<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for Law what

action  his  Ministry will take  against those  who  threaten

owners who do not wish to give consent to en-bloc sales.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  his Ministry will take  action  against

owners  who have neglected maintenance of their buildings  in

anticipation of en-bloc sales.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for Law what

action will be taken to correct the unhealthy trend of  greed

associated  with  en-bloc  sales  which  is  destroying   the

community bonding that we are trying so hard to build.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, can I have your permission to answer the three Questions

together,  including the Question addressed to  the  Minister

for  National Development who has asked me to answer  on  his

behalf as they are all related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, the Member's Questions reflect

his  concern  about  recent press reports on  en-bloc  sales.

However,  the  reports of several en-bloc sale proposals  are

actually not surprising.  The Government first announced  its

intention to review the need for unanimous consent for strata

developments   in  November  1997.   There  was  considerable

interest  in en-bloc sales because of the upward revision  in

the plot ratios.  This meant that the land can be redeveloped

for  a  more  intensive use, thus increasing the land  value.

There  was  a  need to move away from the 100%  or  unanimous

consent  requirement to facilitate the redevelopment of  land

to maximise its use and economic potential.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will recall that we took time and care in

crafting  the  legislation.  The Bill went through  a  Select

Committee  and was passed at the Third Reading in this  House

on  4th May 1999.  It was brought into force recently on 11th

October 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this 2-year period, those who were keen on

selling   en-bloc  sales  were  waiting  to  see  the   final

provisions of the law before proceeding.  Therefore, what  we

are  really seeing now are those proposals which had been put

on  hold  during  the last 2 years, pending  passage  of  the

legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that while some of the en-bloc sale

proposals have been transacted, other proposals are still  on

tender  and  are  still awaiting a response  from  interested

parties.  The Government does not prescribe the sale.  It  is

the  choice of the owners.  Whether an en-bloc sale  proceeds

will depend on whether there is a convergence of interests of

the owners as well as the buyers where there is a price which

the owners are happy to accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific questions posed by the Member, firstly,

as  to  his question about correcting the unhealthy trend  of

greed  associated with en-bloc sales, obviously,  this  is  a

matter of opinion, depending on how one looks at it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the majority owners, they are simply realising the

worth  of  their  assets because of the change  in  the  plot

ratio.   The  higher  plot ratio gives  them  the  choice  of

selling  the whole land with a higher premium for each  owner

than if they were to sell their units individually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendment on en-bloc sales by majority

consent,  a  small minority, even only one, could  block  the

sale.    This   often   led  to  strained   and   acrimonious

relationships.  For example, in the case of Kim Lin Mansions,

which  representors  in  the  Select  Committee  spoke  about

unhappiness   amongst  the  owners  over  the  blocked   sale

culminated in a court

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



case.   With the announcement of the proposed amendments, the

court case was withdrawn, thus avoiding a long, expensive and

bitter court proceeding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member asked about threats against owners

who  do  not  wish  to give consent.  If an  owner  has  been

threatened into giving his consent, such consent would not be

valid  in law.  If the Strata Titles Board is satisfied  that

the  consent was not given voluntarily, then the Board  would

take  this  into account in determining whether the  required

level  of consent has been attained.  Furthermore, those  who

are  threatened could also lodge a police report  or  make  a

complaint  before  a Magistrate for the issue  of  a  private

summons for criminal intimidation under the Penal Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to his question on the action taken against

owners who have neglected maintenance of their buildings, the

Building and Construction Authority will take action  against

Management  Corporations and owners who neglect  to  maintain

their  buildings  or fail to comply with any  notice  of  the

Commissioner  of  Building Control to engage  a  professional

engineer  to  inspect their buildings for structural  safety,

regardless of whether the owners are anticipating an  en-bloc

sale.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, Mr

Goh  would seem to imply by his question that there are  some

people who threaten the owners.  Is the Ministry aware of any

such incidents or not?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> No such reports have been received by

my Ministry.

it.  Parliament has to appoint a Committee of Selection which

matter,recognise or not recognise that there  are  Opposition

members  in  Parliament?   And  if  it  is  going  to  be   a

Parliamentary Committee, then all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



parties  should  be represented.    Why  has  the  Opposition

been left out?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if the Opposition had more

Members  in this House then, of course, we would not be  able

to  deny them of their opportunity to be represented in  this

Committee.  But this Committee's job is to appoint members to

the   other  Sessional  Committees  and  rest  assured   that

Opposition Members will be appointed to some of the Sessional

Committees.  If he were to look at the proportion of PAP  MPs

and Opposition MPs, and if we were also to have an Opposition

Member  in each of the Sessional Committees, then they  would

be over-represented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with paragraph (1)

connection with traffic or parking offences; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To facilitate the operation of an Automated Vehicle

Entry Permit (VEP) and Toll Collection System.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now elaborate on the reasons behind the proposed

amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a review of the penalty system for offences

under  the  Road Traffic Act in 1998, it was  felt  that  the

quanta  of  maximum  fines  for the offences  were  generally

adequate  deterrence, except for 6 types of offences.   These

are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Unlawful alteration of vehicles and trailers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Keeping or using unregistered vehicles;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Failure by a resident of Singapore to inform the

Registrar  of  his  possession or use of a foreign-registered

vehicle;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Failure by a registered owner to produce proof of

scrap   or  export  within  1  month  upon  cancellation   of

registration of a vehicle by the Registrar;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Making false statements, forging licences, furnishing

false particulars; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. Using another vehicle mark, plate or documents,

forging  a mark, plate or document or using them, and driving

or permitting an off-peak car to be driven with a tampered or

altered supplementary licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quanta of maximum fines for the 6 offences were set

many  years ago . The fines need to be raised in view of  the

relative  severity of these offences and the  fact  that  the

number of cases has been rising over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite some statistics, the number of cases for keeping

or  using an unregistered vehicle has risen from 69 cases  in

1995,  to an average of 76 cases each year from 1996 to 1998.

During  the  same  period,  there  was  almost  a  three-fold

increase in the total number of incidents involving Singapore

citizens,  work  permit or employment pass holders  illegally

using Malaysian-registered vehicles in Singapore. The average

number of cases

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



of  motorists  failing to produce proof of  scrap  or  export

documents upon cancellation of registration has risen  to  11

cases  per  year from zero cases in 1995. For cases involving

the  unlawful alteration of vehicles and trailers, there  has

been  a  rise  from zero cases in 1995 to 9  cases  in  1998.

There  were  also  53  cases  in 1998  involving  forgery  of

licences  and  the  driving of off-peak  cars  without  valid

supplementary  licences - approximately a 140%  jump  in  the

number of cases handled from 1995 to 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to increase the maximum fines

for  these offences are thus necessary to check the trend  of

more  persons committing these offences, and will serve as  a

deterrent to potential offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, had on 26th April 1999, announced its

intention to implement a package of tougher measures  against

recalcitrant  motorists  against  whom  there  are  in  force

warrants  of  arrest in connection with traffic  and  parking

offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September 1999, there were 39,197 outstanding

warrants  for parking offences. Together with other  traffic-related  warrants,  a  total  of 54,604  warrants  are  still

outstanding.  These statistics show that a  large  number  of

warrants  of  arrest have been issued because many  motorists

who  have committed parking or traffic offences simply ignore

the  notices requiring them to appear in court in  connection

with  the  offences. Ignoring a notice to appear in court  to

answer a charge, even when the offence is a relatively  minor

offence such as a parking infringement, is a grave matter  as

it  shows  a  blatant disregard for the law.  The  Government

takes  a stern view of motorists who do not comply with  such

notices. Tougher measures will therefore be imposed to ensure

that  there  is  effective enforcement against motorists  who

commit traffic or parking offences and thereafter ignore  the

notices requiring them to appear in court in connection  with

the offences committed by them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures include not allowing a motorist against

whom  there is an outstanding warrant of arrest to renew  his

road  tax until he has been arrested pursuant to the  warrant

or  he  has  surrendered himself, and his  case  conclusively

dealt  with by the court.  It also includes giving powers  to

the  Police,  LTA,  Urban Redevelopment Authority  (URA)  and

Housing and Development Board (HDB) officers to immobilise or

seize and detain any vehicle which is registered in the  name

of  a  person  against whom there is in force  a  warrant  of

arrest relating to a traffic or parking offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists who settle their traffic or parking fines

promptly will not be affected by these measures.  Our  record

shows  that about 95% of motorists settle their cases by  the

final  reminder.  However, warrants of arrest will be  issued

against those who choose to ignore repeated reminders to  pay

their  fines as well as the notices requiring them to  attend

court  to answer the charges against them.  And if they still

do  not take action to surrender themselves when warrants  of

arrest  have  been issued against them, they  will  face  the

tougher measures which we intend to implement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Road Traffic Act also needs to be amended to

facilitate  the introduction of the automated  Vehicle  Entry

Permit (VEP) and Toll Collection System, which is targeted to

be  implemented early next year.  The automated  system  will

make  it  more convenient for Checkpoint users to  pay  their

toll  charges and VEP fees, as well as help to speed  up  the

flow of traffic through the checkpoints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists will no longer need to purchase toll coupons

in advance before going to the checkpoints.  All they need to

do  is  to  insert  a  CashCard or dedicated  smartcard  with

sufficient  cash  value into a card-reader installed  at  the

immigration  booths.   The  card reader  will  electronically

deduct  the  toll  charges  from the  CashCard  or  dedicated

smartcard.   Motorists driving Singapore-registered  vehicles

can use the CashCard, which they currently use for paying ERP

charges, to also pay for tolls at the Checkpoints.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists driving foreign registered vehicles will be

required  to purchase a dedicated smartcard at the  Singapore

Checkpoints before entering Singapore.  The smartcard, called

the Autopass Card, will record the vehicle number, date, time

and  point  of entry of the vehicle.  When a motorist  leaves

Singapore, the VEP fees and toll charges will be computed and

deducted  automatically when the Autopass  Card  is  inserted

with  sufficient cash value into a card-reader.  The Autopass

Card may be used for subsequent trips to Singapore.  In other

words,  when the foreign motorist returns the next  time,  he

will  not have to purchase a new card if he has with him  the

old card.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The automated system will cut down the transaction time

currently  taken  for  the issue and sale  of  Vehicle  Entry

Permits  at the Checkpoints. While in Singapore, the motorist

may  use  the Autopass as an ordinary CashCard and enjoy  the

benefit of cashless transactions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the Road

Traffic (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><i>Increasing fines for certain offences under the RTA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Bill which increase the maximum

fines  for  the  six  offences I  mentioned  earlier  are  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 3 raises the maximum fine for the offence of

unlawfully altering a vehicle or trailer  -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) from $1,000 for a first conviction to $2,000; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) from $2,000 for a second or subsequent conviction to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 4 raises the maximum fine for the offence of

keeping  or  using an unregistered vehicle.  The increase  in

fines is the same as in clause 3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clause 5 raises the maximum fine for failure by a

resident  of  Singapore  to  inform  the  Registrar  of   his

possession or use of foreign-registered vehicle.  Again,  the

increase in fines is the same.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clause 8 raises the maximum fine for failure by a

registered owner to produce proof of scrap or export within 1

month  upon cancellation of registration of a vehicle by  the

Registrar.  The increase in fines is the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Clause 10 raises the maximum fines for the offences

under  section  129  from $2,000 to $5,000.   These  offences

include making false statements, forging licences, furnishing

false particulars, and driving or permitting an off-peak  car

to  be  driven  with  a  tampered  or  altered  supplementary

license.



<br><br><i>Tougher  measures against motorists with outstanding  warrant of arrest</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a motorist against whom there is in force a

warrant  of  arrest relating to an offence under the  Parking

Places  Act or the Road Traffic Act is allowed to  renew  his

vehicle  tax licence once he surrenders himself to  a  Police

Station  or  the  Warrant Enforcement Unit, and  is  formally

arrested.   However, the motorist may thereafter  jump  bail,

not  pay his fines or fail to attend court.  Clause 6 of  the

Bill empowers the Registrar to deny a motorist the renewal of

his vehicle licence until his case is conclusively dealt with

by the court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill empowers a police officer or an

employee of LTA to immobilise or seize and detain any vehicle

which  is registered in the name of a person against  whom  a

warrant  of arrest is in force in connection with any traffic

or parking offence committed by him.  The powers conferred on

an employee of LTA may be exercised in respect of any vehicle

which is being used or parked on a public road or in a public

car park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers conferred on a police officer may be

exercised in respect of a vehicle that is found at any place,

including private premises.  Police would tow or immobilise a

vehicle  found  on  private premises if, upon  going  to  the

private  premises to arrest the offender, they cannot  locate

the offender but find his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



vehicle on the private premises instead.  The vehicle will be

released  when  the offender has surrendered himself  or  the

warrant of arrest has been cancelled by a court.  The  powers

conferred  on  a police officer may also be exercised  by  an

auxiliary police officer who is authorised in writing by  the

Commissioner of Police to exercise such powers.



<br><br><i>Automated VEP and toll collection system</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to facilitate the implementation of the automated

VEP  and  toll collection system, clause 7 of the  Bill  will

allow the Minister to make subsidiary legislation for various

aspects of operations, including the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) provide for the Vehicle Entry Permit to be stored in

an  electronic  form  on such stored value  card,  device  or

appurtenance as may be issued;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) provide for the levy of a fee for the issue of such

stored value card, device or appurtenance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) prescribe the manner in which any fee or tax is to

be  levied and collected, including the use of electronic  or

computerised or other facilities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) prohibit the entry into or exit from Singapore of

any foreign vehicle if any fee or tax payable is in arrears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 also empowers the court to order a person who

has   been  convicted  under  those  rules  to  pay  up   the

outstanding  arrears  of VEP fees and any  tax  that  may  be

levied under those rules.  This new provision is in line with

existing provisions in the Road Traffic Act, which allows the

court  to order convicted motorists to pay up any outstanding

arrears of ERP charges.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of enhanced penalties to the

various  offences as listed under the Road Traffic  Act  will

send  a  strong  signal  to  deter  would-be  offenders  from

committing  these  offences  and  curb  the  rise   of   such

incidents.  Furthermore, the proposed amendments to deny

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



motorists  with  outstanding warrants of arrests  renewal  of

road  taxes, and the empowerment of various agencies  to  tow

away  vehicles  when the registered owners  have  outstanding

warrants of arrests in force against them, will show that the

Government is serious in taking action against motorists  who

blatantly  disregard notices to attend court that are  served

on  them  in  connection  with traffic  or  parking  offences

committed   by   them.   With  the  proposed  amendments   to

facilitate  the implementation of an automated VEP  and  toll

collection system, motorists will enjoy smoother traffic flow

at  the  Checkpoints, as well as greater convenience  in  the

payment of tolls and VEP fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to

speak  in  support of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.   In

principle,  I  have no objection to the proposed  changes  of

empowering officials to take further action and steeper fines

against people with outstanding warrants of arrest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal parking is, of course, causing a lot of

inconvenience  to  many other law abiding drivers.   Whatever

reasons  many  of  these errant drivers may give,  especially

when  they go and see their MPs, they should be aware of  the

danger  and the inconvenience they are causing to  other  law

abiding  citizens.   However,  I  am  quite  puzzled  by  the

Minister  of State's figure just now, when he mentioned  that

there  are  54,000 of such outstanding warrants  of  arrests.

This figure implies that there are such number of people, who

have  committed traffic offences walking around and violating

the  orders  of the court to attend to such cases,  in  which

case  I  am  wondering  whether these measures  that  we  are

proposing  in this amendment Bill will actually  address  the

issue.  If we have 54,000 people with outstanding warrants of

arrests,  certainly, I think it is a very  serious  situation

for the Home Affairs Ministry to look into.  But there again,

for  such cases, will these measures address the issue?   Why

is it so difficult to arrest these 54,000 people?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are special issues and nature of the

offences involved.  Therefore, maybe the solution to  address

the  issue of such warrants of arrest may have to be  refined

and dealt with at further length.  If we just look at seizing

the  vehicles of the offenders at such places including their

homes,  then my question is: why is it so difficult  to  find

the  vehicles of these offenders in their homes and not  able

to  arrest  the person but rather to take away  the  car?   I

think there may be a need to really look at whether these are

appropriate measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The errant drivers of vehicles who have committed

offences  need not necessarily be the owners of the vehicles.

So, in a case like that, there again you have this problem of

trying  to  adjudicate  who  is really  responsible  for  the

offences, and whether the punishment that is meted out on the

owner of a car is really fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask is on the introduction of

this automated vehicle entry permit and smartcard for drivers

of  foreign  vehicles.   I  am not  clear  exactly  what  the

implications  are,  but I would like  to  ask  how  will  the

foreign drivers, with this smartcard that is issued to  them,

top  it  up with cash in Singapore?  Is it through the  ATMs?

Do  they have necessary accounts for this?  And how will  the

authority at the Checkpoint verify and pinpoint the smartcard

to  a  car or a driver?  I suppose from the explanation given

by the Minister of State, the identification is really from a

card  to  a car.  Then again, the issue is really not  errant

cars  but  only errant drivers.  How then do we pinpoint  the

fault?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An errant foreign driver, for example, committing an

offence  can conveniently leave the payment of the  fines  or

tolls  to  another driver who drives out to the gate  at  the

exit point.  What happens if there are offences where demerit

points may be accumulated?  Who then is responsible?  Perhaps

the Minister can clarify.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise to speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a couple of clarifications and

concerns  that  I have regarding these amendments.   The  new

section 95A confers wide powers to police officers, auxiliary

police officers and employees of LTA to immobilise, seize  or

detain  any  vehicle  of a registered  person  subject  to  a

warrant  of  arrest.  This power can be exercised  against  a

vehicle found parked anywhere, even on private premises.   In

the  case of such premises, only police officers can exercise

the  power and then only if he cannot effect an arrest  after

making a reasonable attempt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister tells us that the default rate for

summonses  in  road traffic cases is high and that  provision

has  to  be  made in legislation to control the  problem.   I

agree  that when the default rate is high, measures may  have

to  be taken to improve the situation.  But I think this  new

provision  may unsettle many.  The immobilisation or  removal

of  cars  can  be done even though they are properly  parked.

54,000  immbobilised vehicles in Singapore in car  parks  can

give  rise to a totally new dimension of what Singapore means

by  a "fine" city.  It also could be done in the person's own

driveway and garage.  Is such a far-reaching power necessary?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One need not have to have a vivid imagination to picture

what will happen when a car is immobilised, for example, in a

HDB  car park or in one's own driveway.  Neighbours would  be

quick to notice that something is wrong. The stock answer may

be  that if someone is under a warrant of arrest and he  does

not  surrender he must face the consequences, such as  social

embarrassment.    But  should all subject  to  such  warrants

deserve  the  same treatment?  I certainly hope that  such  a

power be used only in extreme situations and not as the first

recourse in a situation where a person against whom a warrant

has been issued cannot be found.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of those who disobey the law frequently, I

have  no doubt that the use of this law would be appropriate.

Where a person is intentionally avoiding arrest,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



one  can  understand  the need for  stern  action.   But  not

infrequently,  there  are  occasions  when,   due   to   some

circumstance,  such  as  a change of address  or  failure  to

effect proper delivery of the notice of summons, a warrant of

arrest may be issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House, I am sure, have come across cases

where the person against whom the warrant is served does  not

understand  the terms of the warrant at all.  The  notice  is

usually worded in legalese, that is to say, in English  legal

language,  which  is,  to a layman and sometimes  even  to  a

lawyer,  quite incomprehensible even if he knew English.   In

such  cases,  perhaps the Minister can clarify whether  there

will  be  an  opportunity given to defaulters to  answer  the

warrants before such overt actions are taken against him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to know whether there was any

consideration given to a more graduated enforcement  of  such

sanctions.    What  I  mean  is  whether  the  Ministry   has

considered  the  need to distinguish between those  who  have

been  habitually ignoring warrants of arrests and  those  who

are subjected to the process for the first time.  Is there  a

possibility  that  the  legislation  could  be  improved   by

specifying  that these sanctions should only be applied,  for

instance,  to  cases where there is habitual disobedience  to

notices of summons?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proper treatment of offenders in a just society

requires   the  principle that the punishment  must  fit  the

crime.   It  also follows that in bringing the  offenders  to

justice,  we are not seen to take what may be viewed  by  the

public as excessive means, especially when the perception  of

the  public, as the Minister conceded just now, may  be  that

traffic offences, other than the moving offences, may not  be

regarded as serious offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving next to the provision concerning the giving of

notice  to  a  person about the immobilising  or  removal  or

detention of vehicle, it is interesting to note the  contrast

between the means of giving notice through this Bill and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



Parking  Places  (Amendment) Bill  that  will  be  considered

later.   In the Parking Places (Amendment) Bill, the  persons

affected  may be informed through four means: delivering  the

notice  or document to him, another adult member or  employee

of his family, leaving it at his last known business address,

sending  him a registered letter to his business  address  or

any  address furnished by him, and if any of the above cannot

be done, through notification in the Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Bill, in the case where a vehicle has

been detained, the service of notice is only through the post

sent to him at his usual or last known place of residence  or

business in Singapore.  It is difficult to see why the notice

requirements  in  the  Road Traffic Act,  which  covers  more

serious  offences, should be less than those in  the  Parking

Places  Act.  If anything, there should be a higher  standard

of notification, as more serious offences are involved.  This

requires  further  thought  given  the  consequences  of  the

seizure.   It  is  provided, for example,  that  after  three

months  if  the  person had not been arrested or  surrendered

himself, the vehicle may be disposed of by auction or in such

manner  as the Deputy Commissioner of Police or the authority

thinks  fit.  This may deprive the person affected of one  of

his  most substantial assets besides his flat.  I should like

to  ask the Minister to clarify whether the difference in the

notice procedure is intended and why the notice procedure  is

not  as  elaborate  as  that stated  in  the  Parking  Places

(Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these few points that I hope the Minister can

clarify, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern arises out

of  clause 6 and clause 9 of this Bill.  But clause 6  really

alarms  me.   I see that by clause 6, a person who  has  been

arrested  pursuant  to  a warrant may be  refused  a  vehicle

licence renewal, as the Minister puts it, even if he has  not

been  tried  and  his guilt determined by  the  court.   This

reverses  the presumption which perhaps, to some  extent,  is

being eroded in Singapore today.  It reverses the presumption

that any person who is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



accused  of any offence is innocent of the offence  until  he

has  been  proved  to  have  committed  the  offence  to  the

satisfaction  of a court.  But here we have a  proposal  that

even  before the court tries the offender and pronounces  him

guilty  of the offence, he should be punished by not allowing

him to renew his licence.  That, I find very alarming and, as

I  have  said,  it  tends to reverse  the  presumption.    It

assumes that this man or woman is guilty of the offence which

he or she stands charged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also undesirable for the reason that it may act as

a  compulsion  for the person to plead guilty to  an  offence

charged   simply  to  get  the  vehicle's  licence   renewed.

Compelling  someone to plead guilty is, as I have said,  very

undesirable and I think it may even be an offence  under  the

Penal  Code  if  the  police try to compel  anyone  to  plead

guilty.   So  I  do  urge  the  Ministry  to  reconsider  the

provision in clause 6 and see whether it should be made law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important principle of law, and I hope that it

is  accepted by the Ministry of Law and the Ministry of  Home

Affairs, that the presumption of innocence should not in  any

way be dented in Singapore.   On the other hand, it should be

strengthened.  So I have very grave reservations of clause  6

of  the Bill.  I think it should be taken out completely.  If

the  man has been arrested and a date has been fixed for  his

trial,  which I take will be the case, he will  be  on  bail,

compelling  his  attendance for the  trial,  then  no  action

should  be  taken until the decision of the court  is  known.

That would be the civilised way of proceeding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is clause 9 which seeks to insert a new

section 95A.  Prof. Chin has raised a number of questions  on

this and I would endorse my support of what he said, and  say

that  it  may result in penalising members of the family  who

may  be using the car, where the person who is registered may

not  be  available.  He may be out of the country for all  we

know.  But the members of the family may be using the car and

they  may need the car.  Is it the intention to penalise  the

family who is using the car to put compulsion on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



person  who has absconded or is evading arrest?  That  again,

may  I  say, is an undesirable principle.  It smacks  of  the

collective  punishment theory which was applied  in  Malaysia

during  the  years of Emergency and was strongly  criticised,

not  only  in  Malaysia but outside Malaysia,  for  punishing

members  of  a village or community because of the wrongdoing

of one or two members of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the power to release the vehicle is given to

the  Magistrate or the Deputy Commissioner of Police  or  the

Registrar.   But it would appear to me that the  Magistrate's

hand   is  tied  in  that  the  clause  goes  on  to  provide

specifically that he may refuse to release the vehicle unless

the man surrenders himself to a police officer.  There again,

it  is  a  form of compulsion that is being used and  in  the

result punishing somebody else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the question of the 54,000 warrants of

arrest.   Has  the Ministry of Communications and Information

Technology inquired from the Ministry of Home Affairs or  the

police  officers  how  diligent are the Police  in  executing

warrants of arrest?  What would be the position if the police

officers,  through  shortage  of  manpower  or  for  whatever

reason, suddenly forget about the warrant of arrest, which is

lying  on  the  shelf somewhere, and they have not  made  any

attempt  to execute it?  Are you going to require,  first  of

all,  the  Police  or whoever is authorised  to  execute  the

warrant  to  say what attempts have been made,  and  in  what

manner, to execute the warrant of arrest?  If not, the  owner

or  driver  is being punished for something that  the  Police

have not done.  That again is totally unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore ask the Ministry to reconsider this

Bill again, particularly the two clauses (clauses 6 and 9) of

the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, may I

raise  two  concerns for the Minister of  State.   The  first

relates to the new penal powers under the Act, and the second

relates to the automated system for Causeway traffic.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns the penal powers under clause 9.

Singaporeans,  as we know, are very attached to  their  cars.

No  matter how much we raise the prices, etc, they want them,

and the car prices therefore have raised themselves.  And  we

should  be very concerned about powers that use the  cars  as

pressure points to solicit the payment of fines.  Let me turn

my attention particularly to the new section 95A, subsections

(9)  and  (10).  As I read them, these clauses would actually

allow  the  Police to detain and then auction a  vehicle  for

failure to pay fines.  A further understanding is that  these

powers  would be invoked once there is a warrant  of  arrest.

The  threshold for this warrant of arrest may be as low as  a

single parking offence.  And as the Minister of State himself

has mentioned, there are currently 54,000 warrants of arrest.

That  is  a  lot of cars to auction.  This is a very  serious

power  to  punish and it can be, I would argue,  onerous  and

unjust.   This is primarily because under the new subsections

95A(9)  and  (10),  the notice of auction is  merely  in  the

Gazette.  The Gazette, of course, is a formal official way of

giving  notice  of things, but it is not read very  commonly.

In other words, the fact of an auction may not be well known,

and  this might lead to a paucity of people who would bid for

the  car, and this might drop the value below what is a  fair

and  market rate.  This is certainly the experience in  other

countries, and in other forms of execution of court processes

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, of course, that these matters must be

taken  seriously.  People who do not pay their  fines  should

not  get away scot-free.  But I would argue that there  needs

to  be a balance between the legitimate interest of the State

and  the sanctions we wish to enforce.  There needs to  be  a

balance  between  the  quantum  of  the  fines,  just   still

relatively small though, they keep going up all the time, and

the  values  of the cars which are one of the largest  assets

any Singaporean can claim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next concern on the same issue is on the effect of

third parties.  Here I do not mean the families so much,  but

people with a legitimate commercial interest in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



the  car.   Because car prices are so high, most  of  us  owe

tonnes  of  money  to the bank or the hire purchase  company.

They  take the car as a security for their repayment.  May  I

ask  the Ministry whether these rights would be preserved  if

there  was an auction?  And if there is a shortfall,  because

the  auction price is low, and the company is short of  money

to recoup its loan, what happens then?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to reconsider the provisions of

penalties,  first,  to have a higher threshold  before  these

detentions  and auctions are exercised.  Let us use  it  only

for  those who are really recalcitrant.  Secondly, to reserve

a  price for the vehicle.  This need not be done by amendment

but  can be done by practice in the auction.  So at least  it

ensures  that  a fair market value, par values and  years  of

depreciation, etc, are taken into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my second concern. This is for the

automated  system for cars that come across the Causeway.   I

would  just like to ask the Minister of State whether in  the

short  term at least, there are ways to ensure that the shift

to the new system would not add to the Causeway jams and will

not  affect  the  ease at which our Malaysian neighbours  can

visit  us  and our tourism.  I mention this because obviously

we  do  not like the same thing when we go to visit Malaysia.

When  there are new notices and new forms to fill, and we  do

not  get  them, we feel very inconvenienced, and I would  not

like the same to happen to our Malaysian neighbours.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to thank Members for their support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me clarify that the authorities have

been  taking  action against offenders, and let me  give  you

some  of  the  measures  that  have  been  taken.   MND,  for

instance, in 1994 introduced a set of measures to reduce  the

large  number of outstanding warrants of arrest  for  parking

offences  at URA/HDB car parks, for example, by clamping  the

vehicles of motorists with outstanding warrants of arrest for

URA/HDB offences, if they were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



found contravening parking regulations at the car parks.  The

Police  also  carries out regular operations  to  locate  and

arrest  these offenders with outstanding warrants  of  arrest

for  traffic  and  parking related  offences.   Further,  the

Police  has  put in place stringent mechanisms at immigration

checkpoints  to detect and arrest these motorists.   So  this

also  answers Mr Jeyaretnam's point about whether the  Police

has been diligent in their enforcement actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with all these measures, the problem did not go

away.   In  April  this  year, the Government  announced  its

intention  to introduce tougher measures.  In fact,  in  July

this  year, URA and HDB introduced a new measure which  would

deny  such  motorists  the renewal of  their  season  parking

tickets  if  they purchase these season parking  tickets  for

parking in public car parks.  All these measures are actually

part  of  a comprehensive set of measures that we are putting

in  place  now to tackle the problem.  So what we are  seeing

here  today is the rest of the measures that will be  put  in

place.   And  why are we taking this comprehensive  approach?

Let  me  say  that  under the current system,  motorists  are

already given ample opportunities to settle their fines.  Let

me  describe the procedure for settling a parking composition

fine.   Let  us say an original notice was issued on  day  X.

First  reminder will be sent half a month from day X;  second

reminder  will  be  sent  by registered  post  one-and-a-half

months  from day X; final reminder will be sent three  months

from  day  X;  court summons will be sent by registered  post

four  months from day X; and warrant of arrest will be issued

six months from day X.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, there really is little or no reason

why  errant  motorists  do  not take  action  after  so  many

reminders.  It is not justifiable to claim unfamiliarity with

the  system  after  so  many reminders.   We  know,  as  MPs,

residents  come to us with summonses and ask us  to  help  to

either  appeal for waiver or reduction of fines.   They  know

that they are in the wrong and yet some of them simply ignore

these  reminders.   So what is needed is a strong  signal  to

motorists that they must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



prompt  in  taking responsibility for committing traffic  and

parking  offences  by  settling their  fines.   If  they  are

responsive, it would save them from the inconvenience of  the

more  stringent measures which we are putting in  place  now.

And  it would also save the time and resources of the various

enforcement  agencies  in  issuing  summons,  reminders   and

warrants of arrest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is concerned that immobilising a vehicle can

be  unsettling  to  the  public and he  asks  whether  it  is

necessary.  The aim of these stringent measures is  precisely

to  make  owners  realise the importance  of  settling  their

offences quickly to avoid facing such a situation.  Motorists

should  realise that they cannot blatantly disregard  notices

to attend court that are served on them.  So the issue really

is the blatant disregard for the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me address the other points raised by Members.

First,  Mr  Chay  asked why is it that you  cannot  arrest  a

person  at  his  home,  and why do  you  need  to  resort  to

detaining  or  seizing the vehicle.  As  I  said,  there  are

limitations  to the resources that we have, and  the  numbers

are  just increasing too large.  So there is a need for  more

effective  measures.  Mr Chay is questioning  whether  it  is

effective.   But,  obviously, the rest of the  Members  think

that  it  is  very  severe.  So we think  that  it  would  be

effective.   And when we talk about seizing the  vehicle,  it

does  not  mean that you need to seize it only in the  homes.

For  LTA, the area of jurisdiction will be the roads and  the

public  parking places.  For the Police, because  Police  has

jurisdiction  also in private premises, therefore,  they  can

arrest  the  person,  and they can seize  or  immobilise  the

vehicle   in   the   homes  and  other  areas   under   their

jurisdiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members also raised a point on how do we differentiate

the  driver  from  the owner.  Let me say  that  there  is  a

current procedure.  The current procedure is that whenever  a

person  commits  an  offence, usually the vehicle  number  is

recorded,  and  the  authority will write to  the  registered

owner and ask whether the offender

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



is  the  registered  owner or somebody else.   So  if  it  is

somebody  else, then by law he has to furnish the information

and  the  Authority  will go after the offender.   Therefore,

there  will not be a problem because if the registered  owner

is not the offender, his vehicle will not be targeted.  So it

is as simple as that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked about the VEP. VEP violations will

not result in demerit points.  So the question of whether  it

is  the driver or owner will not arise.  What LTA will do  is

that  it will recover any fines or unpaid fees from cars upon

exiting  the Checkpoints.  So it is very much like a  parking

system.   For the foreign motorists, we will not be  able  to

tell  who the registered owner is.  So what we will do is  we

will go after the person who drives the car because he has to

leave the country at some point in time, and that is where we

will  go  after  him.  But of course if  he  just  drives  in

Singapore without going out of the country, we have a  system

to  track that because the vehicle entry permit is only given

for  two weeks.  After two weeks, if he does not go and renew

the  vehicle entry permit, we will go after the vehicle which

may be somewhere in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin Tet Yung brought up the difference in

delivering  notices between the two Acts.  Let me inform  him

that in the amendment, this is in new section 95A(7) where it

mentions  about the means of delivery.  But this is  not  the

only means of delivery because if you refer to section 131 of

the  RTA  Act,  it  also mentions about the  other  means  of

delivery.   So  if  you  compare  the  two  Acts,  the   only

difference  is that, in the PPA, the additional means  is  by

way  of  publication in the Gazette plus also the serving  of

notices  to  an employee of family.  So he is  right  in  the

sense  that it is slightly more elaborate for PPA.   But  the

other  means are all there.  Therefore, we believe that  both

notice  serving procedures provided in both Acts are adequate

to enable the effective discharge of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to Mr Jeyaretnam's point. He is

concerned  about clause 6 and also the immobilising,  seizure

and detention of vehicles in clause 9.  He thinks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



that  this  is against presumption of innocence.   I  do  not

think  so.   The authorities are given powers in  discharging

their  responsibilities to do certain things.  For  instance,

if  LTA suspects that a car on the road is not safe, LTA  has

the  power  to detain the car.  So these are the powers  that

the  Government  is  asking  Parliament  to  provide  to  the

relevant authorities to ensure that they can carry out  their

functions  properly.  I do not think that  we  are  presuming

that  the  person is guilty before the court  trial.   So  my

point  is that the whole objective of this amendment is  that

we should not allow people to disregard the law and that they

should show respect for the law.  It is actually contempt  of

court if they just ignore the court orders and the warrant of

arrest.   So  what we are doing here is to put  in  place  an

effective  means whereby the various agencies can effectively

carry out their functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if Members are concerned about whether family

members would be using the cars, and so on, let me say  again

that  the  idea  of  the Bill is to ensure  that  the  person

settles the warrant of arrest speedily.  Because all  he  has

to  do is to surrender himself to the police and he would  be

given bail and the Authority will release the vehicle.  So it

is  not  as if we are going to detain the vehicle for a  long

period  of  time.   All he has to do is to  simply  surrender

himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also expressed the concern whether the

Authority  would  be  trigger-happy.  Let  me  say  that  the

Authority  will  first  employ other means  and  seizing  the

vehicle will in a sense be the last resort.  We would not  be

going out and start clamping vehicles, as some of the Members

have  feared.  Because of the limitation of resources,  there

is   good   reason  for  the  authorities  to  target   those

recalcitrant  offenders first, as Prof. Chin  has  mentioned,

and  thereafter,  extend it to the rest if they  continue  to

ignore the warrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay raised a valid point about the notice of

auction in the Gazette and whether people will know about the

auction.   Gazetting is to provide the legal  cover  for  the

auction.  But I do agree with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



him  that we can actually do other things like publishing  it

in  the papers, and so on, to make sure that more people will

know about the auction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about credit companies or hire

purchase  companies.  Legally, these vehicles rightly  belong

to them.  Therefore, they can actually approach the Authority

and  if they can prove that the vehicles belong to them,  the

vehicles would be returned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Tay mentioned about the Causeway jam. In my

speech  earlier,  I mentioned that the system  will  actually

help to reduce the jam.  At the moment, when foreign vehicles

come  into Singapore, they have to pay for the entry permits.

Whereas  in the new system, they just put the card  into  the

card   reader.   This  process  is  in  parallel   with   the

immigration process.  If they do not have a card, of  course,

they  will  have to purchase it.  But, as I said, it is  only

once  off  and it would not be worse than before.  Presently,

they have to purchase a permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By way of clarification and without

being  disrespectful to the Minister  of  State.   I   wonder

whether  he  really understood what I was  saying  about  the

presumption of innocence.  I do not get that impression  that

he  understood it.  This clause would suggest that the person

has  been  arrested pursuant to the warrant of arrest  issued

against  him.  If he is arrested, he is brought to court  and

perhaps punished for not turning up and then released on bail

to face trial for the offence for which he was arrested.  The

presumption of innocence is that that man or woman  in  front

of  the  court  is  innocent of the charge  until  the  court

pronounces  that he or she is guilty.  Therefore,  no  action

should  be taken by any Ministry pre-empting the decision  of

the  court and seeking to punish indirectly either the person

or  any other member of the family or other persons.  That is

exactly  what  I  was  trying to convey. The  presumption  of

innocence  before  the trial and no one should  pre-empt  the

decision of the court.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

explained  that  by  immobilising his  vehicle,  we  are  not

presuming  that he is guilty.  In many of our law enforcement

actions,  we  inconvenience  individuals.   The  police  have

powers, for instance, if they feel that you have committed an

offence, to detain you for certain hours and then they charge

you  in  court.   So  are you saying that  by  detaining  the

offenders in the remand prison, it is presumed that they  are

guilty?  Obviously, not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I answer that? They are in the

remand prison because they cannot post the bail that has been

offered  to  them.  That is the only reason they are  in  the

remand  prison, or because certain offences are not bailable.

It  is something quite different from the subject that we are

talking about.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The police can do so if they

have  reason to believe that they want to perhaps do  certain

other  investigations, and so on.  The powers  are  given  to

them to do that and there is no presumption of guilt here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, may I ask three points of

clarification briefly.  The first was that in the Minister of

State's  reply,  he  suggested there was a  division  between

registered  owners  and  drivers.  I understand  the  general

position.  May I ask the Minister of State whether this  will

also  apply  for  parking offences.  In  other  words,  if  a

vehicle  XYZ is parked in a certain spot but the offender  is

not the owner, does it mean that that car will not be seized,

detained and auctioned under the powers so long as the driver

is different from the registered owner?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification I wanted to make was that I am

gratified by the assurances about the auction.  But  does  it

mean that the Ministry and the Authority are taking on a duty

to  have an open and fair auction?  I mention this because in

certain US cases, from all these advertisements you can buy a

Porsche for $50.  It may not be true.  But what they mean  is

that  these  auctions are so badly attended  that  the  price

drops dramatically.  Is there a duty on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



the  Authority to ensure a fair market price if there  is  an

auction?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point of clarification is simply on my point

about  the  Causeway  problems.  I do take  the  Minister  of

State's  assurance that they will improve things in the  long

term.   My  point  was  simply  more  about  the  short  term

implementation.  Will we ensure and, I think  we  always  do,

give sufficient notice to the other side?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I also clarify

with  the Minister:  of these 54,000 warrants of arrest,  how

many  of  such  errant  drivers  are  actually  owning  their

vehicles.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Just two points of

clarification.   First, the Minister mentioned  very  limited

resources  in  relation to the execution  of  warrants.   How

limited  are they vis-a-vis the 54,000 outstanding  warrants?

And the second point is that he mentioned that there are some

who  are  more  recalcitrant than  others  in  terms  of  the

warrants of arrest. Does he have the breakdown of how many of

these  persons  who are subjected to warrants of  arrest  are

first-timers,  and  how  many  are  really  those   who   are

habitually disobeying the summonses?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The short answer to Mr Chay and

Prof. Chin is that I do not have these figures with me on how

many  are  recalcitrants, how many are first-time  offenders,

and  how many are owners of vehicles.  I also do not have the

number   of   persons  that  the  Police  deploy   for   such

enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked a few questions. On the Causeway

jam,  the purpose of the exercise is really to speed  up  the

clearance, not just for the long-term but even for the short-term.   And  as  I  mentioned, if you  were  to  compare  the

automated  procedure  with  the current  procedure,  you  can

expect  improvements because we are doing through  electronic

means.  As I said, the smartcard will be used and reading  of

the smartcard is in parallel with the immigration clearance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fair market value for the cars, the Government

has a duty to ensure that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



the  vehicles are auctioned off because the Government cannot

keep  the vehicles forever. So that is why we are asking  for

the power from this House  to allow the Government to dispose

of  the vehicles.  And when you dispose of the vehicles, what

is  a  fair market value?  How do you actually determine that

it  is a fair market value?  As far as the responsibility  of

Government  is  concerned, we have to ensure that  reasonable

means  are  employed to publicise the auction but there  will

still  be  people who say, "I do not know about the auction."

Because  of  that,  can  you say it  is  not  a  fair  value?

Publication in the Gazette is one means and it also fulfils a

legal  requirement.  The other thing that we  can  do,  as  I

said, is to publish in newspapers and ensure that more people

will get to know about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, owners versus drivers. I am not so clear about

this  point.  If it is a parking offence, I believe  that  we

will probably go after the car owner.  Otherwise, I foresee a

loophole here.  In other words, a person who has committed an

offence can say that it is somebody else who does not  own  a

car.  I believe, subject to confirmation, this is the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br>1.50 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications and Information

Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):  Mr Speaker, Sir, I  beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of this Bill is to amend the Parking

Places Act (PPA) for the following purposes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) to transfer to the Land Transport Authority (LTA)

the power to provide suitable public car parks for vehicles;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) to extend protection from liability for Assistant

and Deputy Superintendents of Car Parks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) to add a general provision to cater for the future

implementation of an Electronic Parking System; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) to empower the Superintendent to immobilise or

remove  any vehicle which is parked in a public car park  and

which  is  owned  by a motorist  against  whom  there  is  an

outstanding warrant of arrest in connection with a traffic or

parking offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the

Parking Places (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, clause 2 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts

section  4  for  the  purpose of transferring  the  power  to

provide  public car parks for vehicles from the  Minister  to

LTA.    Currently,   the  Ministry  of   Communications   and

Information  Technology  approves and  gazettes  the  Parking

Places Order which designates new HDB and URA car parks,  and

prescribes  the  parking  charges for  them.  Generally,  new

Parking  Places  Orders are processed  and  gazetted  once  a

month. To streamline the procedures and processes, the  power

to  provide  public  car parks will be transferred  from  the

Minister to the LTA. Public car parks will be designated by a

parking  sign  planted on site, in lieu of a  Parking  Places

Order.  The  prescribed parking charges will be displayed  on

the  parking  sign.  The certified car  park  plans  will  be

available for public inspection. The power to approve parking

charges will remain with the Minister for Communications  and

Information Technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to confer on the Superintendent

protection  from liability for the loss of or any  damage  to

any vehicle parked in any parking place, or for any injury or

death  suffered by any person in any parking place. With  the

amendment,  the Assistant and Deputy Superintendents  of  Car

Parks,  who are HDB and URA staff, will enjoy the same  level

of  protection in discharging their duties as staff from  the

Land Transport Authority. Currently, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



Parking  Places Act only protects the LTA and the  Government

from such liabilities in the parking places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 seeks to cater for the future implementation of

electronic parking systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 empowers the Superintendent to immobilise, or

remove and detain any vehicle which is parked in a public car

park,  and which is owned by a person against whom a  warrant

of  arrest is in force for a traffic or parking offence.  The

Superintendent  will  release the vehicle  only  when  he  is

satisfied that the owner of the vehicle has been arrested, or

has  surrendered himself to a police officer, or the  warrant

of arrest in force against him has been cancelled by a court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of the term "warrant of arrest" in clause

8(d) covers any Warrant of Arrest issued by a court against a

person in connection with an offence committed by this person

under  the Road Traffic Act, the Parking Places Act, and  the

rules  made  under  these Acts. This is to  ensure  effective

enforcement   against  motorists  against  whom   outstanding

warrants of arrest are in force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted earlier in my speech on the Road Traffic

(Amendment) Bill, the large number of outstanding warrants of

arrest  is  a  matter of serious concern  as  it  shows  that

enforcement  against  motorists who have  refused  to  settle

their  offences has not been effective. Tougher measures  are

necessary to send a signal that there must be respect for the

law,  and  that  motorists  who  commit  traffic  or  parking

offences  must be responsible enough to either  compound  the

offences  when given the opportunity to do so, or  to  attend

court in relation to the offence when required to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 enables the Superintendent to serve on a person

any  summons,  notice, order or document required  under  the

Parking  Places  Act  or  its rules, by  publication  in  the

Gazette, if the Superintendent is unable to ascertain the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



person's  usual  or  last  known place  of  residence,  after

reasonable diligence is exercised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the proposed amendments to the Parking

Places  Act will enable URA and HDB to take tougher  measures

against  motorists  against  whom  outstanding  warrants   of

arrests  are  in  force, by immobilizing  or  removing  their

vehicles  at parking places. Taken together with the proposed

amendments  to  the  Road  Traffic  Act,  enforcement  action

against  such motorists will be tightened. This  will  ensure

that  there  is  proper respect for the  law,  and  that  the

massive  backlog  that the courts are currently  experiencing

will be cleared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will also streamline the

operations involved in designating HDB and URA car parks, and

facilitate   the  work  of  the  Superintendent  in   issuing

summonses  and notices to offenders. Car park Superintendents

will  also be granted protection in the course of discharging

their duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to

speak  in  support  of the Bill.  I only  have  a  couple  of

concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill confers the Land Transport Authority to provide

for  parking spaces in Singapore. Clause 2, proposing the new

section 4 subsection (2), states that the Authority is  under

a  duty  to  ensure  that in the provision  of  such  parking

spaces, it should not unreasonably prevent access to premises

or  use  of the roads by others. The provision of such spaces

should also not be a nuisance to any person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister whether the difference

in language between the repealed section and the new proposed

section  is intended.  In the repealed section, the provision

of  parking spaces should not be a "nuisance".  It is  proper

to  interpret  this  word  most likely  to  refer  to  public

nuisance,  that is, the Authority can provide parking  places

unless such provisions become a public nuisance.  Of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



course,  as it stood, the word is ambiguous enough to include

private nuisance but this is by no means well-established  in

case law.  The new provision states "nuisance to any person".

I  wonder  whether  this  is intended  to  allow  any  person

adversely  affected  to complain and  possibly  to  bring  an

action  against the Authority to remove parking  places  that

cause a nuisance to him or others like him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can clarify what is intended in

this  change in the language of the section.  In other words,

is  it  intended  that a private person can bring  a  private

nuisance   action   against  the   authority?   This   would,

undoubtedly,  I am sure, complicate the general provision  of

car  parks  in Singapore. For example, HDB residents  staying

next  to  car  parks  may  complain  about  the  nuisance  of

listening to squeaking brakes and squealing tyres as vehicles

make  their way through these car parks.  Can they now  apply

for  an injunction to stop the use of the car park until  the

Authority has installed a surface that would not be so noisy?

It  would be good if the Minister of State could clarify this

aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also includes a provision that refers to the

situation  dealt  with  in the earlier  Bill  that  was  just

passed, namely, where a person  is under a warrant of arrest,

his  vehicle  may  now  be seized by a  Superintendent.   The

inclusion of such a provision in the Parking Places  Act,  of

course,  means that even in the case of illegal parking,  the

person  against whom a warrant of arrest is issued  can  have

his  vehicle  immobilised, seized and even  sold.   Again,  I

would  like to draw attention to the fact that there is  some

unease that no distinction is made in the Bill between  those

who  habitually ignore summonses and those who may  be  going

through the process for the first time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legislation that we are considering today, in

my  view,  does not really deal with the root causes  of  why

there  is  so  much illegal parking, especially  in  the  new

housing estates.  The provision of multi-storey car parks  in

favour  of  open car parks in the new housing  estates  means

that even medium height goods

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



vehicles   have  difficulty  finding  parking  space   at   a

reasonable distance from their flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more acute problem relates to heavy vehicles.

Very  often, heavy vehicle  parks are some distance away from

the  main housing areas.  That is understandable because  the

noise  from  these  vehicles early  in  the  morning  may  be

regarded  as a nuisance.  However, it is also true that  many

of  these  vehicle  owners were compelled to  park  illegally

because of the lack of public transport that would take  them

to  their vehicles very early in the morning.  I hope that as

the Authority is now in charge of the provision of car parks,

it  will work together with HDB, URA and the public transport

companies  to rationalise the provision of parking places  in

Singapore.   Provision  of suitable  parking  places  is,  of

course,  important.  Making sure that the owners of  vehicles

can get to them in time is equally important, if not more.  I

hope  that  the Minister of State can address these  problems

before  using  the  criminal law that can have  such  adverse

effects not just on the drivers or the owners of vehicles but

also on the families concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill but implore the Ministry and the

Land  Transport  Authority to take  the  necessary  steps  to

perform   their  statutory  duties  of  providing  good   and

convenient parking places in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to support the  Bill,  but  wish  to

highlight  two  clarifications for the  Minister,  especially

with  regard  to  new  section 4  where  the  Land  Transport

Authority  is  now  given powers to provide suitable  parking

places for vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, with the introduction of new enforcement

measures  in the central business district (CBD),  there  has

been  feedback  about  the problems faced,  specifically,  by

courier   companies  and  those  who  provide  such  despatch

services,   and there are two points here which I would  like

to raise.  One is with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



regard to operation and the other the perception of fair play

and equity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is important to recognise that in any major

city like Singapore, it is important to have the services  of

very  efficient courier service providers to move  documents,

parts  and  samples  from place to place within  the  central

business district.  This is a crucial and very essential part

of our infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current legislation requiring couriers to park their

vehicles   only  at  designated  lots  is,  at   best,   very

inconvenient.  They could park at the basement,  leave  their

vehicles and part of their products behind, and move to a few

floors upstairs, pay their parking charges and all that.   It

is  going to be very inconvenient.  It certainly has affected

the productivity of a lot of these courier companies.  If you

can understand  that as very important and essential, then  I

would  like to ask the Minister to consider whether he  would

have  a  scheme whereby certain public parking  lots  can  be

provided in front of buildings as such essential services can

be  provided  to  facilitate these people to go  about  doing

their  work.   We  could charge a flat fee to  allow  certain

companies  who  provide such services  to  participate  in  a

programme, because they are parking their vehicles all around

the central business district the whole day. I think we could

do more things to refine and facilitate such services, and  I

hope the Minister of State would consider this carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will find issues of competition. Singapore

Post,  CISCO  and  somehow  people like  Telecom  do  provide

services   which  sometimes  can  be  considered  in   direct

competition with private courier companies.  But here,  there

is   a  problem  because  sometimes  people  feel  that   the

enforcement agencies are more lenient when they see  a  CISCO

van  in  certain  parking places compared  to  other  courier

companies,  for example.  And I think this is very  unhealthy

because  if quite clearly they do only critical and essential

jobs, that is fine.  But what is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



more  difficult  is that these companies  do  more  and  more

commercial  businesses,  in  direct  competition  with  other

commercial companies.  I think the level of enforcement,  the

level  of fair play of these people who are authorised to  do

that  and  how  they  carry out the  job  between  CISCO  and

Government-related companies vis-a-vis private companies must

be taken with care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister of State can assure this House

that  in  discharging such responsibilities, proper  care  is

taken  that  some  of these companies are  not  unnecessarily

disadvantaged or targeted in the course of doing their  work.

I hope the Minister can clarify these two points.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer

the  specific  questions, I would just like  to  clarify  the

point  I  made earlier in response to Mr Simon Tay's question

about  parking offences.  He asked what would happen  if  the

owner  was not the person who committed the offence.  At  the

moment,  the law does allow the registered owner  to  clarify

upfront that he is not the one who committed the offence.  Of

course, if he makes a false declaration, then the law will go

after him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me address Prof. Chin's point about the

nuisance  issue.  We have consulted the Attorney-General  and

his  view is that the word "nuisance" in the original section

42  of the Parking Places Act is unqualified.  So it is  wide

enough  to cover both public and private nuisances.  The  new

section 42 refers to causing a nuisance to any person.  Words

in  the singular include the plural, under section 21 of  the

Interpretation  Act.   This means that  the  amended  wording

should be read to refer to nuisances caused to any person  or

persons.  Therefore, we do not think that the amended wording

would  create any different consequences compared to  before.

But I thank Prof. Chin for expressing this concern.  If there

is any problem that we face later on, we can always come back

to Parliament and tighten the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he also asked whether trivial offences like

illegal parking would necessitate such measures.  Again,  let

me say

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Bill  does  not  only target  at  illegal  parking

offences.   In  fact, it covers all Road Traffic  Act-related

offences plus Parking Places Act offences.  And so long as  a

person  against  whom  there  is an  outstanding  warrant  of

arrest,   the  Superintendent  of  Car  Parks  can   actually

immobilise   his   vehicle  in  his  area  of   jurisdiction.

Therefore, we must look at the amendment in that regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking provision is a separate issue. At the moment,

there is no shortage of parking places island wide.  In fact,

in  the  new towns, HDB and URA have car park planning norms,

and  there  is  generally no shortage.  But,  of  course,  he

mentioned about the problem of heavy vehicles.  Again, nation

wide,  there is no shortage of heavy vehicle parking  places.

Yes, heavy vehicle owners want to park right in the centre of

the  town, but there are land constraints to cater  for  that

kind of demand.  We have interim heavy vehicle parks near the

estates,  but this is a separate issue and the Government  is

in  the process of looking into how to tackle this problem in

the long term.  Having said that, this does not give them the

right  to park illegally and, therefore, any illegal  parking

will be dealt with according to the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli talked about the despatch services in the

CBD and asked whether public parking lots can be created.  He

is  aware  that  there are bays, lanes  or  car  parks  where

despatch  service vehicles can be parked and, where possible,

there  will  be car parks provided along the roads.   But  we

have  to bear in mind that the CBD traffic is very heavy  and

therefore  if we were to allow indiscriminate parking  or  to

set up car parks along some of the roads, then the impact  to

the traffic can be very adverse.  So, much as we like to help

them, there are the other greater objectives, in other words,

to keep traffic free flowing and ensure that there will be no

danger  to other road-users.  I would urge that the  despatch

services abide by the law and park legally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his comment on Singapore Post and CISCO having an

advantage over the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



other  courier  companies, this is something that  I  am  not

aware of.  If he has any specific example, he can bring it to

the  attention  of the enforcement agency.  I think  the  law

treats everybody equally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

the training of nurses, the practice of nursing and the types

of nursing services in Singapore. To maintain a high standard

of nursing, there is a need to update the Nurses and Midwives

Act. Let me briefly describe some of the major changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, nurse training in Singapore was hospital-based under an apprenticeship scheme. The Singapore Nursing

Board's role then was to set the training curriculum  and  to

conduct  the examinations. Today, the training of nurses  and

midwives  is  part of the mainstream educational system  with

registered  nurses  and  midwives  trained  in  the   Nanyang

Polytechnic. The enrolled nurses will soon be trained in  the

Institute of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



Technical  Education. The Nursing Board's role will therefore

have  to  be  changed  accordingly  to  ensure  that  nursing

standards  are maintained and that nurses have the skills  to

meet the changing healthcare needs in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the role of nurses has evolved in tandem

with  the  advances in medical science and  technology.  Many

nurses  today  are highly skilled, with more than  a  quarter

possessing   advanced  qualifications  in  various   clinical

specialties.  As  at  December 1998, 42  nurses  are  already

designated as "nurse specialists" in their hospitals.  Hence,

there  is a need to guide the development of advanced nursing

practice  and  to ensure the proper use of the  title  "nurse

specialist".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the gradual increase in the number of nurses in

Singapore,  it is still not sufficient to meet the  needs  of

our  expanding healthcare service. To protect public  safety,

measures  are  needed to prevent persons making  use  of  the

situation  to indulge in unqualified nursing practice  or  to

employ  unqualified persons as nurses. My  Ministry  aims  to

prevent such occurrences by empowering the regulatory role of

the Nursing Board.



<br><br><i>Provisions in the Nurses and Midwives Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the major new provisions that are

being introduced in this Bill.



<br><br><i>Constitution of the Nursing Board</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Nursing Board consists of 17 members, of

whom  six are ex-officio members and another 11 are appointed

by  the  Minister for Health. The size of the Board is  about

right.   However, to widen the representation and  to  change

some  of the titles and terms that have become obsolete  with

time,  clause  3 establishes a Nursing Board with  three  ex-officio  members  and  14 appointed members.  The  ex-officio

members  are  the  Director of Medical  Services,  the  Chief

Nursing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



Officer  and  the  Director-General  of  Education   or   his

representative.  Of  the 14 appointed  members,  11  must  be

nurses and the remaining three need not be nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 12 allow the Minister to appoint the

Chairman  and the Registrar of the Board.  Clause 4  provides

for  the  removal of an appointed member from office  if  the

member,  for example, is found guilty of infamous conduct  or

is  absent  without leave from three consecutive meetings  of

the   Board  or  its  committees.  This  is  similar  to  the

provisions  in  the Medical Registration Act  (MRA)  and  the

Legal Profession Act.



<br><br><i>Functions of the Nursing Board</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the functions of the Nursing Board.

In   devolving   the  training  of  nurses   to   educational

institutions, the existing functions of the Nursing Board  to

determine  and  provide for the training and  examination  of

student nurses are no longer relevant. Hence, these functions

are deleted. Additional functions are included in clause 8 to

enhance the role of the Nursing Board in:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) accreditation of formal nursing courses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) regulation of training and continuing education for

nurses and midwives; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) regulation of the scope of nursing practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to ensure that nurses continue to receive

appropriate   training,   keep  abreast   of   advances   and

developments, and provide safe and competent nursing care  to

patients.



<br><br><i>Registration of nurses and midwives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to matters concerning

registration. Currently, a nurse who has stopped working  for

more  than  10 years is required to successfully  complete  a

retraining  and  competency assessment programme  before  the

nurse

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



could be registered or enrolled to practise again. This is to

ensure  that the nurses and midwives are updated in practice.

Clause  15 allows the Nursing Board to provisionally register

or enrol such nurses to undergo the retraining and competency

assessment programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new provision in the Bill is the issuance of

Practising  Certificates. This is to enable  nurses  to  show

proof   of  current  registration,  including  the  type   of

conditions  imposed on registration whenever  required.  With

the   issuance  of  practising  certificates,  the   existing

provisions for removal of name if the nurse fails to pay  the

annual fee or has ceased practice will be deleted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for a person who is refused

registration by the Board to appeal to the Minister.



<br><br><i>Register of Nurse Specialists</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of medical science, there is a

corresponding  move   towards  specialisation   in   clinical

nursing  practice. It is necessary to monitor the development

of    advanced   nursing   practice   and   accredit   "nurse

specialists". Part 5 provides for the formation  of  a  nurse

specialist  register  and the issuance  of  nurse  specialist

certificates.



<br><br><i>Cancellation of registration or enrolment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act allows the Nursing Board to cancel the

registration  or enrolment of nurses who, for  example,  have

been found guilty of professional misconduct or are deceased.

In  addition, the Bill provides clauses to allow the  Nursing

Board  to cancel the registration or enrolment of nurses  who

failed  to  comply  with the conditions as  stated  in  their

registration   or  who  failed  to  renew  their   practising

certificates for a continuous period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains provisions for the Nursing Board

to restrict the practice of a nurse whose fitness to practise

is impaired due to health problems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Appeal</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act only allows for a nurse who is

aggrieved  by  the  Board's decision to  de-register  her  to

appeal  to the High Court. Clause 21 will allow for a  person

who is aggrieved by the Board's decision to impose any of the

prescribed disciplinary penalties to appeal to the courts.



<br><br><i>Restoration of name</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 provides for a nurse whose registration or

enrolment  has been cancelled by the Nursing Board,  to  only

apply for restoration of name onto the register or roll after

a minimum period of three years.



<br><br><i>Disciplinary procedures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Board is required to consider complaint

letters   and   decide  whether  they   should   be   further

investigated.  This  is  cumbersome  as  it  slows  down  the

investigation  of complaints. The Bill will provide  for  the

formation of Complaints Committees that will investigate into

complaints and report the findings and recommendations to the

Board instead.



<br><br><i>New Offences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had mentioned earlier about preventing persons from

indulging  in  unqualified practices and  the  employment  of

unqualified  persons as nurses. In order to maintain  nursing

standards  and  to protect public interest, such  unqualified

practices  will  be considered as offences. However,  as  the

intent is not to penalise innocent acts, exceptions are  made

for  persons such as doctors, other healthcare professionals,

persons  rendering emergency help or home carers  who  render

nursing care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present penalty for each offence under the Act is a

fine  not  exceeding $1,000, except for failure to  surrender

the  registration certificate, where the fine is  a  sum  not

exceeding $500. The Bill increases the present penalties from

$500 to  $1,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Consequential and other minor amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes consequential changes as a result

of  the  amendments  I  have earlier described,  other  minor

amendments  to delete obsolete terminology and to update  the

existing provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the nursing profession has undergone

significant  changes over the years. The role of  nurses  has

grown in scope and complexity with the advancement of medical

science  and  technology. As the standards of any  profession

are  dependent  upon  the quality of its  practitioners,  the

profession  must ensure that nurses are properly trained  and

highly competent, and that their professional development  is

promoted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help to achieve these objectives by

empowering  the  Nursing  Board to safeguard  both  the  high

standards  of  nursing  practice and  the  interests  of  our

patients and the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has actively sought the views and support of

the   Singapore   Nursing   Board,   the   Singapore   Nurses

Association,  and  the senior nurses from all  hospitals  and

institutions  during the preparation of the Bill.  They  have

made some suggestions on the operational procedures which  my

Ministry  will  take  into consideration when  preparing  the

Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

stand to support the Nurses and Midwives Bill.  This new Bill

is  much  more comprehensive in comparison to the old revised

Nurses  and  Midwives Act of 1985.  This new Bill  will  more

aptly  address the new and changing trends in many  areas  of

the  nursing field.  Sir, I would like, however, to  raise  a

few of my concerns in this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the establishment of the Singapore

Nursing  Board  as a body corporate and constitution  of  the

Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(2)(a), (b) and (c) spells out the members of

the Singapore Nursing Board.  Sir, I feel that here we should

include  as  a  member the President of the Singapore  Nurses

Association.    It   is   more  appropriate   to   have   the

representative of the voices of the nursing profession to  be

in  the  Board.    This will give weightage to the  Singapore

Nursing  Associations, to recognise them and  to  acknowledge

their contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3(2)(d) specifies that 14 members are to be

appointed  by the Minister.  Under this action, I have  three

points to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I feel that we should have a provision for the

recommendations  from the Chief Nursing Officer,  public  and

private  health  care institutions and the  Singapore  Nurses

Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Nurses Registration Board in New South Wales has

13  members,  most  of  whom are nurses  but  three  are  lay

persons,  out  of  which  one is a lawyer  nominated  by  the

Minister   and   two  are  nominated  by  the   Minister   as

representatives  of  consumers. Sir, the  benefit  of  having

people  outside  the profession is that  it  allows  a  wider

spectrum  of  views, perspectives and objectivity.   I  think

this  is  a  good  idea  and  should  be  considered  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is no specification on the number of members

from  the  public  and private sectors.   In  the  past,  the

majority of the members are from the public sector.  As there

are  about 30% of nurses or about 3,827 nurses in the private

sector, it would be reasonable that this clause caters for at

least four members from the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6(1) provides for the appointment of the Chairman

of  the  Board and it states that the Minister shall  appoint

one  of  the  members as the Chairman of the  Board.   In  my

opinion,  the Minister should appoint a registered  nurse  as

the Chairman of the Board.  In the past, this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



has  not  been the case with the Singapore Nursing Board,  as

the  Directors  of Medical Services have been  the  Chairmen.

The  appointment  of a registered nurse as  Chairman  in  the

Nursing  Board  is adopted in countries like  Australia,  New

Zealand,  England and America.  This is logical and would  be

in line with practice in the other professional bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 deals with the general provisions for

registration and enrolment.  Clause 17(5)(b) states that  the

Board   may  refuse  registration  or  enrolment  where   the

applicant  is,  in  its opinion, not of good  reputation  and

character.   This  subclause  is  too  brief  and   open   to

subjective  opinions, as there is no relevant  yardstick.   A

test of relevancy should be applied, as for instance, "not of

good  reputation and character which renders him unfit to  be

practising as a nurse or midwife."  Sir, in this area we  may

find  some  useful provisions from the equivalent  Australian

Nurses Act 1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Australian Act defines "professional

misconduct"  and "unsatisfactory professional misconduct"  as

being  two  instances where there can be a cancellation.  For

the purposes of the Act, professional misconduct, in relation

to  an  accredited  nurse, means unsatisfactory  professional

misconduct  of a sufficiently serious nature to  justify  the

removal  of  the  nurse's name from the  Register.   For  the

purposes  of  the  Act,  unsatisfactory professional  conduct

includes any of the following:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) any conduct that demonstrates a lack of adequate

knowledge, experience, skill, judgement or care by the  nurse

in the practice of nursing;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the nurse contravening (whether by act or

omission) a provision of this Act or the regulations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the nurse's failure to comply with an order or

condition of registration;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) any other improper or unethical conduct relating

to the practice of nursing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that the aforementioned grounds are all

relevant and the words

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



"conduct   relevant   to  the  practice   of   nursing"   are

significant.   This  qualification,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   is

strikingly absent from our aforesaid Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 17(6)(a), the Board needs to consider the

reasons  why the registration or enrolment in another country

has  been  cancelled or suspended.  This may be due  to  mere

technicalities as, for example, when the applicant had failed

to  pay the prescribed fee on time or when the applicant  was

no  longer practising in that country.  The provision in  its

current form does not impose such an obligation on the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 17(7), the Board should not only inform an

applicant by written notice of such refusal pursuant  to  the

section, it should also furnish its reasons for the applicant

to lodge a meaningful appeal to the Minister.  Sir, the rules

of  natural  justice  also suggest that  there  should  be  a

procedure whereby an applicant can appear before the Board to

submit  his case, prior to the final avenue of appeal to  the

Minister.    Since  this  affects  livelihood,  it   is   not

unreasonable that an applicant be given more than a chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 deals with conviction final and conclusive.

Under  this clause, it appears to mean that anyone  convicted

of  a  criminal offence cannot be registered or enrolled,  or

whose   registration   or  enrolment  will   necessarily   be

cancelled.  There is no definition in this Bill of  "criminal

offence".   Taken broadly, it simply applies to all  offences

(and  this  extends  beyond the Penal  Code)  which  lead  to

conviction.   Sir, the offence, which a person  is  convicted

of,  may not be relevant in determining whether he or she  is

fit to be a nurse or midwife.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 concerns application for re-registration or re-enrolment. In clause 23(3), the restriction on re-application seems harsh, as three years is a considerably

long period since this concerns a person's livelihood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 and 29 deal with the appointment of

unqualified persons to practise nursing or midwifery and with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



the  nurse's  agents.   Here, under clause  28(5)(b),  clause

29(3)(b)  and  clause  29(4)(b), the  words  "due  diligence"

connote  a  higher level of care than "reasonable diligence".

Sir, is it then sufficient if the nurse or midwife produces a

copy  of  a  current practising certificate and a prospective

employer  accepts  this?  This would be deemed  a  reasonable

effort  on  the  part  of  the employer,  but  to  show  "due

diligence"  would  infer that he should investigate  further,

like   seeking  confirmation  from  the  Board  as   to   its

authenticity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 is about nurse specialists, etc. Clause

32(2)(a)  (b)  and  (c)  deal  with  registration  of   nurse

specialists  and the issue of nurse specialist  certificates.

Here, there is a vague definition on the type of specialist's

qualifications.  I am of the opinion, Sir, that there  should

be specifications like holding a Masters degree or equivalent

qualification,  in  a specialised branch of  nursing,  and  a

minimum  of  five  years  of experience  in  that  branch  of

nursing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 32(4)(e) and (4)(f), there should be a

statutory recourse, same as in clauses 17, 18 and  19  as  in

the case of nurses and midwives, instead of leaving these  to

the discretion of the Board to make regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 provides for the appointment of a legal

assessor  and  a  medical assessor.  Here, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

whilst  the  role  of the legal assessor is broadly  defined,

there  is  nothing mentioned about the role  of  the  medical

assessor.    There  is  also  no  mention  made   about   the

requirements of a medical assessor as in the case of a  legal

assessor  who  needs to be an advocate and  solicitor  of  at

least  10 years' standing.  In order for a legal assessor  to

make  a  meaningful  contribution, his  role  should  not  be

restricted to questions of law.  Indeed, there is very little

question  of law involved in determining the requirements  of

the  approval,  cancellation and suspension process,  and  it

deals  a  lot with the facts and arguments of facts to  which

contributions from a suitable legal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



assessor  with an appropriate background will undoubtedly  be

immense.   For instance, questions of whether the conduct  or

negligence of an applicant or a nurse or midwife would render

him unfit to be registered or enrolled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Nurses and Midwives Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

initiative  to  introduce  new  provisions  relating  to  the

establishment  of  the  Singapore Nursing  Board,  practising

certificates and the registration of nurse specialists  is  a

timely  move.  As we adopt a "step-down" strategy  of  health

care  delivery from hospitals to the community, the need  for

clear   regulations  for  managing  good  practices   becomes

critical.  We need community nursing skills that focus beyond

the  epidemiological factors of illness and address the  many

life aspects of the persons who are ill.  We also need nurses

specialists for patients with special needs like  cancer  and

mental  illnesses.  In the light of this expanding scope  and

expectations of the nursing role due to changing  demographic

trends  and  the  diversity  of  demands  arising  from  more

educated  patients,  I  am  in full  support  of  this  Bill.

Furthermore,   I   would  urge  the  Board   to   immediately

conceptualise a Nursing 21 national action plan to articulate

the  visions,  goals and guidelines of nursing  for  the  new

millennium.   To me, nurses form a significant resource  that

we must develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, however, is silent on a number of issues which

I  feel  could  minimise the effectiveness of  the  Board  in

servicing  the needs of the community.  Allow me to highlight

a few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On membership of the Board, in Part II, clause 3, I

would  like  also to echo Dr Neo's call for the President  of

the  Singapore  Nurses Association (SNA) to  be  a  committee

member.   The  Association  is  the  only  professional  body

consisting  of 3,000 nurses who could clearly articulate  the

interests  and  concerns  of  the  profession  as   well   as

challenges faced by patients.  It is also the most legitimate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



vehicle  to process policy and professional matters  relating

to  medical management.  The lack of such a provision for the

President  to  be  present and to present the  views  of  the

professional  body is, in my regard, a lost  opportunity  for

the governing Board in getting the relevant feedback from the

practitioners in the field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the percentage of representation of nurses from

the  private  sector on the Board?  Should it  be  consistent

with  the 30% of nurses in private sector currently,  meaning

appointing  at least three members out of 14 members  in  the

committee?  What about the 21% of foreign nurses in our total

corps   of   15,000  nurses?   Should  their   interests   be

represented  in this Board by a nominated Permanent  Resident

nurse?   If  their  inclusion is not deemed  necessary  at  a

formal  level, I hope the committees formed subsequently,  as

indicated  in clause 10, will have representations  from  the

private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from meeting the condition of fair representation,

by  adopting  a more inclusive membership policy,  the  Board

helps  to  draw  together the professional  groups  from  the

private  and  public  sectors to a  common  understanding  in

matters  relating  to salary, competence, service  standards,

among   others,  in  order  to  regulate  nursing  practices,

benchmark  service standards and avoid excessive  disparities

and inequities between nursing groups.  Ultimately, it is  in

the  interest  of the public that we uphold the  dignity  and

morale of the nursing community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister, to again emphasise and stress Dr

Neo's point earlier, see the appropriateness of appointing  a

highly  qualified  registered nurse as the  Chairman,  or  at

least assuming the position of a Co-Chair?  The argument  for

this  is  plain  enough that he or she being in  the  nursing

profession for years, will have the competence to assess  the

needs of the sector.  Part II, clause 6(1) is silent on  this

matter,  whereas previously, the Director of Medical Services

always  assumed  the  position of  the  President.   I  noted

yesterday   that   in  the  Info-communications   Development

Authority

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



of Singapore Bill, a provision was made in clause 31 that the

Minister may appoint a Deputy Chairman.  Can such a provision

be  also included in this Bill, if the idea of a Co-Chair  is

not acceptable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mechanism of appointment, can the Minister

clarify  what  are  the criteria for selection  and  will  he

accept nominations from the SNA, for example?  I mean, can  a

mechanism  be  set  up whereby professionals  nominate  their

candidates for Board governance to ensure that at  least  one

or  two are admitted to articulate nursing needs in different

medical  settings?  Could the Bill be specific in delineating

the  number of formal representations from different  nursing

sectors among the 14 committee members?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the definition of "nurse" and "nurses

specialists".   In  Part  IV,  clause  26,  the  Act  defines

"qualified nurse" as a registered or enrolled nurse who holds

a  valid  practising certificate authorising him to  practise

nursing.   From  what  I  observe,  the  word  "nursing"   is

sometimes  nebulously broad, referring to someone who  has  a

certified  and  approved  degree  usually  dressed  in  white

uniform, in contrast to another who is para-professional  who

executes  the nursing functions without having  a  degree  or

being  in  white uniform.  The nurses in private clinics  are

one  such example, as I was told.  It is hence expedient, and

I  fully  support the Ministry for its timely  initiative  in

streamlining the definition in order to avoid abuses and mis-application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of our aging demographic trends and the

low  number of nurses in training facing a high challenge  in

attrition  rate  over the years, the nursing profession  will

need a wider network of support from non-certified assistants

to  deliver  home nursing services.  Especially in  community

nursing,  the definition of who is and who is not  a  "nurse"

can  sometimes  be  inexact.  During the Budget  debate  this

March,  I  called for the development of a network  of  para-professionals  under  the  supervision  of  certified  senior

nurses  through  the Singapore Nurses Association.   My  call

arises from the practical concern of an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



increasing need for taking care of the old.  Although we  can

count  on  home carers, who would primarily be daughters  and

daughters-in-law,  this  may not be a  sustainable  solution.

One  reason is that women want to work outside the home,  and

the second reason is that they are not trained in the task of

nursing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of nursing services older persons need fall

into a continuum from one end demanding very specialised care

from  "nurses specialists" to those at the middle  level  who

simply  need routine health care assistants to attend to  bed

sores,  for  example, and those on the other, who  only  want

"nursing aides" to carry out basic physiotherapy routines  to

upkeep their body capabilities.  When no accidents and  death

occur,  the  difficult task of "naming" escapes us.   When  a

disaster  does  occur, how is the person who  does  not  call

himself  or  herself a nurse but carries  out  nursing  tasks

which  result  in maiming or killing the patient,  judged  or

sentenced?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a broadening in the scope of nursing aides at both

community  and  hospital  care, it may  be  useful  that  the

Singapore   Nursing  Board  establishes   guidelines   on   a

registration and accreditation scheme to identify,  recognise

and  regulate  a broad range of nursing roles and  practices.

Could  the  Bill include a section on Advisory Guidelines  on

registration of health care assistants other than  "qualified

nurses"?   Do  we  need to sort out these terms  like  "para-nurses",  "home  nursing assistants", "nursing  aides"?   The

other  common  term is health care worker or  assistant.   In

view  of  these  concerns which I gathered from  the  nursing

community, I urge the Minister to review once again  Part  IV

on "Offences", specially clauses 26 to 28.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of accreditation as spelt out in clause

14,  can  the  Minister  clarify  if  correspondence  courses

obtained  by already certified nurses from an allegedly  good

university  which  our Government also sends  nurses  to  are

recognised by the Ministry?  I heard from the Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



Nurses  Association that the recognition was not given.   Can

we  review and broaden the system of accreditation to include

a  larger number of approved institutions abroad and at home,

and   accept   modes   of   learning   from   long   distance

correspondence  course  to part-time  basis?   The  community

already facing limited nursing power could thus benefit  from

continuing nursing support at the same time being managed  by

higher level competence learnt in the process.  In the spirit

of pursuit towards a knowledge-based economy and in promoting

lifelong  learning, I urge the Board in future  deliberations

on   accreditation  to  cast  a  wider  net  to  capture  the

motivations  and  skills  of  many  individuals  who  due  to

personal  and  unique  circumstances  learn  and  upgrade  in

diverse ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point. In a recent address at a press

conference reported in the papers on 19th November,  Minister

Lim  Hng  Kiang said that he would like to see family doctors

adopt  a lifelong training attitude and upgrade their  skills

by  continuing medical education through a Masters  or  post-graduate  diploma  course.  I am totally in  support  of  his

visionary  call.   I  urge  the Minister  to  also  seriously

consider  continuing education within a specified  number  of

hours  to  be mandatory in the nursing and midwife profession

in  order to uphold quality delivery services by attuning the

practitioners to fast changing information and technology  in

the  medical  and  nursing sciences.  Due to  the  increasing

diversity   of   nursing  work,  the   development   of   new

sophisticated   concepts  of  care,   and   the   nature   of

professional   practice   which  increasingly   demands   the

acceptance of responsibility and accountability, the role  of

nurses  and midwives has expanded considerably.  In response,

the pressure for higher qualifications will be inevitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend that such a mandatory training provision be

made  under clause 44 to prescribe a certain number of  hours

per  year  for  mandatory training.   This  initiative  would

develop  a  new  confidence within the  nurses  and  midwives

community.   I  would  also urge policy  consideration  being

given by the Board

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



on  matters relating to remuneration and recognition packages

attached to training depth and specialisation to ensure  work

and pay equity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this piece of legislation will extend, not limit

the  practice  of nurses; that it serves as  a  platform  for

policy  formulations that enable nurses in  fulfilling  their

potential  in  policy  making  and  decision  making  at  all

healthcare levels.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  both  Dr  Lily  Neo and Mdm Claire  Chiang  for  their

support  and their very comprehensive comments on  the  Bill.

Let me take their comments on the various clauses in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on clause 3 on the composition of the Singapore

Nursing  Board.  There are two approaches that we can  go  by

defining  the composition.  One is a general approach  as  we

have done, and the other is to define in specifics who should

or  who should not be a member of the Board.  We have decided

to  go for a general approach.  But I can assure Members that

in nominating or appointing the members of the Board, we will

consider  a  wide representation of views.  For example,  the

President  of  the Singapore Nurses Association  may  not  be

defined   as  a  member  of  the  Board  in  the  Bill,   but

traditionally  that  person has been  appointed  as  a  Board

member.  So it is a question of whether you want to define it

or  leave  it  in the appointment process to make  sure  that

there is this wide representation of views and the people who

are appointed come from both the public sector as well as the

private  sector  and  from the different fields  of  nursing,

whether  they are nursing midwives or psychiatric nurses,  so

that  it  is  broad enough to make sure that  the  Board  can

discharge  its  duties effectively, ie, to set the  standards

and to regulate the registration and enrolment of nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar comment on the Chairman of the Board. I agree

that  there  are some pros and cons in defining  whether  the

Chairman should be a registered nurse and that is the  reason

why we have made

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



it broader.  Previously, the Director of Medical Services has

traditionally  been  the Chairman of  the  Singapore  Nursing

Board.   Personally, I do see great advantages in having  the

Director  of  Medical Services as Chairman of  the  Singapore

Nursing Board as opposed to insisting that the Chairman  must

be  a  registered nurse.  But in this Bill, we have broadened

the  scope  and  therefore it is entirely possible  that  the

future  Chairman can be a registered nurse or he can continue

to  be  the Director of Medical Services or indeed any  other

person who can lead the Board effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also clarify that the function of the Board is

essentially  to  regulate the registration and  enrolment  of

nurses.    So  we  are  not  setting  up  the  Board   as   a

representative  to  look  out for the  salaries,  conditions,

practices,  etc.  So we want to appoint people who  have  the

qualifications to regulate the registration and enrolment and

the  practice of nursing.  Therefore, although we  want  fair

representation,  this  is not a trade union  committee  which

must have representatives from every group to make sure their

interests are taken care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next deal with clause 17 where Dr Lily Neo

commented about the definition of what is good reputation  or

good  conduct.  This provision is a fairly standard provision

in  all  the  professional  Acts, whether  it  is  the  legal

profession,  engineers, etc.  There  is  always  this  clause

which  says persons must be of good reputation and character.

I  think we do have a fairly good understanding of what  that

means.  In the case of the nursing profession, in fact,  this

is  outlined  in the Code of Ethics and Professional  Conduct

which is issued by the Singapore Nursing Board in March  this

year.   And the definition which Dr Lily Neo pointed  out  is

very much included in this code.  So I think basically we are

talking about the same thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Dr Lily Neo also asked whether in not

registering a nurse because of overseas regulatory practices,

would  we  make  an  effort to find out  the  reason  why  an

equivalent overseas

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



regulatory  body did not register the same  nurse.   I  think

this is the current practice.  If the Singapore Nursing Board

decides  not  to register somebody because that somebody  did

not  receive  registration overseas, we would  find  out  the

reasons.   In not registering the nurse, we would  also  give

the  reasons  to  the applicant why her registration  is  not

approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to outline all these in specific

details  in  the Bill.  The Bill is intended to set  out  the

general provisions and the details would be in the subsidiary

regulations.  Members can be assured that the best  practices

will be maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 deals with the term that the conviction is

final and conclusive.  Let me clarify that this is to be seen

in  conjunction with clause 19.  We have this clause 22 which

says that any conviction for a criminal offence is final  and

conclusive.  If somebody is convicted by the courts, we  will

take  that  as a starting point and treat that as  final  and

conclusive.  But then the Board itself, when deciding whether

the   application  is  to  be  registered,  will  take   this

conviction  and  consider whether the  nurse  is  fit  to  be

registered as a nurse.  So the criminal offence is just taken

to be final and conclusive and then starting from that point,

we  will assess whether that offence has any relevance to the

registration  of  the nurse.  The final criterion  really  is

whether the nurse is fit to be registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 is regarding the three-year de-registration

period.  This is to make a distinction between suspension and

de-registration.  The Bill provides for a range of penalties.

If  the offences are not so severe, then of course the  Board

can  impose a period of suspension and the maximum period  of

suspension is two years.  And therefore anything more  severe

than  that  which requires de-registration must obviously  be

above  two  years.  So the minimum period for de-registration

is stipulated as three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also questioned whether the term "due

diligence" requires a higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



level of care than reasonable diligence.  My understanding is

that  both  have  similar connotations  and,  that  is,  that

somebody  must take proper and due care in making  sure  that

whoever  is practising as a nurse or who purports to practise

as a nurse is duly qualified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the whole issue of nursing

specialist.   I agree with both Members' comments  that  with

advances in medical technology, there will be a greater  role

for  nursing specialist within our system.  The provision  in

the  Bill  provides for the setting up of a nurse  specialist

register.  We intend that the details of that register to  be

set out in subsidiary regulations and not put in the main Act

itself.  Because it is still in its early stages.  We have to

decide  how  we want to set out the criteria for  determining

the different categories of nursing specialists, whether they

require Masters degree or years of practice or different post-graduate qualifications.  All this will be stipulated in  the

subsidiary regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area which is critical and very important is

the  whole idea of registration and how to prevent people who

do not have the qualifications from practising as nurses.   I

agree with Mdm Claire Chiang that, with an ageing population,

we  need a wider range of health care and nursing care people

to  look after the different levels of care.  What this  Bill

intends to do is only to set out the criteria for registering

and  enrolling nurses.  So this Bill does not cover the other

areas  of health care personnel, such as care givers,  health

care  assistants, etc.  The Bill is strictly defined to cater

for  the  registration of nurses.  In the  Bill  itself,  the

definition of who constitutes or who will qualify as a  nurse

is  clearly spelt out.  For the other para-professionals  who

are  involved in caring for the elderly, we will have to deal

with that separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the topic of continuing education and

upgrading,  I  agree with the sentiments that  nurses  should

keep up with what is going on in their profession. It is  our

intention  to  make the avenues for continuing education  and

upgrading as accessible and easily available as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



possible,  so as to encourage all our nurses to  continue  to

upgrade. We will assess whether this needs to be mandatory in

due  course, in the same way as the Singapore Medical Council

is  putting  in  place  a  mechanism for  continuing  medical

education.  We  will do the same for the Nursing  Board,  and

whether to make it mandatory, we will cross the bridge in due

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final comment on correspondence courses. Although I

am  in favour of everybody upgrading, in the field of nursing

where  really a lot of the skills are hands-on, I would  have

some  reservations  in  liberally accrediting  correspondence

courses.   I  think  correspondence courses  make  sense  for

nurses  who  want  to upgrade themselves  in  terms  of  care

management  and nursing administration.  But for purposes  of

being  a  clinical specialist, I would have some reservations

on  correspondence  courses.  But we will  review  the  whole

scheme  of  where and how our nurses ought to be trained  and

putting  the  details of the accreditation to the Specialists

Register.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for his

vision  that  best  practices  will  be  maintained  in   the

implementation  provisions of  this  Bill.   May  I  ask  the

Minister whether he will appoint several lay persons to be in

the  Singapore  Nursing Board so as to allow  broader  views,

perspectives and objectivity?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> My apologies. The Bill does provide

for three members of the Board to be non-nurses and it is our

intention  that  that three persons will  represent  the  lay

public.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to inform the

Minister   that   the  President  of  the  Singapore   Nurses

Association has not been admitted to the Board for  the  last

five  years and therefore, I would like him to look into this

matter.   The second point is whether he will please  comment

on  the request for a Deputy Chair being a certified nurse if

he  thinks the Director of Medical Services should assume the

position of Chairman.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> If I may just add

my  voice  to Dr Neo's and Ms Chiang's in the matter  of  the

Chairperson for the Nursing Board. We have talked a lot about

promoting  nursing as a career and engendering pride  in  the

profession  and  if, in fact, the Ministry would  consider  a

registered nurse as Chair of the Board, it would  be  such  a

clear and much appreciated indication of the Ministry's faith

and  confidence in the leadership capabilities of the nursing

profession.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not want to belabour the point.

Basically, the main criteria for appointment to the Singapore

Nursing  Board  must  be  the qualifications  of  the  person

himself rather than who he or she represents.  But as I said,

in making sure that the composition of the Board represents a

wide  section of the nursing profession, we will, of  course,

draw  members  from  the  public  and  private  sectors,  the

Singapore  Nursing Association, different  types  of  nursing

profession,  etc, and we will send the right signals  to  the

nursing profession that the Board would represent and be  the

appropriate Board which is competent enough to regulate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specifics, the President of the Singapore Nursing

Association was a member from 1993-1996. She is not a  member

in   this   current   Board,  but  we   will   consider   the

qualifications of the President on its own merits. For Deputy

Chairman, that is another flexibility which the Minister has.

If  the  Minister  thinks  that  there  is  a  need  for  the

appointment   of   a   Deputy  Chairman   to   increase   the

effectiveness  of  the  Board, I am  sure  that  the  present

Minister   and   future  Ministers  will   take   that   into

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that I assure those Members of the

introducing the subject on which we have heard enough, and do

we  have to listen again to the same thing.  May I remind the

Members that the subject is not about any abstract value.  It

may be intangible, but is more valuable than any tangibles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule of law is what sets a civilised society apart

from other societies that do not observe the rule of law.  So

it  is not an abstract airy-fairy rule that is propounded  or

shouted  out by left wing liberals, but it is something  that

is so fundamental in any society that believes itself to be a

civilised society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have to make a strong case on the first

statement  that  the House recognises the importance  of  the

rule  of  law,  because we have had, many a  time,  Ministers

declaring how Singapore scrupulously obeys the rule  of  law.

So   there   is  an  admission  that  Singapore  scrupulously

recognises the rule of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government often talks about having the fundamentals

correct,  and  they pride themselves that  in  Singapore  the

fundamentals are correct and laid down.  May I say  that  the

rule  of  law is the first basic fundamental for any society.

It  is  the only guarantee of the subject's freedom.  Without

the  rule of law, the subject lives in a state of uncertainty

and in a state of bewilderment and consequently of fear.  But

where the rule of law obtains in all its fullest extent,  the

citizen can live happily, breathe freely, knowing that he  is

ruled only by the law and  not by anything else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this rule, citizens are ruled by the law and the

law alone.  We have had, only this afternoon, the Minister of

State  saying that it was important to send a strong  message

to  those who blatantly and flagrantly disregard the law.  My

party says

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



amen to that.  The question is: is the Government exempt from

this  scrupulous observance of the Rule of Law?  And that  is

what the House has to decide this afternoon.  I have no doubt

what the outcome of this motion will be.  But what this House

has   to  ponder  is  whether  the  Government  in  Singapore

disregards the law, or is it only its citizens who refuse  to

attend  and  answer  court summonses?  We  have  to  ask  the

question  whether  in Singapore it is a  society  that  lives

under  the rule of law or whether it is a society that  lives

under a government that acts by decree rather than under law.

It is a question that we have got to face and answer.  Is the

society  in Singapore a civilised society  living  under  the

rule of law?  Or is it a society more akin to a society ruled

by a Mafia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know these are strong words but the question has to be

asked  and answered.  If the rule of law does not obtain  and

citizens cannot live in the certainty that all their  actions

will  be judged only by the law and by nothing else, and they

will  only  be  punished by the law and not by any  arbitrary

power  on  the part of the Minister, it is no better  than  a

dictatorship, where a dictator rules by decree.  May I  quote

to  this House what one of the finest writers from Africa and

a Nobel Laureate, Mr Wole Soyinka, from Nigeria, wrote in his

book  The Open Sore of a Continent.  And these are his words,

"Under  a  dictatorship, a nation ceases to exist.  All  that

remains  is  a fiefdom, a planet of slaves."  How true  those

words are.  If it is a dictatorship, ruled by decree, then it

is no longer a nation but a fiefdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also inform the Members that the proposition of

the  rule  of  law  that  it is an absolute  fundamental  and

necessary  before citizens can live in peace and  freedom  is

not  something new.  It is not a novel concept.  Its  origins

can  perhaps  be  traced back to the 13th  century  when  the

English  Barons met at Runnymede to curtail and  to  restrict

the  powers  of  the Monarch.  Before that, the  Monarch  was

ruling  at  will,  doing what he wished and  restricting  the

liberties of his subjects.  And so the Barons gathered to put

an end to this rule by the Monarch without any law

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



and they passed a number of declarations.  These declarations

were  later accepted by the Monarch, Henry III, I think,  and

came to be known as the Magna Carta, the great Charter.   And

clause  39 is revealing.  One can see the origins of all  our

recent  declarations in this clause, and if I may read clause

39:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disused or

outlawed or exiled or in any way destroyed nor will  we  send

upon him except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the

law of the land."



They  are  laying down, telling the Monarch that no free  man

shall  be  taken, exiled, his liberty destroyed  in  any  way

except  by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law  of

the land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40 says, "To no one will we sell, deny or delay

right or justice."  As I have said, they were embodied in the

Great  Charter issued back in the time of Henry  III  at  the

request of the Barons and became a foundation for the society

in  England.  One of the reasons why despite the Government's

assertion,  often repeated, that in Singapore the  Government

observes the rule of law scrupulously and it is seen  in  its

fullest  extent, and the critics saying something  quite  the

opposite,  that  there is no rule of law in Singapore  today,

may  be  due  to  a  misconception as to what  is  meant  and

understood  by the Rule of Law.  Therefore, it  is  important

that  we try and understand what we mean when we say  of  the

Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the mentor of the leaders of this Government,

Confucius himself, recognised the importance of giving things

their correct names.  He was asked by a disciple, "What  will

be your first task if you are given the charge of a country?"

His  answer was, "Rectify the names."  When he was  asked  to

explain, he was reported to have said, "If the names are  not

correct,  if  they do not match realities,  language  has  no

object.   If  language is without an object,  action  becomes

impossible.   Therefore, all human affairs disintegrate,  and

their  management becomes impossible.  Hence, the very  first

task of a true statesman is to rectify the names."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the need to try and name things properly is

recognised by Confucius

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



himself.   Perhaps I should try and say something about  what

is  understood by the Rule of Law.  This term,  the  Rule  of

Law,  came into prominence when Prof. A. V. Dicey, a Vinerian

Professor of English law, propounded it.  He saw the Rule  of

Law  to  consist  of  two  main parts.   "One,  the  absolute

supremacy  or predominance of regular law as opposed  to  the

influence  of  arbitrary power and excludes the existence  of

arbitrariness,  of prerogative or even of wide  discretionary

authority on the part of the Government.  Subjects are  ruled

by  the  law and by the law alone.  A subject can be punished

for  a  breach  of law but they can be punished  for  nothing

else."   He  continues: "In this sense, rule of law contrasts

with  every  system of Government based on  the  exercise  by

persons  in  authority  of  wide arbitrary  or  discretionary

powers of constraint."  That is the first meaning of the Rule

of Law.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RULE OF LAW</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You may continue, Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. The second sense of this

meaning of the Rule of Law is that every subject, whatever be

his rank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and

amenable  to  the  jurisdiction of  the  ordinary  tribunals.

Every  official, from the Prime Minister down to a  constable

or a collector of taxes, is under the same responsibility for

every  act  done  without legal justification  as  any  other

citizen.  He adds a third sense, which is that, Rule  of  Law

is part of the common law and has been propounded by judicial

decisions  rather  than by any written constitution.   He  is

speaking of course of England of the United Kingdom.  But  he

continues to say that in developing countries, this  has  now

been  incorporated into their written constitutions.   So  it

has in our Singapore Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said once before that when we decided to break

away  from  the  British rule, we nevertheless  decided,  all

political  parties  gathering  together  and  deciding  as  a

people,  that  we  will  opt  for the  Westminster  style  of

Government  and for the institutions that were applicable  in

England  and, of course, as they were applicable in Singapore

at  that  time.   The  common  law  had  been  imported  into

Singapore  in  the  19th  century  and  the  institutions  of

Government   followed  exactly  the  Westminster   style   of

Government.  So we decided that we would have not  any  other

system.  This was a deliberate conscious choice of the people

made  through  their political parties before the  delegation

went  to  London.   And as I have said,  the  present  Senior

Minister was, of course, a member of that delegation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have a Constitution. These principles of the

Rule  of  Law are to be found in our Constitution.  They  are

there.    They   are  no  longer  dependent   upon   judicial

interpretations and declarations of the Rule of Law.  It  has

become part of the Constitution.  The Constitution, as I have

said,  is  an act of the people.  It is the people's charter.

It  is  the charter by which the people have bound themselves

to  live  together as a society.  So we find these principles

of  the  Rule of Law in our Constitution and they are  to  be

found  -  I am not going to read them for want of time  -  in

Articles 9 and 12 of the Constitution.  There are also  other

Articles.  They are all to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



found  in  Part  II,  I think, which enacts  the  fundamental

liberties  of  the people.  But the most important  ones  are

Articles 9 and 12.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One also has to understand what is meant by the term

"law" in the phrase "Rule of Law".  In a case that went up to

the  Privy  Council, in the case of Ong Ah Chuan  versus  the

Public  Prosecutor, concerning the question whether a certain

provision in an Act (I think it was the Misuse of Drugs  Act)

was  contrary to the provisions of the Constitution,  it  was

argued  for the Government of Singapore that the Act was  not

contrary  to the Constitution because it had been  passed  by

Parliament following the procedure set for the passing of law

by  the  Constitution.  So it had been regularly  passed  and

therefore that was law, and that was all that we had to  look

at.  The Privy Council had no hesitation in rejecting that  - to  confine  law just to written law passed by Parliament  or

the  legislature.  Lord Diplock, delivering the  judgment  of

the Privy Council said this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a Constitution founded on the Westminster model and

particularly  in that part of it that purports to  assure  to

all   individual   citizens  the   continued   enjoyment   of

fundamental  liberties or right, references to  law  in  such

context  as  'in accordance with law', 'equality  before  the

law',  'protection  of  the law' and  their  like,  in  their

Lordship's  view, refer to a system of law which incorporates

those  fundamental rules of natural justice that  had  formed

part  and  parcel of the common law of England  that  was  in

operation   in   Singapore  at  the   commencement   of   the

Constitution.   It would have been taken for granted  by  the

makers  of  the  Constitution that the law to which  citizens

could   have  recourse  for  the  protection  of  fundamental

liberties  assured  to them by the Constitution  would  be  a

system of law that did not flout those fundamental rules.  If

it were otherwise, it would be misuse of language to speak of

law  as something which affords protection for the individual

in  the  enjoyment  of  its  fundamental  liberties  and  the

purported  entrenchment by Article 5  of  Articles  9(1)  and

12(1) will be little better than a mockery."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So law is not just the Acts passed by Parliament but the

fundamental rules of natural justice that have been  accepted

and  become part and parcel of the common law and  which,  as

they  say,  and  which I have been saying,  was  the  law  in

Singapore in operation before that.  I was talking about  the

misconception.  And it comes to my mind that sometime in  the

1980s when I was in this House, there was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



a  debate on the Internal Security Act.  I said then that the

provisions  in  the  Act providing for detention  of  persons

under an order of the Minister was a blatant negation of  the

Rule  of Law.  I said there was no question about it, because

it  blatantly  disregarded the fundamental rules  of  natural

justice.   The then Minister for Home Affairs, Mr  Chua  Sian

Chin,  in  replying asked: "Is the Member trying to say  that

the  Internal  Security Act is not law?  It  was  not  passed

properly?"  There you have the misconception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an Act of Parliament can violate the Rule of Law.

It  can  violate  the  Constitution  and  that  is  specially

provided by the Constitution which says that any Act which is

inconsistent or contrary to the Articles of this Constitution

shall to that extent be void.  And further by Article 162, it

enjoins  the Government and the courts to modify,  alter  and

interpret  Articles  in  any law so as  to  comply  with  the

Articles  in the Constitution, if that law seems to  conflict

with  anything in the Constitution.  So it is  no  answer  to

say, "Oh, we have the law, and that is it."  The question  is

whether  that  law  itself  violates  the  Rule  of  Law   as

understood through the centuries.  That is the main question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough to try to define what we are

talking about when we say the Rule of Law is supreme and what

is  meant by the Rule of Law.  I must now proceed without any

further delay  -  I see time is running on  -  to list what I

see  to be the instances or examples of the violation of this

fundamental principle of the Rule of Law in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after I have listed them, I shall

proceed  to  set  out what I think the Government  should  do

immediately, and then return back to this list of  violations

to try and explain how they violate the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first on my list of the examples of violation of the

Rule of Law is, of course, as has been asserted by us many  a

time,  the  arrest  and  detention of persons  without  trial

purely  on the arbitrary power invested by Parliament albeit,

on the Minister.  A person in Singapore can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



detained without trial under the Internal Security Act, under

the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and  also  under

the  Misuse of Drugs Act, although some justification may  be

found for the detention under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the arrest by police officers and other

law enforcement officers without informing the subject of the

charge.   It  is absolutely important under the Rule  of  Law

that  a  person's liberty should not be deprived.  He  should

not  be  deprived  of his liberty, or in any  way  restrained

unless  he is first told of the law under which that  can  be

done, and why it should be done.  Also incidental to this  is

the  searches - search of a person's house carried out by the

Police  and  other law enforcement agencies.  There  again  a

citizen is entitled to insist that any search of his house be

strictly in accordance with the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the denial of the right to counsel - denial

of  the  right of arrested persons to counsel and  to  visits

from families for a period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there is the denial of bail by the courts even

without adequate reasons.  I am referring to the often  heard

request from police officers prosecuting to ask for a  remand

in  Police  custody  when the accused is  first  produced  in

court.   As  I  said  once before, usually  that  request  is

granted  without  any  inquiry, and I shall  explain  why  it

violates the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the one which we the Opposition have often raised

-   it  is  the  fifth one  -  the denial of the  freedom  of

speech  and  assembly.  That violates the Rule of  Law.   And

when I say about freedom of speech and assembly, of course, I

am also referring to the freedom of the newspapers to publish

-   the freedom of the press.  That is part and parcel of the

freedom of speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, denial of reasons for executive decisions and

shutting out appeals to the courts.  As I shall say,  now  in

almost every Act, one finds this denial of reasons for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



decisions and not allowing any recourse to the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, the restrictions on the right to travel in

Singapore,  the impounding of passports without an  order  of

court.  When I come to illustrate, I shall, of course,  refer

to  the  case of Mdm Teo Siew Har whose passport was detained

for several months for no reason at all under the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the eighth on the list - the power given

to  the Housing and Development Board to throw out lessees or

tenants  without having to take them to court.  That  is,  if

ever  there was one, a clear violation of the person's rights

and  the  Rule of Law.  Then we also have the suspension  and

cancellation of people's licences by executive officials, and

I  have  in  mind, of course, the licences of  taxi  drivers,

without a proper judicial inquiry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have in Singapore an abundance of power exercised

by  the executive through its officials which offend the Rule

of  Law.   That  is the first limb  -  that no one  shall  be

arrested,  deprived of anything, except under the law.   Now,

if  I  may  come to the second limb  -  the equality  of  all

persons  under  the law, and as Prof. Dicey  says,  from  the

Prime Minister down to the constable they are equal under the

law.   No one is more equal than another under the law.   The

Prime  Minister  is  not  more equal  than  a  postman  or  a

collector  of  rubbish.  And under this, I  have  about  four

heads,  and  that is, the blatant violations during  election

time  by  Government and Ministers to secure the  victory  of

their  party,  the  ruling party, including  intimidation  of

voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you have clearly the law not evenly applied as

between  one  party and another.  Then we have the  case  not

very  long ago where it was seen that the law was not  evenly

applied.   The  purchase of apartments  in  Nassim  Road  and

Scotts 28 by Ministers and public officials.  I shall explain

why  I  say  that also seems to imply  that some persons  are

more  equal  than others.  Of course, I shall  explain  that.

But  let  me assure the House, in case an attempt is made  to

assert that I am

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



suggesting corruption, I am not.  All I am saying is the  law

should be evenly applied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the disparate treatment of Opposition

political parties in their applications for licences to  hold

their activities or conduct their programmes.  I will explain

that if I have the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, we have the just recently concluded

instance of the President's election.  I shall explain why it

is  a  violation of the Rule of Law and violates particularly

Article 12 of the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move on and say what I think should be done as

a  priority by this Government.  And we said this before,  we

are  approaching  the end of the century, we are  approaching

the  end of the millennium and we keep talking about the 21st

century.   These steps have to be done immediately before  we

go  too  far  into the 21st century.  And I am commending  to

this  Government  that they immediately  take  the  following

steps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to repeal the provisions in the Internal Security

Act   providing  for  detention  without  trial.   They   are

absolutely  no longer necessary for our society in Singapore.

They are an open sore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, repeal the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Act.   That also is not necessary in our society today.  Both

these Acts may be convenient to the Government.  But that  is

not  the  criterion, that is not the test.  The test  is  the

people's liberties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to preserve the people's liberties. I

do  not ask the Government to repeal the Misuse of Drugs Act.

But  I  think they should have another look at the Misuse  of

Drugs  Act  and see whether it contains sufficient safeguards

against unfairly depriving a person of his liberty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would urge the Government to consider

amending the law relating to public meetings and processions.

This  comes  under  the  freedom of  speech  and  freedom  of

assembly  so  as  to give full weight to the Article  in  the

Constitution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, repeal the provisions in the Housing and

Development  Act  which empowers the Board  to  evict  people

without  having  to  take  them to court.   The  Housing  and

Development  Board  acts  as  the  accuser,  the  Judge,  the

executioner.   It is unheard of.  But in Singapore,  we  have

had this for some time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, I am seriously suggesting to this Government

that  the  police  force  should be taken  out  of  political

control.   It  should  no longer come under  the  control  or

direction  of  the  political masters.  And  likewise,  I  am

proposing  that the CPIB be also removed from the control  of

the  political masters.  I shall, if I have the time,  expand

on all this a bit more.  But it may not be possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of examples I have given of the violations in

Singapore  is, by no means, exhaustive.  I could  add  a  lot

more.   But I have tried to pick out what I thought were  the

very major serious violations of the Rule of Law.  There  are

many  other  violations and, equally, my recommendations  are

only  just  the beginning, ie, recommendations of  the  steps

that  the  Government must take immediately to establish  the

Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may move on and as quickly as possible try and

explain  why the Internal Security Act violates the  Rule  of

Law.  Under the Act, as I have said, it is just the Minister,

and  there is no way of checking the Minister's decision, who

decides  to make an order detaining a subject, depriving  him

of  his  liberty, completely contrary to the rule of  natural

justice and the fundamental principle that all men are  free.

The  Constitution itself provides for a situation  when  this

right  may  be  restrained and, that is in Part  XII  of  the

Constitution, that is when there is an emergency, when  there

is  a  determined group of people resorting to unlawful means

to   bring   down  the  Government  and  the  society.    The

Constitution says in that situation, you have to pass an  Act

of  Parliament and then you can restrain their liberties  and

restrict them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any other conditions? And that was the case

when the British passed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



the  Emergency  Regulations.  Under the colonial  government,

Emergency   Regulations  were  a  purely  temporary   affair,

designed  to  deal  with  what they thought  and  saw  as  an

immediate  threat  to  the  country  from  people  who   were

determined to break down the Government and create trouble in

the  society.   So they brought in the Emergency  Regulations

and  they  were purely temporary, three months at a time  and

they  had  to be passed and renewed.  After we took over,  we

retained  that  power  under the Public  Peace  and  Security

Ordinance (PPSO), giving the power to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Marshall who was a passionate believer in the Rule

of  Law  and  a  believer in the freedom  of  the  individual

however added a safeguard.  He introduced a court or tribunal

of  three persons to whom an appeal may be made by the person

detained and who may release that person if the tribunal  was

not  satisfied  that it was necessary to detain  the  person.

But  the PAP, when they took over, and the great champion  of

personal liberty when Mr David Marshall was in power  -   the

Chief  Minister  of  the  country   -   did  away  with  that

provision  appointing the tribunal and reverted  back  to  an

advisory  panel without any power to release.  The  power  is

only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat

and  so  we do not need it any more.  Let us for once realise

that  it is a violation of the Rule of Law.  Let us be honest

and repeal it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act again was a

temporary  measure.  It was passed to deal  with  the  threat

from  secret  societies in those days.  I remember  I  was  a

District Judge in those days having to record statements from

persons who had been detained under this Act or Ordinance  in

those  days.   A  lot of them were later released  after  the

statements  were  recorded and it was established  that  they

were perhaps not members of any secret society.  So that  was

a  temporary measure and we do not need that now.  But now it

is used for lots of other reasons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, my suggestion is that

there  should  be proper safeguards.  We should  require  the

Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau to get a court order

before  a  person  is detained, present the evidence  to  the

District  Judge or Magistrate and let the District  Judge  or

Magistrate decide whether, on the medical evidence  presented

he  is  satisfied that the person is a drug addict  requiring

treatment,  to  make  an order for detention.   That  is  the

provision  under  the Mental Disorder Treatment  Act  and  we

should take that over into the Misuse of Drugs Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then about the arrests that I mentioned, that is, the

second  violation. It is, as I said, the law that an  accused

person must be told the reason and the charge for which he is

arrested.   It  was declared so by the House of  Lords  many,

many  years  ago  in  what came to be known  as  the  Christy

Lynskey  case.  But in Singapore, persons are just picked up,

not  told  the reason, that alone the charge. They  are  just

told, "Follow me or come to the CID or the CNB." And if  they

ask  why,  he is told, "You will be told there."  That  is  a

violation of the Rule of Law.  You are interfering with  that

person's  liberty without any legal justifications.   Even  a

minute's  interference of the person's liberty is unjustified

unless  the  law  allows  it.   And  similarly,  with  search

warrants. There was the recent case and the Minister of State

replying  to it said, "Oh, yes, but the Misuse of  Drugs  Act

provides."  Yes, I know it does.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up

your time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I shall be

brief.   I  know that Singapore has been voted as having  the

best  judicial system in this part of the world but  I  think

the  concept  of  the  Rule of Law is not  purely  about  the

judicial system.  It means more than that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rule of Law does not mean just plain justice that is

observed  in  our  courts.  I have no  complaints  about  our

court's  function.  In fact, I think they are  doing  a  very

good job.  The Rule of Law to me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



means  that the Government, in its dealings with the  people,

has  to  be fair, transparent and predictable.  I cannot  say

that  the  Government's dealings with the Opposition  parties

have  been fair, transparent and predictable.  The Government

has  control  of  every  public function  in  Singapore.  The

Opposition parties are, of course, not happy with the way the

Government  treats  them in regard to  applications  to  hold

those  functions.  The Opposition parties are treated  as  if

they  are  obligated  to  the  Government  and  have  to  get

permission to organise any public functions such as  dinners,

lantern festival or pasar malams. The Opposition do not  mind

applying  for  permission  if they  are  done  for  a  purely

administrative purpose.  But asking for permission or licence

is done more for political reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, when Opposition parties apply for a Public

Entertainments Licence or other applications, they do not get

a quick reply.  They are left in a limbo and have to wait for

a  long  time.   And  in their anxiety,  they  telephone  the

appropriate department and they are told, surprisingly,  that

that  department is waiting for word from the  top.   We  are

just  wondering whether a simple application for  permission,

say,  to  hold a lantern festival or a pasar malam or dinner,

you must wait for permission from the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman asked for examples. We have only just

recently  held  the 6th Anniversary Dinner of  our  Party  on

Saturday,   20th   November.   We  applied   for   a   Public

Entertainments Licence on 16th October and our answer did not

come  until  15th  November, five days  before  the  function

starts. As you know, if you are organising a dinner, there is

a  lot  of  organising to do.  This uncertainty of whether  a

licence shall be given at all makes organising such functions

very difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the licence came, permission was given to karaoke

singing,   song  items  given  by  the  old  folks   at   the

constituency,  lion dance, lucky draws, but no speeches  were

allowed.   I  was  taken aback. I am the  elected  Member  at

Potong  Pasir,  and  I  am  not  allowed  to  speak   to   my

constituents!  I had to hurriedly send an appeal to say,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



"Please  allow me to speak."  Their reply came,  "All  right,

you  can  speak  but  only for ten minutes  for  purposes  of

thanking your constituents for coming and acknowledging their

sponsorship and gifts that they have given to you."  I do not

think it reflects that we have the Rule of Law in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking much. I am just asking the Government,

when  they  deal  with the Opposition, let us have  fairness,

transparency  and a predictable system. So when  we  write  a

letter  or  even before we hold a function, we know  what  is

coming, what is allowed and what is not allowed.  But  as  it

is,  the  whole  situation is always very difficult  to  deal

with.   It  is  even now. You may like to know that  for  any

function  if  we make an application, we do not get  a  reply

until five days or so before the function starts.  So how can

you  hold  a function without having any anxiety? We  do  not

know  whether or not permission will be given, we do not know

whether  or  not  part of the programme will be  allowed,  or

whatever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking too much. I am just asking the

Government, when it deals with the Opposition, please let  us

have fairness, transparency and predictability.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, in this motion there is much

to  agree  with.  But in the arguments put forward, there  is

much I find that I cannot agree with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with what I do agree with. I agree that

Rule of Law is very important and I think all of us would.  I

also agree that the Rule of Law takes us beyond a very narrow

legalism, but that law is more than what we put on a piece of

paper  and  pass  in  this House. There are  certain  natural

attributes to law. That I agree.  When you agree that law  is

more than legalism, you look for some idea of fairness.   But

there,  we  can disagree.  What may seem fair to me  may  not

seem  fair  to another person or to NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam,  who

moved   this   motion.   In  this  sense,  we  must   quickly

distinguish  between  the  fair  procedure  of  law  and  the

fairness  in  substance of law.  For procedure,  we  find  it

easier to agree.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion and his arguments, I tried to

listen to NCMP Jeyaretnam carefully.  I think there are  some

problems in his arguments in terms not so much of this  broad

idea  of the Rule of Law but in his complaints and instances.

This  relates specifically to certain dichotomies, the  first

of  these is an abstract perfection of what is Rule  of  Law,

against  the  reality  of a working system,  the  society  in

motion,  in  action.  When we compare any  society  to  those

abstract  perfections, there are shortcomings,  instances  of

weakness or areas of improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then have to ask myself, when I listened to the

instances brought forward by the NCMP, whether this speaks of

a  systemic abuse and failure of the Rule of Law, or  whether

these  instances  are  just that,  instances.   If  they  are

instances,  there is recourse to the Rule of Law itself,  ie,

the  Government  of  the  day or certain  officials  are  not

fulfilling  the Rule of Law, there are other ways of  getting

the  Rule of Law done and observed, and this is to go to  the

courts.   And  on this, I found the MP for Potong  Pasir,  Mr

Chiam  See  Tong's argument is of dual-headed.   He  says  he

trusts  the  courts.  He himself pointed out that our  courts

are  one  of  the  most respected.  Yet, he complained  about

certain  systems of unfairness. The answer must  be,  if  the

courts are fair, but there are instances of difficulty in his

view, he must go to the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that in recent years, there

have been a number of cases in which people have done exactly

that.  They have taken hard cases to the courts and they have

won against the Government. There was the Eddie Taw's case on

the  constitutionality of Prevention of Corruption Act. There

was  the  Christopher's Bridges' case on the Official Secrets

Act.   There  was a recent decision against the  Ministry  of

Manpower on certain actions they took in arbitrating  between

employer and employee in which the courts felt that they have

over-exceeded their powers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking further back, the courts have also struck down

decisions  by  the Housing and Development Board,   which  Mr

Jeyaretnam  mentioned, as well as the Registry  of  Companies

and  Businesses.  My point is, if our system  is  endemically

weak,  the whole system is bad,  then we really have to  call

for  this  motion.  But if there are only limited  instances,

the very courts which Mr Chiam mentioned are the upholder  of

the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one exception I think that NCMP Mr Jeyaretnam had on

his  cards  was the Internal Security Act (ISA). That,  as  a

law,  the  ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception.  It

does  not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense

that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can

review  the decision of the Minister.  It is in that sense  a

subjective discretion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam then shared his idea on whether there was

a  need  for amendment, and called for the abolition  of  the

ISA.  When I first became an NMP, I was asked about this.  My

view  was that the time has come to seriously re-look at  the

ISA.   I still think we should re-look at it.  But, in asking

for  this, I have had to re-look at some of my premises  too,

because  in the last year, I asked in this House, and  I  was

told  that  we  do have present detainees under the  Internal

Security  Act.  And why?  These are not political  detainees.

There  are  some allegations of espionage and  other  things.

This  was  all  released to the public after the  question  I

asked in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that, in that sense, we are not arguing

about  preventive detention in abstract anymore.  It  is  not

perfect  abstraction.  There was no public  furore  or  upset

about  these  recent  ISA  cases  when  they  were  announced

publicly. As far as I know, the human rights Non-governmental

Organisations (NGOs) are not more upset than they  have  been

with  Singapore before. The NGOs have also never raised their

hand  against  the  Criminal Law (Temporary  Provisions)  Act

which  NCMP  Mr Jeyaretnam has mentioned today.   I  like  to

point out that the NCMP himself has not completely questioned

the basis of the Misuse of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



Drugs Act.  It also has preventive detention powers.  This is

therefore an inconsistency in his stand.  So my point is that

none  of  these are we really arguing on principle,  Rule  of

Law,  yes  or  no,  black or white.   It  is  a  case-by-case

decision,  because that is how we live our lives  in  a  real

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP drew a lot of precedents from England. Can I

point  out  that while England has had a very good record  in

talking  about principles, of Rule of Law and  living  up  to

many of them, there are also shortcomings in their court,  as

in  every country  -  emergency laws in Ireland to deal  with

the  emergency there.  Many of the precedents that our courts

follow in accepting the subjective discretion of the Minister

come from English precedents.  So I would not think that  any

society  has  all the answers.  I think of this particularly,

because  I  thought this motion should be understood  in  the

context  not  so much of the past, which NCMP Jeyaretnam  has

tried  to  re-establish for us, but in  the  context  of  the

present crisis in our region.  This crisis has been one  that

has also raised many questions about good governance, and one

of the elements of good governance is the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Transparency International, an NGO, has named

Singapore   the  highest  ranked  country  in  Asia   against

corruption.   I  think it is the seventh  or  eighth  in  the

world.   When you look at the region around us, you  have  to

understand that there are many realities which do not measure

up to the benchmarks of Transparency International.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Indonesia last week and I met with various

officials there.  They have a severe task in front  of  them.

An  old  acquaintance, Marzuki Darusman,  is   now  Attorney-General.  He, I think, and this is my personal belief,  is  a

man  who  would try to make a difference, to try to establish

the  Rule  of Law, but the institutions, the officials,  some

are  good  and  some  are  not so good.   There  has  been  a

systemic  problem,  which we do not have in  Singapore.   The

answers, in this context, are much more complex and difficult

than ours.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Singapore is different - size, heritage, a

Government that has been clean and not corrupt, and I do  not

say  that we are perfect.  But my point today is that if this

motion  was about the importance of the Rule of Law and  how,

without being perfect, our Government has tried to observe it

and  how  if Government does not observe it, then the  courts

will fill that gap, I would have agreed with the motion.  But

as has been argued by the two speakers before me, I regret  I

cannot support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, a question for Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you seeking a point of

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I am surprised that the NMP

says  that  I  should  go  to court  when  I  was  not  given

permission to speak.  I have been a practising politician for

over  20  years  now.  I would like to ask  him  whether  the

decision  not to allow me to speak is a judicial decision  on

the part of the Minister, or is it a political decision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am really surprised that Mr Chiam does

not  understand  judicial  review.   Of  course,  it  is  the

decision  of  the  official in charge, but  if  the  official

transgresses certain parameters of the law, if he  is  acting

unreasonably, if he is acting unfairly without due cause,  if

he  has  favoured a PAP official and not Mr Chiam, these  are

all subject to judicial review.  In this sense, while many of

our  laws  do not have appeal to the courts, the  courts  use

judicial  review to ensure that things observe  the  Rule  of

Law.  Is that clear enough, Mr Chiam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think it is difficult for us to go

into  a debate, because Mr Simon Tay is an academician and  I

am speaking as a practical politician.  He thinks I am like a

cry  baby, go to the court to get remedy.  To me, this  is  a

political  decision  and it has to be rectified  politically.

And I think we know how to do that.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng</b>

<b>Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the NCMP never fails to bore us, never

fails to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



show  us  that he lives in the past, never fails to  show  us

that  he is good in delivering lectures on very basic points,

which  any first year law student would know.  For the  first

almost  30 minutes of his speech, he had talked about  things

of  the  past  -  Magna Carta, Confucius  - things which  are

not   of  relevance  in  Singapore,  before  coming  to   the

Constitution, which is what really matters.  He had mentioned

basic  points  that  any first year law student  would  know,

which  I think highlights the fact that this motion is really

unnecessary and gratuitous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he is right. We have heard enough of him, because

that is what he said in this House, and we truly agree.   Why

do  I  say  that this motion is not necessary and gratuitous?

As  Mr  Tay  and all of us believe, there is undoubtedly  the

Rule  of  Law in Singapore.  And all our Ministers, officials

and  public  servants fully observe the Rule of Law.   It  is

therefore absurd to even imply that the Rule of Law does  not

prevail  in  Singapore.  Of course, he will  cite  instances,

which  I  will  deal  with later on.   But  again  these  are

instances which he culls from the past.  It is as though,  in

preparation for this motion, he had gone through the  Hansard

to  see  what  were  the points he had raised,  probably  re-reading his speeches.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I did not do that.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All right. He probably went

through  his files or his diary to see what points he raised.

But  he  did not read carefully the replies that were  given,

because  he has raised all these points before.  I  was  very

diligent  in  trying to see what new points I could  counter.

Whether  it  is,  for example, rights of an  accused  person,

right  to  counsel, right to be informed of  the  grounds  of

arrest,  or  our  preventive  detention  laws,  the  Internal

Security  Act,  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)  Act,

the  Misuse of Drugs Act, or other matters such as Ministers'

actions at the last general elections, or purchases of  flats

at  Nassim  Jade and Scotts 28, or the need  to  hold  a  by-election, whether or not they are unconstitutional, all these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



have been debated, all these have been answered.  So I do not

think  I  want  to prolong the agony of this House  by  going

through the points one by one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Just sit down.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> He would like that. But he has

held  the floor for one hour.  So I think I should do, though

not  quite likewise, but at least take some time to  show  up

his  motion.   I would say that instead of this House  moving

this  motion,  this House should commend the  Government  for

ensuring that all in Singapore observe the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went though the Hansard. He may not have gone through

the Hansard, but I went through the Hansard,  the compilation

of  all our debates.  And I can tell this House that since he

first  entered Parliament in 1981, until 1986, and then after

he  re-entered  Parliament in 1997, he has raised  all  these

points  before.  Indeed, since 1997, he has filed innumerable

questions  for  oral answers, Committee of  Supply  cuts  and

several  motions, not less than 10 motions or  so,  including

about  six  main and two adjournment motions covering  topics

that  have  been covered today.  I am sure he would  remember

our previous encounters in 1997 when we talked about the need

to  set up a commission of inquiry to look into the rights of

accused  persons, a commission of inquiry to look at  whether

or  not our defamation laws ought to be changed, respect  for

the  Judiciary, and we had long debates.  That is why when  I

prepared  for this motion, I wanted to see whether  there  is

need  to  do more.  Because if there is a need to do more,  I

will do more.  But alas, hearing the NCMP out for one hour, I

think he has said nothing new.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Simon Tay said, he picks on instances, areas. He

does not see the big picture.  I think he is coloured by  the

fact  that he has been around a long time.  He does  not  see

the  big  picture,  especially  of  what  is  new,  what  has

transpired in Singapore over the last 10-15 years.  I applaud

Mr  Tay.   He says that he took a certain position as regards

judicial review under the ISA, in the light of the fact that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



there  have  been  recent detentions, he is prepared  to  re-consider his earlier opinion.  This means that he does listen

to  what transpires in this House, what Government has to say

in  explaining why certain Acts are necessary and why certain

laws  are necessary.  But not so Mr Jeyaretnam.  This is what

he  does.  He takes specific instances and then he puts  them

all  in a very alarming manner, as though the Rule of Law  is

something  that does not exist in Singapore, as though  there

is a systemic problem with the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that that is not the case. Even then, the

instances   that  he  cites  are  all  based   on   erroneous

interpretation,  both of the law and, in some  instances,  of

the  facts.   It is just like what transpired earlier  on  in

this  House  when  he challenged the Minister  of  State  for

Communications and Information Technology saying that  if  we

clamp  a person's car, we are punishing him, we are punishing

an  innocent person.  I am quite surprised with that.  Surely

Mr  Jeyaretnam must know that this is not an innocent person.

He has been summoned to court for a parking offence.  He does

not come.  And then a warrant of arrest is issued against him

and  he  also  does not comply with the warrant.   So  he  is

cocking  a  snook  at the law.  He is not complying  with  an

order of the court to appear.  And so you clamp his car,  not

to  punish him, but to inconvenience him, to ensure  that  he

appears  before  a  court.  This is not  judicial  punishment

which, of course, will be unconstitutional.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I by way of clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, Prof. Ho?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. I think

Mr Jeyaretnam has had his hour.  Now it is my turn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will correct you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please continue, Prof. Ho.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> What does the concept of the

Rule of Law entail?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



Maybe  I should also give a bit of background, but I will  do

it  in   two minutes, not 25 minutes.  In short, the Rule  of

Law  refers  to  the  supremacy of law,  as  opposed  to  the

arbitrary  exercise of power.  The other key  tenet  is  that

everyone  is equal before the law.  The concept also includes

the  notions  of  the transparency, openness and  prospective

application  of  our laws, observation of the  principles  of

natural  justice, independence of the Judiciary and  judicial

review of administrative action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state very clearly that all these are established

features  of our legal system.  We all know that everyone  in

Singapore  is subject to the law.  No one is above  the  law.

Other  nations  admire  us  for  this  aspect  of  our   good

governance,  the  Rule  of Law.  Hence,  everyone,  from  the

President  to the humblest citizen, is subject  to  the  same

laws.   There are no double standards or favouritism, and  no

one  is  exempt.   This  is an important  point  because  the

integrity and credibility of our institutions, including  the

Government and civil service and their players, are  the  key

foundations  of Singapore's success.  Also for  this  reason,

Ministers   and  MPs  suspected  of  wrongdoing   have   been

investigated and indeed some have been prosecuted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members recall, three years ago, Senior Minister and

DPM  Lee  came  to  this House to explain  their  actions  in

relation  to some property purchases they had made  which  PM

had  earlier  investigated.   All  these  again  are  in  the

Hansard.   To  me,  this  is a very clear  example  that  the

Government  upholds the Rule of Law and ensures  that  it  is

fully  observed  by  all.   It shows  that  the  honesty  and

integrity  of  Ministers  and public  servants  is  zealously

safeguarded, not only in words but also in deed.  What is the

NCMP  talking  about?   In fact, I will  say  that  the  NCMP

insults  Singaporeans by alleging that the Rule of  Law  does

not prevail in Singapore because this Government which stands

on  the  Rule  of  Law has been repeatedly re-elected  in  10

general elections since 1959.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that the Government is a mafia. I think he

used that word "mafia".  I must say that I am very surprised.

This is really absurd.  Singaporeans are being led by a mafia

organisation!   All  of  us here are members  of  the  mafia!

Foreigners are coming here to live, some wanting to  be  part

of   the  Singapore  family  as  permanent  residents  or  as

citizens.  Why?  Because they also want to join the mafia.  I

hope Mr Jeyaretnam will have a bit more sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example where the Rule of Law prevails in

Singapore  is  what  Senior  Minister,  who  was  then  Prime

Minister,  said in the House in January 1988, in  respect  of

rumours   and  allegations  of  impropriety  concerning   the

previous Attorney-General:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every allegation made against any official of corrupt,

illegal  or  improper conduct or action will be investigated.

The fact that the official complained against is the Attorney-General,   the   highest   legal   officer   in   charge   of

investigation, will not prevent such investigations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister added that the allegations had been

investigated  and were proven unfounded.  But  he  also  said

that  if  they  had  been substantiated, the Attorney-General

would have to face the consequences.  So no one, not even the

Attorney-General  who has the discretion to  prosecute  cases

under  the Constitution, something which Mr Jeyaretnam  I  am

sure,   will   embrace  with  his  heart,  is   exempt   from

investigation and prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our laws are tough against criminals and

wrong   doers.   We  do  have  laws  which  allow  preventive

detention   without  trial,  the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary

Provisions) Act, for example.  There is a sunset  clause  and

every five years we come before this House to justify why  it

should be continued.  Indeed, even for the other laws such as

the  ISA  and the Misuse of Drugs Act, they have  been  fully

debated  in this House.  The last time I think it was debated

by  Mr  Chiam and DPM Lee when DPM Lee explained very clearly

why  the ISA was still needed today.  Mr Jeyaretnam calls for

the  repeal  of  these laws.  Will he be  responsible  if  we

repeal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



these  laws  and  secret  societies start  infiltrating  into

Singapore?  Of course, he would not be because he is just  an

NCMP.  But the Government, the Minister for Home Affairs  and

myself, as his No. 2, will have to be responsible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell Mr Jeyaretnam why preventive detention laws

are  important.  I have explained it many times  before.   In

the  case of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act,  we

are  dealing  with triads, secret societies.   Witnesses  are

fearful  to  testify  in  open court.   So  we  have  to  act

decisively.   Having said this, does it mean  therefore  that

the  Rule  of  Law does not prevail?  Does it therefore  mean

that there are no safeguards?  Mr Jeyaretnam must look at the

Hansard  in  detail  because I remember  very  clearly,  many

times,  not just once, including the last time when  I  moved

the  Bill  to  continue  the CLTPA for  another  five  years,

setting  out  all the safeguards, including advisory  boards.

The  fact  is  that for the ISA, there is an  advisory  board

headed by a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members  of

the public.  If they disagree with the Minister's decision to

continue detaining the detainee, it goes to the President who

will then exercise his discretion.  Is Jeyaretnam looking  at

all these safeguards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our penalties can of course be harsh in some cases, but

this  is necessary.  This is again not against Articles 9  or

12  that  Mr Jeyaretnam is wont to raise. These are all  done

legally  and  carefully  drafted  by  our  Attorney-General's

Chambers.  And of course, all are subject to the requirements

of  the  Constitution  and all coming to  this  House  to  be

debated and passed.  The courts interpret the laws and  apply

the  laws  so that citizens can live in safety.  I was  quite

surprised when the NCMP said that the court's right of review

can be excluded.  Yes, for a few important statutes, like the

ISA,  judicial  review  has  been  curtailed.   But  judicial

administrative actions to the court, whether it  is  mandamus

or prohibition or certiorari are always available to a person

who  is aggrieved.  The important point is that we must  have

courts which are independent.  Mr Chiam has already said that

he believes the courts are competent and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



independent.  They must be fair and they must apply the  laws

fairly.  That is an important safeguard.  Or is Mr Jeyaretnam

insinuating  also  that this safeguard does  not  prevail  in

Singapore?   That our courts cannot be trusted to  apply  the

laws fairly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do not put words into my mouth.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Well, you have done that

before  to  me.   Sir,  the  other  point  is  that  our  law

enforcement   agencies   take  a  professional,   no-nonsense

approach  in  tackling crime.  Mr Chiam  does  the  police  a

disservice.  The police do not take orders from the political

masters.   The  police  exercise  professional  judgment   in

whatever  they do.  Mr  Low, for example, has been quoted  in

the  Straits Times where he said that he finds no  reason  to

say that Government departments discriminate against ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> On Saturday, 20th November 1999, I

was  deprived of my freedom of speech.  I was not allowed  to

speak.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I will deal with that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But on the next day, on Sunday, 21st

November,   my  opponent  at  Potong  Pasir,  a   prospective

candidate for the PAP, Mr Andy Gan, was allowed to  speak  in

the  public  function.  So my question is: has he been  given

permission to speak under the Public Entertainments Act?  Was

he given permission?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Chiam complains about not

having  been given a licence to speak at a function that  was

in  the open.  The event was the 6th anniversary of the  SPP.

He had applied, in fact, initially just for karaoke. That was

on 15th October.  Later on, on 27th October, a new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



application was submitted, this time saying speeches would be

made.  This will definitely turn the event into something not

quite  the same as the original function.  Therefore,  police

looked  anew at his application on 27th October,  and  within

the  three weeks which is stipulated, which police  has  said

they will try to process all applications, gave Mr Chiam  his

reply  on  15th November, which still gave him  five  or  six

clear  days  to  organise  the event.   That  is  the  point.

Otherwise,  if  we do not clarify this, Mr Chiam  will  think

that police is being unfair to the Opposition.  Indeed, there

was another event.  In 1998 ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister of State said the police

gave five or six days, which is enough to organise the event.

We have got 83 tables and we have got over 800 people coming.

Does he think that five days would be enough?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> There are two things Mr Chiam

can  do.  He can either submit earlier, which means that  the

reply will come earlier, or surely he does not wait till  the

permit  comes before doing everything.  I would ask Mr  Chiam

whether this is something new.  The SPP, and before that  the

SDP  when  he led it, had submitted many applications  before

for indoor talks.  Speeches were made and all these have been

approved.   He  knows  that,   because  this  is  the  stated

procedure, stated policy.  If political parties want to  hold

talks outdoors, whether it is PAP or SPP, the answer will  be

no.  In  fact, we have stated this in Parliament before.   Mr

Low  Thia Khiang had an exchange in 1992 with Prof. Jayakumar

on  this point, and Mr Simon Tay raised the question  on  the

procedures for applying for a PEL, and certainly in the media

where Government gave out many statements explaining why  for

political parties an outdoor permit will not be given.  So Mr

Chiam  knows.   He was fishing. He was hoping for  the  best.

But  he  knows that, given the current policy which is stated

and  known  to  all, he will probably not get  permission  to

speak.  Now he wants to make a song and dance about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of clarification. I have been

an MP for 15 years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Can I go on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, Prof. Ho is not giving way. Can

you continue, Prof. Ho?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So what is the result of our

approach  to law and order?  Our approach is that we  have  a

Singapore  which is safe, a Singapore which people feel  they

have  a  home, which people feel that they can raise children

in  and  one  in  which they can walk the  streets  at  night

safely.   Having said this, there are also specific  internal

guidelines to ensure that, whether it is the police or  other

law  enforcement agencies, there will be no abuse.  This  has

been  very  clear because, yes, there have been black  sheep.

But  do  we  cover up the black sheep?  Government  does  not

cover  up the black sheep.  Indeed, if the police themselves,

as they have done, uncover wrongdoing among their ranks, they

will pursue investigations and prosecutions to the end.  That

is   the   assurance  the  Minister  and  I  have  given   to

Singaporeans,  that we do not cover up wrongdoing  and  black

sheep will be exposed.  That is the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point about the Rule of Law is that an

independent,  impartial and efficient judiciary  will  ensure

that  the laws which are passed will apply to all.   It  will

also   ensure  that  the  laws  which  are  passed  are  also

constitutional.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam has raised this point.

Yes,  of course, our laws must be subject to the Constitution

because the Constitution is the overriding document that sets

the  framework upon which the other laws stand.  I  thank  Mr

Simon Tay for enumerating the many cases where those who have

been  aggrieved have mounted challenges in our courts, filing

administrative  actions  and some succeeded.   Indeed,  in  a

recent  case,  Standsfield  Business  International  Pte  Ltd

against  Minister for Manpower, the court, in fact,  accepted

the complainant's argument that the Ministry's enquiry failed

to  comply  with  the  rules  of  natural  justice.   So  the

plaintiff won the case against the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the NCMP is mired in the past. He has not

realised that Singapore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



the  PAP,  and  the  civil service are moving  on  with  fast

changing times, something the NCMP most evidently cannot cope

with.   S21  vividly captures the Government's approach.   As

for  the civil service, PS21 sets the tone.  Even our  courts

have  moved on.  Because if you look at what the courts  have

done, they have introduced many innovations.  They have  also

reached  out to the public through exhibitions, seminars  and

talks.  This is also an important aspect of the Rule of Law - that   Singaporeans  know  what  the  law   is   all   about;

Singaporeans know how their rights are governed by the  laws.

They  know  how to find these laws - statute books which  are

available,  can be bought, can be read in the  library.   And

they  also know where they can have their legal rights aired,

which  is our courts.  The Subordinate Courts, in fact,  have

done a marvellous job.  The Subordinate Courts have been held

up  as a model by the World Bank.  And the Subordinate Courts

have  introduced  many  innovations  so  that  citizens   are

involved in the law, for example, family conferencing, multi-door  court  house.   These are all  examples.   That  is  an

important aspect of the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would not go into it very much. But

this  point  has  also  been  mentioned  by  other  speakers,

particularly  Mr Tay who mentioned the polls that  show  that

Singapore has a very high standing with regard to the Rule of

Law.   I  have  mentioned this before  in  this  House.   The

Political  and  Economic  Risk  Consultancy,  World  Economic

Forum,  and  other  polls  show  that  both  foreigners   and

Singaporeans  believe that we have good  judicial  and  legal

systems,  fair administration of justice.  And  this  is  not

just  from  businessmen because polls conducted in  Singapore

among Singaporeans and foreigners also underscore this belief

and trust.  So there you have it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude. By this motion, Mr Jeyaretnam

implies that our Ministers and public officials get away with

breaking the law.  Any such insinuation impugns the integrity

of  Parliament which passes these laws, judges who apply  the

laws  and  the AG who enforces these laws.  This is  entirely

unfair.  In a recently concluded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



debate  in  this  House on the President's Address,  not  one

speaker  attacked Singapore's key institutions, such  as  our

judges and civil servants, a point highlighted by Mr Davinder

Singh  in  his  closing speech.  Indeed, the  Government  has

vigorously   defended  the  integrity  of  our  judges   when

Opposition politicians in courting foreign support  had  cast

aspersions on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example was a motion that we debated in 1995 on

the independence and integrity of Singapore's Judiciary.  And

also  the  AG.   The  House has taken  great  pains   -   the

Minister  for Law has done this  -  to explain to this  House

the  role  of the AG, why he exercises independent  judgement

when  he wears his hat as the Public Prosecutor, which he  is

constitutionally required to do, something which I am sure Mr

Jeyaretnam will also fly his flag very high for.  And that is

why  when  he issued a considered statement to say  that  the

Ministers in the last Cheng San GRC general election did  not

violate the law, he meant it.  Because his readiness to issue

an  open statement means that he is prepared to stand by that

statement,  not  just  to this House, but  to  other  jurists

around  the  world.  So the integrity of the AG is  something

which  is  also  very important which Mr Jeyaretnam  impugns.

Because  if  he says that people get away with  breaking  the

law, the Government gets away with double standards, then  he

is  also  impugning  the  integrity of the  Attorney-General.

Therefore,  Sir, let no one doubt that the NCMP is  making  a

serious  but  absurd  and  baseless charge  by  tabling  this

motion.   And one can only conclude that by doing  this,  the

NCMP is really craving for publicity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, it is regretted that the

NCMP has all these years habitually made baseless allegations

against  the  Government for not observing the Rule  of  Law.

This motion is yet another example.  Sir, this motion must be

soundly defeated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would like to get a clarification

from  the  Minister of State.  If I heard him  correctly,  he

says there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



would be no more political speeches in open public functions.

Is that right?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It is the current policy,

except in athletic stadiums.  That we allow, but not in  open

areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But, Sir, as far as I am concerned,

as  MP for Potong Pasir, I have never been refused permission

to  speak  in public in open public functions.  This  is  the

first time permission has been refused, and freedom of speech

deprived.   Yet, as I said earlier, Mr Andy Gan, who  is  the

prospective  candidate for the PAP, was allowed to  speak  in

public the day after I was refused permission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is very proud of Singapore's record of the

Rule  of Law.  If this is not flouting of the Rule of Law,  I

do  not know what it is.  Why is an elected MP not allowed to

speak  but a prospective candidate is allowed to speak?   Why

is that so?  Is that not double standards?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I have said, a PAP

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> --- he will have to apply for

a licence.  And if it is in the open, it will be refused.  So

I  am  surprised Mr Chiam says that he had spoken in the past

in the open.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> With a permit. He must give

me  the  instances.  Then the police officers are  not  doing

their job.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We can look into it, if Mr

generous in not following the policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that when Mr Gan spoke, he was not

speaking  at  a  party  function.   He  was  speaking  at   a

grassroots'  function.   I  am  sure  Mr  Chiam   knows   the

difference.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are we still going to go on? I think you

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> That is not a function

organised  by  the SPP.  So there you have it.  Please,  your

ears must be open.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

with  all the isolated incidents that have been mentioned  by

Mr Chiam and Mr Jeyaretnam, they have detracted actually from

the rather broader motion that has been put forward, which is

really that we should look at the function of the Rule of Law

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Rule of Law is a fundamental constitutional

doctrine.   I  believe it is deeply valued in Singapore.   In

fact,  more  than that, I believe it is internalised  in  the

culture  of  the public service.  Mr Jeyaretnam,  of  course,

mentioned just now the concept by Dicey, and it is not a very

accepted concept these days.  There have been quite a  number

of  writers who have developed it.  And I think since he  has

mentioned  it, perhaps I would take a couple of minutes  just

to update Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



Jeyaretnam and the House as to how the Rule of Law concept is

usually talked about these days.  It is usually talked  about

with a little bit more focus.  Broadly speaking, and this  is

the  Diceyian concept, it means that the people are  governed

by  law  and not by arbitrary or capricious force.  But  more

narrowly,  and I think it is a concept that applies  to  this

debate   today,  it  refers  to  the  doctrine  that   guides

authorities into making decisions that are reasonable and  in

the  public interest.  Decisions of public officers are open,

rational assessment and justified on the basis of our  shared

values.   The  best way perhaps to look at the  Rule  of  Law

today is to enumerate some of the fundamental principles that

it  represents.  Some of them actually have been mentioned by

Mr  Jeyaretnam, Mr Simon Tay and others.  But  I  would  just

like to consolidate the thoughts on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that, which I think everyone would agree

with, in fact I think they would agree with all, all laws are

prospective,  stable, properly and constitutionally  enacted.

That is a principle of the Rule of Law.  Second ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Prof. Chin,

may I just interject here.  I think we all enjoy listening to

your  lecture.  So can you please direct your lecture to  all

of us and look at us, and not look back at Mr Jeyaretnam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Continue.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> I will do that certainly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All laws are prospective, stable, properly and

constitutionally  enacted.   The  application  of  laws,  the

making of legal orders by public officers should be guided by

clear and general rules, that is, avoiding any personal  bias

or  favour,  treating equal cases equally,  making  decisions

rationally and in the public interest, and in accordance with

the  written laws of the land.  In this particular  instance,

on  this  principle, I want to refer back to Mr  Jeyaretnam's

original  introduction when he said that  a  government  that

acts by decree is not acting under the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



Rule of Law.  I do not have any objection to that if you  say

a  government  acts only by decree without any circumscribing

of  such  decrees by other laws.  But it would  be  wrong  to

think that is the situation in Singapore.  In this particular

principle  where you have laws, obviously such laws  must  be

applied and obviously the laws are applied by public officers

who   make   legal  orders.   If  these  legal   orders   are

substantiated  by subsidiary legislation, if this  subsidiary

legislation  is  sanctioned by parent Acts,  by  the  primary

legislation,  then  any  order  issuing  from  it  would   be

legitimate  and would comply with the Rule of Law.   And,  if

anyone  is unhappy with that, there is always the next aspect

or  principle  of  the Rule of Law, and  that  is,  that  the

judiciary  has  the  power and the authority  to  review  any

administrative action.  So that is the third principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final principle, which is already mentioned by a

number  of Members, is that the judiciary must be independent

and the courts should be generally accessible to all who seek

recourse  to  them.   I think all of us  in  this  House,  Mr

Jeyaretnam  and  Mr Chiam included, would  not  dispute  this

principle  that is the foundation perhaps of the modern  Rule

of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is by no means a complete list of principles

but, I believe, they constitute the more important principles

of  what  we  are talking about today.  We can examine  these

principles one by one and see how the Government of Singapore

measures  up to these, but that would be unnecessary  in  the

light  of what the Minister of State has mentioned.   He  has

enumerated a number of instances where clearly we have abided

by all these principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of laws laid before Parliament, it is quite

obvious  to  all of us, including the Opposition Members  who

participate in debate and sometimes participate more than  we

would  like,  but no doubt expected, time given  between  the

First  Reading and the Second Reading is more than sufficient

to  allow  Members to prepare for the debate.  Procedures  of

Parliament are inherited from the Westminster model which,  I

am sure, Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



Jeyaretnam  would like, cannot be faulted.  All  legislation,

including  the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)  Act,  is

passed after due deliberation.  As for the civil service, the

Minister  of State for Law has already told this  House  more

than  once,  and  in fact just now, how the Rule  of  Law  is

observed  from top to bottom, from the Minister,  to  use  Mr

Jeyaretnam's  words,  to  the most junior  constable.   These

examples  show  that at the very least, a deep commitment  to

the principles of the Rule of Law.  In fact, we all know that

the penchant for Singapore civil servants to follow rules and

principles  is  well  known,  not  just  in  Singapore,   but

overseas.   There  are jokes about Singapore  civil  servants

following  rules.  The more popular one has to  do  with  two

Singapore  civil servants being marooned on a  desert  island

with a pretty lady and they did not know what to do except to

put  a  message  in  a  bottle and  float  back  for  further

instructions.  This is the sort of picture that  we  have  of

the  Singapore  civil  service.  It suggests,  it  more  than

suggests, it emphasises the fact that the culture of the Rule

of Law is deeply rooted in the public service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, recently, the public service aspires to do even

more.   The  Rule of Law is the primary point from  which  it

starts.  It aspires to be even more responsive to the people.

It  seeks  to help rather than to hinder and such an attitude

must of course be welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the courts are concerned, we have no question

on  that.   All are agreed in this House that the quality  of

justice  is high, and that we have not just local recognition

of   the   quality  of  justice  but  also  of  international

recognition.   There  are  now in  place  various  means  for

ordinary  citizens to obtain justice, not  just  through  the

Supreme  Court, not just through the Subordinate Courts,  but

also  in  the  Small  Claims Tribunals,  Community  Mediation

Centres,  and  so  on.   Access to  justice  has  never  been

greater.  The judicial process, as the NCMP knows, rigorously

pursues  a  rapid settlement of disputes.  There, of  course,

can  be  room  for  improvement.   For  example,  it  may  be

necessary to see how legal cost can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



further  brought down to a more affordable level and that  is

an  area  where  all  lawyers can help,  including  the  Non-Constituency MP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now looking at the original motion filed by the Non-Constituency MP and listening to all the speakers that have

come before me, there are two main flaws in the motion as  it

stands  and  this would detract from its acceptability.   The

first  is  actually  in  the  first  limb  "That  this  House

recognises the Rule of Law .".  I think the word "recognises"

sets  the standard too low.  We not only recognise it, it  is

part  of  our legal culture, we internalise it, we value  it.

It  follows  from what I said about the first limb  that  the

phrase  used  in  the  second limb is also  wrong,  that  the

Ministers, officials and public servants should be  urged  to

obey  the Rule of Law.  We have heard the many ways in  which

the  Government has not only observed the Rule of Law but has

gone  out of its way to promote and internalise it among  all

civil  servants.   In other words, this is not  the  time  to

urge.   This  is the time to commend.  That is  why  we  have

reached  the  stage  of the debate that  we  should  have  an

amendment to the motion for this debate to proceed further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move an amendment to the motion standing

in  the  name of the Non-Constituency MP.  I have  taken  the

liberty to ask the Clerk of Parliament to have copies of this

amendment which I would ask your permission to distribute  to

Members in the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. The Clerk will distribute the

notice of amendment. [Copies of amendment distributed to hon.

Members].  Could you move your amendment, Prof. Chin?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Yes. Sir, I beg to move

the amendment to the NCMP's motion as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete all the words immediately after "That this

House" and substitute with the following words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) values the importance of the Rule of Law; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of

Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all."



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed as an amendment to

leave  out  from the word "House" in line 1 to the  end,  and

there to insert the words -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) values the importance of the Rule of Law; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of

Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all."



The Question is now the amendment moved by Prof. Chin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I finish first? Could you please

resume your seat?  Mr Low, I have to remind you that when the

Chair is speaking, you are not allowed to rise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the words proposed

to  be left out, be left out."  Members who wish to speak now

must confine their speech to the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am no lawyer.

After listening to the lectures, I wonder whether what we are

talking and complaining about is the Rule of Law or something

which  concerns  fairness.  I have three  instances,  one  of

which Mr Chiam has raised about speeches.  On the surface  of

it,  advisors  to grassroots organisations can  speak  freely

because  they  are under grassroots organisations.    Whereas

elected  Members  of Parliament like us also have  committees

which  deal  with  grassroots activities  but  they  are  not

recognised  as part of a grassroots organisation,  hence  the

differences  between  grassroots  organisations  and   events

organised by political parties.  The policy is such that  for

events organised by political parties a licence to speak will

not  be  granted.   Whereas for grassroots  organisations,  I

believe  they  do not even need to apply for a  licence.   In

both  instances,  yes, one is a policy and  the  other  is  a

provision under the law.  The question is whether it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



is   applied   fairly  because  all  advisors  to  grassroots

organisations  are allowed to speak.  We are  not  grassroots

organisations.  So the question is:  is this fair?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other instance is an old issue which was debated in

Parliament  and  that concerns the use of HDB  premises,  for

instance,  the  PCF's use as kindergartens.  I  remember  the

rules  for granting such premises concessionary rental,  that

is, you have to register it as a charitable organisation with

a  paid-up  capital of $5 million.  So the Opposition  cannot

fulfil the requirement and thereby under the rule you are not

qualified.  Is that fair?  It is under the law, yes.  But  my

question is: is this fair?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other instance is pasar malam. In the past, my

committees were allowed to organise pasar malam but  suddenly

the   rule   was   changed.   Right  now,   only   grassroots

organisations or town councils are allowed to organise  pasar

malams.   So there is this change of rule, whether policy  or

whatever,  that disadvantages the Opposition and it  concerns

the  Rule  of  Law.  I leave it to the people  in  the  legal

profession to judge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, there is this question of what sort of

licences are issued.  There are people who are worried  about

whether  or  not  licences  are being  granted  with  certain

consideration.   Many a time the Government  departments  who

grant licences say, "Well, we will consider on a case-by-case

basis." What is case-by-case basis?  I do not think there  is

a  very  clear  administrative ruling, in terms  of  granting

licences  and  other things.  The transparency  is  not  good

enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the amended motion, I agree with point

one "values the importance of Rule of Law".  My understanding

of  the  Rule of Law is to apply the law fairly to  everyone.

"Commends  the Government for upholding the Rule of  Law  and

ensuring  that it is fully observed by all", I  am  not  sure

whether or not the Government upholds the Rule of Law because

my  Secretary-General has obviously pointed out that it  does

not seem to be the case.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you said that any

speeches  after the amendment was moved must be  confined  to

the  amendment.  I wish to speak on the amendment, but I also

wish  to  reply to the points raised in my motion  because  I

know  what the result will be.  The amendment will be  passed

and  I  would not have any opportunity to reply to the points

raised.   So  would you give me permission to  reply  to  the

points raised?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, I have to insist that you

stick  to  the matter under discussion which is the amendment

proposed by Prof. Chin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Then you will give me an opportunity

later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. Confine yourself right now to the

debate on the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am

obliged to you.  I have no quarrel with the changing  of  the

word  "recognises"  to "values".  I see  that  the  amendment

underscores the importance and the need for the rule of  law.

I  have  no  objection  to that.  But  I  am  surprised  that

thereafter  he  goes on to amend the rest of  the  motion  by

asking this House to commend the Government for upholding the

Rule  of  Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by  all.

It  appears  to  me,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  this  amendment

ignores the realities in Singapore and tries to shut them out

and  just  look at what Prof. Chin wants people to  look  at.

But  we  have  got to be honest and look at the realities  in

Singapore.  If we look at the realities, can we then  commend

the  Government for upholding the Rule of Law?  I am  obliged

to  him  for  his  observation that the  debate  was  somehow

hijacked  by concentrating on instances, rather than  looking

at  the whole principle and whether it is being applied.   It

is  like  you  are  not looking at the wood but  just  simply

looking  at  one  or two trees there.  But  if  you  want  to

commend  the  Government for upholding the Rule of  Law,  you

have got to answer a number of questions and ask whether  the

Rule  of  Law  has been observed in the situations  that  are

being looked at.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin again raises, but was already said by Mr

Simon  Tay,  that  the laws are properly enacted,  passed  by

Parliament,   subsidiary  legislation  is  made   under   the

authority of the parent legislation.  We all know that.   But

the  point  is,  as  the Privy Council  pointed  out  in  the

judgement of Ong Ah Chuan that even an Act of Parliament  may

violate the Rule of Law if it is completely contrary  to  the

rules  of  natural justice.  Of course, Parliament, which  is

controlled  almost  entirely by  Members  of  the  Government

party, can pass any law according to the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Clarification, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you allow Prof. Chin to make a

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Bring it up later. Of course, having

more  than  a  two-thirds majority, the Constitution  can  be

amended  at any time. That is why it is absolutely  essential

in  any democratic society that the ruling party should never

have  more than a two-thirds majority if it wants to  have  a

stable   democratic  government.   It  follows  without   any

explanation.  Otherwise, it becomes a tyranny, a  tyranny  by

the  party which controls Parliament and, of course, we  know

the situation in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1966 to 1981, it was an entirely PAP Parliament.

There  was no one from any other party in Parliament.  So  it

was  a  one party passing laws - yes, strictly following  the

Constitution,  the procedure - but ignoring  the  fundamental

rules of natural justice and saying that they are abiding  by

the  Rule  of Law when they passed a Bill, that it  has  been

passed  in  accordance with the Constitution.   That  is  not

compliance with the Rule of Law as the Privy Council tried to

point  out.  After 1981, Parliament continued with a majority

of  PAP members.  And this is the great drawback in Singapore

and  the  one on which the PAP has capitalised, and that  is,

they go to any length to keep out any Opposition building  up

in Singapore.  That

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



in itself, to me, is a flagrant violation of the Rule of Law.

I will illustrate what I mean by just making reference to the

way the elections were conducted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections in Singapore are all one-sided. The field is

not  an even playing field.  It will be idle to pretend  that

we  have an even playing field in Singapore when it comes  to

elections.   I  have  said this before,  in  many  countries,

particularly  in the Commonwealth countries,  that  elections

are  the responsibility of an independent body, that is,  the

Elections Commission.  Do we have an Elections Commission  in

Singapore?  The Opposition parties, I remember, asked for  it

in the 1970s.  Have we got an Elections Commission?  No.  The

elections  are  run  as  though  it  was  a  matter  for  the

Government, and Government alone.  It is run on the decree of

the Prime Minister in whose Ministry the Elections Department

is put.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.50 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, where is the Rule of Law there to ensure equality to

all parties to contest the elections?  Straightaway, you have

a  fundamental breach of the Rule of Law.  When you, on  your

own,  decide to re-draw boundaries just because an Opposition

has  gained  a foothold in one constituency, you decide  that

you  will  bring it in, put it with other constituencies,  ad

nauseam  change boundaries to ensure that the  Opposition  is

kept out of Parliament.  So, that is a glaring instance of  a

violation of the Rule of Law.  And then when it comes to  the

actual  conduct  of  the elections, I am  surprised  that  no

attempt  is  made  to try to answer what I have  said  in  my

speech.   I  mentioned about the conduct  of  the  Government

Ministers  during  an election campaign.  Have  Members  here

forgotten  how the Government won the constituency  of  Cheng

San?   The Parliamentary Elections Act has a provision  which

says  that  any elections won by intimidation or  bribery  of

voters  is  illegal  and  can be set  aside  on  an  election

petition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What took place on 1st January 1997? The Prime Minister

came to Cheng San,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

held  a rally and he had only about 2,000 people in front  of

him  and what did he say?  Did he say, "You vote for the PAP,

we are a better party, the Workers' Party cannot be trusted?"

That  is  all  in the rules.  What did he say to the  voters?

Please  look it up.  It was next day headlined in the Straits

Times.   I will come to that.  That was another violation  of

the Rule of Law.  In the front page it said, "PM to voters  - all  or  nothing".  And he said, "You vote for  the  Workers'

Party, you would not get anything.  Even what you have in the

way  of any benefits will be taken away from you.  But if you

vote  for  us, you will have what you have got  and  you  are

going  to get more.  But if you vote for the Workers'  Party,

upgrading  will cease, you may not get your MRT, trains  will

not  stop here, you would not get your LRT, you would not get

your  new  town,  your children may not get  good  places  in

schools."  If that is not intimidation, I would like to  know

what is intimidation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was his threat, all or nothing. We referred this

matter  for an opinion to a Queen's Counsel in London and  he

said  it  was clearly an intimidation and in breach  of  that

section  under the Parliamentary Elections Act.  PM told  the

voters that if they did not vote for the PAP, they were going

to  lose  everything. But that is not all.  On election  day,

when  the  law  is  that no one, other than the  voters,  the

candidate  and  his agent, will be allowed into  the  polling

centre,  we  had  the  Prime Minister and  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister driving in, shaking hands with voters queuing up  to

vote,  and  going beyond that into the area where  they  were

casting their votes, watching over them.  That seemed  to  us

to be a clear breach of the Parliamentary Elections Act which

said  that  no one, other than the voters, the candidate  and

his  agent  will be allowed, besides of course  the  election

officials and the police officers to keep the order.  If that

is not a violation of the Rule of Law, what is it then?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also refer to the publication by the papers. The

Straits  Times  carried it on their front page.   I  have  no

doubt  that  the  Chinese newspapers also  carried  the  same

message on their front page.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



New Paper thought that it would go one better.  It tabulated,

for  the benefit of the readers, what they would get and what

they would not get, depending on their choice.  Vote for  the

Workers'  Party, you would not get this, you  would  not  get

that,  etc.   The Parliamentary Elections Act  says  that  on

polling  day  itself,  there shall be no  campaigning,  there

shall be no intimidation, there shall be no forcing of voters

and  yet,  the papers blatantly carried all these on  polling

day.   Was  any action taken against the papers?  Is  that  a

violation  of the Rule of Law or not?  And yet, we are  asked

to  commend the Government for upholding the Rule of Law  and

ensuring  that it is fully observed by all.  I  selected  the

elections  because  that  is the  starting  point,  the  main

foundation for ensuring that there is a democracy, a properly

elected  government ruling the country, a government  elected

by   the  people  with  complete  freedom  to  choose   their

representatives without any fear, without any constraint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Cheng San voters have that freedom? Will you

please try and answer that?  You have the Prime Minister, not

the PAP official.  You have the Prime Minister because he was

already  Prime  Minister on nomination  day.   There  was  no

question that he would be the Prime Minister.  He went  there

and  he  said this.  So what freedom of choice did the  Cheng

San  voters  have?  Let us be honest and ask  this  question.

Here  is  the  Prime Minister telling you,  "I  am  going  to

withdraw  everything from you."  What is more, he told  them,

"If  you  vote for us, you'll have a hot line to me.   You'll

have  a hot line to two Deputy Prime Ministers."  I have been

telling some of the Cheng San voters, "Why do you not ring up

the  Prime  Minister?  Ring him up and say, this is  the  hot

line,  Mr  Prime Minister.  Will you listen to me?"  and  see

what response you get.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detention under the Internal Security Act is not

answered  simply  by  saying that we  may  need  it.   It  is

justified.   The question you have to answer is: does  it  or

does  it  not violate the Rule of Law?  The rule, as I  said,

was  propounded in the 13th century when the Barons said, "No

one will be deprived of his liberty

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



except by the lawful judgment of the court."  Is it or is  it

not  a  violation of the Rule of Law?  It is no good  arguing

that it is necessary because you want to keep Singapore safe.

If you want to keep Singapore safe, then shoot all criminals.

Then  perhaps people may not take up to crime.  Have  summary

trials,  summary justice, then Singapore will  be  absolutely

safe.  But is that what we want in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must look at the picture as a whole. Does

detention without trial violate the Rule of Law?  Do not just

say  that  it  keeps  Singapore safe, we will  not  have  any

trouble.  Let us be honest and say, "No, in Singapore, we  do

not  uphold the Rule of Law.  We don't think the Rule of  Law

really  is necessary for our society because we want to  keep

Singapore  safe.   So  we  are going to  give  our  Ministers

arbitrary power to keep Singapore safe."  Then, at least, the

world  will  know that we are being honest, that we  are  not

interested in the Rule of Law.  We have our own way of  doing

things.  But if you keep saying that we observe the  Rule  of

Law,  then you have got to ask the question: do we?   And  if

you  examine  the record of this Government,  certainly  from

1965  onwards, you will find that this is a Government which,

through its Ministers, through its civil servants, especially

the  law enforcement agencies, has violated the Rule of  Law.

I  have mentioned the instances.  But, as I said, you do  not

just  look at it at one instance, two instances.  I could  go

on  and explain in detail, but I do not think I will have the

time for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way Police investigations are carried out violates

the  Rule  of  Law; not informing arrested persons  of  their

right,  denying them counsel once they are taken into custody

for  up  to three weeks violating the Rule of Law.  Yes,  you

can,  of  course, say it is necessary.  Our  police  have  to

investigate, our police have to stamp out crime.  So we  have

got to give them these powers.  Let us say we do not want the

Rule  of Law.  For us, it is more important that our officers

have  the  power  to get criminals out of  the  society  and,

similarly, with other powers of the police.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment ignores the realities in Singapore. It

does  not  look  at  the  situation in  Singapore  but  seeks

approval  or  approbation because Singapore is  such  a  good

place.  Everyone is happy.  Well, that is questionable.   But

it  ignores  the realities, because we have got this  result.

It  does  not  matter about the means.   But  the  means  are

important.   It is not just the end.  It is the  means  which

will  justify  the  end, not the end that  will  justify  the

means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other constant theme of Mr Simon Tay and even Prof.

Chin  is, "Go to the courts, go to the courts."  But that  is

to  miss the whole point of the argument.  Does Mr Simon  Tay

know  that  with the amendment to the Internal Security  Act,

the  courts are now precluded from inquiring into the  merits

of the detention?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do that afterwards. This happened after

the Court of Appeal in 1989 decided it would no longer follow

its past ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used

up your 30 minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I speak very briefly on the

amendment to the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prefacing my remarks, may I just reply perhaps to the

rhetorical  question  Mr Jeyaretnam  asked  me.   Yes,  I  do

understand what the amendments to the ISA have done.   In  my

remarks  earlier,  I  said that I saw this  therefore  as  an

exception to the rule of law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why? Why is it an exception?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> That is why I argued about my own

experience in recognising some of the realities.  And I  must

point  out  to the NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, that his position  is

inconsistent, because while he says he is against the ISA  on

a  principle  of the Rule of Law, he has not recommended,  in

his  speech,  the  abandonment of the Misuse  of  Drugs  Act,

simply some more safeguards.   And that is inconsistent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>

It  is  only consistent if he looked at the realities,  which

means to say case by case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the amendment to the motion. May I just

ask two points of clarification from the Member for Sembawang

GRC,  Prof. Chin.  This is with regard to the second  leg  of

the  amendment.  In commending the Government  for  upholding

the  Rule of Law, does this amendment suggest that the courts

have  had no or very limited role in holding the Rule of Law?

Secondly,  in  suggesting  that the  Rule  of  Law  is  fully

observed  by all, is this amendment suggesting that Singapore

is  somehow perfect?  Because, if either of these suggestions

are  there,  which I hope they are not, then I  am  afraid  I

cannot  agree with this motion.  While Singapore has  a  good

record,  it  is by no means perfect and can be improved  upon

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we do have a good record, it is not only

the  Government that has observed this and made it  possible.

They  have  had a role but it is also the role of the  courts

and other institutions of this country.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, since Mr Tay has asked

about the amended motion, may I just make a couple of points.

Commending the Government in relation to that aspect  of  the

Rule  of  Law  which  relates to  the  importance  of  public

servants abiding by rationality, following proper legislation

and  orders,  it is, as I have said just now,  not  the  only

aspect of the Rule of Law that exists.  I have mentioned, and

I  think the Minister of State has also mentioned, that it is

quite clear that our courts also deserve to be commended  for

the good work that it has done in ensuring the Rule of Law in

Singapore.   But  if  you look at the  original  motion,  the

emphasis  is on the public servants and the public  officers,

and  that is why the amended motion follows very closely that

aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to your second point ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Prof. Chin, can you address

your points to the Chair?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir.  In ensuring that it is fully observed by  all,

that  is an expression of an intention, an expression of  the

expectation that the Government would ensure that all  public

servants obey and observe the Rule of Law, and it is no  more

than  what it says.  I hope that clarifies the situation  for

Mr Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I did not originally intend to

speak  but  having listened to this long and rambling  speech

by  Mr Jeyaretnam, I think I should say a few words, lest  he

gets  away with thinking that he is always right when  he  is

always wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no doctor, no lawyer, just a Minister. Common

sense  tells  me and sometimes I read journals and  what  may

interest  me.   I  know that as we get older, our  short-term

memory gets worse.  Our long-term memory is always there.  So

Mr   Jeyaretnam   recalls  all  these  past   instances   and

selectively remembers certain things and conveniently forgets

others  that  he has learnt over the years.  When  he  quotes

certain instances, he has forgotten all the answers that have

been  given  in  this House or that have been replied  to  in

other   forums.    He  just  completely   ignores   them   or

conveniently forgets them.  The few examples he gave in  this

half-an-hour of additional time that he has as  a  result  of

this amendment boiled down to three or four points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point he made was that in a democracy the

Government  should  not have more than  two-thirds  majority,

otherwise  it  is not a democracy.  I do not  know  by  whose

definition  it is for this particular term of democracy  that

the  Government  should  not  have  more  than  a  two-thirds

majority.  When you have a democratic system, in our  case  a

system  that  allows  the  people  to  elect  and  choose   a

government  every five years, they decide who  they  want  to

govern  them.   We know that the people have  decided,  since

1959,  that the People's Action Party is the party they  want

to  govern Singapore.  Except for the initial years, we  have

got more than two-thirds majority

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



since.   That is the wish of the people, not the wish of  the

PAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1965 till 1981, when Mr Jeyaretnam first came to

this House and made a big song and dance about it, those were

the years when the PAP had total control of this House and in

all  policy-decision making.  Of course, he would  say,  "One

party, and therefore oppressive and bad for the people."  But

the records say otherwise.  Over those few years, despite the

difficulties  we faced and the issues we had  to  deal  with,

despite  some  people who wanted to down Singapore,  we  have

succeeded.  We have succeeded because of the policies that we

have  formulated, the ways we have implemented them  and  the

ways the people have supported them.  They knew quite well in

their  hearts  that  this  Government  delivers  whatever  it

promises.   While we had complete control in this  House,  we

did  not  abuse it.  In fact, we have had some of  our  older

colleagues  play  the  role  of the  Opposition  to  counter,

challenge  and criticise our policies to make  sure  that  we

were  not  all  of  the same mind, moving  in  one  direction

regardless of whether the policies were right or  wrong.   We

moved on and we succeeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, Mr Jeyaretnam came to the House. What

additional contribution did he make?  I think the  record  is

there  for  people to see.  In 1984, Mr Chiam  came  to  this

House.   In 1991, four Opposition MPs came to this House.   I

think  the  people  had  enough.  In  one  term,  the  people

recognised  some  of them were just not competent  enough  to

serve them and two of them are no longer in this House.  That

is  the kind of Opposition we have.  So when Mr Jeyaretnam is

unable  to  get  more people to support him,  and  unable  to

attract the right people to work with him, do not blame it on

the  People's Action Party or the Government.  He should only

blame it on himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam became the Secretary-General of the

Workers' Party since 1972.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 1971.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> 1971. What has changed in the

Workers' Party since?  What new people are there?  Of course,

Mr  Low Thia Khiang is a rare find.  But that is a rarity  in

the  Workers'  Party.  What else do we have in  the  Workers'

Party?  What sort of people do they produce?  Where are  they

election  after election?  Look at the People's Action  Party

in  1971.   Look at the people we had in 1971.  How  many  of

them are here except Senior Minister?  Who else?  1976? A few

more are still around.  But every term we have got new people

because  we  are  able  to  attract  them.   Because  we  are

inclusive  and  able to accommodate all views and  take  them

into  account and that we have to stay relevant in  order  to

gain the people's support.  That is how we have got here.  It

is  not because of anything else.  It is only because of  the

programmes and manifestos that we have.  At every election we

say, "This is the People's Action Party wanting to serve  you

again.  This is what we will do for you if we are in charge."

What  is  wrong with that?  It is the job of every  political

party to win the election, including the Workers' Party, SDP,

SPP  and  SP,  and  what have you.  But the unfortunate  part

about  it is that apart from the People's Action Party,  none

of them has any concrete programme to offer the people.  When

the PAP said, "If you vote for us, this is what we will do.",

Mr  Jeyaretnam says, "This is intimidation."  Is it?  But  Mr

Jeyaretnam is not a political novice.  He is supposed  to  be

an  experienced Secretary-General of the Workers' Party since

1971, for almost 28 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reality of politics. Every political party

everywhere  in  the world has a political programme  for  the

people.   When they are in charge, they implement  them.   If

they  do  their jobs well, they will be re-elected.  If  they

bluff  the people and cannot deliver on their promises,  they

will  be  out  very fast, like the SDP MPs.  They  could  not

perform  and they were out.  That is the reality.  So despite

his  long  years of experience in politics and some years  in

this  House,  he  is not realistic.  That is the  unfortunate

part of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the half-an-hour when I was there sitting and

listening to him is a very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



painful  exercise.  It is painful to me because listening  to

him  we hear the same thing over and over again. The man  has

not got out of the past when the past is long past.  What  we

have now is the present going to the next millennium, and  we

are talking of the Internet world.  But if he operates by the

old system and thinks in the old way, he will never progress.

Certainly, he will not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he mean that by having an Elections Commission it

will do wonders to the Workers' Party?  I doubt it.  Look  at

some  other  countries where they have Elections Commissions.

What  have they become in some of them?  In fact,  I  do  not

think  the system has run very well in some of them,  despite

whatever systems they may have.  Our Election Department runs

a  small outfit.  Every four or five years, and now with  the

Presidential Election works, we get the people in  the  civil

service to support and help as Returning Officers, etc.  That

is  the  kind of structure we have over the years and it  has

worked.  If he says that it is intimidation because we  offer

people a programme and that the Election Department is unfair

because  they are not in charge, there is one route for  him,

that  is,  to take it to the courts on an Elections Petition.

If  he  says he has a QC's opinion that what we did the  last

time was a violation of the law, then the right place to take

it  to is to the courts, apply to the Election Judge and take

up a petition.  That is the way, if he really believes in the

Rule of Law.  What else can it be, if he believes in the Rule

of  Law?  To take a gun and shoot people, like he says?   No,

certainly that is not the way to do things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter is really this. Over these years, people

have  seen the PAP. They have compared the PAP with  all  the

other  parties  and they know that the PAP has delivered  and

that  is why they elected us time and again.  If we tell  the

newspapers,  "No, you cannot summarise the  issues,  and  you

cannot   report  the  eve  of  polling  day  speeches.",   Mr

Jeyaretnam's  complaint will be, "Why is  there  a  blackout?

Why  are you blacking it out and not telling people what  the

programmes are?"  If you do not have a programme, there is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



nothing for the newspapers to publicise.  We have a programme

and therefore the newspapers publicise us.  That is certainly

not our fault.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the ISA violate the Rule of Law? I think both Mr

Simon  Tay and Prof. Chin and my Minister of State have  said

no.   The  Constitution itself says that Parliament may  make

any  law  that ensures national security.  If that is against

the  law, take it up in the courts, unless Mr Jeyaretnam says

we  cannot trust our courts.  Is he saying that?  If so,  say

so.   Call a spade a spade.  Do not mumbo-jumbo and  say  all

kinds  of things and not get to the point.  We had four cases

of  ISA  arrests which were mentioned to this House when  the

question  was  asked by Mr Simon Tay.  We do  not  just  keep

people  unnecessarily.   If they are  no  longer  a  security

threat they will be out.  There is no reason to detain  them.

But  if  they were a threat and they have not cooperated  and

told  us everything, they will be detained.  As a result,  of

the  four cases, two have already been released because  they

have  been  level with the Internal Security  Department  and

have  recanted.  They have explained their role and now  they

are no longer a threat and therefore they were released.  The

other two are still being detained because they have not been

fully honest with us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that he talked about is police

investigation.  Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer.   I  am  only  the

Minister overseeing a department of police officers.  If they

have  violated  the law, Mr Jeyaretnam, who  has  represented

many  cases, would have won them, would he not?    But  I  am

sure  of the results of that.  All I know is that when police

investigates, they follow the rules and the law.  They go  to

the  Attorney-General and the Attorney-General  sanctions  it

before   it  goes  to  prosecution.   The  success  rate   in

prosecution  is  pretty high.  But that does  not  mean  that

every case prosecuted will be successful. The court has, from

time to time, found it justified that either the case was not

properly  investigated  or there was no  case  and  therefore

threw  it  out.  That is the Rule of Law in application.   We

must look at it, as Mr Jeyaretnam says, in perspective,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



take  the  whole picture.  But, unfortunately, he could  only

say,  "Look  at  the whole picture", when in effect  he  only

looks  at  the tree.  That is the unfortunate part  and  very

painful to me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I, by way of clarification, put two

questions  to  the Minister.  Is it or is it not intimidation

for the Prime Minister of the country to come and tell voters

that  if  they vote for the Opposition party, his  Government

will  deny them everything?  Is it or is it not intimidation?

I  told him that a Queen's Counsel is of the view that it  is

intimidation.  Will he answer that question?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the Minister aware, perhaps he does not

bother to read anything that the Workers' Party put out, that

the Workers' Party had a manifesto outlining all the areas of

Government  and outlining the Workers' Party's proposals  and

programmes?   If he has not read it, it is not  our  mistake.

Of course, the papers would not give it prominence but do not

make  an  accusation that we did not have a  programme  or  a

manifesto.   I  will produce it to you and  will  you  please

produce  to us the manifesto that the PAP put out during  the

elections.   Was  it  in  a book form, a  comprehensive  one,

containing  all  the policies that will be  implemented,  the

programmes of the party?  I have not seen anything.  So  will

he please let us have that and I will give him mine.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, again he says the PM has

intimidated  the  voters.   The  PM  says,  "These   are   my

programmes.   If you vote for me, this is what you  get.   If

you  vote for the Opposition, this is what you will  not  get

from  me."   I think that is fair.  Why?  Because it  is  our

programme, you vote for me, I give you my programme.  If  you

vote for the Opposition programme, and if I still give you my

programme, then I must be stupid!  Cannot be, is it not?   If

we  are  stupid, we would not be here.  Workers' Party has  a

manifesto.  Yes, I am aware of that manifesto.  But if people

do believe in the manifesto, if they trust you to deliver  -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You said the Opposition Party had no

manifesto, no programme.  Those were your words.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Let us not quibble about whether you

have  or  you  do not have.  Assuming that you  have,  and  I

believe that you have ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> rose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> And I believe I have seen it too,

what  difference does it make?  You are not in charge of  the

Government.  If you have not read the PAP's, too bad!

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Is the

Minister saying that whatever Opposition has, because we  are

not  in  charge of the Government, even if we  can  bring  up

whatever  programme,  it will be useless?   And  the  PAP  is

capitalising itself on its position as the Government to  say

that  because  it  is  in charge, it  will  give  the  people

everything  that  this Government has.  But  where  does  the

money  of the Government come from?  The people.  If  you  do

not  vote  for  me, I will not give you, whether  it  is  the

programme  of  the  PAP as a party or the  programme  of  the

Government.  Are you saying that the Secretary-General of PAP

can  go  to  the  voters and say, "Well, I am the  Secretary-General.   I can give you."?  I wonder whether a person,  who

becomes  the  Prime Minister of a country, should  behave  as

though  he is the Secretary-General of the ruling party.   Is

he  looking after the interests of the Party or looking after

the interests of the nation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think these are fine points

that  we  are debating.  If the PAP is in charge, we are  the

Government.   Over  the  last 40  years,  we  have  been  the

Government.   Whatever that were accumulated is a  result  of

this Government's policies, and that is a fact and a reality.

So  when we make a promise and say, "Well, you elect  us,  we

will do this for you, we will carry out our programme."   And

for  the last 9 or 10 terms, this is what we have been doing.

That  is  a reality.  We are not politically naive  as  that,

surely.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

listening to the debate in this House over the motion and the

amendment, I was reminded of this story.  Two housewives went

to  the  market  and they saw a rather big fish.   They  were

arguing  about how long it was.  Housewife A said,  "Well,  I

have  got  a  way to determine this."  And she pulled  out  a

string,  measured the fish and then compared it to  her  arm,

and  she  said, "It is about 50 cm."  Whereupon  housewife  B

said, "No, it is not."  She took a look and she said, "It  is

49.74  cm."  Whereupon housewife A said, "How did  you  know?

How  can  you  be  so  accurate?"  And housewife  B  replied,

"Ruler, lor."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we debate what Rule of Law means in this House

and whether we value it or not, I think sometimes we must  be

clear  that we know what we are talking about.  We cannot  be

inexact and flawed in our definition of what Rule of Law  is.

We  cannot take a string and say this is what I think Rule of

Law  is.  I do believe that Mr J B Jeyaretnam who has  spoken

extensively acknowledges that there is Rule of Law.  The only

problem  he has is that this Rule of Law, because  it  is  so

well  upheld by the Government, he has to re-define it.   And

he  very cleverly uses a case from the Privy Council to  say,

yes,  Rule  of  Law does not mean written law; yes,  we  have

obeyed  the written law.  But besides the written law,  there

is  something called the rules of natural justice.   Speaking

as  a  lawyer, I think it is indeed true that there are rules

of justice which are part of the laws of Singapore, and we do

not  deny  that.  Perhaps the debate is so esoteric a  topic,

that  it is the reason why most of the speakers in this House

so far have been lawyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me just give a graphic illustration of what Rule

of  Law is and is not.  If you talk about Rule of Law, it  is

the  exact  opposite of law of the ruler.  Rule of Law  means

the  law decides what you can do, what you as a ruler can do.

Law  of  the ruler means what I say as a ruler, that is  law.

In  some countries around us, we have read the newspapers, it

makes  headlines  when a ruler stops at the  traffic  lights.

Because in that country, the Rule of Law is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



so abused and violated that when finally a ruler does stop at

a  traffic light, it is news!  I think what would be news  in

Singapore  would  be  a Minister or an MP  shooting  the  red

light.   That is breaking the law, and they will be taken  to

court, I am quite sure, if that happens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr J B Jeyaretnam finds nothing wrong with the law,

and nothing wrong with our application of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I have a point of

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> I am not giving him the

floor.  It gives me concern that his flawed definition  would

therefore mislead those in the House who are not lawyers, and

mislead  the public who are not lawyers.  When we talk  about

the  ISA,  he cites that as an example of the breach  of  the

Rule  of Law.  But if you look at the principles of the  Rule

of  Law,  and  particularly  at  the  principles  of  natural

justice,  natural  justice  requires  essentially  two  basic

principles.  One is that you have the right to be  heard  and

to  explain  your  case,  and, two, is  the  right  to  equal

treatment.   A right to have your case heard also means  that

there  is  a review.  As the Minister of State has mentioned,

even  in the ISA we have got Advisory Boards that review  the

cases and recommend to the President whether the detention is

to be upheld or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we do have rules of natural justice applied. There

are appeals possible and there are reviews possible.  And  as

Mr  Simon  Tay  has  mentioned, there are courts  that  would

review our decisions and the decisions of administrators.  Mr

Low  Thia Khiang has said that there is a difference  between

the  policy and the law.  Perhaps there is, perhaps there  is

not.   But if a policy is made and it is in contravention  of

the  law, the courts will strike it out.  The Ministers would

never  have allowed it if they realise it is in violation  of

the  law.   Nonetheless, if Queen's Counsel or  any  esteemed

lawyers  have given an opinion to the Opposition that  things

are otherwise, they should test it out in the courts, and our

courts are independent,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



and the Opposition does admit it.  And we have examples.   Mr

Simon  Tay  has  mentioned examples of how  the  courts  have

actually  ruled against the Government.  So there is  natural

justice, and we must not say that there is not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam chides the House and certain Members of

the  House, and I do believe he does chide the Members of the

Opposition  too, both from his party and from  the  Singapore

People's  Party,  saying  that they are  just  hijacking  the

debate from this high abstract concept of natural justice  to

instances,  isolated  instances, I must  say.   And  isolated

instances may sometimes prove a point, but I agree with Mr  J

B  Jeyaretnam  here  that  we should  not  look  at  isolated

instances  but  look at the whole wood.   Having  said  that,

however,  he  goes  on ad infinitum on an isolated  case  and

isolated  cases.   I would say that natural justice  requires

that  the courts are independent and impartial and nobody  in

this  House has disagreed with that.  So the ruler  does  not

decide  what the law means.  It is the court, independent  of

the ruler, who decides what it means, and that to me, Sir, is

the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say also that Mr J B Jeyaretnam's arguments are

flawed.  For example, he says that we should put the CPIB and

the  Police  under,  I do not know what, but  away  from  the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Out of political control.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Out of political control.

Out  of  the  hands of the political masters,  he  says.   He

forgets that if the Police are not accountable to anybody and

if  they are not checked by anybody, then it will be a Police

state beyond what he can imagine.  It will no longer be  Rule

of Law.  At least, under the political masters, the political

masters  are  subject  to checks, and there  are  very  clear

checks.   One  is  that the courts can say, you  are  out  of

order, you cannot do this.  And the courts have done that, as

I  have said.  Two, every five years or less, they go to  the

ballot  box.  And if they have systematically abused the  law

and the system,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



they would not be elected, they would be chucked out, and  we

have  not seen that happen yet to the People's Action  Party.

So  I do not believe that the population thinks that there is

a blatant disregard for the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam thinks that an Elections Commission

would solve all these problems.  Perhaps he thinks that  with

an Elections Commission, the Workers' Party would be a ruling

party.   I  do  not  think  so.  The people  finally  decide,

whether  it  is  an Elections Commission  or  not.   But  the

Elections Commission is not the cure because, if it  was,  as

Mr  Wong has pointed out, then there are many countries  that

have Elections Commissions  -  they should not be having  the

problems  they are having.  And we have got examples recently

on  this.   Mr J B Jeyaretnam would, I am sure, say that  the

United  States of America is a prime example of the  Rule  of

Law.   I  would say that if he thinks so, and I know  he  has

said this in not so many words before, that the country is  a

prime  example of the Rule of Law.  Perhaps he  forgets  that

even  in a country like that, we have got Presidents who have

been  taken to task for breaching the Rule of Law.  The  Iran

contra affair during the Reagan's years is one example.   And

President  Nixon had to resign because of another  breach  of

law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He had to face the law.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Exactly. That is my point,

Sir.  That where you have a Rule of Law, a country  that  has

respect for the Rule of Law, it is not whether the system  is

perfect or not.  Nobody says our system is perfect.   But  it

is  what we do when there is a breach of the Rule of Law, and

governments  get knocked out.  Actually Reagan  did  not  get

knocked  out,  but  that is another story.   Governments  get

voted out and they get imprisoned if they have very blatantly

broken  the law.  So as far as I am concerned, the  Elections

Commission,  the absence or presence of it,  does  not  equal

Rule  of Law.  So we have done what we could.  The Government

has  done  what  it has to do to make the Rule  of  Law  well

respected  among  Ministers, civil servants and  all  parties

that uphold the law in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam has got some complaints about how the

newspapers  deal  with  his Party.   Sir,  the  last  time  I

checked, the editors of the Straits Times and Zaobao had  not

occupied the Istana yet.  They are not the Government.   They

should  not  be  brought into this debate which  we  are  now

debating,  and  that is, that we commend the  Government  for

upholding the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must add that perhaps if you were to look at

another  way of summarising what we mean by the Rule of  Law,

it is that the Rule of Law is a situation where laws are fair

and transparent and predictable, as Mr Chiam has cleverly put

it,  in a moment of inspiration perhaps.  I do not think that

we  have problems with this, and I do not think Mr Chiam  has

problems with this.  He has one instance, and I believe  that

instance came about from a misinterpretation of what the  law

and  the  policy  said, and so I think he  should  be  better

informed now as to how that law or that policy was applied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instances like that only go to show that we are not

perfect.   There  are  things you  can  do  to  improve,  but

certainly we are living in a country where the Rule of Law is

supreme and we have to commend our Government for it.  We  do

value  the  Rule  of  Law  and we hope  that  Singapore  will

continue to have the Rule of Law and good governance and keep

Singapore in the eyes of the world, almost heaven.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, it is very

clear   in   the   Standing  Orders  when   you   resort   to

clarifications.  I have always given you the benefit  of  the

doubt when you stand up and go by way of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I want to ask him a question by way of

clarification on his statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Carry on. I will decide whether it

is a clarification or not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. Thank you. The speaker says

that  in a detention under the ISA, we have an advisory panel

or  board.  Is he saying it has the same powers as a court of

law?   Does  not the rule of natural justice require  that  a

person  should not be deprived of his liberty  unless  he  is

tried  by  a  court  of law and is found guilty  on  evidence

admissible in a court of law?  Does it or does it not say  so

in  the rule of natural justice?  And is this what happens in

an   advisory  panel  hearing?   Are  witnesses   called   to

substantiate  the Government's case?  Is the  detainee  given

right to cross-examine and call any witnesses?  Is that  what

he is saying?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a clarification.

Yes, Mr Chiam.  Have you spoken?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Not on the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. Proceed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I hope I have a moment of

inspiration  now as I speak.  I would like to  speak  on  the

amendment to the motion of Mr Jeyaretnam.  I wonder why Prof.

Chin uses the word "values" rather than "uphold".  Sometimes,

people  value  some belief and yet they do not  uphold  their

belief.   So  I  think "uphold" is a better word.   Also,  he

wants  the  motion to be amended on the second limb "Commends

the  Government  for upholding the Rule of Law  and  ensuring

that  it is fully observed by all".  I cannot agree with this

because of my experience in my constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite some of the examples where Rule of

Law  is  not observed in my constituency.  Sir, some  of  the

Members here may think that that is trivial.  When talking of

advancement of the Internet, it is probably a small thing to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



talk  about what happens on the ground.  But I can  tell  you

that the battle for each seat here in Parliament is fought at

the  constituency, on the ground level.  So it is  important.

Prof.  Chin  also  said that if you are not  happy,  you  can

always  go for a judicial review.  But how do you  go  for  a

judicial review when a Minister makes a decision not to allow

the  MP even to plant a tree there?  Yes, it happened to  me.

At  that time, one of the members of the public felt that  he

should  present  me with a tree because my  MP's  office  was

about  to  be opened, in memory of that.  Like a good  MP,  I

wrote  to  the HDB for permission to plant one tree and  they

said,  "No.  Very sorry.  It is not included in the  planting

plan of the constituency.  You better write to the Parks  and

Trees  Department."   So  we  wrote.   The  Parks  and  Trees

Department replied that the earth there was not suitable  for

this  kind  of  tree.  When I read that,  I  went  ahead  and

planted  the tree.  So the tree was planted.  On that  night,

somebody  came and pulled it out and put it in  front  of  my

office.  Of course, we planted it back in a pot, just  to  be

safe,  but  not on the ground.  How do we go for  a  judicial

review  to get permission to have the right to plant a  tree?

I  do  not know how it is done.  Maybe somebody should advise

me.   But to me, this is a political matter and it should  be

resolved politically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, at one time, the PAP was generous enough to give

Opposition  members a walled-up office at the void  deck.   I

was  given one and was very happy and we made good use of  it

for our meet-the-people sessions.  Residents could come in to

discuss  their personal problems with privacy in the  office.

But now, I do not have an office.  It was torn down and given

to  somebody  else.   So we have to hold the  meet-the-people

session with just a temporary curtain across and very  little

privacy.   We have to speak very softly so that other  people

could  not hear.  The office was torn down, so what do I  do?

Do  I  go for a judicial review and say, "Look, you have made

the  decision to give us an office.  Now it is torn down.   I

think the decision is wrong, not properly done.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



It  is  not  clear, not rational, not in the public interest.

It does not qualify as an appropriate action."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this problem of pasar malams. Pasar malams

of  course  earn for the people who organise it.  Every  time

you  organise it, you get something like $25,000.  The  money

can be useful for welfare work and promoting your interest at

the constituency.  But suddenly the rules were changed and we

were  deprived of holding pasar malams.  They said, "You  can

have  two pasar malams a year."  But suddenly some grassroots

organisations, I am not very clear, were given two  years  of

quota  of  pasar malam.  Instead of one year once, they  were

given  two  years.   In  others words, we  were  straightaway

deprived  of two years.  How do you vouch for that?   How  do

you  take  that  for a judicial review?  So these  are  small

problems which you may think are trivial.  But these  add  up

to  the popularity or status of the MP there.  If he can hold

pasar  malam or plant a tree, people go round and say,  "That

is  the tree planted by the Opposition."  Politically, it  is

probably not prudent for them to allow all this thing.   That

is why they were taken off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the battle of the notice boards. The RCs have

notice  boards, so do our town councils.  We are supposed  to

put  up only notices concerning the town council and the  RCs

are   supposed  to  put  up  only  notices  concerning  their

activities.  But if they turn political and put up reports of

the   Prime   Minister  and  photograph  of  the  prospective

candidate there, advertising himself all the time, and a  lot

of  political matters, what do I do?  Do I go and complain to

the  courts and say, "Look, this is only meant for RC matters

and no political matters are to be put on the notice boards."

Again,  these are little problems.  In the end, maybe Mr  Low

Thia Khiang is right.  What actually is needed is not Rule of

Law,  but  what is fair to both sides.  I am not particularly

worried  that  all  these things are done  because  they  are

actually   political  matters  and  should  be  resolved   by

political means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of

Mr Jeyaretnam, if you want to speak, you can speak now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I want to reply to the comments made

when I spoke.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I do not want to keep repeating what I

have already said.  But may I just take up a few things which

were not brought up in the amendment speech.  The Minister of

State  said in his speech - I want to reply to him because  I

think I have already dismissed the others - as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



I  understand it, that all are subject to the same law.  This

is  what we want, equality, all subject to the same law.  But

he  does not deal with the specific inequalities that we have

shown that have happened in Singapore.  I have mentioned  the

elections as an example and nothing has been said about that.

I have mentioned about the purchases of the apartment.  This,

I  have  said, came under the second limb about  all  persons

being  equal under the law.  All that the Minister  of  State

can  say  is,  "The  Senior Minister  and  the  DPM  came  to

Parliament to explain the purchases."  We have the Prevention

of  Corruption Act.  We have section 8 in that Act which says

that  where  any public official gets any benefit, advantage,

favour  from  anyone who has any dealing with the Government,

then  he  will be deemed to have got that benefit  or  favour

corruptly.   And  we had here Ministers, not only  Ministers,

Judge  and  other public officers getting this benefit.   The

matter  was not referred to the CPIB for investigation.   But

what was done was for the Prime Minister to take it into  his

hands  and  to  appoint another Minister  and  somebody  else

outside  to  look into it. Where is the equality between  the

Ministers and anybody outside the Government?  In their case,

it  would  have  been referred immediately to  the  CPIB  for

investigation.   But it was not.  That is one  example  where

the law was not applied equally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says, "Police do not take decisions from

Ministers."  May I tell the Minister of State and this  House

that in a proceeding in a court when I was charged along with

the  then  Chairman for speaking without  a  permit,  and  we

claimed  trial and the licensing officer was called  to  give

evidence  for  the prosecution, in answer to my question,  he

said,  "Yes, I have been appointed under the Act to  consider

every  application and to make the decision."   But  he  said

that there was a ruling that if any application is made by an

Opposition  political  party,  that  application  should   be

referred to the Ministry first.  Of course, we had known that

because previously, prior to that case, every time I rang him

up  he  said,  "Well, I am afraid that  I  do  not  know  the

decision yet.  You have to wait. I will let you know  when  I

get the decision."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



Well,  that  was  giving  himself away.   So,  there  was  an

admission   in   court  that  applications  from   Opposition

political   parties  were  being  treated  differently   from

applications  by other organisations or individuals.   There,

you  have a clear breach of the Rule of Law that all  persons

are equal and no one is above the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point, which I would like to make, is to

underscore what Mr Chiam has said.  The Rule of Law does  not

talk  about how judicial decisions are to be made.   That  is

something quite different.  That is built up under the common

law  and there are rules of court.  But what the Rule of  Law

says  is  that  the executive cannot deprive  anyone  of  his

liberty or his goods without a specific law and observing  in

executing that law, the rules of natural justice.  It  is  no

answer  to  say we have the Rule of Law because we  have  the

courts. We are not talking about the same thing. The Rule  of

Law  is outside the courts.  It is for the executive, for the

Government,  to  abide by.  It is for the  man-in-the-street,

the  public, to abide by, and of course the courts themselves

to  abide  by it.  But the Rule of Law is not just  concerned

with  decisions  made by the courts.   The  Rule  of  Law  is

concerned  to ensure that the executive, that the  Government

is  under  law,  just  like  any ordinary  citizen.   It  is,

therefore, no answer to say the courts are there to judge, we

are  not  infringing the Rule of Law.  It is a  non  sequitur

completely.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, just a

short rebuttal.  First, I think I have to put on record  that

when I said that the Minister does not direct the Police what

to  do, it is not in relation to matters, all and sundry, but

it   is   in  relation  to  applications  under  the   Public

Entertainments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



Act  when  political parties are concerned.  In other  words,

when  an  Opposition party applies for a PEL,  the  licensing

officer  will have to exercise his professional judgement  as

he is required to do under the Public Entertainments Act.  He

does not seek the approval of the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That was not what that officer said.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I am telling him the practice

as  we  do  it now.  The other point is Mr Low Thia  Khiang's

comment about fairness. What is important is that if we  have

rules,  for  example, like setting up a community foundation,

it is open to everybody to do it, not just PAP but Opposition

parties.   If  you are unable to do it because  of  financial

constraints, you should not say that there is no Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam brought up some instances on the

ground  which he has lived with.  These are, as he has  said,

not  problems  of the Rule of Law but how all  of  us  handle

matters on the ground to reach out to constituents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question, as amended, put , and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House (i) values the importance of the Rule of

Law;  and (ii) commends the Government for upholding the Rule

of Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all.
