<div align="center"><b>CHINESE AND ENGLISH RELIEF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Figures of, and training scheme to improve teaching standard)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a) if he will give figures  of  Chinese

and  English relief teachers employed in Government

and  Government-aided primary and secondary schools

in  1970,  and from 1st January, 1971,  up  to  the

latest convenient date; and (b) if he will consider

introducing   a   training  scheme  during   school

holidays for those relief teachers so as to improve

their  teaching standard and enable them to  become

fully qualified teachers and take up teaching as  a

profession.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, as on 20th November, 1970, the latest

convenient date before the schools closed  for  the

December  holidays, there were 269  Chinese  medium

relief  teachers  and  847  English  medium  relief

teachers, both graduates and non-graduates,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



(totalling   1,116)  employed  in  Government   and

Government-aided primary and secondary schools.  Of

these,  813  were  in Government  schools  (701  in

primary schools and 112 in secondary schools);  and

303 were in Government-aided schools (86 in primary

schools and 217 in secondary schools).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on 28th February, 1971, there were 336 Chinese

medium  relief  teachers  and  856  English  medium

relief  teachers  (totalling 1,192)  consisting  of

both  graduates  and  non-graduates,  employed   in

Government   and   Government-aided   primary   and

secondary schools. Of these, 847 were in Government

schools  (684  in  primary  schools  and   163   in

secondary  schools);  and 345 were  in  Government-aided  schools (242 in primary schools and  103  in

secondary schools).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the question, Sir,

relief  teachers  are  employed  in  a  variety  of

situations:  for example, I give pure vacancies  as

against  temporary vacancies created by substantive

holders being on national service, on secondment to

other  Departments,  on study  leave,  or  overseas

educative  travel, on maternity leave, on  extended

sick leave and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great majority of relief teachers were

employed to fill pure vacancies most of which  were

for trained English medium teachers. The number  of

English    medium    relief    teachers    remained

consistently   high   because   resignations    and

retirements from the English medium, compared  with

other  language  streams,  were  the  highest.  The

yearly  average  number  of  405  resignations  and

retirements  of  English medium  teachers  was  the

highest  as compared with the next highest  average

of  78  Chinese medium teachers over the  past  six

years.  Last  year, the Teachers' Training  College

organised an "Introduction to Teaching" Course. The

Course   aimed  at  giving  relief  teachers   some

valuable  guidance  in their  work,  especially  in

areas such as attitude to work, class control,  and

instructional efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a special training scheme for

relief  teachers  is  under  consideration  in  the

overall review of the system of teacher training.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  taking into consideration the fact  that  the

pure and temporary vacancies will continue to exist

for  many years to come, may I ask the Minister  of

State  for Education what concrete steps are  being

taken  to  do  away  with the method  of  employing

unqualified relief teachers to man our  schools  in

such large numbers, as quoted by him just now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

we cannot do away entirely with relief teachers. As

I  have  explained, they are employed  in  a  great

variety  of situations such as maternity leave  and

so  on.  The  pure vacancies will  be  filled  when

graduates  come  out  from the  Teachers'  Training

College.  Unfortunately, we  have  not  got  enough

trainees of high calibre joining the T.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Minister of State

says that we cannot do away with the employment  of

relief teachers. May I ask him if the employment of

unqualified relief teachers is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



recent phenomenon, or has it been going on all  the

time?  As  far  as I understand, the employment  of

unqualified  relief teachers is  a  new  thing.  As

such, I cannot understand how the Minister of State

for  Education can say that it cannot be done  away

with.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I say it

cannot  be  done away with completely.  The  relief

teachers'  scheme  has been introduced  ever  since

women have maternity leave.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Can the Minister of

State for Education tell us what are the terms  and

conditions of employment of these relief teachers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Relief teachers are employed

according  to the terms laid down and depending  on

their qualifications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Can the Minister of State give

more information on this aspect?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not

got the details with me, but if the Member for Bras

Basah wants them, we can send them to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> We have had this relief teachers'

system  for quite some time. I am not convinced  by

the  answer that up to now there has been no scheme -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member asking a supplementary

question or is he giving a speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can the Minister of State for Education tell me for

how  many  years has this system of relief teachers

been  in  existence? Can the years of  teaching  as

relief teachers be considered for qualification  as

experience when applying for the post of teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do these relief teachers have the benefit of the

Central  Provident Fund? If they do  not  have  it,

what   is  the  reason  for  it?  Even  daily-rated

employees have the benefit of the Central Provident

Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first,  I  do  not have this  information  in

detail  at hand. If the Member for Sembawang  wants

it, I can prepare it for him later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the relief teachers can be trained

depends   on   whether  they  have  the   necessary

qualifications.  As I have said, the  programme  of

training  of  relief teachers will be  carried  out

under the whole review of teacher training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Provident Fund benefit, I think the

Member   has   not  read  today's  or   yesterday's

newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> If there is no

proper  scheme for relief teachers, are they  going

to be treated as daily-rated workers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> They are daily-rated, Sir.

They are paid according to their work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Is the Ministry

of  Education considering the introduction of part-time  training as a way to minimise the problem  of

having  to  employ  such a large number  of  relief

teachers  to  meet  the  shortage  of  teachers  in

schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just

now  answered that we are carrying out  an  overall

review of teacher training.

<div align="center"><b>FILMS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of classification system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Culture if he will consider introducing a system of

film  classification to replace the current  system

of film censorship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of film

classification has been under active  consideration

for  quite some time. Film distributors, Government

officials  and the ordinary cinema-goers  have  all

been  involved  in the discussion one  way  or  the

other  on  this matter. So far there  has  been  no

consensus of opinion among the parties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



concerned  on a system of film classification,  and

on  whether  or  not the system will definitely  be

better  than  the existing film censorship.  It  is

true  that systems of film classification have been

in  operation  for quite some time  in  the  United

Kingdom,  the United States of America and  certain

other  industrially  more advanced  countries,  but

there has been no indication that the standard  and

quality  of  films  have improved  because  of  the

introduction of the systems. In fact, it has become

more  and  more apparent that the contrary  is  the

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many big film production companies in Hollywood

which  have been responsible for the production  of

some  of  the  finest films we have ever  seen  are

being  forced  to  wind up business  because  films

produced by them at high cost have not been able to

compete  with low-budget films produced by  smaller

companies   or   even   individuals   who    peddle

pornography. There is no doubt that there has  been

a  sustained degeneration in the standard of  films

since   the   introduction   of   the   system   of

classification  in  the western  countries.  It  is

these  facts that have made us hesitant  in  taking

the plunge, for although we do not want to deny our

adult citizens the pleasure of watching some of the

films  born  out  of a permissive  society,  it  is

certainly  not  our wish to turn our  city  into  a

pornographic jungle like New York or Copenhagen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alarmed at the bad state of affairs in the United

States,  President  Nixon  recently  called  for  a

campaign  to  clean  up  the  smut  that  has  been

generated since the relaxation of censorship there.

He  was afraid that the warped and brutal portrayal

of  sex  in books, plays and movies, if not  halted

and  reversed,  could  poison the  well-springs  of

American and western culture and civilisation.  But

the  harm has been done and it is now difficult  to

undo  it. This is a good lesson that we must learn.

We  must  not  allow the American disaster  in  the

experiment of culture to be repeated in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also conscious of the fact, however, that

if  our  present system continues, there  will  be

fewer  and  fewer films suitable for  the  general

audience.  We  are  therefore  trying  to  find  a

compromise   in  devising  a  simple   system   of

classification.  We cannot say as  yet  when  this

system can be implemented, because there are  many

problems  which  have yet to be settled,  problems

such  as  the  age limit for the  audience  for  a

particular  category of films; how the  system  is

going to be enforced; who should be responsible to

see that persons of the right age will be admitted

to  watch the right category of films; whether the

system  will be acceptable to all cultural  groups

in  Singapore,  and  so  on.  Until  we  can  find

solutions for these problems, all we can  now  say

is  that we are travelling towards that direction,

and  it  is  hoped that details can be arrived  at

later in the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out at this juncture that

film   classification  will   not   replace   film

censorship. It will be a useful complement to film

censorship. With film classification, it is likely

that the film censors will not need to cut out  as

extensively  as before, at least as far  as  films

for adults are concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sites for the

former  sheep and cattle abattoirs at Jalan  Besar

are  being  redeveloped under  the  urban  renewal

programme   for   the  relocation   of   families,

businesses  and  hawkers affected  by  development

schemes in the locality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the former sheep abattoir site, a 16-storey

block  of  fiats,  with a podium comprising  three

rows  of  eating stalls and shops, will be  built.

This  project will be similar to the People's Park

Complex  which has proved to be a success. Tenders

for  the  construction  of this  project  will  be

called some time this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the site for the cattle abattoir, a

similar  project planned, but this site will  only

developed  when the Ministry of hands over  vacant

possession Urban Renewal Department.

<div align="center"><b>(Smaller stalls and resiting of stallholders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a)  whether  he considers  the  unilateral

action  of  the Hawkers Branch of his  Ministry  in

reducing  the  sizes of the stalls  at  the  Rayman

Market  and charging the same rental justified,  in

view  of  the fact that stallholders at the  Market

have  been and are suffering loss of business  ever

since  their  customers who used to stay  at  Jalan

Kebun  Limau were evicted; and (b) when  and  where

those  stall-holders  will be  re-sited  after  the

Market  is  demolished and if he will  ensure  that

suitable  alternative stalls be found for  all  the

stallholders concerned as a proof of his Ministry's

concern  in  looking after the  livelihood  of  its

licensees in the Market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the question as it stands is  rather

long-winded.  I shall try my best to answer  it  in

parts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the allegation that the Hawkers

Department  is taking unilateral action  to  reduce

the  sizes of the stalls is a misrepresentation  of

the  true  facts. What is being done is to  require

the    licensees   to   remove   the   unauthorised

extensions, structures and obstructions  that  have

been  made  to their original stalls. The  standard

size of a stall has always been 6 feet by 4 feet as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



stipulated  in  the  Environmental  Public   Health

(Markets)  Regulations. I would advise  the  Member

for   Kallang   to   read  these  regulations,   in

particular, the Third Schedule on licence fees. Not

only should the stalls be of standard size, but the

fees  are  also fixed at a minimal sum. Looking  at

the licence fees, he can see that they are a highly

subsidised form of rental charged by Government for

a market stall or site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second part of the Member's question,

my  Ministry  has been assured by the  Housing  and

Development  Board that the existing Rayman  Market

will  not be demolished until the new market to  be

built    nearby   is   completed.   All    licensed

stallholders  will  then be given  suitable  stalls

inside  the  new  market.  In  fact,  I  gave  this

assurance  in  writing  in  November  1969  to  the

Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Member knows that it is Government's

policy  to resite unlicensed hawkers from roadsides

and unauthorised places in indoor accommodation and

markets.  Rayman Market can accommodate 236  stalls

and  pitches, of which 101 are vacant. The  Hawkers

Department  thus propose to license and  resite  by

ballot  the 115 unlicensed hawkers now carrying  on

business  near the market and along Balestier  Road

into  the  market.  This  will  not  only  minimise

competition from the unlicensed hawkers outside but

will  also  bring people who buy from them  to  the

market.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

can  the Minister assure me in this House that both

the  old and new licensees will be given places  in

the  new  market  to be built by  the  Housing  and

Development Board?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

quite  get  the  point the Member for  Kallang  has

raised.  But I believe I have answered the question

-all the stallholders in the present market will be

given stalls.

<div align="center"><b>(Banning of entry into Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether he is aware that  there  are  many

foreign hippies in Singapore; and, in view  of  the

bad influence they have on the Republic's youth, if

he   will  take  steps  to  ban  their  entry  into

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, instructions

were  issued  in  April  1970  to  all  immigration

officers   at  all  entry  points,  including   the

Airport, Port and Causeway, that all hippies should

be  helped  to  get  on to their next  destination.

Airlines  and shipping companies were also informed

not  to take such travellers for disembarkation  in

Singapore. Obviously, there are borderline cases in

which  it is difficult to deny entry facilities  at

the  point  of  entry. These persons  are  admitted

temporarily  pending inquiry into their  individual

cases.  If  they turn out to be hippies,  they  are

required to leave for their next destination within

a matter of days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on 15th February, 1971, the Immigration

Department  has no known foreign hippie on  record.

However,  in  the first six weeks of this  year,  a

total   of   25  borderline  cases  were   admitted

temporarily and subsequently classified  as  hitch-hikers  and  not hippies. Whatever  the  case,  the

Immigration  Department is making every  effort  to

help these people get on to their next destination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department takes the stand that

dirty  and untidy-looking people with long, unkempt

hair  and  beard are presumed to be hippies  unless

proved  otherwise.  Anybody, therefore,  who  looks

like  a  hippie  has  to  satisfy  the  immigration

officers that he, in fact, is not one and that  his

stay  in Singapore will not raise doubts at all  as

to his true position before he is permitted entry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is well under control. It is not,

therefore,   proposed   to   vary   the    existing

instructions  and  to declare a total  ban  on  the

entry  of  foreign hippies, particularly those  who

are healthy hitch-hikers and do not betray signs of

the drug-taking type of hippie on arrival.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Sir, can the

Parliamentary Secretary explain to the  House  what

he means by "borderline" cases of hippies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I would say a "borderline" case

is  one  where a person is not clearly a hippie  on

the  basis of the presumption which I have  stated,

hut  at  the same time he is not able to avoid  the

suspicion  that he may be a hippie because  of  his

general  appearance and mannerisms. It is difficult

to give a graphic description of a borderline case,

but  my  Ministry  considers and  determines  every

borderline case on its demerits!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Have the Government given any

guidance or training to the immigration officers as

to  what constitutes "hippiism"? If they have,  the

immigration  officers may be better  able  to  take

action against local hippies or foreign hippies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think any

elaborate training is required on the part  of  the

immigration  officers. The presumption  is  clearly

stated,  and  the  officers  will  exercise   their

discretion  accordingly. Where there are borderline

cases,  as I say, we treat them in accordance  with

the method I have described.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

<br><br><i>Review of the Singapore Economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to expectations at the last budget, the

year 1970 has been another very favourable year for

Singapore.  A  quick look at the main economic  and

social  indicators which are given  in  summary  in

Table I will be sufficient to confirm this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exceptionally prosperous last two years

of  the  Sixties, we entered the new decade of  the

Seventies  with  some diffidence  as  to  what  the

future  would  hold  for  us.  The  major  external

factors then looming over the horizon and likely to

affect  the  economy during the first half  of  the

decade  were  the  continued  instability  of   the

international  monetary  system,  depressed   share

prices  combined  with inflation in  the  developed

countries    and,   in   consequence    of    these

uncertainties, the expectation of a  gradual  slow-down  in  the  growth of world trade. Domestically,

there were the expected consequences of the British

Government's decision to withdraw all its  military

forces from Singapore by the end of 1971. Added  to

this  was  the uncertainty as to the effects,  both

economic and political, of the accelerated run-down

of American Armed Forces in Vietnam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event, whilst there was some cause for our

apprehensions, the worst has been avoided  in  1970

largely by a coincidence of favourable factors. The

decision   by  the  Labour  Government  for   total

military   withdrawal  from  South-east  Asia   was

reversed  by the victory of the Conservative  Party

in  the  United Kingdom elections. The Conservative

Government  intention  to  maintain  an   effective

presence  in  the area has given added strength  to

the  Five-Power Defence arrangements  for  Malaysia

and   Singapore.   It  has  resulted   in   greater

confidence  in  businessmen and  investors  in  the

future  of  both countries. Instead of an  expected

$150  million  loss  in income,  the  reduction  of

British military spending also proved to be  slight

in  1970. (But the drop will be all the sharper  in

1971!) World trade in value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



terms  continued to expand, not in accordance  with

earlier  GATT  (General Agreement  on  Tariffs  and

Trade) estimates of a 4-8 per cent rate, but at the

relatively high rate of 13 per cent. This  is  only

slightly less than the 14 per cent rate in the boom

year  of 1969, but account has to be taken  of  the

fact that because of the increase in manufacturers'

export prices, the increase in the actual volume of

world  trade was somewhat less than this. The  rate

of   growth   of   world  trade   was   nonetheless

impressive,  particularly in view of the  recession

which hit the American economy during 1970 and  the

prognostications of a possible world recession as a

result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these fortuitous circumstances,

our  economy in 1970 was able to more than maintain

the healthy level of economic activity achieved  in

the  previous  two years. According to  preliminary

estimates, which are given in Table II,  the  Gross

Domestic  Product,  our best indicator  of  overall

economic  health, reached $5,565 million at  factor

cost,  an increase of $730 million over 1969.  This

is  an  increase of some 15 per cent compared  with

the  average  annual growth of 14.5  per  cent  for

1968-69 and of 9.5 per cent for the past decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall want to look more closely at the

components  which  make  up  the  total  of  $5,565

million  Gross Domestic Product shown in Table  II,

but  before doing so, it may be of interest to note

the  related or twin indicator of economic  health,

the  Gross Domestic Expenditure shown in Table III.

This  gives  the  expenditure  on  all  goods   and

services  in  the economy. At $5,707  million,  the

Gross   Domestic  Expenditure  shows  an   absolute

increase of $928 million or, percentage-wise,  16.3

per cent over 1969. More than half of this increase

in  Gross  Domestic Expenditure is attributable  to

the   growth  in  Fixed  Capital  Formation,  which

reached $1,403 million, a hefty increase of 41  per

cent over 1969. Not only will this large investment

ensure a sustained rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



of economic growth for the future, but it is strong

evidence  of investors' confidence in the political

stability  of  Singapore  and  its  potential   for

profitable  economic investment. Table  IIIA  shows

that the largest portion of the Gross Fixed Capital

Formation  was in machinery and equipment,  and  in

construction,   both   indicative   of   industrial

investment. It may also be of interest to note that

the  private  sector share of both consumption  and

capital expenditure is some 80 per cent. This ought

to  allay  any  incipient fears such as  have  been

expressed sometimes of over-intrusion by Government

into  what  is properly the private sector  of  the

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now return to the Gross. Domestic Product

and examine the contribution of the various sectors

shown in Tables II, IIA, and JIB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agriculture and fishing sector continues to

show  the  small  but nevertheless  welcome  yearly

increment. Its potential may, however, be  limited.

Vigorous  efforts  will  continue  to  be  made  in

developing the Jurong Fishing Port and in promoting

deep-sea fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sector, manufacturing, on the other

hand, continues to play an increasingly larger role

in  the economy. In 1970 more than one-third of the

growth in Gross Domestic Product was the result  of

the  growth in manufacturing output. Our industries

are   gradually  moving  away  from   the   limited

possibilities of import substitution on to the more

promising fields of export promotion. We  shall  so

gain  a  larger share in the benefits of  expanding

world  trade  in manufactures. The  time  has  long

passed   since  Singapore  relied  solely  on   her

traditional   entrepot  outlets  for   her   export

markets. Singapore products in increasing range and

quality  are  now finding their way to  markets  in

Europe  and  America. In Table V, the figures  show

that  direct  exports  of  manufactures  rose  from

$1,265 million to $1,708 million in 1970, a gain of

35  per  cent  over  1969. The steady  increase  in

investment,  increasing the productive capacity  of

new industry and expanding existing industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



has  resulted in an increase in value-added  output

to  $1,104 million in 1970 (see Table V). The Gross

Domestic  Product  figures  for  manufacturing  and

quarrying in Table II show a growth of 29 per  cent

in   1970  as  compared  with  the  average  annual

increase  of 22 per cent for 1965-69. Manufacturing

industries now comprise slightly more than a  fifth

of the national economic cake compared to less than

one-tenth a decade ago - see Table I1B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their contribution to total employment is also

significant.   Preliminary  census  data   covering

establishments  with  10 or more  workers  indicate

that  there were about 126,500 workers employed  in

manufacturing  industries in 1970. This  represents

an  increase of some 25,000 workers or 25 per  cent

over  the  previous year's 100,758 and against  the

average  increase in employment for  1968-69  which

was about 21,250.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilities sector's contribution of $136

million to the Gross Domestic Product reflects  the

expansion  of  industrial consumption, particularly

of electric power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry played the most dynamic role in the

growth  of  our  economy. Because of  the  stimulus

given  by  industry towards trade  in  manufactured

products, trade was the largest contribution to our

Gross  Domestic  Product, 30  per  cent  for  1970.

However, entrepot earnings in 1970 dropped  by  4.5

per  cent  or  about $30 million  compared  to  the

previous year. And total entrepot earnings made  up

about 11 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product  in

1970   as  against  19  per  cent  in  1960.   This

percentage  may be expected to decline  further  as

our  industrial  and  economic  base  expands  with

domestic  trade  keeping  up  its  steady  rate  of

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two factors may, however, explain the poorer

entrepot  performance  in 1970  relative  to  1969.

First,  despite  the  remarkable  growth  of  world

trade,  the prices for rubber registered a downward

trend  in  1970. Consequently, the value  of  crude

rubber exports fell by about $250 million. This was

a fall of 17 per cent compared with the increase of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



62  per cent in 1969 when rubber prices were on the

uptrend.  Secondly, our exports  to  South  Vietnam

fell  by  about  $100 million. In  spite  of  these

adverse developments, however, there has been  some

slight increase in total export earnings because of

the  increase  in the export of manufactures.  This

increase  amounted  to  $433  million,  more   than

sufficient  to  offset the fall  in  the  value  of

exports of rubber and exports to Vietnam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst export growth has been sluggish, imports

have  been buoyant. Concern has been expressed over

the   widening  trade  deficit  and  its   possible

repercussions on our balance of payments  position.

However,   analysis  of  the  trade  and   payments

accounts  suggests  that there  need  be  no  undue

anxiety  because  of the following  considerations.

First,  for  an economy with a small resource  base

enjoying  rapid industrial growth, the buoyancy  in

imports  is  due  largely  to  the  fast  pace   of

investment in imported capital goods. This is borne

out  by the statistics which show that between 1968

and  1970, total imports increased by less than  20

per  cent on an annual average, whilst in the  same

period   capital  expenditure  on   machinery   and

equipment  in Gross Domestic Expenditure  increased

by  more than 50 per cent. Secondly, the outflow of

payments  for  capital  goods  is,  by  and  large,

balanced by the inflow of foreign long-term capital

for investment in Singapore. This has generated the

demand for the capital imports. Thirdly, because of

imperfect data, the trade deficit in the balance of

payments  is  thought to be smaller than  shown.  A

part of the positive large amounts for "errors  and

omissions"  in the balance of payments  figures  in

Table  VII  is  believed to be due to  the  trading

account.  Finally, and the most conclusive  factor,

our  foreign reserves have been rising steadily  in

recent   years.  Official  overseas   assets   have

increased from $2,278.9 million in 1968 to $3,556.4

million  at  the  end  of 1970.  For  the  present,

therefore, there is no need for alarm at our  large

trade deficit. That is not to say, however, that an

improvement in export performance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



would   not   be   necessary.   Our   traders   and

manufacturers  should  make  greater   efforts   to

penetrate  more  markets and  make  more  sales  in

higher  value  goods.  Greater  promotion  efforts,

including participation in trade fairs, would help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the building industry which has a

traditional role in pump-priming sagging economies,

our  original use of it in the last few  years  was

intended  to  mitigate the effects of  the  British

military   withdrawal.  The  stimulus   which   was

provided  through incentives such as  property  tax

reduction or payments by easy instalments has  been

successful,  perhaps  somewhat over-successful,  in

getting investors to build hotels, shops and office

accommodation and other urban renewal projects.  As

an   indication  of  the  brisk  activity  of   our

construction industry, preliminary figures for  the

Construction  Sector in the Gross Domestic  Product

available  indicate an increase of 36 per  cent  in

value-added  output. This is the  highest  rate  of

growth   recorded  since  1961  for  the  industry.

Statistics on the production of broken granite  and

of  cement show an output increase of 19  per  cent

and 19 per cent respectively compared to 7 per cent

and  13 per cent in 1969 and substantiate the  high

level  of  activity of the industry.  At  the  same

time,  however, the smaller increases recorded  for

these   building   materials  indicate   that   the

construction  industry's 36 per  cent  increase  in

earnings may be constituted partly by higher profit

margins and only partly by increased constructional

capacity.  It could also be due to an  increase  in

constructional labour costs. This is suggested also

by  the  acute  shortage of  skilled  building  and

construction  workers. One of the  consequences  of

this has been an unprecedented rise in the cost  of

new  buildings  reflected  also  in  the  value  of

existing  buildings  such as dwellings  and  office

blocks. However, some hotels have declined in value

for  other reasons. The situation is being  closely

watched   to   prevent  the  cost   increase   from

developing  to  serious  proportions.  It  may   be

necessary  also  to take other measures  to  ensure

that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



run-away escalation in costs does not occur in  the

building industry. This could have serious  effects

on our total development effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be convenient at this point to refer to

the  ownership  of dwellings sector  in  the  Gross

Domestic Product. The increase in earnings  of  $22

million  over 1969 appears to be commensurate  with

the  expenditure on dwellings shown for 1970 in the

statistics at Table IIIA. In keeping also with  the

capital expenditure, the earnings year by year show

a  steady rise in absolute terms and make a  useful

contribution  to the economy. In percentage  terms,

however, there has been a slight decline to 3.7 per

cent in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made earlier to the reduction of

British  military  spending. Preliminary  estimates

indicate this reduction last year to be small, only

$30 million. The final figure could well be larger.

But  for  1971, the reduction in spending  will  be

considerable  as British force levels  go  down  to

just over 2,000 men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the areas of economic activity which were

fostered  and developed during 1970 to  offset  the

loss  in foreign exchange and other effects of  the

military  run-down, one of the most  promising  was

the tourist industry. The statistics of sea and air

passenger   arrivals  indicate   the   very   rapid

increases  in  passenger traffic to Singapore  from

306,000 in 1965 to 562,131 in 1969, and 716,139  in

1970.  If  we exclude local passengers  from  these

figures,  we find that 521,654 tourists arrived  in

Singapore  in 1970. This represents an increase  of

110,000 or about 25 per cent more visitors than  in

1969.  The  exceptional  increase  may  be  due  to

visitors  going to or returning from Expo  `70  and

passing  through  Singapore. With  this  inflow  of

tourists  into Singapore, and in spite of the  much

increased number of 62 tourist hotels in  1970,  it

is  possible  still  to keep  the  monthly  average

occupancy  rate  above 70 per  cent.  This  figure,

judged  by more developed tourist countries, should

ensure    a   more   than   profitable   operation.

Preliminary  estimates  of  earnings  from  tourist

services in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



total $272 million. This is about 5 per cent

of  Gross  Domestic Product. A decade ago, earnings

from tourism contributed less than 1.5 per cent. We

have  moved  away from the thinking that  Singapore

would  be unable to attract tourists in significant

numbers because of a dearth of tourist attractions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to the sector of "other

services"  which make up some 15 per  cent  of  our

economy.  Among  these  "other  services"  must  be

reckoned those of the financial institutions  which

make   possible  our  trade,  industry  and   other

economic activity. Our instrument for the issue  of

currency  remains the Currency Board with  its  100

per  cent  backing by external assets of all  money

issued  by the Board. It is an automatic regulation

mechanism  of money with foreign exchange earnings.

At  the end of the year, there were $726 million of

currency  notes  in active circulation.  With  $875

million  also  of  demand deposits  (excluding  the

deposits  of  the Government in the  banks),  money

supply matched the overall pace of progress in  the

economy, increasing by 15 per cent in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I mention the action which was taken in the

past    year    to   strengthen   other   financial

institutions?   I   refer   specifically   to   the

establishment   of   the  Monetary   Authority   of

Singapore  and  the arrangements to reorganise  and

strengthen  the  Stock Exchange  of  Singapore  and

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore Act was

gassed. Opportunity was also taken to revise and re-enact  the  Banking  Act, which  put  on  a  proper

footing the licensing and control of banks, and the

regulation  of  their  business  by  the   Monetary

Authority of Singapore. The many activities we have

and  are  expecting  to develop  in  the  financial

sphere  --the  Asian Currency Unit or Asian  Dollar

market,  the  gold  market, the  numbered  accounts

system, merchant banking all these will ensure that

we  have a firm framework for these operations, The

Monetary Authority commenced functioning on the 1st

January, 1971, and the first Board meeting was held

on the 5th February, 1971, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



arrange for the management and routine business  of

the   Authority.  A  Managing  Director  has   been

appointed and staff is gradually being recruited It

is hoped that the Authority will move shortly under

One  roof, albeit in temporary premises, until  the

permanent  site  at  the  Central  Provident   Fund

building can be ready by 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the functions of the Commissioner of Banking

have now been assumed by the Monetary Authority  of

Singapore,  it  will  now be  responsible  for  the

performance  of the banking sector. The  year  1970

has  been  one of steady progress for that  sector.

Table  VI statistics indicate that commercial  bank

deposits  by  the end of 1970 rose  by  about  $500

million   to   $3,195  million.  Though   this   is

equivalent  to an increase of 16 per  cent,  it  is

still  a somewhat lower rate of growth than the  19

per  cent  for  1969 or 26 per cent for  1968.  The

slower  growth  is partly because of  the  drop  in

entrepot   earnings.  Bank  loans   and   advances,

however,  to  the private sector grew at  the  much

faster  rate of 26 per cent to reach $2,168 million

by  the end of the year. Bank loans and advances to

manufacturing industries grew even faster, by  more

than  50 per cent from $448 million in 1969 to $739

million  in 1970. Manufacturing loans and  advances

now  constitute  34  per cent  of  bank  loans  and

advances as compared with 26 per cent in 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Dollar market, which has become a part

of the banking system, continued to expand in 1970.

Total  resources are now estimated at about  US$400

million, and this despite declining interest  rates

consequent  upon  the  fall in  interest  rates  in

international financial centres during the last few

months  of  the  year. When the  market  was  first

established,   most  of  its   funds   were   being

reinvested  in  Euro dollars and  U.S, dollars  in

London,  European financial centres and the  United

States.  However, there is a growing awareness,  on

the  part  of the very large number of creditworthy

companies  in  Southeast Asia, of the possibilities

of borrowing from the Asian Dollar Market for their

bankable projects. Our policy will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



to encourage the channelling of more and more Asian

Dollar funds into regional uses. The lower rates of

interest  now  payable  for  Asian  Dollars  should

assist in such use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Stock Exchange, I need not

repeat the reasons for the legislation now known as

the  Securities industry Act, 1970, and the related

Companies (Amendment) Act, 1970. Conditions in  the

Stock  Market had led to such a loss of  confidence

that  legislation was needed. I am glad to say that

the  market  has  reacted not unfavourably  to  the

legislation.  Close consultations  are  being  held

between  officials of my Ministry and the Committee

of  the  Exchange as to how best to  implement  the

various  provisions  of  the  legislation  and  the

recommendations  of the Ferris  Report.  There  are

indications  that  similar  legislation  is   being

considered  in  Malaysia and the  Bank  Negara  has

begun discussions with the Exchange on the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic price level remained fairly stable

within   the  pattern  of  economic  and  financial

developments  I  have just outlined.  The  Consumer

Price  Index  with 1960 as base o 100 registered  a

monthly  average  of 111.5 for 1970  compared  with

111.1 for 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative stability in the overall index does

not   mean,  however,  that  there  were  no  price

movements   during  the  year.  There   were   such

movements  but they largely offset each other.  The

Housing  sub-index, for example, moved up by  about

two  percentage points because of a tax  on  Public

Utilities  Board bills, but there was a decline  in

the  sub-index  for food items. In particular,  the

prices   of  rice  and  other  cereals   showed   a

significant decline as shown by the fall in the sub-index for these items from 115 for 1969 to 109  for

1970.



<br><br><i>Future Prospects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the less predictable subject of our

future  prospects.  Can we sustain  the  very  high

growth rate of 15 per cent for 1969 and 1970 in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



coming  year? To deal with this question,  we  must

try  to  learn  from the analysis of  the  economic

situation which we have made of the past year,  and

earlier  years,  and from the experience  of  other

countries.  First of all, growth rates  of  15  per

cent  are very exceptional. They are far in  excess

of  the  six per cent per annum target of  the  new

United  Nations  Second  Development  Decade.   Our

comparison  should  not, however,  be  the  average

developing   country.  More   relevant   ones   for

comparison  are  our keenest competitors  in  Asia.

Taiwan  with corresponding figures of 9.9, 9.3  and

10.3  per cent, South Korea with 13.4, 8.9 and 13.1

per  cent,  and Hong Kong for which Gross  National

Product figures are not available but whose  export

trade expansion of 15.8, 15.3 and 14.2 per cent for

the  same  three  years indicated  a  similar  high

growth  rate. Then Japan with its sustained  growth

rate  of  12.3,  12.9 and 14.3 per  cent  of  Gross

National Product growth in real terms for the years

1966, 1967 and 1968 respectively. In an analysis of

their   very  high  growth  rates,  Mr  S.  Okita,

President  of  the Japan Economic Research  Centre,

attributed  the  high growth  of  the  first  three

countries to the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) rapid growth of manufacturing industries;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) export-oriented economic growth;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) cost consciousness of the business

enterprises about their products;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) widespread small and medium sized

industries   developed   mainly   by   private

initiative;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) relatively efficient and productive

agriculture;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) relatively high standard of education and

public administration;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) paucity of indigenous natural resources

which  necessitates  exports  of  manufactured

goods;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) aggressive importation of foreign know-how and its adaptation to local conditions;

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) frequent cases of the separation of

imported  know-how  from imported  capital  or

management participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were like-minded with Mr Okita in emphasising

the  development  of export-oriented  manufacturing

industries for countries wishing to attain a  rapid

economic  growth. Exceptions would, of  course,  be

countries   with  rich  endowments  of   exportable

natural resources such as oil and minerals.  Larger

countries also can depend more on domestic  markets

as  compared to smaller countries. For us, however,

there  is no choice. It is comforting to know that,

according to the examples and results of  the  high

growth  countries I have mentioned, we have roughly

been  charting the right course. All we need do  is

keep the Singapore ship steady as she goes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are signals of storms ahead. On the

international  horizon the dark clouds  consist  of

continued  inflationary conditions in some  of  the

major  industrial countries, and the threat to  the

stability  of  the  international  monetary  system

caused by pressures on these economies' balance  of

payments.  The  international climate  may  not  be

entirely favourable to growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further cloud consists of the uncertainty over

the state of the U.S, economy. Because of its size,

it  exercises  a very powerful influence  upon  the

economies  of  the rest of the world. Its  economic

health  and  the measures its Government  takes  to

maintain  it  are  therefore of universal  concern.

Judging  by  the index of Stock Exchange  business,

with  its sustained trend over many months  towards

ever-increasing share prices, there are encouraging

signs  of a healthy recovery of the economy. Policy

measures being adopted to stimulate the economy are

much  more pragmatic and less doctrinaire and ought

to   have   beneficial   results.   Official   U.S.

economists' prediction is of a 9 per cent  rise  in

Gross   National  Product  at  current  prices.   A

moderate  recovery  is considered  by  others  more

likely,  with  a 3 - 4 per cent real  growth,  with

lower inflation rates of 4 - 4 1/2 per cent, and  with

unemployment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



falling   slightly.   Notwithstanding   this

improvement,  a  slight  downturn  in  world  trade

prospects  is  expected, as the U.S, recession  of

last  year  would, according to expert opinion,  be

felt  in  its delayed effects on world  trade  only

this year. GATT forecasts are that world trade will

grow between 7 and 11 per cent in value and between

5  and 7 per cent in volume in 1971. This would not

be  unsatisfactory.  But it  will  not  sustain  an

increase   in   Singapore's  trade  of   the   same

proportions as in 1970. Further, a disruption could

be  caused  by  measures in the  U.S.  Congress  to

reintroduce  the legislation, better known  as  the

Mills'  Bill,  which seeks to impose restraints  on

the  import of textiles, shoes and other  articles.

Its  passage  could lead to retaliatory  action  by

Japan,  the  OECD  (Organisation for  Economic  Co-operation and Development) and other countries  for

similar  restraints  against  U.S, imports,   with

adverse   consequences  also   upon   world   trade

generally. The restrictive climate could jeopardise

international  co-operation  in  expanding   trade,

gains  made  by the Kennedy Round cuts, the  scheme

for generalised preferences for the manufactures of

less  developed countries, and the tendency towards

greater liberalisation of trade and investments  in

Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home is the accelerated run-down of the

British military bases which is due to commence  at

the  end of this month and to be completed  by  the

end  of the year. British military spending in 1970

is  put, by preliminary estimates, at $350 million.

The greater part of this will be lost by the end of

the  year. Some 15,000 civilian employees and 2,000

locally  enlisted personnel will lose  their  jobs.

Unemployment  in  such numbers  and  a  decline  in

national income of the order of $250 - $300 million

between  1971 and 1972 must affect the economy.  We

must  have  more counter recessionary measures,  in

accelerated  public sector development in  building

and   construction,  and  further  induced  private

investment  should  cushion  some  of  this  shock.

Another  adverse  factor  is  that  entrepot  trade

earnings  can  be expected to decline further.  Our

neighbouring countries will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



do  more  and more of the processing of  their  own

commodities  and  enter more and more  into  direct

trading  relations  with  consumer  countries.   We

understand  their  national  aspirations  and  wish

their  policies  success which is likely  if  their

decisions  are  based  on economic  considerations.

Singapore  can still have a vital role to  play  in

the   provision   of   financial,   transportation,

marketing and other services. The present depressed

prices   in   rubber   and   some   other   primary

commodities,  aggravated by higher  freight  rates,

will  accentuate the decline in our entrepot trade.

With   the  withdrawal  of  American  forces   from

Vietnam,  entrepot  trade in  petroleum  and  other

products will also be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the clouds on the horizon are not

all  dark.  A new international factor, which  will

have considerable influence in South-east Asia,  is

Japan's  rapidly increasing economic strength.  She

is the largest economic power after the U.S, in the

non-Communist world. She is likely to  continue  to

expand  at  around eight or more per cent  in  real

terms  - the Japanese economy would possibly  reach

the present level of the United States economy in a

decade, according to some American predictions. She

can  therefore  become a major determinant  of  the

rate of economic development of nearby countries in

Asia and in the Pacific. Japan already represents a

very  large  market for the products of  South-east

Asia, particularly for those in which she will have

lost  her  competitive  edge  in  labour  intensive

production.  Countries  like  Korea,  Taiwan,  Hong

Kong,  Singapore and others with lower  wage  costs

will   increasingly  take  over  from  Japan.   Her

intentions in regard to increasing her aid  to  one

per cent of her Gross National Product by 1975 will

have an increasing impact on the prosperity of  the

countries she will be assisting with such aid. This

should  be  in  the region of US$4,000  million  by

1975, at one per cent of US$400,000 million in  GNP

double that of her 1970 GNP of US$200,000 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manufacturing, the leading growth sector in

the  Singapore  economy, a record  number  of  very

large    projects   by   well-known   international

companies were announced in 1970 and are now in the

pipeline.  The amount of such commitments  in  1970

exceeds the total of all foreign investments in the

manufacturing industry made in Singapore  to  date.

At the beginning of 1971, it was estimated that the

figure  for  total  foreign direct  investments  in

fixed assets in manufacturing industries, including

approved   commitments,  stood  at  nearly   $1,700

million, compared with an actual cumulative  figure

of $600 million at the beginning of 1970. These new

projects will take two to five years to reach  full

production.   However,  both   quantitatively   and

qualitatively,  in  the  next  few  years  as  they

commence   production   and   expand,   they   will

undoubtedly  contribute towards a  continuing  high

rate   of   growth.  They  will  also  extend   the

diversification of our manufacturing sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing benefits will be derived from the

progressive implementation of committed projects in

the  pipeline.  Then there are hopeful  signs  that

continued  progress will also be made with  further

new  industrial projects. Some of the main  reasons

for optimism are as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflationary trends in all industrialised

countries  will  continue  to  exert  pressure   on

international  companies to readjust  their  global

manufacturing  and  distribution  strategies.  This

will   probably   accelerate   the   tendency    to

decentralise   and   to  adopt   a   multi-national

approach,  in which careful calculation of  optimal

cost   and  distributional  advantage  will  figure

strongly.   So   it  is  crucial   that   reputable

international    companies,    especially     those

interested in long-term growth, should continue  to

find  Singapore an efficient base with  an  overall

investment climate that is hospitable and conducive

towards  long-term growth. In particular,  if  they

find in Singapore adequate physical infrastructure,

necessary  commercial facilities and communications

services which are continuously being expanded  and

modernised, if they see the growing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



increase  and  diversification  of  our  supporting

industries and engineering services, if  they  find

that  the high general education level and  quality

make   our  workers  readily  trainable  in  modern

skills, then the bigger international companies, in

planning their long-term world-wide strategy,  will

invariably  consider  Singapore  one  of  the   key

locations.  This  will be particularly  so  if  our

workers  and  the  unions  are  educated   to   the

realities of our economic life, keen to make  their

contribution to the transformation of  our  society

with  high Industrialisation and sophistication  in

technology. Already a large and growing  number  of

such  international companies,  having  done  their

surveys, have indeed decided that Singapore is  the

place   where   they  can  sink   deep   roots   by

establishing    projects   in    which    long-term

considerations play a major part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stimulate overall growth, our strategy towards

promoting this most important sector of the economy

is   important.  In  response  to  the   increasing

interest  of international companies in  investment

in  Singapore,  we  have expanded  the  network  of

Economic  Development  Board  offices  overseas  to

serve such companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get the greatest advantage and to

maximise  benefits from these new trends,  however,

Singapore  must also readjust priorities to  evolve

what may be called an optimum investment policy. In

this   connection,  two  aspects,  in   particular,

deserve special consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in promoting new industrial projects, it

is  necessary  to be more selective.  Increasingly,

emphasis will have to be placed on those industries

with world-wide markets, with scope for progressive

growth in technological content. We must now select

industries  with  greater  capacity  to  contribute

towards  the  development of modern skills  at  all

levels.  Indeed, we are already restricting certain

types of industry with low technology which are set

up purely on short-term considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the important question of training. To

sustain the accelerating pace



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



of  industrial  development, manpower  with  modern

skills  is  required  not only  to  meet  immediate

demands  but  also to create a large  reservoir  of

skills  at all levels to ensure continuing  growth.

This  calls  for a crash programme which  can  meet

both short-term and long-term needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At higher levels of skill, for managerial and

technical  staff,  industrial  firms  now  find  no

difficulty  in  filling immediate requirements.  As

opportunities  expand, increasing  numbers  of  our

graduates  abroad are now returning.  In  addition,

with  the  liberalisation of immigration,  Economic

Development  Board centres abroad  find  increasing

response   by   many  professionals,   particularly

Asians, of all categories of skills who are willing

not  only to come and work in Singapore but to take

root  here  as their permanent home.  In  the  long

term,   of   course,   we  have   to   expand   our

universities,  the Polytechnic, Ngee Ann  Technical

College,  and other institutions of higher learning

and technical training, which we are now doing, and

I  shall further elaborate when I deal with the the

Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for middle level skilled personnel, such as

foremen,  craftsmen  and workers  with  specialised

skills,  who  are equally important,  we  have  now

introduced   three   measures.   First,   we    are

implementing  joint  Industry-Government   training

programmes   in   co-operation  with  international

companies  who  are  starting sizable  projects  in

Singapore.  In  such programmes, costs  are  shared

between the Government and the sponsoring firm,  on

condition  that  it will undertake  to  train  more

workers  than  its own requirements,  so  that  the

surplus may be released to upgrade the general pool

of  skills in Singapore. Another condition is  that

the training programme and t he standards of skills

to be achieved are approved by the Government. Such

joint training programmes are valuable not only  in

supplementing the instructors and facilities in the

regular educational system. Even more, they help to

ensure  a much greater realism and practical  value

in the content of courses. For the firms concerned,

such programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



have  the  advantage of  being  much  more

closely geared to their specific requirements,  and

also ensure them the requisite skilled manpower  at

reasonable  cost.  Secondly,  we  will  also   give

similar  encouragement and support  to  the  longer

established  firms  in  Singapore  which  have  the

capability   and   readiness  to  introduce   joint

training  programmes along the same lines. Thirdly,

we are intensifying the programme whereby firms are

supported in sending trainees abroad to the  parent

plants.  Such trainees have already been placed  in

West   Germany,   Switzerland,  Japan   and   other

countries.  Here  again, the  Government  shoulders

part of the costs, provided the training programmes

meet  agreed skill standards and will provide  more

trained  workers than the firm's own  requirements.

In  this connection, the Economic Development Board

is   directing  its  efforts  towards  placing  the

trainees not only in firms which have already  made

commitments in manufacturing projects in Singapore,

but  also  in  those firms which have Singapore  in

mind   as  a  location  for  their  future   global

development programme. The response from both these

kinds of firms is most encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the implementation of these

crash    programmes   will   require   considerable

financial  support  from the Government.  For  this

purpose, I propose to use part of the revenue  from

payroll  tax.  I shall refer to this again  when  I

come to the Revenue Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps more important than financial support,

the  success  of all these programmes depends  upon

careful  pre-selection of the trainees. Appropriate

tests  will be given to ensure that they  not  only

have  adequate educational standards but also  have

suitable  mechanical aptitudes to benefit from  the

specific training programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these efforts, we should be able not only to

meet  the immediate requirements of existing  firms

but,  more  important, in the  next  two  to  three

years,  they  would provide the necessary  pool  of

skilled manpower by which we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



derive the maximum benefits from the more demanding

operations  that are being set up, and also  ensure

continuing  success  in the  promotion  of  further

projects      of      progressively      increasing

sophistication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any assessment of our future prospects must give

due  weight  to  developments of our  other  growth

sector -tourism. By the end of this decade, tourist

and  passenger  traffic at Paya Lebar International

Airport will have doubled itself twice in the  ten-year period. Investments for further development of

the Airport are necessary and have been authorised.

With  the  advent of the airbus and other types  of

larger  and  faster  passenger  aircraft,  new  and

sophisticated  air  control and  air  communication

facilities  will  be  required.  Work  has  already

commenced  on  improvements  to  the  present   air

terminal   building.  The  first  stages   of   the

development  and extension of the  runway  are  now

being  implemented. External sources of funds  have

been sought from the Asian Development Bank to help

in this development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tourists arrive, a good proportion I

hope  by M.S.A, planes, they will want to know what

there  is  to  see  in Singapore. The  considerable

attractions  of our shops, hotels and  restaurants,

our  garden  city  atmosphere and  our  interesting

mixture  of races with their different customs  and

exotic cuisines, will delight many tourists, but we

must  cater for all other tastes as well.  We  have

already  in operation the Bird Park in Jurong,  but

we should shortly have Chinese and Japanese gardens

also  in Jurong, a zoo in Seletar, a Marineland  or

Aquarama in Bedok, and cable cars from Mount  Faber

to Sentosa, where other facilities for tourists are

being planned. A team of international consultants,

Messrs.   Dillingham  Overseas   Corporation,   was

appointed to study the development of Sentosa  into

a  tourist centre. Their report, which recommends a

comprehensive and far-reaching plan for public  and

private  investment  in the island,  is  now  under

study. Two projects recommended by them, an 18-hole

Golf Course and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



Swimming-Boating    Lagoon,    are    now     under

construction. The total investment involved  is  in

the region of $300 million to $400 million. Because

of  the major part the Government will have to play

in initiating the plan, the details have to be very

fully  examined  and assessed. On  the  whole,  the

report  is optimistic that Sentosa can be developed

into  an  attractive and profitable tourist  centre

with   consequent  benefits  to  the   economy   of

Singapore,  particularly foreign exchange  to  help

even out the deficit in our trade balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these facilities and with the number of

hotels  already in operation and in the last stages

of  completion, we are in an excellent position  to

take  advantage  of the growth in tourist  traffic.

But  if  the  progress  is  to  continue,  tourists

arriving  at  the  Airport,  the  harbour  and   at

Woodlands  must meet with nothing but courtesy  and

efficiency.  They must be treated by  taxi-drivers,

hotel receptionists, porters and workers in hotels,

restaurants  and  shops in a friendly,  polite  and

efficient  manner and the standard  of  cleanliness

must  be  high.  The  cuisine  must  be  excellent,

particularly in the exotic Asian dishes. Efforts by

our Tourist Promotion Board for the maintenance  of

these   standards  and  for  other  promotion   are

continuing,   including  increasing   our   tourist

attractions with historical sites, which have  been

given  some publicity in the press recently. But  a

more direct and more business-like effort would  be

that  which  is  being  seriously  considered,   of

developing    Singapore   into   a    centre    for

international    conventions    and    conferences.

Singapore is ideally situated for this purpose, and

the   availability   of  first-class   hotels   and

convention  facilities and an efficient network  of

telecommunications  are added advantages.  We  have

the    necessary   experience   to   organise   big

international   conferences  like  the   E.C.A.F.E.

Plenary Session in 1969 and the Commonwealth  Heads

of   State   Conference  in  January   this   year.

Preparation  for the Annual Meeting  of  the  Asian

Development  Bank in April this year is  now  under

way. What is now needed is an intensive and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



sustained  international promotion  drive  and  the

setting up of a convention servicing unit to handle

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our tourist industry develops as we hope, it

will  not  be  at  the expense of our  neighbouring

countries.  I mentioned earlier in my  speech  that

Expo  `70  had  indirectly  increased  our  tourist

inflow  in 1970. Similarly, any increase in tourist

traffic  to one country in the region can  only  be

beneficial to others in that region. The full scope

for  regional co-operation in promotion of  tourism

is  being  studied  by A.S.E.A.N.  (Association  of

South-east  Asian Nations). Immediate  arrangements

can,  however,  be made to organise  more  regional

tours   on   a  package  basis  and  I   hope   our

entrepreneurs in the tourist industry will get down

to doing this in a big way with other entrepreneurs

in other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to summarise this part of my budget statement, all-out efforts will be made domestically to achieve once again the high growth rate of the preceding years, with emphasis on developments in the sectors of trade, manufacturing and tourism. Our success or failure will depend on

our efforts, although external factors, outside our

control,  particularly in their  effects  upon  the

trade  sector,  can  upset  our  best  plans.   Our

economic  strategy for further diversification,  of

markets  as well as of industrial products, should

help  to  reduce our vulnerability to such  adverse

factors.



<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, 1971-72</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the essential, if more mundane part

of  today's business, the Estimates of Revenue  and

Expenditure for the financial year 1971-72, The two

Memoranda*  which

Members already have, one  on  the

Ordinary Estimates and the other on the Development

Estimates, give the reasons for the major  changes

in the provision and allocation of funds as well as

the forecasts on the basis of existing taxation  of

revenue  yields  in the next financial  year.  They

also contain information on revenue and expenditure



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*Papers Parl. Misc. 1 and 2 of 1971)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



performances   in   1970.   As   detailed

explanations  in these documents are  available  to

Members,  I  do  not propose `to  go  into  a  very

detailed  commentary on the Estimates. I need  only

set  out  the  policy framework  within  which  the

Government has drawn up the budget for 1971-72  and

highlight some of the noteworthy items in both  the

Ordinary and Development Estimates.



<br><br><i>Estimates of Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision proposed for 1971-72 is

$1,306.8  million which is 25.5 per cent more  than

the  1970-71 provision but 28.1 per cent higher  if

compared  with  actual  expenditure  in  1970.  The

expenditure  in  1970 was in  turn  35.1  per  cent

higher than `that in

1969.   Therefore,  the  increased  provision   for

1971-72 is not exceptionally high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the policies adopted this year are the

same  as  those which determined `the last  budget.

The building-up of our defence capability maintains

topmost priority. However, there is a limit to what

we  can  afford even in the initial years of  rapid

build-up  from zero capability. It is desirable  to

peg the provision for defence needs to no more than

10  per  cent  of our Gross Domestic  Product.  The

provisional estimate of Gross Domestic  Product  at

Factor  Cost  for  1970  is $5,564  million.  Total

provision for defence purposes in the Ordinary  and

Development  Estimates is $530.0 million  which  is

9.5  per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.  This,

however,  does not take into account  some  of  the

provisions  available  to  the  Ministry  of   Home

Affairs  which  definitely  are  complementary   to

defence needs but are not readily apportionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other provisions in the Ordinary

Estimates, as in the last few years, care continues

to  be  exercised  over the expenditure  on  social

services. The provision for this group of  services

is  increased by 7.6 per cent. For 1971-72,  health

services are allowed the highest increase  at  12.0

per  cent. Even this figure is understated in  that

the provisions for the new Alexandra and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



Sembawang Hospitals are meant for eight and nine

months  respectively. Expenditure on  education  is

increased by 9.8 per cent. The health and education

services  together take up 84.2  per  cent  of  the

total provision for social services as against 82.0

per cent in 1970-71.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consonance with our economic growth policy,

adequate  provision has been made for all  economic

services  as  these help not only to  maintain  but

also  to  increase the momentum of growth. Next  to

defence and internal security, economic services as

a group have been allowed the most rapid expansion.

The total provision for this group for 1971- 72  is

20.5    per   cent   higher   than   for   1970-71.

Transportation  and communications claim  41.1  per

cent  of the provision as against 38.4 per cent  in 1970-71.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory expenditure is 11.6 per cent more than

in  1970-71, mainly because of additional  interest

payments and contributions to sinking funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the major changes in the provisions under

each  Ministry. The Prime Minister's Ministry needs

a   smaller  provision  because  the  Public  Works

Department  and  Public Health Division  will  take

over  the maintenance of public health in the areas

taken  over  from  the  British  authorities.  This

decrease  is partly offset by additional provisions

required  for the new Anti-Pollution Unit which  is

now   properly  established  and  geared  to  begin

operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology requires

more funds mainly because

of  the promotional activities to be undertaken  by

the newly-appointed Metrication Board. Actually the

provision  in  respect of this Ministry  is  higher

than  is apparent because the contribution  to  the

Science  Centre Board which, prior to the formation

of  the Board, took the form of "Staff and expenses

of  the Popular Science Centre", is now shown under

the Contributions and Charitable Allowances Head of

Expenditure.



The  Ministry of Defence is now shown as a separate

Head  of  Expenditure in the 1971-72 Estimates  and

the  provisions  are  not readily  comparable  with

those shown under the former Ministry of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



Interior  and  Defence Head of Expenditure.  Whilst

the  Armed Forces will continue to be built up, the

Ministry  will  be  concentrating  increasingly  on

consolidation. Three of the Deputy Secretary  posts

are upgraded and two new units are established. One

of  these is the Direction of Employment Department

established to enforce provisions of the  Direction

of  Employment Ordinance. However, because  of  the

rapidly    expanding   employment    opportunities,

applications from employers for exemption from  the

provisions  of  this Ordinance are freely  granted.

The other is the Science and Management Group which

will provide the technical and managerial expertise

in  the Ministry for dealing with such problems  as

evaluation  of  weapons systems, implementation  of

contracts, etc. In view of the very large  sums  of

money which are being spent on defence, any greater

scientific  or economic precision on evaluation  of

military   expenditures  should  result   in   very

considerable  savings. Also, a number  of  civilian

posts  at artisan, craftsman and technician  levels

are   provided   to   give  the  Ministry   greater

flexibility in recruiting supporting staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block provision for "Armed Forces" is $354

million as compared with $208 million in 1970-71.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a decrease of $171,940 in the overall

provision for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This

is  largely  achieved through closer estimation  of

the  resources likely to be needed by the Ministry.

The  creation  of  32 new posts  for  the  Ministry

headquarters   and   Overseas   Missions,    annual

increment   of  salaries  and  increases   in   the

provision  of  Overseas  and Children's  Allowances

require  an  additional  half  a  million  dollars.

However,  a  more  realistic  estimation  of  funds

required based on past expenditure on Special Make-up  Allowances,  emoluments of officers  on  leave,

etc., passage and miscellaneous expenses result  in

a net decrease in the total provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in overall provision under the

Ministry of Labour of 3.5 per cent should be viewed

in the light that expenditure on the Hotel Training

School now comes within the purview



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



of   the  Technical  Education  Department  of  the

Ministry  of  Education. The main  factor  for  the

increase in the overall provision for this Ministry

is the strengthening of the Factory Inspectorate to

curb the rise in industrial accidents. Thirty posts

had  to  be created urgently under an Establishment

Warrant in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As may be expected in view of its importance to

economic     development,    the    Ministry     of

Communications is given a significant  increase  in

provision.  The Ministry headquarters is  given  12

new   posts,  mainly  in  the  Administrative   and

Executive  grades,  so that the  Ministry  can  co-ordinate  as  well  as  guide  its  ever  expanding

departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Department has not only to

expand and improve facilities at Paya Lebar Airport

but  also  to manage Seletar Aerodrome. It  has  to

prepare for the taking over of Changi Aerodrome and

provide fire-fighting services at Tengah Aerodrome.

At the same time, it is necessary to train Aircraft

Surveyors as aircraft registration work will be  of

increasing importance in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Department has also experienced a

tremendous increase in workload over the  last  few

years.   This   department  requires  more   postal

Clerical Assistants and postmen to maintain a  high

standard  of  service. For 1971-72, a total  of  98

additional posts will be available. Funds  have  to

be  provided  for  the department to  progressively

clear   accumulated  liabilities  in   respect   of

transport and freight of postal articles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Telecommunications Department will be making

preparations to become a corporation by April 1972.

During  1971-72,  the department  needs  additional

administrative staff to ensure that the  transition

will  be smooth. At the same time, additional staff

are   required   in   the  development,   planning,

engineering, maintenance and operation sections, so

that  even as the department is undergoing a  major

reorganisation, it will be able to  cope  with  the

rapidly increasing work-load.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Vehicles will also have a heavy

programme in reorganising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



the  road transportation system. The Registry  will

mainly  depend on the new Enforcement Unit and  the

strengthened  Investigation Unit to carry  out  its

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education gets an increase of 9.8

per  cent  in  total provision. Over the  last  two

years,  there  has  been  a major  reallocation  of

resources from general to technical education. This

will  continue  in 1971 - 72 although  we  are  now

approaching   the   limits   within   which    such

reallocation may be made. For 1971 - 72,  a  number

of  not  insignificant adjustments are made to  the

teacher  posts. The main objective is to  cut  down

the  number  of non-graduate teachers and  increase

the number of graduate teachers in order to step up

the  general  standard  of  teaching  in  secondary

schools. A sizable number of supernumerary posts is

also   provided  and  these  will  be  reduced   as

vacancies  arise so that the number of non-graduate

teachers  bears  a  closer  relationship   to   the

enrolment   in  the  primary  and  lower  secondary

classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase given to the Ministry of Education

is  not  entirely for schools. Grants  to  the  two

Universities, the Singapore Polytechnic,  Ngee  Ann

College  and  aided  schools account  for  about  a

quarter of the increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is given additional posts

for  the National and Queenstown Libraries and  the

new Anti-Smoking Advertisement Unit. The Government

Printing  Office  will increasingly  operate  as  a

commercial  organisation and eight  new  posts  are

given for this. The Government Printing Office  has

been   very   successful  in  securing  jobs   from

statutory   bodies   and   commercial   firms   and

consequently  it  is given a larger  provision  for

printing supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Social Affairs, the amounts

required  by  the  Social  Welfare  Department  for

public   assistance   and  Tuberculosis   treatment

allowances  in  1971  -  72 are  expected  to  drop

following  the  trend in recent  years.  Also,  the

Sports Division and Stadiums and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



Pools  Division  of  the Ministry  have  ceased  to

function with the formation of the National  Sports

Promotion  Board. The Prisons Department,  however,

requires  more funds but these are mainly  for  the

Prisons  Industries and for bread-making at  Changi

Prison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development gets

a  fairly big increase of 18.6 per cent mainly  for

the  National Development Division and  the  Public

Works  Department.  Under the National  Development

Division,  $1.6  million is for the  administration

expenses of the Urban Renewal Department for  which

provision   was   made,  it  is   considered   less

appropriately,  in  the  Development  Estimates  in

previous  years.  The Public Works Department  will

take  over  responsibility for the  maintenance  of

buildings  and  installations handed  over  to  the

Government by the British authorities. It has taken

over  the  maintenance of all roads in  the  Jurong

Town  Corporation's estates, the Toa Payoh New Town

and  some  new  private housing  estates.  It  will

maintain  catchment  drains and  canals  previously

looked after by the Ministry of Health. Its own new

sewerage pumping stations and treatment works  will

be  coming into operation. For these and other  new

activities,  the  department  requires   additional

funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is also given a

substantial increase. Part of the increase  is  due

to  the  impending  takeover of the  Alexandra  and

Sembawang  Hospitals  from  the  British.  However,

existing  hospitals are given a total  of  445  new

posts  and larger provisions for equipment so  that

patients  will get a higher standard  of  treatment

and  doctors  will  be able to  work  under  better

conditions. For the Public Health Division, 157 new

posts  are provided, with the largest single  share

for  the  School Health Branch. This Division  also

requires additional funds to pay for public utility

services  and to extend public cleansing and  anti-mosquito  measures to areas which  will  be  handed

over to the Government by the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has an increase in

provision of $39.7 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



Considering, however, that the allocation  to  the

Development  Fund  alone  has  increased  by   $40

million,  there  is a net decrease  in  the  other

provisions  under this Ministry. This  is  largely

due to the fact that a number of units such as the

Overseas Investment Section, Banking Control  Unit

and the Office of the Commissioner of Banking have

been  transferred  to  the Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore.  These  are  to  some  extent  counter-balanced  by  new  posts  for  engineers   to   be

recruited  from  abroad for  assignment  to  other

Ministries,  posts for the new Career  Development

and Training Section and other posts to strengthen

the Organisation and Methods Branch as well as the

Central  Supplies  Unit.  A  smaller  subsidy   is

expected  to  be  required  by  the  Housing   and

Development Board but this decrease is  more  than

offset  by  a  new  subsidy for  the  building  of

standard cargo vessels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departments under this Ministry which are

given  substantial  increases  in  staff  are  the

Inland Revenue and Customs Departments. The Inland

Revenue Department has a net increase of 41  posts

to   enable  it  to  reorganise  its  Income   Tax

Division.  The  Customs Department  gets  116  new

posts to man new points such as the Naval Base and

Seletar  Aerodrome, new units  such  as  the  Cess

Collection Unit and the Motor Assembly Plant Base,

and  to reinforce the personnel at the Central Sea

Stores  Warehouse, the Dutiable  Parcels  Section,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Ministry of Home Affairs is given

adequate funds to pay for 329 new posts which  are

necessary  to  support the reorganisation  of  the

Police.  Additionally, $875,000  is  provided  for

radio  patrol  cars, stand-by engines  for  Marine

Police  launches, uniforms and training  equipment

for Police Cadet Corps in schools. The Immigration

Department   gets  67  new  posts   to   man   new

checkpoints  as  well as to cover existing  check-points more adequately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes a quick survey of the Ordinary

Estimates.  I  will now deal with the  Development

Estimates for 1971.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Development Estimates

provide  for  a  total  of $635.9  million,  after

pruning.  The total proposals submitted  were  for

$849.85  million. It has been possible to allocate

to  the  social  sector 39.5 per cent,  or  $61.74

million,  of  their requests, while  the  economic

sector has been allocated 68.3 per cent or $114.06

million.  Defence and Administration,  because  of

over-riding considerations, receive 93.92 per cent

approval,  or $111.61 million requirements.  Loans

to  statutory  bodies  and  companies  will  total

$348.55  million,  after  reduction  from  $407.55

million.  Tables  IX, IXA and  IXB  show  how  the

Development Estimates provision of $635.9  million

is distributed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, a large part of the expenditure

on Government development projects is allocated to

the  Ministry of Law and National Development. Out

of the total budgetted provision of $287.5 million

for  Government, this Ministry will receive  $96.4

million  most  of  which will  be  for  the  major

schemes  of land reclamation administered  by  the

Ministry  at the East Coast Reclamation. Phases  I

and  II  of this scheme, totalling 1,125 acres  of

reclaimed  land,  are almost completed.  Two  more

phases will be carried out in 1971 - 72. Phase III

will  provide  165 acres of land  fronting  Nicoll

Highway, and Phase IV will provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



another  1,025 acres of land stretching from  Bedok

to  Tanah  Merah Besar. The two phases are expected

to  cost  a  total of $67.8 million of which  $16.8

million is required in 1971 - 72. At Kallang Basin,

reclamation  will continue. A total  of  400  acres

have  so  far  been reclaimed and in 1971  -  72  a

further  92 acres will be reclaimed, A sum of  $2.1

million   is   needed   for   such   works.   These

reclamations  will  enable us to  redevelop  a  sea

front which gives maximum use by the people of  the

sea and maintains the highest aesthetic skyline for

Singapore,  avoiding the mistakes of  past  private

and public developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very worthy project is that of urban

renewal which has been gathering momentum over  the

past  year,  and for which $13.1 million  has  been

provided.  Redevelopment  of  the  Crawford,  Sepoy

Lines   and   Havelock  constituencies  is   almost

completed  and  attention has now  moved  to  other

parts  of  the Central Area. An additional  sum  of

$4.2  million  is  required  to  meet  resettlement

expenses  of the Resettlement Department on  behalf

of the Government and statutory authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Botanic Gardens, which has proved to be a

popular attraction for both tourists and the  local

population  will  require $400,000 for  improvement

works to be carried out. To provide more fertiliser

for  the "Garden City" campaign, it is proposed  to

establish  a  refuse composting  plant  to  convert

refuse  into compost which is recognised as a  good

soil fertiliser. The plant is expected to cost $1.5

million of which $500,000 is required in 1971 - 72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $1.5 million is provided for general

development  works undertaken by the  Public  Works

Department.  The  works include major  construction

and  renovation of various Government buildings and

the  provision of more modern facilities for  these

buildings.  The  "Garden  City"  campaign  will  be

stepped  up with the provision of $4.8 million  for

various   new   park  schemes  as   well   as   for

improvements to existing parks and open  spaces.  A

sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



$300,000  will be spent on vehicles to  enable  the

Parks  and Trees Division to execute its work  more

efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on roads and bridges is expected to

amount to $14.2 million.. The major project in hand

is  the  Pan-Island Expressway.  Work  on  various;

sections  of  this Expressway is being carried  out

simultaneously.   By  1973,  the  Expressway   will

provide  rapid access between the eastern  (Changi)

and  the  western (Jurong) parts of  the  Republic.

Work  on several one-way road systems will also  be

continued  in 1971-72. These systems are  aimed  at

relieving traffic congestion in the city.  Drainage

and   flood  alleviation  schemes  will  cost  $4.5

million.  The  next fiscal year  will  witness  the

completion  of the first phase of the  Bukit  Timah

Flood Alleviation Scheme, in which storm water from

the Upper Bukit Timah Catchment will be diverted to

Sungei  Ulu  Pandan and thus alleviate flooding  in

the  area. The Bukit Timah Canal, along which earth

slips  have occurred, will be concrete-lined  at  a

total cost of $1.9 million of which $1.4 million is

required  in 1971-72. Several new drainage  schemes

will  be  initiated  in various  densely  populated

areas  and  new  housing  estates.  These  include'

Geylang  Serai,  Toa Payoh and  Telok  Blangah  New

`Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sewerage development works will require $14.2

million.   Most  of  the  sewerage   projects   are

continuing  schemes. However, two new  schemes  are

expected  to  be  implemented in 1971-72  in  Telok

Blangah New Town and at the East Coast Reclamation.

These  sewerage  schemes will provide  one  of  the

infrastructural  services for  the  development  of

these two sites into recreational, residential  and

commercial  complexes. The treatment works  at  Kim

Chuan  and  Ulu  Pandan require a  total  of  $1.6.

million  for  urgent  extensions.  When  these  are

completed,  the two treatment plants  will  have  a

combined capacity to serve 1.35 million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $1.93 million provided for Primary

Production,  $1.07 million is required  for  Animal

Husbandry  projects.  This  includes  $500,000   as

Singapore's contribution to the United Nations Pig



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



and Poultry Training and Research Institute as well

as  $40,000  for  the  proposed  Swine  Brucellosis

Eradication Pilot Scheme. The proposed expansion of

Jurong  Fishing  Port and Fish Market  to  increase

both  the  port and market facilities will  require

$200,000.  The existing Fishing Training  Institute

and  the South-east Asia Fisheries Research  Centre

at   Changi   will  need  $138,600  for  additional

facilities.   Among   agricultural   projects,   an

Agricultural Statistics Unit will be set  up  at  a

cost  of  $150,000. The Unit will carry out  census

and surveys on primary production in Singapore. The

Factory   Farming  Pilot  Scheme,  the  Hydroponics

Farming  Scheme and the Intensive Farm  Improvement

Schemes  are  all  continuing  projects  for  which

$201,600  will  be provided. A sum of  $205,000  is

also  required for the acquisition and  preparation

of land for the expansion of the Sembawang Research

Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence will need $100 million,

mostly   for   works   and   buildings   and   land

acquisition,  to, accommodate the expanded  defence

units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications is allocated a

total   provision   of  $29.2   million   for   the

development   of  facilities  in  civil   aviation,

telecommunications,   postal   and   meteorological

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development in Civil Aviation will require an

estimated   sum  of  $14.6  million.   Intermediate

airport  development proposals at a total  cost  of

$106.2  million  will  be  implemented  to  provide

additional  facilities at Paya Lebar  International

Airport.  These  proposals,  for  which  an   Asian

Development  Bank loan of $62.10 million  has  been

obtained, will be implemented over a period of five

years  and  will  include a new passenger  terminal

building  with additional parking aprons, a  modern

freight terminal and a hangar large enough to  take

in  aircraft like the Boeing 747s. The runway  will

be  extended  from the existing  I  1,000  feet  to

13,200  feet. Advanced navigational aids, including

radar  equipment, will be installed at the Airport.

The fire services will also be upgraded to meet the

highest international



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



standards.  An amount of  $7.5  million  is

required  to  get  these projects off  the  ground.

Meanwhile,   existing  facilities  at  Paya   Lebar

Airport will be improved to meet immediate demands.

The  present  passenger terminal,  which  is  being

redeveloped  at  a  cost of $6.4 million,  will  be

completed by September 1971. The improved  terminal

building  will  be  able  to  cope  with  passenger

traffic  generated by the larger jets.  Improvement

to  the  parking  aprons and  taxi-ways  is  to  be

completed   by  June  1971.  With  these  immediate

improvements, Paya Lebar Airport will  be  able  to

handle  the  increasing air  traffic  growth  until

1975-76 when the intermediate development proposals

are scheduled to be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the telecommunications projects, a major

scheme  which will be completed this  year  is  the

Earth  Satellite Station at Sentosa. A sum of  $5.6

million is required for work to be completed. A sum

of $3.2 million will be spent on telex development.

These include the purchase of more teleprinters and

ancillary  equipment. To catch up  with  the  heavy

demands  for these services, the national automatic

telex  exchange will provide a total of 1.200 lines

by mid-1972, while the international semi-automatic

telex   exchange  will  have  a  capacity  of   150

channels.  To serve the needs of the off-shore  oil

industry, $400.00() will be spent to purchase radio

transmitting   and  receiving  equipment.   As   in

previous  years, contribution will be continued  to

be  made  to  international projects  such  as  the

SEACOM   (South-east  Asia  Communications   Cable)

project  and  the  International Telecommunications

Satellite  Consortium. The total cost of  providing

all these telecommunication services is expected to

be $12.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other proposals under the Ministry of

Communications include the setting up of the  Motor

Vehicle  Inspection Centre at  Sin  Ming  Road  off

Upper Thomson Road, for which $800,000 is required.

The new Mass Transit Planning Unit to be set up for

further  investigation into the  feasibility  of  a

mass rapid transit system for Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



requires  a  sum  of $500,000. The  study  will  be

carried   out   with   U.N.D.P.   (United   Nations

Development Programme) assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will be provided with

$27.17  million $8.97 million for General Education

and   $18.20   million  for  Technical   Education.

Expenditure  on academic education involves  mainly

continuing projects. The new Raffles Institution at

Grange Road, which is provided with a sum of  $2.85

million, will be completed by the end of 1971. With

the    resiting   of   Raffles   Institution,   the

development  of its existing site for the  proposed

Raffles   International  Centre  is   expected   to

commence in early 1972. Another junior college will

be  erected on a 15-acre site on the reclaimed land

at  Siglap. For the initial works on this  College,

$500,000  is  provided. A  sum  of  $1  million  is

required   as  Government  contribution   for   the

construction  of other junior colleges  planned  by

private organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For technical education, a sum of $5.41 million

is  provided  for  the further development  of  the

vocational  institutes, a technical  institute  and

workshops   in  secondary  schools.  The   proposed

Singapore  Technical Institute  will  require  $1.8

million.  This  institute, situated  in  MacPherson

Housing Estate, is expected to be completed towards

the  end of 1971 and will have facilities to  train

craft-technicians  for  Singapore.   The   proposed

building  will  also house the Technical  Teachers'

Training Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis on technical education will be extended

to  the  institutions of higher learning. Provision

of $1.60 million is' being made for the purchase of

equipment  for  the  Faculties of  Engineering  and

Architecture  and  Building at  the  University  of

Singapore. Expansion and resiting of the  Singapore

Polytechnic  at Dover Road is now under  way.  This

new  campus,  on  completion by  1973  -  74,  will

provide for an enrolment of up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



10,000  students.  An amount  of  $6.0  million  is

provided for this development in 1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of Ngee Ann Technical College will

take place during the next three to four years. The

whole expansion for which an Asian Development Bank

loan   has  been  obtained  will  cost  some  $10.5

million. It will increase the enrolment capacity to

3,000  students. A sum of $2.2 million is  required

in  1971--72 for this expansion. An additional  sum

of   $468,000  is  provided  for  the  purchase  of

equipment   for  the  Mechanical  Engineering   and

Industrial Electronics Departments of the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $1.25 million is required for the

completion  of  the  Hotel  and  Catering  Training

Centre.  The  proposed  centre,  which  will   also

accommodate a hotel to be opened in 1971, will turn

out some 1,000 trained personnel a year to meet the

acute demand for hotel and catering workers in  the

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will spend $2.1 million

for  hospital  services. The major project  is  the

development of specialist units. This is a  follow-up  of  the  Report  by  the Committee  on  Medical

Specialisation.  A  sum of  $1.0  million  will  be

required  for  building facilities  and  equipment.

Other  new  projects include the proposed  plan  to

centralise the kitchen and the Sterile Supply, Unit

at   Outram   Road   General   Hospital   and   the

establishment  of  a  rehabilitation   centre   for

paraplegics  and  hemiplegics  at  Tan  Tock   Seng

Hospital.  A  total of $400,000 will  be  spent  on

improvement of wards and other services in  various

hospitals and clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Health Services will require $1.5

million to purchase more refuse collection vehicles

to  improve  the public cleansing service.  Another

$300,000 will be spent to complete works on  a  new

Environmental  Health Depot for the  Eastern  Urban

Division.  The  new  depot will  house  the  Public

Cleansing and Vector Control Services vehicles. The

present   dental  clinic  at  Outram  Road  General

Hospital  is to be extended to provide more  space,

and three dental clinics are proposed at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



various  areas  to meet the increasing  demand  for

dental treatment for outpatients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture, which is responsible for

the  Department  of  Broadcasting,  the  Government

Printing  Office and the Library Services, requires

$3.4  million. A provision of $1.7 million  is  for

the new Radio Studio and Offices Building, work  on

which  is  expected to commence in June 1971.  When

completed in early 1973, the building will  replace

the  series of old buildings presently occupied  by

the   Radio   Section   of   the   Department    of

Broadcasting. A sum of $153,300 will  be  spent  to

install   modern   fire-prevention   equipment   at

Caldecott  Hill  T.V.  Centre  and  several   other

transmitting  stations.  The  Government   Printing

Department  requires $95,300 for  the  purchase  of

printing machinery which will increase its printing

capacity as well as inject greater efficiency  into

the  Department. As a result of shortage of storage

space,   the  shelving  capacity  of  the  National

Library will be enlarged at a cost of $300,000.  It

is also proposed to build a library at Toa Payoh to

cater  for  the  large number  of  people  in  this

densely built-up area and $400,000 is provided  for

work to start in 1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the projects to be undertaken by the Ministry

of  Home  Affairs  are  new  ones  except  for  the

proposed  improvement  to  the  Police  Academy  at

Thomson  Road, for which $770,000 is  provided  for

its   completion.   Among  the  new   projects,   a

Divisional  Headquarters will be  built  at  Grange

Road to replace the existing one at the junction of

Orchard  Road and Paterson Road. Another  important

project  expected to be implemented in  1971-72  is

the  purchase of additional vehicles and  equipment

for  greater operational efficiency of  the  Police

Force.  These  will  include motor  cycles,  patrol

cars,  scooters,  outboard  engines  and  ancillary

communications  equipment. A sum of  $1.50  million

has  been  provided for this. A marine  substation,

estimated  to  cost $445,000, will  be  constructed

near the Jurong Landing Pier to replace the present

substation  at Tanjong Kling which is  affected  by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



Jurong    Town   Corporation's   industrial    land

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Science and Technology, two

important development projects are expected to  get

off  the ground in 1971 - 72: the resiting  of  the

University  of  Singapore at  Kent  Ridge  and  the

proposed  Science Centre in Jurong. The total  cost

of  these two projects is estimated at $100 million

and $9 million respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A University of Singapore Development Unit was

set  up  in  September 1970 to take charge  of  the

planning and designing of the new University campus

at   Kent  Ridge.  This  Unit  has  completed   its

preliminary  studies and plans  for  the  buildings

earmarked  for the first phase of the  development.

It is expected that more groundwork will have to be

undertaken  during  1971 before construction  works

can  commence in early 1972. A sum of $1.24 million

is provided for these preliminary expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Science Centre will be situated on a

10-acre site in Jurong. The centre will be run by a

board  which was formed in 1970. Construction  work

on the centre has not commenced yet but earth works

are  scheduled  to  begin  soon  and  building   is

expected to commence at the end of 1971. A  sum  of

$1.78  million  will be required for  this  purpose

during  1971-72.  The whole project  will  probably

take two years to complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction works on the proposed subordinate

Courts  Building at Havelock Road  is  expected  to

start in mid-1971. The total cost of the project is

estimated at $6.62 million. The building will house

all  existing subordinate Courts which are affected

by road-widening and urban renewal projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Social Affairs is budgetting for

a  total  expenditure  of  $1.01  million  for  the

development of welfare services, prisons  and  fire

brigade services in 1971-72. Before the end of this

year  the Junior Approved School is expected to  be

completed,  part  of  the cost  of  which  will  be

provided under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



the United Kingdom Financial Assistance Scheme. The

original  proposal for an open Prison at Ulu  Bedok

has  been shelved pending the results of a  Colombo

Plan expert's study of the establishment of a penal

institution.  Improvement  to  other  prisons  will

include  the construction of a Cellular  Block  for

Changi  Female  Prison to provide maximum  security

cells  for  female  prisoners who  are  at  present

accommodated  at Changi Remand Prison.  The  Prison

Industries will be provided with a sum of  $250,000

to  purchase additional equipment. A creche will be

built  in the Jurong Industrial Estate for children

of  workers as a means of encouraging more  married

workers  to  live  there. The building  of  a  fire

station  at Jurong to meet the increasing need  for

fire services has been proposed for which a sum  of

$247,100 is provided for works to be carried out in

1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance will require $364.4

million,  of which $150.0 million is for  loans  to

statutory authorities, $198.6 million for loans  to

industrial  and commercial enterprises,  and  $15.8

million    for   various   Government   development

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board, in

implementing  its Third Five-Year  programme,  will

increase  its  target of building  from  13,000  to

20,000  housing  units per annum  by  1975  and  is

expected   in  the  present  budget  to   incur   a

development expenditure of $159.0 million, of which

$100.00  million will be in the form of loans  from

Government.  A loan of $50 million is provided  for

the   Jurong   Town  Corporation  to  finance   its

development projects, including the reclamation  of

swamp  lands east of Jurong River, construction  of

marine  channels and improvements to  Jurong  Port.

More  housing units and other social amenities will

also be provided by the Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the loans provided for industrial and

commercial  enterprises, $96.0 million is  intended

as a further line of credit to the Development Bank

of Singapore. Another loan of $67.9 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



will  be  extended to Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, to

enable the national shipping line to purchase  more

ships  and  tankers. Jurong Shipbuilders  (Private)

Ltd.,   a   joint   venture  with   the   Singapore

Government, Jurong Shipyard (Private) Ltd., and the

Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Ltd., will  be

given  a loan of $20.8 million for its shipbuilding

programmes.  The COMFORT Co-operative,  established

by  the  National Trades Union Congress to  operate

mini-buses and taxis, will be assisted with a  loan

of $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other development projects

administered   by   the   Finance   Ministry,   the

development of the tourist industry will cost $13.5

million,  of which $11.0 million will be  spent  on

providing   tourist  amenities  and  infrastructure

facilities at Sentosa. A sum of $2 million will  be

required  for  works on Jurong Park. An  amount  of

$1.6 million is allocated for various economic  and

technical  feasibility studies,  including  an  air

mapping  survey, and studies on oil pollution  off-shore.



<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the subject of how all the

expenditures  can be financed. In the Estimates  of

Revenue for the next financial year, total receipts

are   expected   to  be  $1,307.2  million,   which

represents  an increase of 10.6 per cent  over  the

actual  receipts  for  1970. All  the  increase  is

expected from the normal growth without any changes

in  existing taxes or the imposition of new  taxes.

While all the major sources of revenue are expected

to  perform  better,  it is  anticipated  that  the

annual  increase may not be as buoyant  as  in  the

last  two years in view of an expected slowing down

of  world  trade  and the massive run-down  of  the

British Armed Forces in the Republic.



<br><br><i>Direct Taxes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four direct taxes, namely income tax,

property  tax,  payroll tax  and  estate  duty  are

expected  to yield $430.8 million, which represents

32.9  per  cent of the total revenue estimates  for

the next financial year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax, which forms a little over done-fifth

of  the  total revenue, is expected to  yield  $280

million.  This  is $28.5 million  higher  than  the

previous  year. As the income tax is based  on  the

previous  year's income, and 1970 has been  a  good

year for the manufacturing, building and commercial

sectors,  the  growth of revenue from  this  source

will be maintained. The administrative capacity  of

the  Inland  Revenue Department has  been  improved

with  recruitments  during the past  year  and  the

operations  of  the Anti-Evasion  Unit  during  the

course of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue from property tax is expected to

increase   by  $16.6  million  to  $124.8  million,

reflecting  the  rapid  ,growth  of  the   building

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate for payroll tax is $17

million.  Here  I have news which employers  should

welcome.  The proceeds of the payroll tax  will  be

used  to  lighten  the burden of employers  in  two

areas.  Firstly,  the  proceeds  will  be  used  to

compensate  employers for the  "make-up"  pay  when

national servicemen are called up for their  annual

training exercises with the Singapore Armed  Forces

and  they  do  not  work  in  their  factories  and

offices.   Secondly,  it  is  proposed   to   allow

reimbursements  to  industrialists   for   approved

training  or apprenticeship schemes in  skills,  of

which there is a critical shortage in the Republic.

Details of the approved schemes will be worked  out

by  the Economic Development Board and the Ministry

of Education.



<br><br><i>Indirect Taxes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate from indirect taxes is

$385.2  million, which represents 29.5 per cent  of

the  total estimated revenue for the next financial

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport sector is expected to yield $16

million  more  next  year than the  previous  year,

consisting  of  $2.8 million from  road  tax,  $3.9

million  from special tax on diesel vehicles,  $2.9

million  from  ad  valorem  registration  fees,  $3

million from petrol, $2.5 million from import duty,

and  $0.9  million from passenger vehicles  seating

fees. The other increases are expected from tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



on Public Utilities Board bills ($2.4 million), tax

on  Singapore Telephone Board bills ($0.9  million)

and Customs duty on sugar ($1.3 million).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates show a decline in the revenue from

Customs  duty on liquors and tobacco,  two  of  the

oldest  sources of revenue. In the case of liquors,

the  expected  decline is due to the  large  stocks

being  available arising from speculative  releases

in  the first quarter and the last quarter of 1970.

If  the  ban  on  advertisements of cigarettes  and

smoking of cigarettes in designated places has  the

expected salutary effects, the revenue from Customs

duty on tobacco will decline.



<br><br><i>Other Sources</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of goods and services by Government

departments   will   yield  $10.1   million   more,

consisting    of    $5.4    million    from     the

Telecommunications Department,  $1.9  million  from

the  Postal Department and $2.8 million from  other

departments.   Regulatory  charges  (administrative

fees)  are  expected to yield $19.1  million  more;

interests and dividends are expected to yield  $9.9

million  more; stamp duty is expected to  yield  $4

million more than last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates show a decline in the revenue from

land  sales and premium by $15.4 million  and  $8.2

million from Japanese Special Aid as compared  with

the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On existing taxation, therefore, the revenue

yield  from  all  these sources  will  be  $1,307.2

million.  Since we have planned for an  expenditure

of  $1,306.8 million on current account, there will

be  a  small  surplus of $0.4 million,  even  after

taking  into  consideration a contribution  of  $80

million to the Development Fund for expenditure  on

development account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates for the financial year

1971  - 72 provide for a total expenditure of  $636

million,   which,  as  Table  VIII  indicates,   is

expected to be financed largely from domestic loans

amounting  to  $250 million. This  is  expected  as

usual to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



come  mainly from the Central Provident  Fund.  The

appropriation   from   current   revenue    already

mentioned   of   $80  million  and   debt   service

repayments  of  $115  million  added  to  the  $250

million  loan  will  together total  $445  million,

leaving a balance of $191 million. Part of this can

come   from  external  loans,  interest  and  other

receipts  totalling  some  $91  million.   If   all

disbursements take up the full provisions, which is

unlikely,  the overall deficit will be  about  $100

million. This can be financed, if necessary, by new

taxation  or  borrowing  or  by  running  down  the

balances  in  the  Development  Fund  which  it  is

estimated will stand at about $500 million  at  the

beginning of the financial year 1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which now remains to be considered

is  whether, on current needs both for ordinary and

development  expenditures, new taxation  or  higher

rates  on existing taxation should be imposed.  The

Government's  policy  of  promoting  fast  economic

development has paid off. Existing tax yields  have

increased  so  that  they have been  sufficient  in

recent   years  to  meet  the  needs  for  ordinary

expenditures. A modest contribution to  development

expenditures has also been possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure requests, however, have

been increasing in size from year to year. Some  of

the needs in the coming years for projects like the

Mass  Rapid Transit System or for renewal of  urban

areas will be for sums beyond anything we have been

accustomed   so  far  to  consider.  The   balances

remaining  in the Development Fund and the  present

sources   for   replenishing  these  balances   are

unlikely to be sufficient to meet all these  future

needs.  Some  of  the  development  projects   are,

however,  self-financing or can assist in producing

better economic returns on other projects. For such

projects, borrowing would be appropriate and public

authorities  or companies concerned could  probably

tap  additional sources of funds such as suppliers'

credits or borrowing in international



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



markets. The Government itself can  borrow

more externally. Singapore's public debt at present

stands at only $1,168 million and sinking funds are

available to offset these by some $438 million. Our

debt  servicing  charges at $181 million  represent

only  13.7  per  cent of our total ordinary  budget

appropriation,  or  3.7  per  cent  of  our   Gross

Domestic   Product.  Our  credit   worthiness   is,

therefore, high. When opportunity occurs,  it  will

be   our   intention   to  float   loans   in   the

international money markets. New taxation or higher

rates on existing taxes appear to be unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1971, therefore, unless tax yields fall very

considerably below our expectations or sudden large

calls  for contingency financing are made,  no  new

measures are being proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, add that from time to time over

the  year,  it  may  still be necessary  to  remove

anomalies  in taxation, improve tax procedures  or,

where   a  case  is  clearly  established,   accord

protection in the earlier stages of industry  being

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
