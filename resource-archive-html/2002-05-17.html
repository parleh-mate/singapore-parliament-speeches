<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P (cont.) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [16th May, 2002],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Assoc. Prof. Chin  Tet

Yung].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, when we

received news about the detention of the Singaporean with Al-Qaeda links by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, it  must

have  shocked many of us.  Many of us asked how is it that  a

Singaporean could have been involved.  It brought home to  us

the  sad  truth that terrorism is a world-wide  scourge  that

spares  no  country,  however small and however  secure.   Of

course,  what  was most reassuring was that our  ISD,  having

received  information from one of its sources  on  the  first

suspected  terrorist, had already been discreetly  monitoring

him  and  those linked to him.  ISD subsequently  detained  a

number of suspects linked to him and briefed the Americans on

this  case  around  mid-December.   It  was  only  after  the

briefing  that the Americans informed ISD that the video-tape

about  targets in Singapore was found.  Fortunately  for  us,

the  people  behind the making of the tape had  already  been

detained  by the time the existence of the tape was disclosed

by  the  Americans.   A potential catastrophe  was  therefore

avoided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, combating terrorism is no longer just a national

security  issue.   It  is  a multi-national  security  issue.

Intelligence  departments have to  work  together  and  share

information  quickly and accurately, if we are  to  have  any

success in avoiding terrorist attacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to read in the Straits Times that there will

be  a meeting of the ASEAN Security Ministers to come up with

an ASEAN-wide counter-terrorist agreement, next week in Kuala

Lumpur.   One of the items on the agenda apparently would  be

to  discuss  how  to  shore  up domestic  laws  to  meet  the

challenges of combating terrorism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange how a catastrophe can change opinions

on   detention  laws.   Before  the  September  11  terrorist

attacks,  many  countries  in the  liberal  world  and  other

liberal  NGOs  criticised the detention  laws,  such  as  the

Internal   Security  Act  and  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Act  as draconian.  Recently, the  US  Attorney-General, John Ashcroft, endorsed Malaysia's Internal Security

Act, which is actually very similar to ours.  Indeed, the  US

now   has  a  Patriot  Act  that  contains  over  a  thousand

provisions,  far  exceeding  the  scope  and  powers  of  the

Internal Security Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that, now, no one would question the need

for  such  legislation as a powerful weapon to fight  against

terrorism.   The  task is to see how we can have  legislation

that  would enable the law enforcement agencies to  do  their

job  well and yet not intrude into the lives of ordinary law-abiding citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister just two

questions.  First, whether Singapore's existing links to, and

the  level  of cooperation with, other intelligence agencies,

especially those in the region, are adequate.  And, secondly,

whether   there  needs  to  be  a  review  of  our   domestic

legislation  to  shore up the powers of the  law  enforcement

agencies to combat terrorism.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,

I  thank  the Members for raising the questions.   They  have

expressed  concern  about the security situation,  and  asked

whether Singapore is prepared for the threat of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first give Members an overview of the security

situation and measures that we have taken to deal with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of terrorism to Singapore is not a new one.

We  have  had  our brush with terrorist groups in  the  past.

But,  in all these incidents, the involvement of Singaporeans

was  minimal.   In  contrast,  the  recent  Jemaah  Islamiyah

episode  saw  the participation of Singaporeans in  terrorist

plans which, had they succeeded,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



would have resulted in significant loss of lives.  Mr Tan Soo

Khoon and other Members have commented on this too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group so

different  from the previous groups?  At the  risk  of  over-simplification, what has made the difference is impact of the

Al-Qaeda.  It was the exposure of Jemaah Islamiyah leaders to

the  jihad  in  Afghanistan and to  Al-Qaeda  training  which

radicalised   them,   not   only   by   imbibing   Al-Qaeda's

sophisticated terrorist tradecraft, but also its ideology  of

global jihad.  Ibrahim Maidin, the Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah

leader, understood the importance of this Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda  exposure, and went to considerable lengths  to  ensure

that a flow of selected Jemaah Islamiyah cadres were sent  to

Afghanistan.  That the Jemaah Islamiyah subscribed to the Al-Qaeda's  global  jihad agenda is obvious.   For  even  as  it

maintained  its  own vision of, first, an Islamic  Indonesia,

and later an expanded vision of an Islamic nusantara (meaning

Malay   Archipelago)  comprising  Malaysia,   Indonesia   and

Mindanao, Jemaah Islamiyah members were ready to take part in

the  Al-Qaeda's global terrorist war against those  whom  Al-Qaeda deemed as the enemies of Islam, namely the Americans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in 1997, nearly four years before the September

11,  2001  attacks, Singapore's Jemaah Islamiyah members  had

themselves  conceived  of a plan to attack  the  shuttle  bus

conveying  American personnel to Yishun MRT.  This  plan  was

submitted to, and was approved, by the Al-Qaeda leaders,  but

for  reasons  unknown,  was not subsequently  pursued.   Then

again   in  October  2001,  when  an  Arab-Canadian  Al-Qaeda

operative approached the Jemaah Islamiyah for help to  launch

multiple  truck  bomb  attacks against US-linked  targets  in

Singapore, the local Jemaah Islamiyah cell readily acceded to

this  request.   Had  they not been stopped  in  time,  these

attacks  would have no doubt occurred.  In fact,  even  after

they   learned  of  the  arrests  by  the  Internal  Security

Department, the Jemaah Islamiyah leaders met in Johore a  few

days later and instructed the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



Jemaah  Islamiyah  members to continue with  the  attacks  in

retaliation  of  the  arrests.  To this end,  the  Indonesian

Jemaah Islamiyah bomb maker, Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi, who  was

called "Mike", was about to buy 4.8 tonnes of TNT when he was

arrested  by Filipino Police following intelligence from  the

ISD.  At the time of his arrest, he had already acquired  and

stashed  away  1.2 tonnes of TNT, 2,400 metres  of  detonator

cord  and  hundreds of detonator caps destined to be smuggled

from Mindanao to Indonesia, then to Malaysia and, finally, to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terrorist challenge that Singapore and the rest

of  the  world are facing today is like nothing we have  ever

encountered  before.  Terrorism is not a new phenomenon.   It

is an old scourge which has plagued many countries throughout

the  world since even the turn of the 20th century.  But most

of  these  terrorist  groups were generally  local  in  their

agenda  and  their  operations.   These  would  include,  for

example,  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri  Lanka,

the  Irish  Republican Army in the UK, the Basque Separatists

in  Spain  or even the Shining Path of Peru in South America.

In our region, until recent years when links were established

with  external groups, we have the Abu Sayyaf  and  the  Moro

Islamic  Liberation Front in the Philippines.   All  of  them

mounted  terrorist  operations mainly in their  own  national

domains.   The Al-Qaeda however is a trans-national terrorist

organisation with sleeper cells all over the world.   It  has

operational reach anywhere in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Al-Qaeda is, of course, not the first of its kind in

this  regard.  There were terrorist organisations which  also

operated internationally.  Members of the Japanese Red  Army,

for  example, came all the way to Singapore to mount the Laju

incident  in  1974.  What makes the Al-Qaeda  unique  is  its

ability   to   successfully  franchise  and  indigenise   its

terrorist   expertise  and  ideological   agenda   to   other

autonomous,  local militant Islamic organisations  throughout

the world, including, as you have seen, the Jemaah Islamiyah.

The Al-Qaeda is able to weave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



together  a  brotherhood  of  local  terrorist  and  militant

organisations,  each  with its own agenda  and  revolutionary

histories but, at the same time, ideologically linked to  the

agenda of a common global jihad.  This means that even if the

Al-Qaeda is dismantled, the pursuit of its jihad continues in

these local groups.  And given the internal resources and the

capabilities  of  these groups, the threat of  terrorism  can

continue  for  a long time to come.  This is what  makes  the

current  complex terrorist threat that we are facing  such  a

resilient,  borderless and porous phenomenon.   This  is  why

Singapore strongly condemns all forms of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible member of the global community,

Singapore  fully supports international efforts in  combating

terrorism.   In doing so, the United Nations Act was  enacted

to  implement the United Nations Security Council  Resolution

1373.   Under  the  Act, regulations allowing  us  to  effect

measures  mandated by the UN Security Council can be  issued.

At  the  same  time, relevant international  conventions  and

protocols relating to terrorism are being reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore works closely with its ASEAN partners to

combat terrorism.  The ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism

that  I am attending in Kuala Lumpur next week is an example.

ISD  has  regular  contacts with its foreign counterparts  to

exchange  intelligence.  These have resulted  in  significant

successes, such as the arrest of bomb maker Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi   in  the  Philippines.   Beyond  terrorism,  our   law

enforcement  agencies have established close  relations  with

the   other   regional  counterparts  to  deal   with   other

transnational  crimes,  such as drug  trafficking  and  other

serious crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon is interested in our National

Emergency  System (NEST).  The NEST has been in  place  since

1982  to  ensure that Singapore survives any security threat.

It  is  a  comprehensive system encompassing civil  security,

civil  defence and the smooth operation of our economy during

an  emergency.   It also ensures the provision  of  essential

services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



such as water, power, health services, food and fuel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Ministries and certain key Government agencies

are involved in NEST.  I chair the National Emergency Council

comprising  the  Permanent Secretaries of all the  Ministries

and   the  key  appointment  holders  of  certain  Government

agencies  to  set  the  policies and  provide  guidelines  to

coordinate  and  prioritise  the operations  of  the  various

bodies involved in this National Emergency System.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a Security and Policy Review Committee set

up  since 1988 and comprising the Ministers for Defence, Home

Affairs and Foreign Affairs to monitor the strategic security

issues,    particularly   those   requiring    inter-Ministry

coordination.  We also have the Executive Group,  chaired  by

my   Permanent   Secretary,  and  comprising  the   Permanent

Secretaries  of the key Ministries to lead in the  management

of any civil security or civil emergency situation, such as a

hijack, a bomb explosion, terrorist sabotage and other  civil

disasters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we set up the National Emergency Behaviour

System as a key component of the National Emergency System to

mitigate and manage stress experienced by victims and provide

psychological  support for traumatised individuals  during  a

civil  or  a  national emergency.  Today, we  have  emergency

responders, nurses and teachers who are trained as  emergency

behaviour officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various exercises are carried out from time to time.

Some  are  more  visible,  such as  the  air  crash  exercise

conducted  in  May  2001 along Holland  Road  which  involved

representatives  of  grassroots  organisations  as  well   as

Government  agencies.  We also conduct blood donation  drives

and  shelter exercises which involve the public from time  to

time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Singapore Civil Defence Force conducts

civil  resource mobilisation exercises regularly.  And  I  am

glad  to  note  that  the civil resource  owners  have  shown

encouraging  support for these exercises.   There  are  other

exercises which are less visible to the public, and these are

primarily  to  test  out the response plans  of  the  various

agencies in handling and dealing with an emergency situation.

Members  asked me to tell in greater detail what these  plans

are.   For obvious reasons, we do not publicise these  plans,

lest potential trouble makers learn how to overcome them,  or

to sabotage them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the emergency behaviour officers,

many of them have been put into practice when we had the  air

crashes  in  Palembang  and  Taiwan,  as  well  as  in  other

earthquake disasters, such as in Taiwan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members also spoke about the need for multi-agency coordination to deal with terrorist threats. We

recognise this.  At the strategic level, the coordination  is

enhanced  through the establishment of the National  Security

Secretariat,  which DPM Tan mentioned yesterday,  and  it  is

staffed  by  the Home Team and officers from the Ministry  of

Defence.  The Joint Counter-Terrorism Centre was also set  up

to  share  intelligence on terrorism among  the  intelligence

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further tighten the inter-Ministry coordination, my

Ministry  has recently set up the Homefront Security  Centre,

which  will  have  oversight of the security  operations  and

joint exercises to test responses to the various threats.  It

will  work closely with MINDEF and other Government  agencies

and departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's openness to trade and travel is our

economic  strength,  but it can also be a security  weakness.

So, following the September 11 attacks, security measures  at

our borders have been intensified to prevent the infiltration

of  undesirable persons.  Stringent immigration and  security

checks are carried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



out at all sea, land and air checkpoints.  All seamen are now

required   to   undergo  full  immigration   clearance.    To

facilitate  this, the Clifford Pier and the West Coast  Ferry

Terminal have been gazetted as designated landing points with

full immigration, customs and security facilities recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where possible, we have also enhanced our operational

capability  using technology.  The Singapore Immigration  and

Registration  has acquired equipment to detect forged  travel

documents.   X-ray machines and walk-through metal  detectors

are  deployed  to  detect weapons and explosives.   Explosive

sniffers capable of detecting explosives such as TNT, or even

C4   -   an explosive substance found in the shoe of the  man

who  travelled  on a plane to America  -   which  has  a  low

vapour emission, are also deployed.  Mobile x-ray machines at

the  land  checkpoints enable effective inspection  of  cargo

vehicles.   In  addition,  my  Ministry,  together  with  the

Ministries  of Transport, Trade and Industry and Finance,  is

considering a security regime to screen and inspect  imports,

exports  and  transhipment cargo at our ports.   This  system

will  leverage  on  technology, such as  x-ray  scanners  and

radiological detectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October last year, visa requirements have also

been  imposed on visitors from certain countries in  view  of

the   global   security  situation.   This  allows   security

screening of visitors before their arrival in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key installations and high-risk establishments are

attractive  targets for terrorists.  If our key installations

are   sabotaged,   lives  will  be  lost  and   Singaporeans'

confidence will be shaken.   Therefore, Police and,  in  some

instance,  the  SAF  and  Gurkha  officers  are  deployed  at

establishments  such as Changi Airport,  Tuas  and  Woodlands

Checkpoints, key Government buildings as well as our oil  and

water  installations.   Regular  patrols  are  conducted  and

physical  measures,  such as closed  circuit  television  and

security lighting, are put in place.  Police and ISD



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



have  also conducted training for security agencies  and  in-house guards of key installations.  The training includes the

identification of bombs, firearms and other weapons, and  how

to  respond to incidents such as a bomb explosion, should  it

occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when arrested, the Jemaah Islamiyah members already

had  four  tonnes of ammonium nitrate kept in a warehouse  in

Malaysia,  and were planning to acquire another 17 tonnes  to

manufacture  truck bombs.  While ammonium nitrate  is  widely

used  as  fertilisers, it can also be turned into explosives.

There  are  other commercial substances that can be similarly

misused.   While we have a system of monitoring  the  import,

transport and storage of hazardous materials, my Ministry  is

currently   studying  whether  the  controls  over  hazardous

materials  and commodities that can be misused by  terrorists

need to be refined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is widely believed that many terrorist activities are

funded  from  Osama  Bin Laden's personal fortune  through  a

series of money laundering operations.  It is vital that  the

integrity of our banking system be protected from such abuse.

Singapore  has  a  rigorous system of checks  to  detect  and

counter  criminal use of the financial system.   We  will  be

introducing the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Bill  in

Parliament next week.  This legislation will give  effect  to

the  International  Convention for  the  Suppression  of  the

Financing  of  Terrorism,  which  Singapore  signed  on  18th

December  2001.  Thus far, we have not detected any terrorist

accounts  in  our  financial system.  Nevertheless,  we  will

continue with our strict monitoring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may recall that the US had five anthrax-related deaths last year. This caused a series of anthrax

hoaxes in many parts of the world.  From October last year to

16th  May  this  year,  143 cases of suspected  anthrax  were

reported to the Police.  All turned out to be false alarms or

pranks.   I  urge  those  who tried this  not  to  waste  the

Police's and the security forces'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



resources  by  calling  them  up  and  putting  white  powder

substances,  and therefore detracting them from  their  major

role of protecting the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mr Charles Chong asked if we are ready to

deal  with biochemical threats.  I would like to assure  this

House  that  we have a system in place to monitor and  detect

any  biological  outbreak early.  Our security  agencies  and

medical services are prepared and equipped to deal with  such

contingencies.   We  have systems in  place  to  monitor  and

detect any biological outbreak early.  The Ministry of Health

has  sent  out directives to medical practitioners  to  alert

them  to  the symptoms that a patient would demonstrate  upon

the exposure to biological or chemical agents.  Our hospitals

also  have adequate facilities and medical supplies to handle

such  a  contingency.  Since 1996, after the sarin attack  in

Tokyo, the Singapore Civil Defence Force has been raising its

level   of  preparedness  to  respond  to  any  chemical   or

biological  agent  attack.   The  Civil  Defence  Force  will

reorganise its resources to better handle these threats.  Two

new hazardous materials (Hazmat) stations will be established

on  Jurong Island and in Tuas by 2004.   The skills level  of

the   Hazmat   specialists  will   be   enhanced   and   more

sophisticated  equipment acquired.  We  have  also  conducted

study  visits  to other countries to see how they  deal  with

such threats and to learn from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is also concerned about threats to our

financial system or cyber crime problems.  Threats like these

are  certainly emerging in cyberspace.  Terrorists can  carry

out cyber attacks against critical infrastructure facilities,

such  as telecommunications networks, and cause great  damage

to  our  economy  and  our lives.  To  deal  with  this,  the

Infocomm Development Authority has worked out policies, plans

and crisis management framework for infocomm emergencies with

the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with Prof. Chin that it is just not

enough  for  the  Government agencies to  be  prepared.   The

community has an important role to play.  Homefront  security

must  be  the  shared  responsibility of  every  Singaporean.

Since the introduction of Total Defence concept in 1984,  the

Government  has  been  consciously  enhancing  the   security

awareness  amongst  Singaporeans.   For  example,  the  Civil

Defence  Force  provides  handbooks  containing  a  list   of

important telephone numbers as well as information,  such  as

the  use  of  improvised  covers at  home,  tips  on  cardio-pulmonary   resuscitation  (CPR),  first-aid,  dealing   with

hazardous materials, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Prof. Chin that volunteers are

indeed  given  a  role in ensuring the community's  security.

For  example, we have the Civil Defence Executive  Committees

in  the various constituencies which focus on the fire safety

and  emergency  preparedness, and manages the  Civil  Defence

Volunteer  Scheme.  To date, a total of 60,000 CD  volunteers

have  been trained under this scheme in skills such as  first

aid,   rescue  and  evacuation  procedures,  and  basic  fire

fighting.   This ensures that they are equipped to take  care

of  the community in times of emergency.  Another example  is

the Neighbourhood Watch Zones which boast of a total of 4,000

volunteers,  of which about 1,000 are women.   These  provide

the  "eyes  and  ears" on safety and security issues  in  the

neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a crisis, it is vital that the community does not

further  dissipate our security resources through unwarranted

fear,  suspicion and paranoia.  Singaporeans could also  help

our  security  agencies by staying calm in an  emergency  and

alerting  the security agencies if they come across something

suspicious  in  the  neighbourhood.   Police  has  and   will

continue to share information on what to look out for and who

to  call  should  suspicious items or  persons  be  found  or

detected.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman asked how we can prevent ourselves from being

a target for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



terrorists.   Let  me  say  that,  today,  every  country  is

potentially vulnerable.  Singapore is no exception.  Although

we  have crippled the Jemaah Islamiyah cells and its plans in

Singapore, the threat of terrorism  has not gone away, and it

is  not  likely to disappear for some time to come.  We  have

protective  measures in place, but there  is  no  recipe  for

immunity.   The best we can ask our people to  do  is  to  be

vigilant  and take a shared sense of responsibility over  our

common   collective  security.   For  example,  the  critical

information  that  the ISD received that led  to  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah investigation came from a concerned Singaporean who

told ISD that a Singaporean called Muhammad Aslam bin Yar Ali

Khan had links with Al Qaeda.  ISD put him and his associates

under  surveillance but did not arrest him when he  left  for

Afghanistan  on 4th October 2001.  After he was  arrested  by

the  Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, news broke at the  end

of  November  and  MHA  was asked by the  press  to  comment.

Fearing  that  all  his  associates  would  flee,  ISD  began

arresting  the  Jemaah Islamiyah group on 9th  December  last

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerned Singaporean who passed ISD the information

was not the only example in this case.  There were others who

stepped forward with useful information when the case  became

public.   This  included an expatriate working in  Singapore.

Obviously, everyone who lives in Singapore and shares in  its

safe  and secure environment can have a positive contribution

to make.  The world is a less safe place today; we need to be

on  guard.   But we must not let this sober reality undermine

our self-confidence and allow fear to reduce us into paranoia

and paralysis.  We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated

by terrorism; life must and will go on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are ready to deal with the challenges posed by

the  current security climate.  I can assure this House  that

our  officers are well trained and equipped to handle a  wide

range of security threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans themselves must never take racial and

religious harmony for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



granted.   I  am  glad  to  note  that  Singaporeans   reject

extremist  elements,  regardless of race  or  religion.   The

stability  and  trust that has taken more than  30  years  to

build  must prevail if Singapore is to survive as  a  nation.

This  requires  the  involvement  of  all  Singaporeans.   By

remaining  vigilant,  united and  steadfast,  the  challenges

would be more easily overcome, and we would emerge a stronger

nation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the Central Narcotics

Bureau  caught  3,417 drug abusers last  year.   This  is  an

increase  of 8% over the previous year.  Among them were  784

new abusers, representing a 17% increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to raise a primary concern that the

number  of  people caught with synthetic drugs has  gone  up.

The  new  "club  drugs" Ketamine, Ice and  55  are  now  more

popular  with abusers, with "K" or Ketamine, being  the  most

popular  currently.  Its popularity is due in a large measure

to  the  misinformation that it is not addictive and  has  no

long  term  ill-effects.  Abusers take between two and  three

swipes  of  one  gramme each time.  The  first  swipe  causes

hallucination of about an hour and after that the  abuser  is

sober;  hence, giving the impression that he is  in  control.

The  second  and third swipes might cause the  abuser  to  be

amnesic  and has no recollection of what happened  the  night

before.  Because of that, it had been used in gang rapes that

went  unreported.  "K" is most commonly found  in  nightspots

and  is  peddled by the drug syndicates.  Often,  the  senior

syndicate  members recruit younger boys and girls to  traffic

on their behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popularity of "K" to traffickers and abusers alike

lies  in  the difficulty in detecting the drug in the abusers

should they be caught.  Ketamine offences have risen to  24%,

and  the  number  of  people  caught  using,  possessing   or

trafficking the drug increased to 207 last year, up from  167

in  2000.  More than half of those arrested (55%) are younger

than 25, and one in three of the young abusers is female.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high incidence of repeat offenders in

synthetic drugs.  The age of abusers starts as young  as  14,

when they are still in school.  Almost always upon addiction,

the  abusers  would switch to the most popular and  sometimes

stronger type of drugs.  Many young girls end up in a vicious

cycle  of  crime,  abuses and flesh trade  to  sustain  their

lifestyle.  The younger girls are forced into nightclubs  and

KTVs  as  hostesses.  Does the Ministry of Home Affairs  have

any  figures on such cases of young offenders?  If not,  will

the Ministry of Home Affairs have studies done on this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether there

are  any  proactive plans taken by his Ministry to  curb  the

rising  trend of synthetic drug abusers?  May I  ask  whether

there are any local back-street synthetic drug manufacturers,

since such drugs are supposed to be easily produced?  Are  we

vigilant in this area?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since many of the synthetic drug users are young people

and many starting as early as 14, should there be more public

education  and  drug  awareness programmes  targeted  at  our

school  children?  This is important because many of them  do

not realise the potency and addictive effects of Ketamine and

its  long-term ill-effects.  May I beseech MHA to be  current

in  its knowledge of new synthetic drugs and adapting quickly

to  the prevailing scene at all times.  We need to be on  top

of the current situation as best as we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MHA should collaborate with MOH on a regular basis

in  using the services of the Centre for Drug Evaluation  and

Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine to analyse the new

synthetic  drugs so as to design appropriate urine and  blood

tests  to detect them.  Enabling drug detection will help  us

curb such drug abuse.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



Sir, enjoying a strategic location for the air and sea routes

has   given  Singapore  tremendous  advantages  economically.

Through  this  unique geographical position, we succeeded  in

developing  Singapore into air and sea hubs.  However,  these

two  have brought special problems.  Along the heavy movement

of goods and people through various entry points too flow the

illicit drugs.  Singapore receives 7 million tourists a year.

In  addition,  tens of thousands of Malaysian  workers  cross

into  Singapore  daily to work here.  Many  Singaporeans  too

shuttle across the Causeway and the Second Link.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Singapore is not far away from the

Golden Triangle, the nearest source of illegal drug, and  the

fact that our country is a major transportation hub, the risk

of  Singapore becoming a transit point for drugs is real.  We

have  lived under these circumstances for a long time and  so

far,  the  Ministry has done an excellent job  in  preventing

drugs  from flowing into Singapore.  However, for  every  new

measure taken, the drug syndicates would always find new ways

of  overcoming them.  My question is: what are the new  plans

that the Ministry has in mind to counter this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent figures released by the MHA show that the

number of those detained for drug abuse had stabilised.  What

are  the factors that have contributed to this situation, and

what further steps the Ministry has in mind to further reduce

the  number  of  drug  offenders?  What sort  of  support  is

offered  by  MHA  to  the  affected  families  and  is   such

assistance sufficient?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the number of drug offenders

arrested  has declined significantly, by 34% in the  last  10

years, from about 6,250 in 1992 to 4,130 in 2001.  Mr Yatiman

asked what were the factors that contributed to this decline.

Since  the mid-1990s, we have taken a multi-pronged  approach

in  dealing with this drug problem, ie, preventive education,

vigorous  enforcement and a comprehensive rehabilitative  and

after-care  regime  to tackle drug abuse.   We  do  not  work

alone.  We work with all the agencies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



that  are responsible to deal with this issue.  We work  with

the  Ministry  of  Education.  We work with the  Ministry  of

Health.   We  work with the Ministry of Community Development

and  Sports.   And  we  also  work  very  closely  with  many

community  self-help  organisations, voluntary  organisations

which are concerned about our young people being involved  in

drugs, and help them to get out of the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, effective enforcement is a cornerstone of our

overall  strategy.   So  we  doubled  our  Central  Narcotics

Bureau's manpower in 1995.  The CNB has also reorganised  and

improved the effectiveness of its intelligence division.   We

used  to  have  a very small set-up, but we have  decided  to

increase the number of officers in this division so as to get

better  information  to  deal  with  drug  syndicates.   This

enabled  the  CNB  to  break up many more  drug  trafficking,

smuggling and distribution syndicates than before.  Just last

year  alone,  the CNB smashed 24 syndicates, six  times  more

than it did in 1994 when we had less resources.  We have also

strengthened  our  laws,  for example,  by  sending  hardcore

addicts to long-term jail sentences.  Apart from acting as  a

deterrent,  this has actually kept the hardcore drug  addicts

away  from contaminating the young.  As a result,  we  see  a

decline of younger people in drug addiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must keep on top of this evolving trend. As Dr

Lily  Neo  has  pointed  out, new  synthetic  drugs  such  as

Ketamine are gaining popularity, just as Ecstasy was  gaining

popularity  in  1996/1997.  Although the number  of  Ketamine

abusers is small, we are paying very close attention  to  it.

Dr  Neo  is  concerned particularly about young  girls  being

addicted  to  Ketamine.   We  are similarly  concerned.   133

Ketamine  abusers  were  arrested  last  year.   This  is  an

increase from the 78 in year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is correct that one in three of these Ketamine

abusers are female, as compared to one in 10 among the  other

abusers.  This trend mirrors the increasing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



abuse  of  such  drugs,  not  just  in  Singapore,  but  also

regionally and internationally.  We are not alone  in  having

this  problem.  But that is no comfort.  20% of the  Ketamine

abusers, as I said, in the last two years were actually below

20  years old, of whom half were girls.  The relatively  high

abuse  rate  among  the  young  females  is  because  of  the

misconception  - their wrong thinking - that  Ketamine  is  a

benign  drug  which  they  think  will  not  be  harmful   or

addictive.  Let me, at the outset, dispel this misconception.

Ketamine  produces a progression of effects from a  state  of

dreamy  intoxication to delirium, accompanied by an inability

to  move, feel pain, or remember what has occurred under  the

influence of drugs.  So girls are particularly susceptible to

other  problems  if  they indulge in  such  drugs.   Ketamine

causes    hallucination,   alters   sensation,    mood    and

consciousness.  It distorts hearing, touch, smell, taste  and

visual  sensation  and causes nausea, vomiting  and  loss  of

memory.  I do not see the fun in taking such a drug.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our young abusers consume Ketamine at night

entertainment  outlets.  CNB regularly  conducts  enforcement

actions in these places.  Just as it did with the problem  of

Ecstasy abuse, it requires the nightclub operators to  inform

the  CNB  should they come across such people.   However,  to

date,  neither  the Police nor CNB has come across  any  drug

trafficking  syndicates luring young girls into  prostitution

via Ketamine addiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketamine is detected through urine analysis conducted by

the  Centre  for Forensic Science.  So we work  very  closely

with  the  Ministry of Health.  Urine specimens of  suspected

Ketamine abusers are sent there for anlaysis.  No one  should

be under any illusion that he or she can consume Ketamine and

get away with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synthetic drugs, including Ketamine, are not known to be

produced in Singapore - that is the lucky part.  But they are

produced  in clandestine laboratories in the region  such  as

the  Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia and  smuggled

into Singapore - that is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



frightening  part, because it is so widely produced  in  this

region, and they can be brought in quite easily.  We have  to

ensure that our border checks are tightened up as well.   But

we  have many travellers coming into Singapore every day  and

that  task  will  be difficult.  We will have  to  depend  on

intelligence  to  detect syndicates and to raid  such  places

where drug abusers hang around and arrest them.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, volunteer groups like the National Council Against

Drug   Abuse   (NCADA)  and  the  Singapore  Anti   Narcotics

Association,  working  with  the CNB,  have  undertaken  many

preventive drug education programmes with the schools and the

general  public.   Every year, the National  Council  Against

Drug Abuse has many programmes involving the schools and  the

students,  as  well  as  many  out-of-school  youths  working

together  with SANA.  The result is a marked decline  in  the

number  of new drug abusers, from 1,421 in 1996 to  784  last

year,  and that is, in a way, an encouraging sign that we  do

not  have  many more new ones coming in, although we continue

to  have them.  We cannot completely stop people from abusing

drug.  Only enforcement action can reduce that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aftercare is also an essential part, which is what Mr

Yatiman asked, in curbing the drug problem, as it helps  drug

addicts  to resist and overcome their addiction.   Here,  the

Prisons   Department   and  the  Singapore   Corporation   of

Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) work very closely together

with  the  volunteer  groups,  such  as  Singapore  Aftercare

Association  and the halfway houses.  This has proven  to  be

successful  in  keeping down the proportion  of  former  drug

abusers returning to drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance is also granted to families of offenders to

help  them  cope with the incarceration of their loved  ones.

Families  of  offenders  can  approach  the  Industrial   and

Services  Cooperative Society Ltd and SCORE  for  assistance.

The Industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



and  Services Cooperative Society offers annual  book  grants

and  scholarships  to  help them cope with  their  children's

schooling  and expenses.  It also employs family  members  of

offenders.  Family members of offenders who face difficulties

in  finding  jobs  can  also approach  SCORE  for  employment

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, my Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr

Mohamad Maidin, holds weekly meetings with the family members

of  drug  addicts, to see what sort of assistance they  need.

Ex-drug  addicts and their family members are  given  further

assistance.  Help rendered includes employment, accommodation

and  counselling.  The Prisons Department and  the  Singapore

Anti-Narcotics Association have, since 1998, spearheaded  the

Family   Education  Against  Drug  Abuse   programme.    This

programme teaches families the necessary skills and knowledge

to cope with and facilitate the addicts' recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from all these measures, families of offenders can

seek  help  from  other  community  agencies,  such  as   the

Community   Development  Councils  and  the  Family   Service

Centres.   These  measures are enough from now  to  help  the

families  of offenders to tide over the difficulties  arising

from their incarceration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, Community

Safety and Security Programmes (CSSP) are action plans  drawn

up  by  grassroots leaders, residents and the  Home  Team  to

tackle community issues and problems affecting the safety and

security of the local neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It started in 1997. The main purpose of CSSP is to

encourage  the  community to look after its  own  safety  and

security matters through self-help, mutual support and active

citizenry.  I understand that, since the year 2000, CSSP  has

been expanded to include schools in crafting their own safety

and  security  programmes.  Could the  Minister  provide  the

House  with  an  update of how successful has  CSSP  been  in

getting the community involved in addressing neighbourhood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



safety and security issues?  What initiatives have also  been

taken by the Home Team to facilitate problem solving CSSPs by

grassroots  leaders  and residents?  And would  the  Minister

consider  implementing  a National  CSSP  Awards  to  provide

recognition about standing initiatives and to encourage  more

in the community to get involved in CSSP?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, Mr Charles

Chong  has  just asked for an update on the Community  Safety

and Security Programme (CSSP).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to note that, since the CSSP was

launched  in  1997,  we  have made very  good  progress.   In

December  1998, there were 66 Residents' Committees  involved

in  the  CSSP.  Today, we have 502 Residents' Committees  and

all  53  Neighbourhood Committees have implemented the  CSSP.

In  addition to that, more than 100 schools have adopted  the

CSSP.   But  numbers do not tell the whole story,  Sir.   The

range and quality of CSSPs have also seen marked improvement.

Today,  CSSPs  encompass  crime  and  fire  prevention,  road

safety,  juvenile  delinquency, care and support  programmes.

In  recent  years, commercial enterprises, such  as  markets,

have also come on board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And CSSP, as we have noted, is a form of pro-active

community  self-help.  To maintain its effectiveness,  it  is

crucial that all CSSP practitioners receive adequate training

in  problem  solving as well as in community building  tools.

With this in mind, the Home Team and the People's Association

conducted a series of workshops in January this year to train

more than 1,700 grassroots leaders and Home Team officers  in

the  skills  needed for effective community involvement.   We

will   continue  to  build  up  the  capabilities   of   CSSP

practitioners,  so that we can sustain the CSSP  efforts  and

improve the quality of the solutions devised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also expand CSSPs in our schools. School CSSPs

mostly belong to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



one  of  three categories - juvenile delinquency,  preventive

education  as  well  as road safety.  These  programmes  have

generally been successful although we recognise that  we  can

still  do  more.   Already there are encouraging  signs  that

point  to  a  broadening of the school CSSP  programme.   For

example, the Northeast CDC has been working with the National

Police  Cadet  Corps (NPCC) and the Police to  develop  young

student  leaders  by  involving NPCC  cadets  in  local  CSSP

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion by Mr Charles Chong to consider

implementing national CSSP awards to provide recognition  for

outstanding  initiatives  and  to  encourage  more   in   the

community to get involved in CSSP, I am pleased to inform him

that  the  Police  is  currently working  with  the  People's

Association  to implement a common set of criteria  for  CSSP

awards to cover all CDCs.  From then on, we can have a better

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to assure the House that the Home Team

will  remain committed to the CSSP.  As CSSP grows in numbers

and  in scope, the Home Team will continue to provide support

and  resources, wherever we can, so that we can  achieve  the

CSSP's goal of building a caring community and safe homes for

all our citizens.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the most

challenging  tasks in any penal system is how to rehabilitate

offenders  after  they have served their  sentence.   In  our

society, a criminal conviction carries a stigma that is  very

difficult to remove.  We are not a very forgiving society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me recount the fate of an NUS graduate, who

graduated with an Upper Second Class degree, whether  through

the  rashness of youth or whatever, he was foolish enough  to

commit  a  petty theft for which he was fined $1,000.   There

was no imprisonment.  Unfortunately, that was not the end  of

the  matter.  His subsequent punishment, as it were, was much

more severe than the fine.  Even though he attended many  job

interviews, he could not find a job, because he had  to  tell

them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



that  he was convicted of an offence.  And even when  he  was

offered a job finally, he was told that the pay would be very

much  less  than a clean graduate, and in some cases,  $1,000

less.   We  do  not  seem to be able to  forgive,  let  alone

forget.  We should try to give those who genuinely reform and

who have done their time a second chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the problem lies with the Registration of

Criminals   Act.   This  Act  provides  not  just   for   the

registration  of criminals who commit offences  in  Singapore

actually,  but indeed include those committed in Malaysia  as

well.  And, in fact, the Minister may additionally order  the

registration  of  criminals  for crimes  committed  in  other

countries.   There  is  no  doubt  that  we  do   need   such

legislation,  especially  when  the  offenders   are   either

recidivists or have committed really serious offences.  But I

do think that there is scope for more discriminating approach

to the registration of criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there should be a differentiation between the

serious cases and the petty cases.  Indeed, there is room  to

argue that there should be separate registers and that in the

register  for petty offenders, there should be a  time  limit

after which the record should be erased.  I am thinking  here

especially   of  the  first-time  offender  who   commits   a

registrable   offence   but  who   was   not   sentenced   to

imprisonment.  If such a person were to keep a clean  record,

for  example,  for 3-5 years, I think he or  she  deserves  a

second chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when a record is erased, I think it should be

legislated  that  it  should  not  be  regarded  as  a  false

declaration to state in a job application form, for  example,

that he or she has not been convicted of an offence.  Because

erasing  the  record  is  just  one  step  and  it  would  be

regrettable  if we did not take the extra step  to  make  the

erasure meaningful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, under current legislation, section 7 of the Act

allows the Police Commissioner to exercise his discretion to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



dispense  with  registration for certain types of  first-time

offenders.   I  urge  the Minister to  review  the  situation

immediately  and see whether this power can be  exercised  in

appropriate  cases.  In the meantime, I hope that  amendments

to  the  relevant  legislation will  be  tabled  as  soon  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have seen and have paid their debt to

society,  let us try to forgive and forget.  Let  us  try  to

give these individuals a second chance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, persons convicted

of  crimes, and especially those who were sent to jail,  face

strong social stigma and sometimes the stigma stays with them

for  life.   As a result, many of them find it very difficult

to  find  work,  try as they might.  And the  situation  that

Prof.  Chin  Tet Yung has just described is one example,  and

that  is of a person who has not gone to jail.  In our  meet-the-people sessions, we come across cases of those  who  have

gone  to jail and their difficulties are even greater.   This

inability  to  find work easily, in comparison  with  others,

hampers their ability to reintegrate into society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we survey the economic landscape, we know that

it  is  going to be more turbulent going forward.  This means

that  even persons, who have never had brushes with the  law,

would  find it more difficult to find work and to hold on  to

work,   because   of   the  changes  in  technology,   skills

requirements, and so on.   For persons who have to endure and

face   social  stigma  associated  with  their  having   been

convicted of crimes, and especially having been sent to jail,

would  actually find it extremely difficult to compete for  a

job  and  to earn a living.  The strain is not only faced  by

them, it is also faced by their families and society at large

directly or indirectly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the families, their inability to find work would

directly reduce family income, leading to increased hardship.

In  the  case  of society, we would then have  to  live  with

perhaps  a  higher level of long-term unemployment  for  this

group and also a higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



rate of recidivism.  Therefore, it is in the interest of  our

society  and nation that we seek new and additional  ways  to

lower  the  barriers for re-entry of such persons  back  into

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what measures is

his  Ministry  taking, in the light of the  changed  economic

landscape,  to  further  help  these  offenders  with  skills

upgrading  and  job placement, both while  they  are  serving

their sentences as well as after that.  I would also like  to

ask   the   Minister  whether  his  Ministry  could  consider

extending  the use of non-custodial punishment options  to  a

wider range of less serious offences.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, our vision is to be a caring,

compassionate  society. But, in order to be compassionate,  I

agree with Prof. Chin that we have to be forgiving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For drug and criminal offenders, there are numerous

programmes  carried out by the authorities, both  during  and

after detention, to enable them to return to new life.   This

is,  indeed, a laudable objective.  However, the  success  of

such effort depends on how the Government, the community, the

employers  and  the  family of the individual  concerned  are

prepared  to  help.  For many years, SCORE has been  actively

involved in skills training for the law offenders.  How  many

of  them have gone through such training every year, and  how

many  managed to find jobs with the help of SCORE?  Sir,  the

idea  of  training them and placing them under  various  pre-release schemes and post-detention programmes is to give them

a  second  chance.  The success of these efforts  depends  on

three factors:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether we succeed in changing the mindset of the

ex-offenders, and to make them lead a new life;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, whether there is societal acceptance of the ex-offenders; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, whether we can make them financially self-supporting to enable them to regain their self-esteem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in the third aspect that worries me most.

While  it  is  true  that over the years there  has  been  an

increase  in  the  number of ex-law offenders  being  offered

jobs, many are still unable to do so.  During my MPS, I often

come across cases in which these people are being turned away

by  potential  employers simply because  they  have  criminal

records,  some  as  far  back as  16  years.   The  potential

employers often cite the police record as the reason for  not

employing them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern expressed by Prof. Chin on this

issue,  and  I  would also like to urge the  Minister  to  do

something to remove the stigma and help those caught in  such

circumstances to fully turn over a new leaf.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the Minister whether a review could be undertaken on the

number of offenders who have been sent to prison arising from

offences    which   do   not   carry   custodial   sentences,

particularly, fine defaulters, ie, a person who is unable  to

pay, eg, car park summonses, or a person who is unable to pay

a small fine for a simple driving offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the Minister to do a review to find out

whether we are sending people unnecessarily to prison.  These

offences  are  usually not serious enough to  merit  custody.

They  go  to  prison  anyway,  due  to  their  inability   or

unwillingness to  pay.  Such a sanction impacts most severely

on  those  without means, giving the impression that  justice

discriminates  against the poor.  By sending such  people  to

prison,  we  can  cause severe hardship to them.   They  lose

their  jobs,  the family is in distress, they  earn  the  ill

repute  of having gone to prison and, most damaging  of  all,

they are demoralised.  In many cases, the individuals who end

up  in prison are those who have low incomes.  Of course,  it

would  lead to another debate, whether the punishment  should

fit the crime or the offender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking the Minister whether he could undertake a

review  of  the  number of prisoners who  have  ended  up  in

prison,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



and  see  whether  alternative methods of punishment  can  be

considered for them.  For example, they can be required to do

community service.  Alternatively, the courts can be asked to

allow these individuals a longer period of instalment to  pay

up their fines.  I am quite sure that my proposed approach is

a  better  approach.  Imposition of a prison term means  that

the   fine   goes  uncollected.   In  addition,   there   are

significant costs associated with incarceration.  I feel that

such a state of affairs is neither in the interest of justice

nor  sound  financial management.  I am of the  opinion  that

there  is a pressing need to introduce reform in relation  to

the system of fines, both in the interest of justice and with

a   view   to  relieving  pressure  on  prison  accommodation

generated by the current system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same review, I would also urge the Minister to

consider  alternative  means  to release  alleged  offenders,

pending  trial,  other  than  by using  the  bail  mechanism.

Presently,  when  an alleged offender is  unable  to  furnish

bail,  before he is charged and before the actual trial date,

he  is  remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison.  At times,  the

bail  amount  may  be small but, as the alleged  offender  is

poor,  he is unable to furnish bail.  According to statistics

provided  by the Asian and Pacific Conference of Correctional

Administrators,  as  of  mid-2000,  there  were  2,311   such

unconvicted  remandees,  or 16.8%  of  prison  population  in

Singapore came under this category.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really hurts me to hear of cases where such

individuals  are  subsequently acquitted and their  detention

all  along was an injustice.  Perhaps we can consider a  home

detention system, or allow a bail bond insurance system  that

is being practised in the US.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the

incarceration of individuals often affects many people around

him, especially his family members.  Following incarceration,

often times, the family experiences a sense of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



loss  and crisis, and often sends them scrambling to  try  to

manage.   This  is  often more serious when the  incarcerated

individual is the head of the household.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge and am pleased to hear the Minister

mentioning  earlier that families are more  involved  in  the

rehabilitation process of drug offenders.  I wonder  if  such

programmes  are extended to criminal offenders too,  because,

often  times, in my experience, when the incarcerated  person

is  in prison, the family readjusts itself and tries to adapt

one  way or the other in the absence of the person.   In  due

course, the family manages one way or the other, with support

services around.  But when the person comes back, the  family

has  to readjust again to readmit him into the family system.

This often creates a lot of problem for the family.  Ever  so

often, the incarcerated individual comes along and says  that

the  family  is  not  able to accept him again,  or  is  less

supportive of him.  In that regard, often times, what he does

is  that he takes the easy way out and says the family is not

supportive and, therefore, he returns to his old ways and the

vicious cycle continues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am asking the Minister is whether it is

possible  for the Prisons Department especially,  to  include

family  members  in  the rehabilitation process  of  criminal

offenders, not just drug offenders, because what we  need  to

do  is  to  really maintain the family unit,  even  when  the

incarcerated  person  is in.  I recognise  that  the  Prisons

Department  will  probably face constraints  with  regard  to

allowing  civilians into the system, but we need to  consider

this  seriously because, otherwise, we are going to  continue

disconnecting   family   members   from   the    incarcerated

individual.   At  the  same  time,  it  may  prevent   future

generation of incarcerated individuals or offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is with regard to

employment opportunities.  Rehabilitation is often seen as in

the  process when a person is incarcerated.  Often times,  we

do not pay too much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



attention when the person is released.  What is important  is

that  the  adjustment process is equally important  when  the

person  is  released, and employment opportunities have  been

found  to be critical in preventing them from going  back  to

their criminal activities.  I recognise the role of SCORE  in

trying  to  create employment opportunities for ex-offenders.

But  what  I  do hear a lot is that, often times,  these  ex-offenders  are  given employment amongst ex-offenders.   This

does  not  create  a sense of normalcy.  What  they  need  is

employment  amongst  non-offenders,  to  create  a  sense  of

normalcy that they are reintegrating into society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that earlier this week the Minister

for  Home  Affairs mentioned that there is  going  to  be  an

amendment  to the Registration of Criminals Act, and  I  echo

very  strongly Prof. Chin's call for it to be tabled as  soon

as  possible, such that we are giving second chances and  new

opportunities  for  ex-offenders  to  be  reintegrated   into

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also suggest - I raised this point earlier this

week  -  the idea of creating job opportunities in the  civil

service for ex-offenders?  I think MHA has responded.  I urge

MHA  to  try to encourage all other Ministries to  show  that

they  are  open  enough to accept ex-offenders amongst  them.

This  would  then set the example for the private  sector  to

emulate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki, can you wind up your speech,

please?

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, in line with our

vision of accepting failures and redefining success, I  think

we need to operationalise second chances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, just one minute.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, not one minute. Half a minute,

please.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> My last point, Sir, is to

ask  the Minister for an update of drug offenders who are  in

long-term detention.  I think that was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



sometime  in the mid-90s and the first group will be released

soon.  What are the rehabilitation plans for them, especially

in returning to society?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I thank the many Members who have

spoken on this very important topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address their concerns as to the

rehabilitation of offenders, in particular, measures we  have

put  in place to ensure, first of all, that they are properly

trained and have the skills whilst in prison or DRC, so  that

when  they get out of prison, they can find jobs.  There  are

two  parts:  skills and training whilst in prison,  and  when

out,  finding jobs.  The other main concern is this  question

of  non-custodial sentences, whether more can be done to help

particularly   those  offenders  who  have  committed   minor

offences, to keep them out of prison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say at the outset that the Ministry of Home

Affairs  is  committed to rehabilitating  offenders  who  are

resolute about turning over a new leaf; in other words,  they

are  genuine and they really want to change and start  afresh

in  society.   Hence, we have adopted a number of initiatives

over  the past years.  These initiatives are broad-based  and

spearheaded by various agencies.  That is the way we approach

this  matter  -  not  just ourselves, but  getting  on  board

various agencies, both statutory boards as well as VWOs,  and

also good-hearted citizens, who want to help out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, recently, we launched the CARE Network. CARE

Network  is  spearheaded by the Prisons Department,  together

with the Singapore Corporation for Rehabilitative Enterprises

(SCORE).   It brings on board agencies like SACA, SANA,  NCSS

and ISCOS, where they take what we call an in-care and after-care  approach; in other words, through care, to  look  after

the  addict  and prisoner whilst he is in prison and  try  to

provide  a  seamless transit to the time when he  is  out  of

prison.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what happens when he is in incarceration? During

the period of incarceration, vocational training and academic

courses  are  offered  to selected inmates,  based  on  their

suitability,  such  as interest in the courses,  and  whether

they  are  receptive to rehabilitation programmes.   Academic

education  is  also  offered to selected inmates  to  improve

their  literacy.  Members would have heard of the Kaki  Bukit

School, which has turned out very good students, some of whom

have done even better than the national average.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have highlighted the role of SCORE. Indeed,

SCORE has geared up in this area.  Over the years, SCORE  has

become  a  key  player  in preparing offenders  for  the  job

market.   SCORE  runs  vocational  training  programmes   for

amenable  inmates  to  equip them with relevant  job  skills.

Many  of these vocational training courses lead to recognised

certification  by institutions, such as ITE.  To  ensure  the

relevance of these courses, SCORE conducts market surveys and

seeks advice from representatives from industry.  Since 1982,

SCORE has trained nearly 20,000 inmates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE also operates its own industries, and works with

private companies to offer inmates the opportunities to learn

useful  skills, such as furniture making and computer repair.

At present, there are 28 firms operating different industries

and  employing  more  than 2,000 inmates  annually.   Through

these  opportunities, inmates acquire  work  ethics  and  job

discipline, preparing them for employment upon release.  This

is  a  point  that Mr Yatiman talked about, this question  of

self-esteem, the need for counselling.  So, it  is  not  just

offering  them skills in a vacuum but, as they imbibe  skills

in  terms  of  job-related skills, they  also  imbibe  social

skills - how to interact with fellow workers, how to meet job

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that transiting from prison to employment

can   be   disorientating.   Hence,   SCORE   also   provides

psychological counselling, collaborating with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



NTUC   Skills  Development  Centre  to  conduct  Work  Skills

Training  Programmes to prepare inmates for  the  phase  when

they  will be out there without the physical support  of  the

prisons,  and  having  to  relate with  different  groups  of

people.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is in-house care. What about when they leave the

prisons  and the drug centres?  That is the point  that  many

Members  have  spoken  about.  This  is  an  important  point

because all would come to naught if they feel having done  so

much,  when  they  are out there, everybody does  not  accept

them.   We want to say that society should be more accepting,

family  should be more accepting - Dr Maliki and  Mr  Yatiman

had  talked  about the importance of family - and, hopefully,

employers will be more accepting.  This is a point that Prof.

Chin and various other Members have talked about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this is also a key concern of MHA. Here again,

we  have  got what SCORE is doing and what we have also  done

outside of the SCORE efforts. First, a brief sharing on  what

SCORE has done.  SCORE has in place this Corporate Assistance

for  Rehabilitation  Scheme  through  which  employers  offer

training  sponsorships and work attachments.   So  far,  more

than 1,800 inmates have benefited from this scheme.  This  is

quite important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE, as I mentioned earlier, also keeps in touch with

industries.  I think this is important.  One key  feature  is

that  SCORE maintains a database.  Currently, there are about

1,500  companies which have indicated interest, readiness  or

willingness to employ these ex-offenders.  I understand  that

last  year  alone,  SCORE managed to secure  the  support  of

another  230  companies, despite the weak job  market.   Last

year,  SCORE managed to give employment assistance  to  about

1,600 offenders.  I think this is very good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they do? They do work as production operators,

cleaners, technicians, welders, electricians and cooks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



Dr  Maliki made this comment and raised concern that not  too

many of them should be put together; otherwise, they are  not

learning  how  to relate with the outside world.   He  should

rest  assured, because there is this approach where not  more

than  five ex-offenders are employed in a company at the same

time.  That is very good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MHA is mindful, as Mr Heng and Mr Yatiman have noted,

that  ex-offenders  face barriers in  their  job  search,  as

society  stigmatises them.  I have answered earlier  in  this

House  that we are reviewing, and will amend the Registration

of  Criminals  Act, so that those who are convicted  of  very

minor  offences  will have their criminal records  considered

spent  or  expunged after a certain period of time,  provided

they  do  not  re-offend.  This will, therefore,  be  a  step

towards helping them to rehabilitate so that should there  be

screening of their records by employers, the records will not

surface.   Also  on  its part, prisons give testimonials  and

also help in referrals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin made a good point because the question in

most  of these application forms will be, "Have you ever been

convicted  by  a  Court of Law?"  The fact  is,  despite  the

record  being  expunged  or considered  spent,  the  truthful

answer must be "yes", and that will remain so.  That is why I

will, like many of the Members here, urge employers to take a

more flexible and compassionate approach.  In other words, do

not just balk at the fact that the prospective employee has a

record.   Come on board because Government, society, families

-  all  of  us  are trying to give offenders with  a  genuine

desire  to  turn  over a new leaf - a fresh  start  in  life.

Employers should also think about it and do their part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki, in particular, has mentioned family

involvement.  I want to assure him that prisons  indeed  take

this  very seriously.  If he has followed media coverage,  he

would  have read about ground-breaking initiatives  involving

families, bringing them into the prisons setting.  He  talked

about whether this is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



wise.   I  think  they  do it selectively  and  wisely.   For

example, Mother's Day.  We have had occasions in the past  to

bring in even children to spend some time with their mothers.

The  Prisons Department tells us that this works  because  it

starts  the  mother thinking whether what  she  has  done  is

correct.  There is fresh resolve when they part company  that

she  will  not  do it again. There are other programmes  also

where  families  are  involved,  for  example,  play-and-wait

programmes and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that has been raised by Members is

whether  there should not be a more non-custodial  punishment

for  a  wider  range  of less serious  offences.   An  Inter-Ministry   Committee,  which  I  headed  a  few  years   ago,

recommended a range of community-based sentences (CBS).  Some

of  these are indeed being rolled out.  We all know that when

appropriately   applied,  CBS  address  the  limitations   of

existing  sentencing options, such as hardship on  offenders'

families,  no  break in employment, because the offender  can

continue working, and also the question of difficulties in re-integrating into society, because he would remain in society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I want to highlight the Tail-End Home

Detention scheme which was implemented two years ago in April

2000.   This  scheme  basically allows  prisoners,  who  have

committed  minor  offences, to serve the tail  end  of  their

imprisonment  at  home,  subject to  electronically-monitored

curfew via tagging.  As of 30th April 2002, a total of almost

1,200  inmates have been placed on the scheme.  I am  pleased

to report that the success rate is 99.8%.  Only two offenders

have  so  far  failed  this  programme.   Recently,  we  also

introduced a community-based programme, involving a stay in a

Half-way House, for drug addicts on long term imprisonment  - I think that is Dr Maliki's concern. He talks about long term

imprisonment offenders who are coming out.  We  are  doing  a

pilot programme now to ascertain whether after the period  of

incarceration, a stint at a half-way house will help them  to

re-integrate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the success of the Tail-End Home Detention Scheme,

MHA is considering widening its scope.  We are also exploring

the  possibility of introducing Front-End Home  Detention  to

allow  offenders, who have committed very minor offences,  to

serve their sentences at home.  A feasibility study is now in

progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Attorney-General's Chambers' Law Reform

Division  is  conducting a study on the decriminalisation  of

minor  regulatory  offences.  In its study,  it  will  assess

whether  and  in  what circumstances some  criminal  offences

should  be  reclassified  as non-criminal  infringement.  The

study  will  also  investigate the use of administrative  and

civil  sanctions  as  enforcement mechanisms  to  replace  or

complement enforcement through criminal sanctions  for  these

minor regulatory offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran has raised a concern about fine defaulters.

He  suggests  that more should be allowed  to  pay  fines  by

instalments.   I think that is one way to go.   Mr  Ravindran

will  know  that under the CPC, fine instalments are  already

allowed,  and  my  understanding is that the  Courts  already

allow  this for deserving cases.  I agree that more  can  and

should  be  done.  MHA will work with the Courts to  see  how

best  to move forward.  Fine defaulters, who are genuine  and

really  want to pay the fines by instalments, can do  so.   I

understand that, on request, more offenders are given  longer

grace  periods  to  pay  their fines.   Under  the  Automatic

Traffic  Offence Management System (ATOMS),  you  can  settle

your fines electronically.  ATOMS is not so much to give  the

offender the opportunity to pay by instalments, but to settle

it  more  quickly  and to settle it more expeditiously.   The

Courts  will  enhance the system.  They are thinking  of  the

possibility of extending ATOMS to other regulatory  offences,

which are commonly processed in the night courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about bail which Mr Ravindran mentioned? Here

again, we have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



balance  the  interests  of  the  State,  public  safety  and

security  with the concerns that he has raised regarding  the

offender.  A bail system applies in many places in the world.

The thing is to set bail realistically.  Here, in most cases,

no  cash is put upfront.  It is a matter of getting a  surety

with  sufficient  assets to stand as  your  guarantor.   This

system  works well. The question is that those who  stand  as

surety must do so with their eyes open.  In MPS cases, a  lot

of  them are sureties, who stand as surety and later on  find

that  they  have  to  pay because the person  has  absconded.

Explaining  the system is important.  I hope that the  Member

will  appreciate  that there is a need  to  maintain  a  bail

system, so that the integrity of the court is kept intact and

the  person who is required to appear in court at  a  certain

time will do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have covered most of the points. Time runs. The

point is that we have done quite a bit in this area.  Let  me

end  by  saying that it is not just what Government will  do,

but everybody must play a part, including employers, families

and society out there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time indeed runs. I would like to remind

Members that we have another 10 speakers plus the reply which

should be finished within 41 minutes.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I have just three

quick  questions  to  ask the Minister.   My  first  question

concerns  the  road  accidents involving  the  motorcyclists.

Last  year,  about 100 motorcyclists died on our roads.   The

sad thing is that many of them who died were in the prime  of

their  lives.   A  lot  of accidents involving  motorcyclists

involve motorcycles which were below 200 cc.  My question is:

what  can  we  do  to  reduce the number  of  road  accidents

involving motorcyclists?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in the United States, the authorities

there  are  very strict regarding motorcyclists.  Apart  from

the  fact  that  it  is  compulsory to  wear  crash  helmets,

authorities   there  issue  guidelines   as   to   what   the

motorcyclists should wear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



on  the  roads.   For example, they advise that motorcyclists

should  put on jackets, so that in case they are involved  in

some  accidents, the jacket would help to protect  them  from

injuries. They even advise something like "do not wear  shoes

with shoe laces", because the shoe lace can get entangled  in

the motorcycle in case of an accident.  But over here, we can

see  people riding around a motorcycle wearing a singlet  and

slippers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question involves the recent imposition of the

seat belt rule for passengers in the rear seats of motorcars.

I  applaud this move.  I think the seat belt rule has been in

place  for many years.  I am only surprised that it  has  not

been  implemented  until recently, and  vigorously.   What  I

cannot  understand is why the driver, apart from being fined,

is  given  three  demerit points.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  or  the  Traffic Police not to be too  generous  in

giving  demerit  points.   I think  this  is  a  question  of

overkill.   When we first had this system of demerit  points,

the idea was to punish road users or drivers, who drive their

vehicles in such a way that they cause a hazard to other road

users.   I can well understand that we need to issue  demerit

points  to people who speed, or even to people who use  their

handphones  when they are driving.  But why  are  we  issuing

demerit points to a driver when it is his rear seat passenger

who  refuses to buckle up, or maybe the passenger could  have

buckled  up, but along the way, while the vehicle is  moving,

he  unbuckles himself?  How can the driver, who is  right  in

front, see what is going on behind him?  Sir, it is just like

when you fly on an airplane, if the seat belt sign comes  on,

and  you  still refuse to buckle up, and something happens  - bumpy weather, you bump your head - well, good luck to you  - but you do not punish the pilot.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I refer to the report some 2-3 weeks ago in

the  Sunday Times souped up cars were speeding along  Orchard

Road in the early wee hours of Sunday morning, something like

3-4 am.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



What surprises me also is why the Traffic Police were unaware

of  this,  because I understand that this is common knowledge

amongst quite a lot of people in the motor industry or in the

business of souping up cars, and I think at that early Sunday

morning  hours there are still a lot of people walking  along

Orchard  Road.   So I do not understand why the  Police,  who

were  patrolling the streets, were not aware of this problem,

unless,  of course, at 3.00 am on Sunday morning, the Traffic

Police have gone to bed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

I  want to touch on two of the topics that Mr Tan also talked

about, but in a different aspect.  I also applaud the Traffic

Police (TP) for requiring motorists to belt up, but it  seems

that  punitive  measures have been taken for  non-compliance.

Prior  to  enforcing  this law, the  TP  did  not  carry  out

sufficient educational programmes to educate motorists on the

importance  of  belting  up.  It  would  be  a  pity  if  the

Government has to resort to using punitive measures to ensure

compliance of all our laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, fatal motorcycle accidents. Like Mr Tan, I

share this concern, but I also want to declare my interest as

the President of an active motorcycling club.  The statistics

supplied  by the Ministry confirmed my belief.   82%  of  all

fatal accidents over the last 5 years happened on bikes below

200  cc.   24%  of these victims got their class  2B  licence

within  a  year and met with an accident.  Many of them  died

also  as  a pillion to these new riders.  Something is  wrong

here.  Either bikes below 200 cc are inherently not safe,  or

newer riders are more accident prone, or both.  The answer is

probably somewhere in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a motorcyclist, it always pains me to hear of a

motorcycle accident, and my heart usually skips  a  beat.   I

hope  the Traffic Police will act on my suggestion, from  the

motorcyclist's  point of view, on how to  improve  motorcycle

safety.  It will be different from what Mr Tan mentioned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the TP should prohibit P-plate motorcyclists from

pillioning passengers.  These new motorcyclists on  the  road

have not clocked enough riding hours, experience or defensive

skills.   How then can they be allowed to take responsibility

of the life of their pillion passenger?  They should take the

first  year  of their licence to familiarise themselves  with

the  road hazards and improve their riding skills before they

be allowed to pillion a passenger.  This may sound harsh, but

my  experience in motorcycling tells me that this  will  save

lives.  Having a pillion on a small cc motorcycle changes the

power  and  handling dynamics of the bike.  If a motorcyclist

is  a  new rider, he will not be able to handle a sudden road

hazard like a negligent or drunk driver driving straight into

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, defensive skills training. All class 2B bike

licence  holders  should  be encouraged  to  go  for  licence

upgrade  after  one year.  This could be done with  insurance

company  to offer higher discounts for insurance premium  for

the  licence upgrader.  The class 2A test should also include

greater defensive skills element in its training content.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, heavier punishment like jail and caning for

motorists  who  cause fatal accidents through  negligence  or

drink   driving,   or  for  lack  of  care   for   vulnerable

motorcyclists.   My  experience and many  anecdotal  evidence

from  fellow  bikers confirmed that there are  many  big  car

owners  out  there who neglect the safety and risk  of  other

motorcyclists by cutting too close into their  lanes.   There

are also some crazy drivers

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia, could you speed up and finish

your speech, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Some crazy drivers reportedly

even disturbed a motorcyclist by cutting in very closely  by,

then slowed down, and then cutting in again.  Others pressure

the  small cc motorcyclists by tailgating so closely  behind.

We  always hear of newspaper reports of a motorcyclist losing

control of his motorcycle,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



but  never explained why.  Something is wrong somewhere here.

I hope the Police will investigate further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia, please end your speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Finally, Sir, I hope the

Police will take a serious view of this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  he  could  review why there is a delay  in  allowing

people   to   take   driving  tests  in   Singapore.    Here,

particularly, I would like to ask whether he can look at  the

supply and demand side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply side, whether we can explore the

possibility of having more driving centres or, alternatively,

whether  we  can  recognise driving test  results  issued  by

overseas  driving test centres which are properly  accredited

and  which  conduct  their tests according  to  international

standards.   And,  thirdly, whether we can also  consider  if

somebody  wants  to  set  up a proper  driving  centre  in  a

neighbouring country, say, in one of the islands and have  it

properly  accredited,  and  have international  standards  of

testing, we can recognise such driving test results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the demand side, one of the groups of people who

regularly go for driving tests in Singapore, and adding on to

the  queue,  are  those who get 24 demerit points,  or  whose

licences are suspended by the court.  At the moment, there is

a double whammy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you commit an offence, you get a fine and you

get  24  points,  your licence is suspended.   Then  if  your

licence  is  suspended for a year, you get a  triple  whammy.

You are required to go for a driving test all over again.  My

question  is whether we can decouple the third whammy,  which

is  the  requirement to go for a driving test one more  time.

Because there are certain offences, for example, driving in a

bus  lane, which carries three demerit points, not wearing  a

seat belt, carries three demerit points - all these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



things do not really relate to driving skills.  They are more

mistakes  and  simple offences which do  not  impact  on  the

driving  ability or pose any serious danger to other  drivers

on  the  road.   So  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister  to

seriously  consider whether there is really a need for  those

who  have  been suspended for a year to go for  driving  test

again,  and whether we can decouple this exercise so that  we

reduce demand on our driving test centres.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to

raise  a question on what I perceive to be too long a waiting

period  for  conversion of Malaysian class 5 licence  to  our

Singapore class 4 vocational driving licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our private bus operators employ Malaysians with

class  5  licence as bus drivers in Singapore.  Upon approval

of  their work permit, their class 5 licence is converted  to

Singapore  class  3  licence.  This is  followed  by  another

waiting period of some three months or so before a test  date

is   given  for  conversion  to  class  4.   Upon  successful

conversion  to class 4, another waiting period of 2-3  months

is  again  required before a date is given for the vocational

class 4 licence driving test.  By the time the Malaysian  bus

driver obtains his vocational class 4 driving licence, it can

stretch to a 6-month waiting time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the need for Malaysians working in

Singapore  to  hold  a  Singapore driving  licence.   What  I

consider as inconsistent is the fact that there are Malaysian-registered  heavy  vehicles which ply our  roads  daily.   In

particular, I am referring to Malaysian lorry and van drivers

who  come  in from the Causeway or the Second Link,  and  ply

their  vehicles  all the way to our port container  terminal.

These  drivers do not have a Singapore class 4  licence,  and

yet  are considered safe and competent enough to drive on our

Singapore  roads.   That being the case, the  long  wait  for

conversion  cannot  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  these

Malaysians waiting to be employed must first be tested to  be

competent and safe.  If this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



were  so, then there seems to be inconsistency in our policy.

In  fact, the long waiting time has dire consequences on  the

bus  operators.  Very often, the recruited bus drivers decide

to  give  up  their jobs as they find the waiting period  too

long  and cannot afford to go on without a salary during this

period, since they are not yet productive on their jobs.  The

bus   operators,  in  this  instance,  would  have   expended

resources that only brought in futile results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I request for the Minister to kindly look into

shortening  the  waiting  period  for  conversion   of   such

licences?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Sir, questions concerning the

safety on our roads have been raised by Mr Tan Soo Khoon  and

Mr  Steve  Chia.  May I first, at the outset,  say  that  our

roads are generally safe for our road users.  They are mostly

in  good condition, well-maintained but, at the same time, we

also  have people who speed on our roads and there  are  also

people with dangerous driving habits.  As a result, accidents

do  happen.   Unfortunately,  as mentioned  by  Members,  the

majority  of  those who died, or who were seriously  injured,

eg,  last  year, were motorcyclists, and some  of  them  with

pillion  riders.  They formed about 89 out of 197 fatalities,

and  210 out of 340 people who were seriously injured on  our

roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely, the Police takes a very serious view of the

vulnerability of this group of road users.  And measures have

been put in place to enhance the safety of our motorists,  in

particular,  motorcyclists.  For motorcyclists,  specifically

our approach involves:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Improving the quality and standard of rider

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;training and testing;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Vigorous enforcement; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Intensive public education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first touch on improving the quality and

standard  of our rider training.  Learner riders need  to  be

equipped with good riding skills and habits in handling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



their  motorcycles  on  the roads  and  also  when  they  are

interacting with other road users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-the-road-training was introduced since 1985; in other

words,  they  have  to experience what it  is  like  actually

driving  on  the  road before they get  their  licence.   And

computer-simulated  training  was  also  started   in   1998.

Emergency braking on wet surfaces and also riding at night on

public  roads have also become part of the curriculum.   Sir,

the  training syllabus for learner motorcyclists is regularly

reviewed.   All these were designed to improve  the  training

system  so that they are better prepared when they are  ready

to ride the motorbike on the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police also partners various organisations

to  promote motorcyclists' safety and to improve road safety.

These  organisations include the ITE Ang Mo Kio  Safe  Riding

Club, Harley Davidson Club, National Safety Council, tertiary

institutions   and  organisations  with   large   fleets   of

motorcycles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, I must say that other motorists

have also a role to play in ensuring a safer road environment

for  our  motorcyclists, and they should  give  motorcyclists

sufficient space on the road.  This is the concern raised  by

Mr   Chia   earlier.   Tailgating  and  also   squeezing   of

motorcyclists  to  the  side  of  the  lane   is   not   only

inconsiderate,  but  is  also very  dangerous.   The  Traffic

Police  has been conducting on-going public education efforts

to  stress the need for drivers of motor vehicles to give way

to motorcyclists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the problem of speeding on our roads.

In the first three months of this year, about 7,000 motorists

were  booked for speeding.  But this is down from 9,500  over

the  same period last year, partly because of our enforcement

efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for motorcyclists, 3,307 of them were caught speeding

last year as compared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



to  2,400  in the year 2000.  The thrust of Traffic  Police's

enforcement  efforts  is  to  curb  speeding  and   dangerous

driving.   Enforcement actions against dangerous drivers  and

riders  are conducted regularly.  This is the concern  raised

by  Mr Tan earlier.  In fact, for those people who were found

speeding  at 40 km or more above our speed limit,  they  will

immediately be charged in court and may face disqualification

from driving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is also continuously looking out for

illegal  racing,  as  it is not only a nuisance,  but  it  is

extremely  dangerous to the racers and to other  road  users.

Sir,  Traffic  Police regularly patrols areas  where  illegal

racing  is  known to take place.  Between January  and  April

this  year,  the  Traffic  Police  mounted  a  total  of  325

operations   against  speedsters,  out  of  which   69   were

concentrated  at  the Lim Chua Kang area, Tuas,  as  well  as

Orchard  Road.  As rightly pointed our by Mr Tan,  they  have

been  known  to  be  racing in these places  illegally.   The

penalties  faced  by these speedsters range from  composition

fines  to  possible  conviction and disqualification  by  the

court.   The  Traffic  Police will continue  its  enforcement

action against these speedsters.  But I must say that because

they  are  illegal and they are organised  at  times  and  at

places  which  they  did  not inform the  Traffic  Police  in

advance, it will not be possible for the Traffic Police to be

at  all the places where they are racing.  But where we know,

where  information has been given to us, we will indeed  take

action to stop them, and to take all necessary action against

this group.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Maidin, could you please speed up?

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Mr Chia raised his concern about

L-riders.   Actually, the number of riders in Class  2B,  new

licence holders, were very few.  The majority of this  group,

about  85%  who were involved in accidents have been  on  the

road  for  more than one year.  They are experienced drivers.

As   I  said,  part  of  the  problem  is  speeding  by   the

motorcyclists and other motorists, and also some dangerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



driving habits which have contributed to such accidents.   At

the same time, we hope that with a better training programme,

we  could  help them to be even better drivers, and  we  hope

that other motorists will not make it difficult for them.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ravindran earlier mentioned about learner

drivers  who  can  take their test faster.   At  the  moment,

learner drivers take their training at our driving schools as

well  as from private instructors.  On the average, they take

about  five  months  just to undergo  practical  training  in

driving.   And  the  five  months of training  is  considered

reasonable,  because learner drivers have  to  cover  a  wide

range of driving skills and pick up good driving habits  and,

hopefully, make our roads safer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period of training also provides learner drivers

ample time to familiarise themselves with the traffic as well

as  road conditions in Singapore.  And we believe that for  a

life  time of driving, this initial investment of five months

is well worth it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wait for a test slot takes another two months.

Hence,  on average, the total time taken for a learner driver

who  passes on the first try is about seven months.  I  think

it  is  still  well  worth it.  The are a limited  number  of

practical driving test slots.  Between January and March this

year, there were 17,100 driving test slots available compared

to  19,000 learner drivers seeking to take their tests.   So,

test  slots  are somewhat limited by about 2,000  in  number,

partly  because of the availability of driving  circuits  for

practical  tests.  There  are currently  only  three  driving

circuits here.  As the three driving schools need to  conduct

practical  training using the driving circuits as well,  test

slots  have  to  be properly spaced out and  scheduled.   The

Traffic  Police is aware of this constraint, as mentioned  by

Mr  Ravindran,  and  is working with the driving  schools  to

explore  ways  to  increase the number of test  slots.   With

that,  perhaps the timeframe for passing one's  driving  test

can be shortened slightly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singaporeans taking the test, for example, in

Batam,  at  the moment, we have our own programme  or  scheme

because of various reasons, including the fact that our  road

conditions,   users and the traffic here are not  similar  to

other  countries, let alone Batam.  So there is a constraint,

At  the moment, in fact, Singaporeans who go overseas and get

their licences do not get automatic recognition here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Maidin, we have 18 minutes left, and

there are still six Members who want to speak.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Sir, I have one more point to

answer Mdm Ho.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do it quickly, please.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Yes, Sir. A foreigner can drive

in  Singapore without converting his foreign driving licence,

if it is for short periods.  He is allowed to drive up to one

year,  if he is driving in and out of Singapore.  Thereafter,

he is required to obtain a Singapore driving licence.  But  a

foreigner  who  is  working  in  Singapore  is  considered  a

resident.  Therefore, he is treated like a Singaporean and he

must  get a Singapore driving licence before he can  drive  a

vehicle   in  Singapore.   These  include  drivers  who   are

Malaysians  and who are working for SBS and other  companies.

Foreigners  with  foreign driving licences  are  nevertheless

subject to our regulatory regime of our Traffic Act, and have

to comply with all the provisions of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, it is not possible to shorten the period

for foreigners.  They have to wait for a while.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards concerns raised about seat belts and

whether or not demerit points are justified, I must say  that

the  concern  now is not to reduce the three  demerit  points

against  drivers  who  fail to ensure  and  comply  with  the

regulations.    Instead,  our thinking  now  is  to  consider

whether  the passengers, especially those who have a  licence

and did not belt up, should also be considered to get three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



demerit points.  Because he is a qualified driver and he  did

not comply with the regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes a fine is good enough. Sometimes it is

not  good  enough.   Sometimes many of our drivers  are  more

concerned with demerit points.  Therefore, demerit points can

also  play  a very important part to ensure that  people  are

more caring and wear seat belts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I asked the question on decoupling

the  suspension and the driving test, and I did  not  get  an

answer.   Perhaps  the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary  could

respond.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> Sir, normally, people get

suspended  because  the  court  is  satisfied  that  he   has

committed  a very serious offence.  Therefore, the suspension

is necessary.  And the idea of sending them back to school is

to make sure that they re-familiarise themselves with the law

and,  hopefully, pick up good driving habits.   The  idea  is

that,  in the end, when they go back to the road, it  is  for

their  own  safety  and for the safety of other  road  users.

That is the key reason and I think it is still relevant.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I just want to ask

the  Minister why visitors from China, both social visit pass

and  business pass visitors, face a more lengthy  application

process compared to visitors from other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect I would like to ask is on the student

pass.   It  seems to me that SIR must be the only immigration

authority  in the world that terminates student passes  based

on  their  examination results.  I would  like  to  find  out

whether SIR could liberalise this policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to make

two  points regarding permanent residence.  The first is that

I  have come across cases where permanent resident status was

granted to one spouse and not to the other.  This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



creates  a  problem  for  them, as the  family  unit  has  no

certainty  in  making Singapore its permanent home.   If  the

wife  is  working  here and the husband  is  left  behind  in

Shandong province in China, what do you think the most likely

outcome  would  be?  One outcome is that they make  plans  to

move  on to the United States or some other country,  and  we

lose  them  eventually.  The other possibility  is  that  the

husband  finds  another woman there and  divorces  his  wife.

Now,  what  business do we have in breaking up families?   If

for  some reason, we cannot grant the other immediate  family

member  PR  status,  then I think we should  not  grant  that

applicant  PR status in the first place, as he is not  likely

to  be  here permanently without his family.  In not allowing

all  the family members to reside here, we force him  to  use

this  place as a stepping stone to something else,  and  this

defeats our purpose and our objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to permanent residents becoming

so  permanent  that  they do not want to accept  citizenship.

Many PRs who have been PR for many years do not actually want

to   be  Singapore  citizens,  unless  and   until  something

terrible  happens  to  their home country.   There  are  many

reasons  for their decision.  The main reason, I suspect,  is

that  they enjoy the best of both worlds, and can always take

that  step  at a later stage.  In the meantime,  they  remain

mobile  and  continue to enjoy the rights of  citizenship  in

their  home country and the many benefits of being  a  PR  in

Singapore  to  the  envy of Singaporeans.  I  know  permanent

residence  means  they can reside here on a permanent  basis.

But  I would like to ask the Minister whether an expiry  date

should be imposed on the PR status.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, the precursor

of  the Singapore Penal Code is the Penal Code of the Straits

Settlements, which was passed by the Legislative  Council  of

the Straits Settlements in 1871, and this was, in turn, based

on  the Indian Penal Code of 1860.  Come September this year,

the  Singapore  Penal Code would have been in force  for  130

years.   This  is significant if we consider that  while  the

Penal Code has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



amended  from  time  to  time,  it  still  retains  its  main

provisions in their original form.  The wait of 130 years  is

showing  in the Penal Code, and several of the provisions  in

the  Code appear to be rather inappropriate for the Singapore

of  today.   For example, section 429 provides  that  whoever

commits mischief by killing or rendering useless an elephant,

a  camel  and  a  host  of  other  non-indigenous   creatures

including cows shall be punished with imprisonment for a term

which may extend to five years or with a fine or with both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in present times, as we remake Singapore and are

willing to sacrifice sacred cows, section 429 appears  to  be

grossly out of date; similarly, for sections 428 and 498  for

which  I  do  not have the time to go into.   Many  of  these

provisions  are  rarely or never used to prosecute  offenders

precisely because they are so irrelevant to society today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that a comprehensive review of the

Singapore  Penal Code be done to re-evaluate  the  role,  the

scope  and the relevance of its provisions, and to  weed  out

provisions which are no longer needed or desirable.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to

speak  on the topic on a gap in our law, and this is  in  the

area  of  stalking and harassment.  I think as  a  result  of

urbanisation and widespread use of information technology, we

are  seeing  an  increase in a new type  of  aberrant  social

conduct,   namely,  stalking  and  harassment.   As   regards

stalking, we all know what that means.   Harassment can  take

many forms; particularly with the use of IT, it is taking the

form of e-mails and SMS messages through the handphone.   The

current   status  of  the  law  does  not  afford  sufficient

protection.    The   only   relevant   legislation   is   the

Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.   The

combined  effect of section 13 (a), (b) and (c)  is  that  it

prohibits   threatening,  abusive  or  insulting   words   or

behaviour  in written or oral form within sight of a  person,

or  in  such  a manner as to believe that immediate  unlawful

violence will be used.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



problem  is  you can have a conduct which is not threatening,

abusive  or  insulting, but which is nevertheless harassment,

eg, silent phone calls in the middle of the night, persistent

calls of conduct.  Or you send flowers which the person  does

not  want  or  if you send dead flowers.  Or you  could  send

unwanted  gifts  which people do not  want  either.   When  I

became  an  MP, I received a message to return  a call.   And

when I did, I discovered he had not called but this woman had

left messages with a whole host of people to call him, and it

was a form of harassment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only in October of last year that it became an

actionable  tort in Singapore when our High Court ruled  that

you  could actually have a civil course of action.  Sir,  the

problem   seems  to  be  that  we  do  not  have   sufficient

legislation, and I would like to ask the Minister if he would

be  prepared to look into legislation to provide for it to be

an  offence  for  the police to have appropriate  powers  for

other  remedial  action,  eg,  referral  for  counselling  or

psychiatric evaluation.  And, finally, if the person is not a

Singapore  citizen, then perhaps to review the conditions  of

his stay in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, I give you two minutes to

raise both your points before the Minister replies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Sir. I will make

it in two minutes with my questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can the Minister tell us how many applications

for  society  registrations have been rejected  in  the  last

three years?  If any, can the Minister also explain what  and

why they were rejected?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is unreasonable for the Registry of Societies

to charge $400 simply for the registration of a society.  Any

subsequent changes to the constitution, the ROS charges $140.

Can   the   Minister   look  into  reducing   these   charges

significantly?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, can the Minister kindly explain the rationale for

restricting the societies to certain parts of Singapore, like

in   Geylang?   In  view  of  the  excess  capacity  of   HDB

shophouses, will the Minister look into allowing societies to

register and function in these shophouses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to my second cut on public

entertainment licence.  Can the Minister also explain why  it

takes  21  days to issue a speaking permit?  Can the Minister

look  into  reducing that?  The Minister said  previously  in

Parliament that they are going to shorten the period.  I want

to  know  how it is getting along.  Can the Minister cut  the

approval  down  to three days in the name of  efficiency  and

productivity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point. Can the Ministry also do away with the

need  to  apply  for the entertainment permit personally  and

physically?   Like  all  Government Ministries,  I  hope  the

application for the public entertainment licence can also  be

done electronically on line?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho, you have about seven minutes to

answer all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Chia said that he had two

questions, but he had four questions.  The Minister is not  a

computer  who is able to produce all these specific  answers.

I will try, but then I have got six minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take Dr Wang's cut first. I think Dr Wang is

concerned about tourists coming particularly from China,  and

whether  we  should  in fact tap this vast  market.   Let  me

assure him that MHA is aware that there is a large market out

there.  And together with other agencies, we will do our part

to  facilitate the entry of these tourists.  But, of  course,

the   Member   must  be  aware  that  we  must  balance   the

considerations,  because besides genuine  tourists  who  come

here,  there are also others who come here illegally and  who

work  illegally.  And this includes, in fact, even  students.

Whilst we also want to tap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



students and, in fact, many PRC students study here,  we  are

also mindful that the system must be able to sieve those  who

are genuine from those who come here for other reasons, using

either  the tourist visa or the student pass as subterfuge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that we have been flexible in granting

visas  to  genuine  visitors.  For example,  last  year,  SIR

received  330,000 visa applications from Chinese  and  Indian

tourists,  and  99%  of  these were approved.   Only  1%  was

rejected.   I  do not have the breakdown for the Chinese  and

Indians,  but taking them as a group, both these markets  are

something  that  we do recognise.  Most of these  visas  were

processed  within 2-3 days.  So, it is not true  that  it  is

taking a long time.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we also hold regular dialogues,

not  only  with economic agencies but, for example, with  the

National Association of Travel Agents (NATAS) to explore ways

to  facilitate  the  entry  of genuine  visitors  from  these

countries.   For  example, we revised the banker's  guarantee

recently  for the 96-hour visa for PRC tourists.  Previously,

each  travel  agent  had to furnish a banker's  guarantee  of

$100,000.   But, with effect from 15th April this  year,  the

banker's  guarantee  has  been waived  for  Singapore  travel

agents  who  consistently bring in PRC tourists  who  do  not

overstay; in other words, based on their record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in fact, is the approach we also take with

applicants  - schools and other training institutes  -  which

want to bring in Chinese students to study in Singapore.   We

realise that there is a market out there.  Many of them  want

to  come  here,  but we also must realise  that  there  is  a

plethora  of  agencies  here.   For  example,  we  have   the

Government  schools.   We  have  the  institutes  of   higher

learning.  We have schools with good reputation like NAFA and

LaSalle.   And  then there are private institutions  doing  a

whole  range of activities.  The approach SIR takes will  put

the onus on these training institutes and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



schools  to ensure that whoever they bring out do not violate

conditions, like not working, and so forth.  In fact, SIR  is

fine-tuning  its  procedures,  examining  things  like,   for

example, the need for a sponsorship so that more students can

come out.  Basically, the point is that we are mindful of the

need to tap this market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min talks about permanent residence. In

fact, we are mindful that we should not separate family units

when they apply for PR.  Generally, that is the principle  we

work  on  - preservation of family unity.  Hence, the spouses

and  children of Singapore citizens and Singapore PRs may  be

granted  PR  under their sponsorship.  In the instance  where

family members apply for PR together, they are considered  as

a  family  unit.  I am informed that in a large  majority  of

cases,  if  the  main  applicant is successful,  PR  is  also

granted to the spouse and children.  In these cases,  if  the

spouses  and  dependants are not able to come in because  the

main  applicant economically does not satisfy the salary cut-off,  or  is not able to establish an income that is  stable,

then,  in many cases, they are also granted long-term  social

visit  passes.  That is the main point.  If Mr  Ong  has  any

particular  case, he can refer them to me.  I  think  we  are

considering one of his cases now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that PR is granted on the basis of

free  entry  in  and out of Singapore, based  on  a  re-entry

permit.   That  is the system we work on.  PRs  who  come  to

Singapore,  who  live  in  Singapore,  because  of   our   PR

assessment scheme, they are assessed to be able to contribute

to  Singapore.  That is why for those who live in  Singapore,

we  take  it  on that basis.  When they renew their  REP,  at

least  that shows an indication on their part that they  want

to  continue using Singapore as their proxy home.   Some  may

not  want to become Singapore citizens straightaway.  But the

point is that they do contribute to Singapore's well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong's point on the Penal Code, yes, indeed,

it  is  an  old dame enacted in 1871, and so we are reviewing

it.   There  is  a  process where, together with  MinLaw  and

Attorney-General's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



Chambers, we are looking at all the 400 provisions to  update

the  provisions,  and also to update the  penalties.   It  is

taking  some  time because there is a need to  integrate  the

scheme that we want the Penal Code to have, not only internal

consistency  amongst  the various provisions  but  also  with

other statutes as well.  This is just to assure Mr Chong that

we have this in hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah has expressed concerns about what she

calls  a lacuna, or gap, in the law.  Let me assure her  that

we are indeed studying the issue of whether or not there is a

need to enact specific anti-stalking and anti-harassment laws

in  Singapore.  I think she is aware of a study made  by  the

Singapore  Academy  of  Law.  We will  look  at  it  and,  if

appropriate, we will enact it.  But I must say  that  in  the

Singapore context, we must be careful.  Because of our  close

proximity,  Police  must  be very  satisfied  that  they  can

practically be able to implement any anti-stalking  or  anti-harassment law.  Otherwise, somebody just lingering around in

the void deck may fall foul of that law.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has recently announced that PSA is

currently  reviewing  its charges,  and  this  is  after  the

pullout  and  loss  of  two  major  customers  -  Maersk  and

Evergreen.   I believe they constitute about probably  15-20%

of  its  turnover.  Recently, the Minister has also announced

that   $80   million   will   be  spent   to   develop   more

infrastructural facilities for the maritime cluster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of top customers should not be taken lightly.

Already, we hear that Tanjung Pelepas is expanding the number

of  berths for more shipping lines.  In this area, I  believe

customer  relationship management is  an  important  area  of

focus  for  any  business.   Whether  Tanjung  Pelepas   went

backwards  to  entice  the top two customers  that  is  quite

immaterial  to me.  The fact is that two top customers  went.

We  should not under-estimate what two top shipping lines can

do there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has argued that there is more than just

cost  in  the  equation.  There is also  value  in  our  port

facilities,   infrastructure,  IT  connection,  connectivity,

reliability, efficiency, and so on.  What I would like to ask

the  Minister  is  that we should be aware  of  industry-wide

changes  in  order to estimate this kind of  demands  in  the

market.   It  is  definitely not cost alone.  Shipping  lines

want  to  operate their own berths or terminal for maximising

their  own  value, and also because they want to build  their

own  global supply chain integration.  Supply chain  linkages

in  extracting  value from the competitive environment  is  a

very important part of modern business.  Many managements  in

these   shipping  lines  are  answerable  to  their   boards.

Building  their  own global supply chain,  therefore,  is  an

important  strategic  objective of  these  companies,  and  I

believe PSA should collaborate with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these big shipping lines and big corporations

have  their  own  advance schedule planning in  supply  chain

network  for  these  global players  and  they  can  maximise

upstream and downstream



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



planning  schedules and connection.  These,  I  believe,  can

overcome connectivity advantages of PSA.  Global players also

have  their  own  IT and infrastructural strengths,  we  must

remember.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been arguing for a private operation of berths

for  the last three years.  I hope the Minister's answer this

time  would  be  different.  But  I  believe  we  can  anchor

important  customers  and shipping  lines  by  tendering  out

facilities over a lease period, and also a possibility  could

be  through schemes of joint share of revenue.  In this  way,

we can establish partnership with the major players.  We must

never  under-estimate the downstream losses  of  the  linkage

effects  in  the economy arising from this loss of customers,

whether   it  is  in  the  service  sector,  freight  sector,

logistics  or ship-chandling.  Will the Minister  assure  the

House  that policies will be applied to prevent further  loss

of customers and prevent the erosion of primacy of our port?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, Singapore's status as a premier

port  in  the region and a transshipment hub is under  siege.

The  loss of Maersk Sealand last year to Tanjung Pelepas  and

now,  this year, Evergreen, means creaming off at least  $2.2

million twenty-foot equivalent units of containers, or 15% of

PSA's  annual  volume.  What is probably just as  serious  is

that  if you lose two big customers, you also lose the feeder

lines that provide the connectivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how will a line like Evergreen manage to squeeze a

good  deal is something which is quite well-known in shipping

circles.   It just went from PSA to Tanjung Pelepas back  and

forth, pushing down prices with each offer and counter offer,

until  one  side blinked.  This is a common business  tactic.

When  you have a choice, you can bargain until the other side

gives  way.  It also shows that during bad times,  no  matter

how  much  you tout your strength, in terms of efficiency  or

innovation,  or  how  far  you  are  ahead  with  information

technology  in your operations, in the end, what counts  most

to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



customers  is  cost.   Sir, when you  are  in  business,  you

sometimes  have to be prepared to take a cut in  your  profit

just  to make it attractive for you to lure a customer.   The

important thing is to get your customer first, then make  the

money later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that PSA did go through great lengths to

keep  these two major customers.  But I think the danger here

is  whether the loss of these two major lines will in the end

attract others to move ahead, others like COSCO of China  and

"K" Line of Japan.  And Mr Chay Wai Chuen has just said, what

about the downstream effects on the economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason why Maersk moved was that it could not get a

dedicated  terminal from PSA with which it  could  have  then

been  in  a  better position to manage its own logistics  and

costs.   I  join  Mr Chay in asking whether PSA  is  now  re-thinking this policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maersk Line was also attracted to Pelepas because it was

offered  a  30% ownership in the port.  Recently,  the  Prime

Minister  has  suggested  that PSA should  think  of  selling

shares to the major shipping lines.  I also read just  a  few

days  ago  that PSA's IPO has now been postponed.  Does  this

mean  that  PSA  is now re-looking at it or will  it  have  a

private placement of shares to shipping lines?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the horizon, there is a bigger threat to us.

Just  yesterday, it was announced that Thailand  has  revived

the  idea of a canal through the Kra Isthmus, and it is going

to  be  called the Thai Canal.  This idea of a canal  through

the  Kra Isthmus has been on the cards for something like 200

years.   But,  I  think, this time the Thais  mean  business.

This will cut shipping traffic through the Straits of Malacca

and  certainly  will  affect not just Singapore  but  Tanjung

Pelepas.   But I also understand that the Thais have  offered

Singapore a stake in the project.  I would like to  know  the

Government's thinking on this.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, like my colleagues, Mr Tan

and Mr Chay, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



have  spoken  before  me,  I  am  equally  concerned  by  the

departure  of Maersk Sealand and Evergreen Marine to  Tanjung

Pelepas.   While  the  Minister  had,  during  last  Monday's

Questions  for Oral Answer, explained the transfer  of  these

two  shipping  lines  would not affect our  port  positioning

dramatically, I am still a bit concerned on the impact it has

on our workers and businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the port does not stand by itself. There are so

many parties that are directly or indirectly involved in  its

downstream  operations.   The  decline  in  terms  of  volume

handled  by PSA would also mean that those working  with  the

port  - in the transportation of goods and the processing  of

them  -  would  be affected.  These are people  who  work  as

movers,  crane  operators,  bulk breakers,  distributors  and

packagers.  They face a real prospect of losing their jobs or

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure of the two shipping lines is a signal that

PSA's  current approach and strategy require serious  review.

Could  the  Minister  elaborate on the future  direction  and

fresh  efforts to ensure PSA remain competitive on  a  global

scale?  Other ports are also facing similar competition,  for

example, Pusan in Korea versus the fast growing Chinese ports

of  Shanghai  and Dailan, and Rotterdam versus  the  rest  of

Europe.   We  have to make necessary changes  to  avoid  from

following the fate of Liverpool when the America-Europe trade

pattern changed.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from facing challenge from the emerging

competitors  from  the  region,  Singapore  is  also   facing

changing  pattern of shipping routes and shipping technology.

What plan does the Ministry have to return to our port's pre-eminence?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, the port is Singapore's life line

and  supports many local businesses.  I share my  colleagues'

concern that any decrease in PSA's local freight volume  will

have  a  serious  impact  on  the other  related  sectors  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people were therefore cheered when they read the

headlines  on the back page of the Straits Times of  7th  May

2002,  which  states, "PSA stays buoyant, handling  39%  more

containers  in  April".   This appeared  remarkable.   But  a

closer  reading  of the article revealed that the  pronounced

jump  was, to a large part, due to the 182% surge in  traffic

handled by PSA's overseas terminals.  Although volumes at its

Singapore's terminals grew 8.6% in the first four  months  of

this  year, PSA handled 15.52 million TEUs for the  whole  of

last year, a fall of 8.9% over the year 2000.  Latest figures

show that PSA is handling 1.4 million TEUs in Singapore,  ie,

two   thirds   of  its  total,  and  740,000   TEUs   abroad,

representing one third of its total.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether PSA, by having

operations  in various parts of the globe, would  divert  its

management's  attention away from the local port  operations.

Overseas volume represents one third of PSA Corp's total, and

is  growing  rapidly.  If other ports are more profitable  to

manage  or  have more potential for growth, would  management

focus more on these high growth areas?  How do we ensure that

PSA  is committed to managing its Singapore's port operations

well?  Would it not be better for PSA to be split into two or

more  separate  companies,  like  Singapore  Power,  one   to

concentrate on international business and the other to  focus

on  management  of  the local port?  Or should  we  introduce

competition like expanding Jurong Port to take over  part  of

the container operations in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, a well-known economist coined

this phrase "the death of distances" a few years ago, because

efficiency,  potentially dominant air routes can be  altered,

and  airports  and airline businesses can be  very  seriously

affected.   We pride ourselves as an important air  hub  when

our  airline  -  Singapore Airlines - by its  superior  brand

name,  has been anchoring many of our hub services.  In  this

process,  Singapore, as an air hub, in competition  with  the

many regional air hubs, such as KL, Bangkok or Hong Kong, has

emerged creditably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emergence of China as a power economy and

Northeast  Asia  as  a  significant growth  region,  and  the

relative  slower  growth  of the Southeast  Asian  economies,

Singapore's  air hub location is slightly tangent.    Coupled

with this background, one must seriously ask what is the cost

competitiveness of our air hub.  One of the most powerful key

macro economic variables that has changed as a result of  the

last  Asian financial crisis was the dramatic realignment  of

exchange  rates  of  many  of our competing  countries.   The

merger  and acquisition and the rescue buy-out faced in  this

restructuring  is  over.  Today, what we are  seeing  is  the

realigned competitiveness at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can reassure us. Today, if one

were to ask many average businessmen chasing sales, it is not

surprising  that  they  will switch planes  at  many  of  our

regional  airports,  eg, KL, Bangkok,  even  Perth.   Airline

tickets  originating from these centres are much cheaper,  as

much as 50% or more than SQ.  I assume the airport facilities

are  equally cheaper than Singapore airport.  This  underlies

my concern about the competitiveness of our airport as a hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our port and our airport have been important pillars in

our  economy.  How does the Minister ensure that they get the

measure  of  the  competitive  environment,  just  like   the

policies  on  market  competition and deregulation  that  the

Government  proposed in the telecommunications sector  a  few

years  ago,  which have driven costs down and value  for  the

consumer  up?   It is not just the bottom line  of  Singapore

Airlines  that matters, but also many of the related services

in the air freight businesses that will be of concern.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although Singapore

is  just a little red little dot on the world map, it is well

known throughout the world for its excellent  airport. Changi

Airport  has, over the years, won accolades and  awards  from

various  international  agencies, and has  been  consistently

rated as the best in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With very intense competition ahead, are we able to

maintain  our  enviable position and supremacy for  the  next

decade?   First of all, the new Bangkok International Airport

will   be   opened  in  2004  and,  recently,  the  Malaysian

International  Airport  has  been  offering  very  attractive

discounts to attract more carriers to land there.  The  other

airports  in  the neighouring countries are also  seeking  to

improve their facilities and services.  I would like  to  ask

the   Minister   whether  these  competitions   will   affect

Singapore's position as an aviation hub.   What measures  are

being taken to face these competitions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of technology, airplanes can now

fly  longer  distances without having to make  midway  stops.

Many  airlines are cutting down stops in between destinations

in  long-haul  flights. I believe this must  have  a  certain

effect on us.  The growth of the airline business depends not

only  on  the efficiency and facilities of the airports,  but

also on the economic development of the country, its  tourism

industry and the convention business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these businesses will generate tourist arrivals in

Singapore,  especially if we can attract more conventions  to

be  held  in Singapore.  We should spruce up our  attractions

in  Sentosa so that we can attract more tourists.  We  should

also   step   up  our  efforts  to  sell  Singapore   as   an

international   convention venue.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister   whether   the  Ministry  of  Transport   has   any

comprehensive   plan   to   match   these   challenges,    by

strengthening our airport services to cater for  heavier  air

traffic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan Soo Khoon is not speaking. Mr

Yatiman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, the experience currently

faced  by  PSA  could  be  a good lesson  for  the  authority

responsible  for  maintaining  Singapore's  position  as  the

airline  hub  of the world.  Competition from the  region  is

getting  stronger and could be fiercer, in terms of selecting

airlines,  passengers and cargoes.  Countries in this  region

and beyond are offering services and facilities at much lower

cost.   I would like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry

has  a clear strategy to ensure the pre-eminence is retained.

And  as  SIA  is  key  player in the  development  of  Changi

International Airport as an air hub, I would also like to ask

the  Minister  to  comment whether the current  SIA's  ticket

pricing  structure  will  have  a  long-term  effect  on  our

position as a top air hub in the world.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, has the Ministry considered the

setting  up  of a trucking exchange by siting  a  depot,  for

example,  in the centre of the island to provide  a  trucking

exchange, so that containers can be switched to other  trucks

which  ply  in  that sector?  I believe productivity  can  be

improved  in this way.  Often, in a journey, a truck carrying

cargo  on  a container might ply empty on the return journey.

I  am  talking about Singapore.  The journey is twice as long

as  necessary and productivity on the return trip  is  nearly

zero.   The trucking exchange, through B2B IT infrastructure,

can   exchange  information  and  plan  schedules   so   that

participants  in this exchange can minimise  costs  and  plan

schedules.   Naturally,  to  anchor  this,  big  players  are

needed.   But once it is up, it is the small players who  can

distinctly  benefit by lower time cost and  equipment  driver

cost.  Roads also will be less heavily used with less charges

to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, such depots exist for trucking to exchange

containers running in different sectors.  Essentially, it  is

an  informational exchange with B2B business transaction, and

the  rest is a matter of schedule planning and organisational

arrangements.  IT costs are not so prohibitive these days and

the  space required, I believe, may not be so big.  The value

added to the economy can be very great, opening a new area of

business.  Trucks with container loads from other inland



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



parts  of  Asia - Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia,  Laos  -  can

perhaps  one  day even switch loads in such a logistics  hub,

and  grow  to  be  a  land  port to complement  the  port  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

first, let me thank all the Members who have spoken for their

comments  and views.  Mr Chay, Mr Tan Soo Khoon,  Mr  Yatiman

and  Mr  Ong Kian Min have expressed deep concerns about  the

competitiveness  of our port and our ability  to  retain  the

shipping lines in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such concerns are understandable. As I informed

the  House  on Monday, the port sector is a very  competitive

one, not just in our region, but all over the world.  This is

because new ports are being developed, and existing ones  are

always  striving to upgrade their services and  capabilities.

For  example, Hong Kong faces stiff competition from the  new

ports  in  Yantian,  Shekou and Chiwan.  In  such  a  dynamic

environment,  with so many competing ports,  we  must  expect

shipping  lines to adjust their ports of call  from  time  to

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure Members that PSA is no stranger to

competition.   As Members know, PSA is largely a transhipment

hub.   Transhipment containers can be handled anywhere  along

the  route  of  the  container  ships.   They  need  not   be

transhipped here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the competition, PSA continues to do well. Its

container  terminals handled 1.42 million  TEUs  (Twenty-foot

Equivalent Units) in March 2002, the highest throughput in 17

months,  and  this is despite the loss of a  major  customer.

Its  container volume grew by 8.5% for the first  quarter  of

this year.  It has an extensive network of 250 shipping lines

connecting to 600 ports in more than 100 countries around the

world.   All these shipping lines are PSA customers,  because

PSA  offers  them  a  highly  cost-effective  value-for-money

service and a shipping connectivity that few ports can match.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Members have noted, the competitive environment

is  constantly  changing.   PSA  recognises  this.   It  also

recognises  that it cannot afford to be complacent.   PSA  is

now  reviewing all facets of its business strategy, with  the

aim  of  partnering and anchoring the customers here for  the

long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PSA knows that many shipping companies are facing

low  profit  margins.  As such, the shipping lines  would  be

shopping  for  lower  prices.  PSA understands  this  and  is

committed   to  remaining  price  competitive  and  remaining

responsive to the needs of the customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong expressed worry about PSA's overseas operations

and  that  these  operations may divert management  attention

away  from  their operations in Singapore.  He proposed  that

PSA  splits  into two companies, one to manage the  Singapore

operations,  and one to manage the foreign investment.   Sir,

as  Members are aware, PSA has been investing in ports abroad

that  have  a  high growth potential.  It now has significant

port  operations  in China, Europe, India  and  Brunei.   The

container volume handled abroad now totalled about 8  million

TEUs  a  year, and is expected to grow rapidly.  The overseas

operations  give PSA greater economies of scale.   Even  more

important,  they  enable  PSA to  provide  an  international,

rather  than just local service to the shipping lines.   And,

this   is   important,   because   shipping   lines   operate

internationally.  So, PSA must be in a position to serve them

in as many places as they go to.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These advantages and synergies would be lost if PSA were

to be split into two companies, as Mr Ong has suggested.  But

I can assure Members that Singapore will remain PSA's largest

and  most  important operation for many, many years to  come.

Because of the strategic value of the port to Singapore,  not

only  will  PSA management be fully focused on it,  but  also

that  of  the Government leaders and, as we have shown  here,

the Members of the House as well.  So, PSA's management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



cannot afford to divert its attention from the operations  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay mentioned about the dedicated terminals,

whether  PSA  will  be  prepared to look  at  other  options,

including the dedicated terminals.  As I have mentioned,  PSA

is  doing  a  complete review of its business  strategy,  and

nothing should be discounted.  It will be talking to all  its

customers,  and  it  will  be as responsive  as  possible  in

meeting the needs of the customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that these are

challenging times for our port. PSA is acutely aware  of  the

ever-changing  competitive landscape.  I can assure  Mr  Chay

and  other Members of the House that PSA is not about to give

up  its  position as the number one transhipment port in  the

world.   It  will,  therefore, do all that  is  necessary  to

partner  its  shipping  clients  and  help  them  to  compete

effectively and to grow.  This, in turn, will enable  PSA  to

continue growing and to remain as a top transhipment port  in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon also asked about the Kra Canal. Sir,

contrary to the newspaper reports, we have not been consulted

or  approached about investment in the Kra Canal, and we are,

therefore, just learning from the newspaper reports  what  is

going on in Thailand with regard to the canal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the remarks of the MPs on

airport competition.  What I have said about the port applies

generally to airports as well.  Inevitably, airports  compete

with  one another, especially within the region.  As  Mr  Ang

has pointed out, countries such as Thailand and Malaysia have

recognised the economic importance of a hub airport, and  are

investing heavily in this sector.  The competition  faced  by

Changi  Airport in the years ahead can, therefore,  only  get

more intense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, despite the competition, Changi Airport is still

making good progress. Let me quote Members some figures.  For

the two months of March and April this year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



passenger  and cargo traffic at Changi Airport grew  by  1.5%

and  8.9%  respectively, compared to a year ago.  SIA's  load

factors  are up by five percentage points in March and,  what

is  more  important, airlines are adding  new  or  additional

flights  into Changi.  For example, SIA will start  new  city

links  to Las Vegas and Chicago later this year.  Qantas  has

started a new service to Rome through Singapore, while  China

Eastern Airlines has doubled its flights to Shanghai to 14  a

week  from seven a week.  In the next few months, Changi will

welcome  Australian Airlines, which is the new subsidiary  of

Qantas,  and it will be starting a new service to  Cairns  in

Queensland.   And Swiss International, the new  airline  that

replaced Swissair, has also started operations from Changi to

Zurich.   Changi's air cargo network has also expanded,  with

CargoLux  and  Northwest starting links to Budapest,  and  to

Cincinnati in the USA, respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new city links and services are part of our never-ending efforts to improve Singapore's connectivity.

Presently,  58 scheduled airlines serve Singapore, connecting

us to 139 city links in 50 countries.  This high connectivity

is  a  key reason why 28 million passengers used Changi  last

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, while the prospects for the aviation sector are

improving,  we have to continue upgrading our facilities  and

improving  our  services,  in order  to  keep  ahead  of  the

competition.  So, what will we do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will continue with our policy of enhancing our

infrastructure  to  cater  to the  ever-increasing  needs  of

airlines and passengers.  When Terminal 3 (T3) opens  at  the

end  of  2006  or early 2007, we will have a state-of-the-art

terminal  that will increase Changi's capacity by about  one-third.   The  other  two  existing  terminals  will  not   be

neglected.    Expansion  works for T1 will  be  completed  in

September  this  year,  and we will be  investing  some  $240

million  after that to improve T2, to make sure that all  our

facilities are really up to scratch and are at the  forefront

of service and technology.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in building the new infrastructure, we are aware

that  we have to cater to the latest technologies that  might

come  along and, therefore, works are underway to ensure that

our   runway  and  terminal  facilities  will  be   able   to

accommodate  the  new  Airbus  A380,  which  can  carry   555

passengers,  and  which  should  be  the  largest   passenger

aircraft  in the world.  SIA and other airlines have  ordered

this  aircraft and they will be flying this aircraft  through

Singapore  and,  therefore, we must be ready to  accept  this

aircraft.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have also mentioned the need for Changi to

be  cost-effective and cost competitive.   We  have,  indeed,

always  been  conscious about the need to provide  value  for

money to our airlines and to our passengers.  In fact, we  do

this  without demands being placed on us.  For example,  CAAS

extended  the  off-Budget measures, such as a 10%  rebate  on

landing  fees,  15% rebates on office and warehouse  rentals,

and  a  15% rebate for concessionaires until the end of  this

year. The rebates cost CAAS about $17.4 million.  But what is

more  important  is  that the rebates have  brought  Changi's

landing  fees close to 1981 levels, ie, what we were charging

20 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAAS also has several schemes that enable new airlines,

or  airlines that start new services, to enjoy heavy  rebates

on  landing  fees and grants for several years.  Since  their

introduction in 1998, about $7 million has been awarded under

these schemes to 18 airlines.  I can assure Members that CAAS

will  continue  to  review  these  incentive  programmes  and

partnership programmes with the airlines, and we will  tailor

them further to suit the needs of the individual airlines and

anchor them here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have also expressed concerns about

the  pricing  policy of SIA and how it is forcing  passengers

from Singapore to fly elsewhere to obtain better deals.  As I

have  told the House before, CAAS does not intervene  in  the

pricing policies of SIA or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



any  other airline that operates through Singapore.  Airlines

are free to set their own airfares.  But what is important to

note  is  that the aviation sector in Singapore is very  open

and  very  competitive, with multiple airlines  competing  on

many  of  the routes.  Air travellers can, therefore,  choose

the  airline that best suits their requirements in  terms  of

service,  price and flight times.  Many airlines offer  fares

for direct flights to popular destinations that are, in fact,

much,  much  lower  than  SIA's.  With  such  attractive  and

competitive choices, there is really no need for Singaporeans

to   transfer   at   other  airports,  en  route   to   their

destinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members some examples. Let us say to

Bangkok.   There  are 11 airlines that fly  to  Bangkok  from

Changi,  and the price of an economy class return ticket  can

range  from  only  $200  to  as  high  as  about  $400.   So,

passengers  have  a  full range to choose  from.   Similarly,

passengers  flying  to Jakarta can choose from  13  airlines,

with  ticket prices ranging from $580 at the high end, to  as

low as only $160.  So, tremendous choices are available.  And

Singaporeans,  especially  Singaporean  businessmen  who  are

looking to cut costs, should actually shop wisely.  They will

be rewarded if they do shop around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will continue to work with CAAS to

attract  as  many  airlines as possible to  Changi,  so  that

Singaporeans  can  have a wider range  of  choices  and  more

competitive prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay touched on the logistics area. He

mentioned  the existence of trucking depots or dry depots  in

Europe,  where trucks can then exchange their load  in  order

not  to  have  to return empty.  This concept is  very,  very

applicable  to countries with large land mass,  because  then

the distances are huge, and that is why we see such dry ports

or  land  depots in the USA, Europe and even in China.   They

are  sprouting up in many parts of China.  The potential  for

such  "land  hubs" in Singapore is not that good, because  we

are too compact.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is merit in helping industry players

better  deploy their assets as best as possible,  within  the

company  and  between companies, as this will  then  help  to

ensure better asset utilisation and help to lower costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that, at present, there are two Vehicle

Scheduling  and  Tracking Systems (VSTS)  in  place  to  help

companies  better  optimise their  truck  usage.   These  are

provided by Transnet and Sunray, and these systems are linked

to  PSA's IT systems as well.  So, not only can they  use  it

for  their own usage, but they can link it to PSA,  so  that,

for  cargo  that is going through PSA, it helps to  make  the

data  exchange  seamless and electronic.  We will  definitely

encourage more of such systems to be developed, so that  they

can help our companies better deploy their assets.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, it has been more

than  six  years since the LTA published its White  Paper  on

World Class Land Transport System.  Have we achieved what  we

spelt out in the paper?  Let us take a brief close look.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have expanded our MRT network to serve the heavy

transit corridors.  We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



built the LRT system in Bukit Panjang.  We have improved  our

road  network system, linking the major parts of  the  island

with  expressways.  It seems, however, as  the  Chinese  say,

"lei  sheng  da, yu dian xiao" - much said and  little  done.

Those  projects  completed are also not perfect.  There  were

breaches  and  breakdowns.  Some  examples  were:   the  many

breakdowns  of  the  LRT system, the problems  with  the  MRT

trains,  cutting  down the frequency of the  MRT  service  to

Changi Airport, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the authorities and agencies took

immediate  steps to address the problems when they  surfaced.

But could they have been prevented in the first place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has made changes to the vehicle

registration and tax system.  We can expect to see  that  car

ownership will rise and more vehicles will be on the roads in

the  future. What are LTA's plans to absorb this increase  in

the number of vehicles?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport infrastructure is like the blood

circulation  system in our body.  It connects our  residents'

homes,  workplaces and places of recreation.  It must  remain

healthy  and free flowing so that our nation can grow.   What

are  the Ministry's plans for the future development  of  our

roads and transportation infrastructure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Ministry has announced its intention

to  put  in  place a comprehensive Rail Transit System  (RTS)

network,  there has not been a firm commitment  on  the  date

when the network will be in place. With the plans to increase

car  population  and with the fact that most  of  our  people

today  have  to  spend  more  than  one  hour  taking  public

transport from home to the workplace, it is critical that the

RTS network be expanded more expeditiously, so as to make the

public  transport an attractive alternative  to  the  private

transport.   When can we expect the RTS to link  up  all  our

housing  estates?  If the Ministry is unable to put in  place

the RTS network quickly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



it  should consider alternatives, such as maybe, the mini-bus

scheme in Hong Kong to make the public transport in Singapore

more attractive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, in the latest Budget, the

Government  has reduced the duties and registration  fees  on

buying   cars   and   re-peg   the  Preferential   Additional

Registration  Fee (PARF) to the ARF component instead  of  to

the  OMV component.  The rationale was to shift the ownership

cost to usage cost.  In adjusting this rate to peg ARF a  bit

lower,  from  140% to 130% of the OMV and reduce  the  excise

duty  by 11%, the total upfront savings on taxes on new  cars

is  about 21% of the OMV.  This benefits new buyers, although

I  hasten to add I am not sure how it will be negated by  the

bidding on COE prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to more usage cost, as proposed, will mean

that  previous car owners are unduly penalised by  having  to

suffer  a  lower resale value of their cars because new  cars

now cost lower, because of the reduced cost, and have to bear

the  likely  increased usage cost as  well.   In  our  legacy

structure, the cost of owning a car has to be shared  between

ownership  and usage cost.  With the lowering of  the  excise

duty  and  the ARF, I am afraid the Government is  signalling

another  round  of increase in ERP and usage cost,  including

increased  recovery rate for car parking.  I  hope  that  the

Minister can assure the House that even as he is now  relying

more on usage, he should be wary of letting more cars on  the

roads  in  order  to tax them more as they crowd  the  roads.

There  is a trade-off between the pain on one-time high price

of  purchase of a car versus the daily grind and pain of high

ERP  and  parking charges as more cars clog  the  roads  with

lower ownership cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge him to be more cautious in dismantling the

current  parity, even as the carrot of lower upfront cost  is

dangled.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> The Government uses

two ways to control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



congestion  on  our  roads.   One  is  the  control  of   car

population, and the other is to control their usage. We  have

heard  that the Government is switching its emphasis  of  car

control  from  that of ownership to that  of  car  usage.   I

believe  that  whatever method the Government uses,  the  car

population  in  Singapore shall be at  a  fairly  high  level

because  motorcars  are  a good source  of  revenue  for  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost everyone in this House, I would say, drives a car

and  we  all know that our roads are not entirely congestion-free.   In fact, there are perpetual traffic jams in  certain

of  our  roads.  Prominent examples that come to mind readily

are  the  CTE towards Braddell Road and at Toa Payoh PIE  and

Upper  Serangoon  Road.  I must say that  the  quota  system,

imposed   by  the  Government,  supposedly  to  control   car

congestion  on  our  roads,  to me,  is  more  a  system  for

collecting revenue than the control of traffic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the so-called quota system, the cost of motorcars

in  Singapore  has  escalated to levels where  the  costs  of

motorcars  in our country are the highest in the world.   The

Government does not seem to be unduly concerned or worried of

the  high  car prices in Singapore. Why should it?  High  car

prices  are good business for the Government.  The prices  of

COE  shall  be  higher when the car prices are high  and  the

Government can rake in more money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to reduce taxes on motorcars. I

say to car owners, "Do not be too elated", for this reduction

of  revenue, most likely, shall be made good by the increases

in  revenue  from  car  usage.  More ERP  gantries  shall  be

constructed,  like  those which have already  gone  up  along

Dunearn Road, the cost of HDB car park lots and car park lots

outside  HDB estates throughout the island shall  be  quickly

increased.   As far as I can see, car ownership in  Singapore

shall never be cheap.  The Government has used motorcars as a

phenomenal  revenue source and it shall continue  to  exploit

that  source  for  revenue  with more  creative  means.   The

Government has earned a lot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



of  money  from  motorcars and I think the Government  should

plough  back  some  of those revenues to the  people  in  the

following ways:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government should build bicycle lanes in

all  HDB  housing estates so that residents there can  safely

cycle  in  their estates, whether to go shopping or to  visit

community centres, or whether to go for a swim, visit friends

or whatever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in other countries like Denmark and Holland

use  the  humble  bicycle extensively as a  mode  of  travel.

When  costs  of  motorcars remain so prohibitively  high  and

beyond the reach of the ordinary HDB heartlanders, I am  sure

that  the construction of safe bicycle lanes shall be  gladly

welcomed  by  the people there.  I hope the Government  shall

look  into the possibility of constructing safe bicycle lanes

in all HDB housing estates.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion I would like to make is the

Government  should persuade bus companies to use low-capacity

buses to ply in private housing estates to pick up passengers

to bring them to bus-stands or to the nearest MRT stations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, could you please finish your

second suggestion quickly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have one more suggestion. I wish

that  the  park-and-ride idea be revived as  land  costs  are

high.   The  Government can construct high-rise parking  lots

near  MRT  stations so that car owners need  not  drive  into

town.   They can park their motor vehicles in those high-rise

parks  and ride the MRT or bus to town.  In this way, traffic

problems in town can be abated.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Mr Chairman, I am sure that

following the review on the car tax announced by the  Finance

Minister  on  3rd  May, 2002, many car owners  and  potential

buyers will have to recalculate the cost of owning cars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new tax on cars gave upfront reduction in terms

of  excise duties and ARF.  As the time-line value of the car

is  being moved from OMV to ARF, private car owners who scrap

their cars before eight years can get more benefit.  But  the

same  cannot be said for taxis.  While it costs more  to  car

owners  because  the  PARF is lower, it costs  more  to  taxi

drivers  when the burden of tax is shifted from ownership  to

usage.  This means that the taxi drivers will have to pay for

the  increase of the ERP charges and GST.  On the  one  hand,

the  taxi drivers are concerned over the possible impact this

must  have  on  them, while on the other, the  commuters  are

worried that they may have to pay more taxi fare for the  use

of  taxis.  Could the Minister clarify that this is  not  the

case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the light of this development, I would like to

ask  the  Ministry  whether there is an  overall  package  to

minimise the cost to commuters using taxis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I share Mr Chay's concerns.

With  the  change in motor vehicle taxes, the PARF rebate  is

now  pegged  to the ARF actually paid on each car.   I  would

like  to  ask if the Minister could clarify whether this  new

way  of calculating the PARF rebate applies to existing motor

vehicles  which  were registered before May  2002.   When  an

existing car registered before May 2002 is scrapped,  is  the

owner  entitled to PARF rebate, calculated based on the car's

OMV,  which was the case at the time when he bought the  car,

or is it based on the car's ARF?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to reduce ARF and excise duties and extend

ERP  is  a double whammy for existing vehicle owners.   Apart

from  having to bear a drop in the value of their cars,  they

would  also be subject to higher usage charges.  At least  43

gantry  points  have been set up, the latest addition  is  at

Dunearn  Road.  What is the Ministry's plan for the  roll-out

of  ERP and in doing so, will it take into consideration  its

impact on existing vehicle owners?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Mr Chairman, the car tax structure

has  been  shifted from the burden of tax from  ownership  to

usage.   As the vehicle population grows, there is  a  strong

possibility that our roads would be more congested.  I  could

foresee  more ERP gantry points being built.  Many  motorists

have  discovered that despite the imposition of ERP  charges,

some  highways,  eg,  the CTE, ECP and  the  AYE,  are  still

congested  at  certain times of the day.  In  addition,  some

fringe roads have also experienced increase in the volume  of

traffic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the prospect of these fringe roads being imposed

with ERP in the next five to ten years?  What can be done  to

reduce  the  burden of usage on motorists?   Apart  from  the

imposition  of the ERPs, may I know whether the  Ministry  is

considering  other options such as constructing double-decker

roads or flyovers similar to the one along Telok Blangah Road

and Keppel Road, to ease the traffic jam, instead of imposing

ERPs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min, you have 3 cuts back to

back.  You can take them altogether.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I would like to take the 3 cuts

together, but to tackle the 2nd one on bus services first  as

this is more important, in case I get "guillotined".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as MPs, when we do our rounds of block visits and

meeting  residents,  one  issue  that  attracts  a   lot   of

complaints  is bus service.  Currently, there  are  only  two

companies, SBS and TIBS, providing scheduled bus services  in

the  housing  estates.  Whenever there are requests  for  new

routes,  the common reason for rejection by SBS is  that  the

proposed  route  would not be commercially viable.   But  who

determines   that   the  proposed  service   would   not   be

commercially  viable?   It is SBS,  based  on  its  own,  and

perhaps inefficient, or archaic method of operations.  Is the

SBS way the best, or the perfect way of doing things?  Surely

not.   Surely it can be improved.  But how do we improve  it?

Can someone else with a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



idea, a different mode of operations or business model,  come

up  with  a better way of running that service?  I  am  quite

sure it can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to offer a few suggestions as a layman.

First, why should feeder bus services be operated by SBS?   I

would  suggest  that the public bus service  be  restructured

into two or more smaller networks.  SBS can operate the trunk

services, and be like NOL, the main shipping liner calling on

hub  ports  and  have  smaller vessels  feeding  to  it.   In

shipping, it does not make commercial sense for a main  liner

to  run  feeder  services.  Smaller  feeder  vessels  can  be

operated by smaller operators who are more familiar with  the

local  conditions.   This can be done without  much  loss  of

efficiencies or integration.  In any case, there is not  such

a  high  degree  of  integration in the first  place  between

feeder,  trunk and MRT services.  It is not as if a passenger

can  time it so precisely to catch the 7.45 am feeder,  which

will bring him to the station to catch the 8.03 MRT train.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I have an RC Zone, whose residents have been

complaining, and I have been complaining, for many years that

the  SBS  feeder  bus  service  for  that  area  is  bad  and

inefficient.  At times they have to wait 15 minutes  for  the

bus  to  arrive,  and then it goes on this  circuitous  route

before  reaching the bus interchange.  There has been  little

improvement over the years.  The feeder bus fare is 65 cents.

If  you take a taxi from that zone to the bus interchange, it

costs  $3.   So, if five persons come together  and  share  a

taxi,  they  would  have  broken  even.   Of  course,  it  is

difficult for them to get five persons together at  the  same

time.   But  if you operate a mini-bus and make  small  loops

between  the  interchange and the zone, picking up,  say,  10

passengers at a time, I think you can make money.   The  math

is  quite straightforward.  Taxis are considered expensive to

operate.  But if a taxi can charge $3 per trip, and the mini-bus collects more passengers, it should do better.  Would not

it  be  better  to have buses of a suitable size  and  making

smaller  loops, instead of a big bus making a long circuitous

route?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, SBS runs its services in a hub and spokes manner,

the  hubs being the bus interchanges and MRT stations.   This

looks  good on paper.  This assumes that every commuter wants

to  take a trunk service or the MRT to get out of the estate.

But  how  about intra-town travel?  Could not a neighbourhood

centre  be  a hub?  Could not there be more mini-hubs  within

the estate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, SBS started intra-town feeder services that

basically  connect two feeder services together.  They  bring

commuters  from one end of the estate to the  centre  and  it

goes  on  to  the  other end of the estate.   Now,  how  many

passengers actually need to go from one end of the estate  to

the  other end?  SBS told me, "actually not many".   I  think

residents  are more likely to want to travel to an  adjoining

precinct if there is something like a neighbourhood centre or

school there.  Sir, I think this goes to show that it is  not

one-size-fits-all and we need local operators  who  are  more

familiar  with  the  conditions,  with  the  needs   of   the

residents, to be able to provide a better service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we reorganise feeder

services  into smaller geographical regional hubs  and  allow

for more competition so that new methods of running a service

for  that  area  can be implemented.  If an  entrepreneur  is

convinced that he can find lower cost solutions that can meet

the  needs of the commuters and is prepared to put his  money

where  his  ideas are, why not let him try it?  If  we  worry

that  he  may  not  be  viable  and  fold  up,  thus  causing

disruption to commuters, should not the same worry also apply

to electricity suppliers and telecommunication providers?  If

we  worry about him cherry-picking the profitable routes  and

neglecting  the  less viable ones, then may  I  suggest  that

maybe  the incumbent operators can be given a call option  to

buy  over the route at a pre-determined valuation.  So if the

entrepreneur takes the risk, proves that the route is viable,

the  commuters  would be happy and he would be  happy  to  be

rewarded  for  the risk taken.  This is already happening  in

other industries, where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



nimble small boys try it, prove that the idea works, and cash

out by selling to the bigger boys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should liberalise and allow new players, with

creative  ways  of running a service to come in  to  compete.

Liberalising  the public bus services can help raise  service

standards  and serve commuters better.  Maybe even Virgin  is

interested and wants to bundle with its mobile phones.   This

would be in line with the liberalisation of services in other

sectors.  In today's economy, when virtually everything  from

legal services to telecommunications to banking, and even the

provision  of  basic  utilities, are opening  up  to  promote

competition and consumer choice, I am not convinced that more

players  cannot  be introduced to provide better  public  bus

services.   This  must  be  one  of  the  last  bastions   of

protectionism.  There is not even direct competition  between

TIBS and SBS as they serve different routes.

especially those who live by the side of the tracks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bukit Gombak, near the Guilin View, residents are

frequently complaining to me about the noise generated by the

matter  to the Ministry of Transport.  May I ask the Ministry

whether it has any plan to reduce the noise level and improve

on the situation.  Is there any regular monitoring and review

to ensure that the noise level is within the permitted level,

especially when the trains travel within the housing estates?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask whether there will be an overall plan for

our nation-wide public transportation system, upon completion

of the North-East line.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> The Bukit

Panjang  LRT is designed to provide people from Bukit Panjang

and  Chua  Chua Kang a rapid and reliable means to access  to

the  MRT  service  in  Chua Chua Kang.   After  the  LRT  has

operated for almost three years, one would wonder whether the

LRT  is  reliable.  Based on a newspaper report that the  LRT

services had been interrupted 50 times in its less than three

years  of operation, it worked out to be one failure in every

three  weeks.  This is highly unacceptable and could  not  be

considered   as   a   reliable  service.    It   has   caused

inconvenience to the residents as they could not rely on  the

LRT to get them to work and to school on time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent breakdowns imply that the LRT system

selected  does not meet the objective of providing a reliable

service at a high commuter volume.  As far as reliability  is

concerned,  the  unmanned system is not based on  well-tested

and  proven  technology as otherwise it should  not  fail  so

often.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, what are the actions

his  Ministry will take to ensure that the LRT would be  free

from breakdowns in the future.  As we are building a new  LRT

in  Sengkang,  is the new one going to be more reliable?   We

know  that  the  LRT  is  a  rapid link  from  the  place  of

population  catchment to the MRT stations.  In no way  should

the  LRT play the role of internal feeder service because  of

its   rigid   route.   From  my  understanding,   after   the

reshuffling of the existing bus services and the introduction

of  the LRT, I realise that the LRT built for Chua Chua  Kang

and  Bukit Panjang has many shortcomings.  One, there  is  no

coordination  between the road design system, the  LRT  route

and  the bus services, right from the beginning of the design

stage.   Two,  the LRT tries to take in as many commuters  as

possible,  even  though the LRT route  is  not  ideal  for  a

certain particular population catchment.  Three, the decision

makers   are  not  hesitant  in  sacrificing  the  commuters'

interest for the sake of increasing ridership of the LRT.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular reason given is LRT's viability and the

avoidance  of duplication.  A typical example is bus  service

307  in  Chua Chu Kang.  Ever since it was withdrawn, it  has

caused  a  lot of problems for the people - shopping  centres

lack  business,  people's style of travel has  been  changed,

people go less often to the park where they normally do their

morning  exercises,  and  they  do  not  patronise  our   six

coffeeshops  in  Teck  Whye Shopping Centre  anymore.   As  a

result,  it  has  caused a lot of discontent and  unhappiness

among  the  people.   After two years of withdrawal  of  this

feeder  service,  I am happy to note that  the  Ministry  has

eventually decided that they have to look after the  interest

and  convenience of the people and reinstated bus service 307

just last weekend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson learned from the social impact of the first

LRT  system in my Constituency will be a very valuable lesson

for  the next LRT in Sengkang.  Will the Minister ensure that

in  any  future LRT development, there is a good coordination

between  the  road  network design, LRT  route  and  the  bus

service,  before any intention of building a  new  LRT?   The

interest of the commuters must be ---

must  not sacrifice the commuters' interest for the  sake  of

increasing the ridership of the LRT.  The LRT is a rapid link

for  the  people and in no way should it serve  as  a  feeder

service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang commented on

the  White Paper that much has been said but little done.   I

seek to disagree with him.  In fact, much has been done.  And

more  has  been done than what has been set out in the  White

Paper.   In  terms of the rail network, we expect to  have  a

much  wider rail network than has been laid down in the White

Paper.  It is going to be more than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



two-and-a-half  times longer than what was  set  out  in  the

White  Paper.   In terms of road building, we are,  in  fact,

ahead of what was stated in the White Paper.  So, actually it

is little said, much done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on the key point which most of the

Members  have spoken about, which is on the shift in the  car

policy towards more usage restraint measures, rather than  on

ownership cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership cost affects all car owners, regardless of how

much  they drive and how much they actually add to  the  road

congestion.  Usage restraint measures are more focused,  more

efficient  and more equitable.  Car owners pay  according  to

what  they  use and how much they add to the road congestion.

ERP  has been found to be able to divert car traffic from the

congested  roads during peak period and shift the traffic  to

the  less  busy period.  So the shift to the usage  restraint

measures   will  therefore  bring  about  a  more   effective

utilisation of our limited roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay has asked that we be aware of the impact of

having more cars on the roads because this will then increase

the usage cost.  We are indeed aware of that, which is why we

are   introducing  the  shift  gradually  so  that  the   car

population  will  still  be kept under  control  and  not  be

allowed to expand significantly.  The 5,000 COEs that we  are

adding  should be seen in the context of the overall  vehicle

population.   We  have  a total vehicle population  of  about

700,000 vehicles on the roads.  So the additional 5,000  that

we  are  adding will only add 0.7% to our overall population,

and  I  do  not think this will increase the congestion  very

much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the MPs have asked about the expansion of the

ERP  system.   With regard to the expansion of ERP  coverage,

LTA  had announced in May 1999 the Phase 2 expansion  of  the

ERP  system.   This will form a second ERP cordon  along  the

outer  ring  roads.  Existing car owners have therefore  been

given ample notice that the ERP coverage will be expanded  in

due course.  A total of seven gantries were implemented under

phase 2A in September



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



1999.   Gantries  at  the remaining 10-12 locations  will  be

erected as and when traffic conditions warrant it, ie, it  is

a  congestion control and we will only implement ERP at those

spots when the congestion on those spots warrants it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman mentioned that there are heavy traffic jams

at certain roads - and I think Mr Chiam said the same thing - at  CTE  and Toa Payoh PIE interchange.  Based on our studies

where  there are ERP gantries, the traffic along those  roads

may  be  heavy,  but they are still within the optimal  speed

range  established  by  LTA for the efficient  use  of  those

roads, ie, they are above the speed of 45 kph.  I think where

the  roads  are  heavily  congested now  are  really  in  the

evenings.  CTE is almost like a parking lot in some stretches

and this is because we do not have ERP during those evenings.

I  would like to inform Members that my Ministry and LTA  are

now  looking  seriously at how to relieve the  congestion  on

those  roads.   Where there is no scope  for  us  to  further

expand those roads, one alternative is to introduce ERP there

in  the  evening  hours as well.  That would  help  to  shift

traffic to those roads that are not so congested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern about the impact on

existing  car owners when ERP is expanded, ie, when we  shift

more  to  usage restraint, the existing car owners  have  not

benefited  from  the lower upfront costs, and therefore  they

have  not  benefited from the change.  It is true that  these

owners  did not benefit from the lower ownership costs.   But

they  will  still benefit when the road tax for all  cars  is

reduced by about 20% from September this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as Members will recall, when ERP was introduced in

1998,  the  Government had announced that  road  tax  rebates

would  be  given  for  a  period of five  years.   The  final

instalment  of the 5-year rebate package is due in  September

this  year.   I am happy to inform Members that  we  will  be

giving a road tax rebate of $100 per passenger car unit (PCU)

this  year.   This  rebate is the same  as  last  year's  and

together with the coming road tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



reduction, this will help motorists adjust to the progressive

shift to the usage restraint measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong asked about the PARF for cars registered before

May 2002.  I am happy to inform him that cars bought with pre-May 2002 COEs will enjoy the PARF rebate calculated based  on

the OMV.  This is only fair as they bought the COEs under the

old ARF and PARF rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo and Mr Yatiman asked about our plans for

upgrading  the  road network in view of the  growing  vehicle

population.  There are numerous road projects underway today.

These   projects   include  the  Braddell  Road/Bishan   Road

Interchange,  PIE/Adam Road Interchange, upgrading  of  Upper

Bukit Timah Road, the Telok Blangah Semi Expressway, and  the

CTE/Braddell  Road  Interchange,  which  will  also  help  to

relieve  the traffic on the CTE when all these are completed.

Also, the 12-km Kallang/Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE), which is

a  very  important project, will be completed in 2007.   This

project, when completed, will also help to relieve a  lot  of

the  traffic from the CTE.  All these on-going projects  will

cost  almost  $2  billion.  In addition, LTA will  embark  on

several  road upgrading and development projects  worth  $570

million over the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must also alert MPs that there is a limit to what

we  can  do,  because we have a limited  amount  of  land  in

Singapore.   Already, roads take up 12%  of  our  total  land

area,  and  this  is  the  same  amount  of  land  used   for

residential  purposes.   Going  forward,  we  will  have   to

increasingly rely on ERP to manage road congestion and ensure

that  our limited roads are used optimally.  But we all  need

to  travel  for  one reason or another.  The Government  will

therefore ensure that commuters have an efficient alternative

to  cars.  Our priority, therefore, is to continue to  expand

the  rail network, as this will be the backbone of our public

transport  system.   SMS Khaw Boon Wan  will  shortly  update

Members on the development of the rail network.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on now to Mr Chiam's remarks. Mr Chiam

went  on  a very convoluted argument about car ownership  and

revenues.  With our limited land, I think even Mr Chiam  will

agree, we have no choice but to control car ownership.  If he

is able to give us a better alternative on how to control car

ownership without imposing a cost on the owners of  cars,  we

will be very happy to review his suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the system we have for controlling of car ownership

is  not  a  revenue-generating system.  Yes, we  do  generate

revenue from that, but that is not the primary interest.  The

primary  interest is to make sure that, firstly, we  have  an

efficient  system  for transporting people around  Singapore.

Private  cars is one element of that system.  But the  public

transport  system is an even more important element  of  that

policy.   Having allowed the people to meet their aspirations

to own cars, how do we make sure that our roads do not become

giant  parking lots that we see in many countries?  The  only

way is to have congestion control which, in our case, is ERP.

The  ERP  has worked and we will continue to have to rely  on

the ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has made three suggestions. First, he brought

up  the issue of people in Amsterdam using bicycles.  I  have

been to Amsterdam before and if I were living in a climate as

pleasant as Amsterdam, I will be very happy to ride a bicycle

to  work  too.   But,  unfortunately,  the  reality  is  that

Singapore  is  too hot a place to be riding  bicycles.   Yes,

people  do  ride bicycles for leisure but I think few  people

would want to ride to work and arrive at work sweating away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for bicycle lanes to be built in the HDB

estates.  Sir, already we are so land short.  We are  already

struggling  to find spaces for parks, recreation  usage,  and

residential usage.  It would be very difficult for us to  put

aside  land  for  bicycle lanes.  In any  case,  in  the  HDB

estates,  during the day time hours, or during  most  of  the

day,  other  than the peak hours in the morning and  evening,

the roads are actually quite sparsely used.  Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



it  is  very safe for people to be riding bicycles.  In fact,

many  of my senior citizens do ride bicycles around, and they

have  never  complained  to me about the  dangers  of  riding

bicycles  around.   But they do not  use  it  as  a  form  of

transport, even though they have bicycles.  They use it as  a

form  of  leisure and they ride it during the  cooler  hours,

rather  than  at noon time when they have to go  out  to  get

their lunch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked us to persuade bus companies to use

low capacity buses for private estates.  Private estates are,

in  fact, free to set up their own cooperative and hire a bus

to  run  a  shuttle  service  from  the  estate  to  the  key

amenities.   In  fact, some condominiums  are  already  doing

that.   They  hire  a shuttle bus service that  shuttles  the

residents  to  either  the shopping centres  or  to  the  MRT

station.  So they are free to do that.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked us to expand the Park-and-Ride location.

Sir, we do have the Park-and-Ride locations.  The feedback we

have  is  that  they are still not well used.   If  there  is

additional demand, we will definitely be very happy  to  look

into  that.  So if Mr Chiam has got suggestions as  to  which

Park-and-Ride carpark is overly utilised, do let us know,  we

will definitely look into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yatiman talked about the impact on taxi drivers

and  that  taxi drivers will not benefit and, in  fact,  they

have to pay more from the increased ERP.  It is true that  if

there are more ERP gantries, and if the ERP rates still go up

because  of  the increased congestion, the taxi  drivers  may

have  to incur more expenditure on the ERP charges.  But this

is  because  of  the  driving patterns of the  taxi  drivers.

Today, taxi drivers tend to cruise around even when they  are

empty   looking  for  passengers.   Increasingly,  the   taxi

companies and taxi drivers will have to review their  driving

habits  and driving patterns.  They may have to rely more  on

the  call  service and wait for the passenger to  call  them,

rather  than  cruise  around and pay for  the  increased  ERP

charges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to Mr Ong Kian Min's points on the

feeder  bus  service.  Sir, he proposed that  we  review  the

possibility  of introducing competition into the  feeder  bus

service because quite often he gets complaints from residents

that  the  existing bus companies are unable  to  meet  their

expectations.  First, let me explain to Members a little  bit

about  the  public bus framework.  The current  bus  industry

framework allows the basic bus operators, ie, SBS Transit and

TIBS,  to achieve economies of scale.  This enables  them  to

maintain  affordable  fares, while  complying  with  the  bus

service standards set by the PTC.  The service standards  set

by  PTC  include quality of buses, service frequency and  the

maximum number of transfers allowed on a particular trip.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, PTC imposes universal service

obligations on the operators.  This means that they  have  to

provide  a  comprehensive network of bus services,  including

regular  bus  services,  to the less  populated  areas,  even

though these routes may not be profitable.  The bus operators

therefore  have to balance between the profitable  areas  and

routes  that  are not profitable.  People living in  sparsely

populated  areas,  or working in newly developed  areas,  are

therefore not penalised by having to pay higher fares, or  to

be  deprived of a public bus service.  But that does not mean

that  we do not see a role for private bus operators, and  we

do  not have private bus operators operating in certain niche

areas and on the Scheme B services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bus routing is a very complicated business. There

is  a  certain amount of ridership and the ridership  can  be

best  met by a certain deployment of bus resources.   If  you

deploy  more  bus resources, yes, the residents  will  get  a

better  service.  But more bus resources with lower ridership

per  bus  must  translate into a higher fare.  It  cannot  be

having  fewer passengers and being able to charge a low  fare

unless  the  fares  are being subsidised.   I  do  not  think

private  bus  companies  are in the business  of  subsidising

ridership.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, let me inform Members that we are

open  to  the  idea  of introducing competition  in  the  bus

industry.   As  Mr Ong has mentioned, one possibility  is  to

allow private bus operators to operate a feeder service on  a

pilot  basis.   Unlike  trunk  routes,  feeder  services  are

confined to a certain geographical area and therefore  it  is

easier to monitor them and to see how they are performing and

to  get  feedback from the commuters.  I would  be  happy  to

invite  Members  who are not happy with their current  feeder

bus  service, if they are willing, to volunteer  his  or  her

estate  for this pilot project.  Just let me know and I  will

ask PTC to explore this option with him or her.  Perhaps,  Mr

Ong may be the first guinea pig for this project.  But please

make sure that our GRC members agree with you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have replied to all the questions. I

will  now  ask  SMS  Khaw to reply to the  questions  on  the

trains.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said that transport

infrastructure  should  be  free  flowing  like   the   blood

circulation  system.  I totally concur.  To achieve  such  an

outcome  requires careful planning and sound  execution.   Mr

Yeo  is  again correct to say that an efficient Rapid Transit

System  (RTS)  network is an important part of our  transport

infrastructure and its timely expansion is critical to making

public   transport  an  attractive  alternative  to   private

transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our RTS network has reached 100 km. We are

increasing it by 50% to about 150 km by 2006.  This would  be

achieved when we complete the following projects.  First, the

North-East Line and the Sengkang LRT by the end of this year.

Second,  the Punggol LRT by the end of 2004.  And third,  the

first  two  stages of Circle Line by 2006.  Beyond that,  our

plan is to further expand the network by another 60% to about

240 km by 2015.  By then, almost 90% of our City Centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



and  practically every job or employment would be within  400

metres  of  the  nearest MRT station.  This is  an  ambitious

project and requires tens of billions of dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ambitious plan of this kind will need to be executed

in  phases.  First, we will complete the remaining stages  of

Circle  Line  by  the year 2010, at the end of  this  decade.

Next,  we  will  build several new lines  which  are  now  at

various stages of planning.  They are, first, the Bukit Timah

Line  to serve the Bukit Panjang, Upper Bukit Timah and Bukit

Timah  areas.  Second, the Eastern Region Line, to complement

the  existing  East-West Line in the East and,  finally,  the

Jurong Region Line, which is a light rail system to serve the

residents in Jurong as well as NTU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggested that we expedite the

expansion of the network.  We will do our best, provided  the

economy performs well.  We can realise these plans within the

next 15 years or earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about the noise created by trains. As

we  build more rails and bring them closer to the people,  we

cannot  avoid  some degree of noise pollution.  To  eliminate

it, we have to stop building apartments near to the roads, or

MRT  tracks.  In that case, then there will be no Guilin View

in  Mr  Ang Mong Seng's constituency.  In Singapore, we  know

this  is  not  practical.  So we have  to  accept  that  some

apartment  blocks will be subjected to some noise  pollution.

But  we  must certainly do our best to cut down the level  of

pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang spoke specifically about the noise level created

by  MRT trains around the Bukit Gombak Station.  He wrote  to

me.   I went there to take a look.  Within 200 metres of this

station,  there  is this Guilin View, a private  condominium,

and  about  a dozen HDB blocks located near there.   We  have

tried  to  cut  down  the noise levels  by  adopting  several

measures.   First,  LTA sets very strict criteria  when  they

select trains so that the noise emission limit is subject  to

certain  guidelines  which are set by  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment.  Secondly, LTA designs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



constructs  the  MRT  tracks to allow them  to  absorb  noise

better.  That is why ballasted tracks on timber sleepers  are

used  on  all our MRT viaducts.  Third, and this  is  a  very

important  point,  we require our MRT operators  to  properly

maintain  their  trains and their tracks.   Good  maintenance

will  ensure  that  noise levels are kept within  environment

guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has taken noise measurements near Bukit Gombak

Station, and those measurements indicate that the levels  are

still  within ENV's guidelines.  But, nevertheless,  we  will

continue  to work with Mr Ang and his grassroots  leaders  to

find if there are better and practical solutions to bring the

noise level down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the frequent breakdowns of Bukit

Panjang  LRT  when it first started.  Prof. Low stressed  the

need  for  us to minimise disruptions and make it a  reliable

system.    I   totally   agree.    Breakdowns   inconvenience

commuters.  They are therefore not welcome.  That is  why  we

impose  a very high performance standard on the LRT operator.

What  is our expectation?  We set a standard, what is  called

service  availability standard of at least 99.7%.  What  does

this  mean?  This means that everyday, over a daily operating

period  of 20 hours, the maximum down time should not  exceed

four minutes.  This is a very demanding standard.  But it can

be  achieved.  Unfortunately, the Bukit Panjang LRT  did  not

perform to standard initially.  During its first two years of

operation, there were a number of occasions when it could not

meet  the  standard.  We share the frustration of the  Member

and  his residents.  We had not sat on our palms.  A  lot  of

efforts and resources were mobilised to first understand  the

problem and then to fix them.  We have made progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last September, for a continuous six months

period,  the Bukit Panjang LRT system succeeded in  achieving

this  very high standard of 99.7%.  Unfortunately, this  very

good  record  was  interrupted by two incidents.   One,  last

month, and a second one, this month.  Detailed investigations

are ongoing but the preliminary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



assessment  confirms that the LRT system is  robust  and,  in

fact,  is  functioning as designed.  On both  occasions,  the

system  was  shut down automatically because  the  IT  system

detected  some faults which were eventually traced to  wiring

problems  at  the termination panels.  Given  an  experienced

operational  and maintenance crew, the wiring faults  at  the

panels  could  have  been identified and rectified  speedily.

But as it turned out, the operator took longer than necessary

in   troubleshooting  the  faults,  resulting  in   prolonged

shutdowns.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, therefore, continue to stress on staff training

and retraining, and, particularly, in troubleshooting skills.

Towards  this  end,  the operator, SLRT,  intends  to  engage

Bombardier  Transportation,  which  is  the  original  system

supplier,  to  help  in  its staff  training  programme.   No

efforts will be spared by SLRT to ensure compliance with  the

99.7% service standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, could the initial teething problems of the

BP  LRT  system be prevented?  Yes.  What are the steps  that

can be taken to ensure that we avoided it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the LTA applies stringent criteria when selecting

a  system.   We  take  into account  the  experience  of  the

designer  and  supplier, their reliability  and  their  track

record.  This is done at the tender evaluation stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the selected system is put through rigorous

trials and tests before we put it into service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, involve the operator early. The LTA brings the

appointed  operator on board at an early stage to be  closely

involved in the system's development.  Such early involvement

enhances  the  operator's knowledge and appreciation  of  the

system, and it allows him to build up expertise, so that they

are operationally ready before the start of service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why did Bukit Panjang LRT system fail to perform as

expected?  First, on selection.  I think we did well.  The BP

LRT system is a sound system, based on proven technology.  It

is  a  mature system, has been running for more than 20 years

in  other parts of the world and in many cities.  So, we  got

an "A" there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we did put it through rigorous tests before we

started commercial service although, on hindsight, perhaps we

could have allowed more time for trial running.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I think we did not do as well on the

third  step.  We did not appoint the operator, which is SLRT,

early  enough.  So, this is a very important lesson which  we

have  learnt,  and that is why for the North East  Line,  for

Sengkang  LRT and Punggol LRT, LTA has stepped up efforts  to

involve  the operator, which will be SBS Transit, to  prepare

it, to gear it up for its tasks ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also stressed the need to integrate the LRT

with  bus  routes.  I totally agree.  LRT and bus routes  are

different  components of a system.  They should synergise  to

bring maximum benefits to the majority of residents, and that

is  why each time a new LRT system is put in, we have  to  do

some rationalisation of existing bus routes.  It cannot be  a

simple  add-on.  But, in any rationalisation,  we  will  take

into  account  the interests and concerns of  the  residents.

And, here, the Member of Parliament plays a significant role,

in  articulating the interests, feedback and  suggestions  of

the  residents.   This  was a role  which  Prof.  Low  played

wonderfully.   And  in the recent general  election  results,

there was clear evidence of that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government

introduced a rebate on green vehicles in January 2001  for  a

period  of  three years to encourage the use of electric  and

hybrid  cars in Singapore.  Is this measure effective?   Some

67,000  cars were registered in Singapore last year,  out  of

which only 13,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



or  less  than 0.2%, were green cars. There seems  to  be  no

attraction  in this.  From the pricing point of  view,  after

the  rebate,  a  1.5 litre Toyota hybrid car costs  $134,488.

That  is  about 60% more than a Toyota Corolla  of  the  same

engine  capacity, even after the rebate.  Another example  is

that  a  995  cc Honda hybrid car costs about $141,000.   For

less  than  that price, a motorist can buy a 2.3 litre  Honda

Accord, which is much bigger.  There is a huge difference  in

prices.  How do we expect people to switch to green vehicles?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to look at the rebates again

to  make  the  green cars more attractive to  buyers  and  to

extend the 3-year rebate period.  In Sweden and Britain, they

have already provided bold incentives to encourage people  to

switch  to  green cars.  I think we should  go  in  the  same

direction.   We  can  further  lower  the  cost  differential

between petrol-propelled vehicles and the green vehicles,  so

that, car for car, motorists can be drawn towards the greener

choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, we saw the launch of Compressed Natural Gas

(CNG)  buses  and taxis in Singapore.  I would like  to  know

whether  the Ministry of Transport has any plan to  introduce

the  CNG  vehicles in Singapore.  We should have  more  green

cars  in  Singapore,  for  the sake  of  a  green  and  clean

environment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not present. Prof. Chin is

also not present.  Mr Khaw, do you want to reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang spoke in

support  of  green vehicles.  He felt that  our  current  tax

incentives  were inadequate and, as a result, we do  not  see

many  of them on our roads.  As pointed out by him, we  first

introduced  the  rebates  for hybrid  and  electric  cars  in

January  last year.  Then, in October 2001, he may  not  have

noticed, we extended the rebates to natural gas vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rebates comprise two components. First, a one-off

rebate  to  reduce the upfront cost of purchase.   For  cars,

this is 20% of the Open Market Value (OMV).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



For  buses, the rebate is 5% of OMV, so, fully offsetting the

ARF of a bus, ie, green buses do not have to pay any ARF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a recurrent rebate on the annual road

tax  payable.  For green vehicles, the rebates amount to  20%

of  road tax.  For hybrid vehicles, a lower rebate of 10%  is

granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these rebates lower the upfront and annual

running  costs  of  green  vehicles,  and  reduce  the   cost

differential  with  the conventional  vehicles.   With  these

rebates  and the lower fuel costs, the total cost  of  owning

and  using  green vehicles should be comparable  to  that  of

conventional vehicles of equivalent OMV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the take-up rate is, indeed, very low. To-date,

only  15  green vehicles are on the road.  Why  is  this  so?

Obviously, there are many other factors, apart from cost  and

rebates, which affect a motorist's decision on whether or not

to  buy  a  green vehicle.  For example, how many models  are

available?   Is  it  a limited range?  In the  market  today,

there  are  only three models.  And, for some  of  the  young

buyers, what is the design like?  Is it cool?  And there  are

other factors, eg, what is the subsequent maintenance support

by the dealers?  All these are very important considerations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all new technology, the rate of uptake would

initially  be  low, due to consumer inertia.   Green  vehicle

technology is still new, and it will take time for it to earn

consumer  acceptance.  In fact, our low uptake  here  is  not

unique.   In Japan and the US, their take-up rates  are  also

very low.  Last week, I read a Business Week article on green

cars  which drew the conclusion that the technology is  still

evolving, and they made the point that, realistically,  green

cars  are  not going to be a big thing for another 10  years.

So  this  is a crucial point.  What does it mean?   It  means

that  it  will  remain a niche product for quite  some  time.

Therefore,  the  economy  of  scale,  which  is  enjoyed   by

conventional cars, will not benefit green cars.  So,  despite

whatever  rebates  we  may  give,  green  cars  will   remain

expensive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like Mr Yeo, my Ministry supports the intent to

reduce  car pollution, and we will continue to promote  green

vehicles, and lean in their favour.  But, at the same time, I

do  not think we should go over-board and, certainly, not too

much  ahead of consumer acceptance.  But, meanwhile, we  will

monitor the development, and we can always review the rebates

at the end of next year.  We will then see if further changes

will be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Yesterday, the Comfort Group announced

their  results.  The results show that business profits  have

improved  by 15%.  Comfort Group is the largest taxi operator

in  Singapore.  The high turnover is because they  have  more

taxis  available.  I understand that many people have already

registered themselves with CityCab, and are waiting for taxis

to be allocated to them to drive. I believe  when people lose

their jobs, one of the options is to become a taxi driver.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.42 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, taxi drivers are subject to very great

pressure.  At the time of an economic slowdown, people  would

avoid taking taxis, and hence less passengers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



At  the same time, many unemployed people are switching  over

to  taxi  driving.   So, the competition  for  passengers  is

invariably intensified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with this recent stepping up of the Traffic

Police  action  against non-conformity with  the  safety-belt

rules,  the taxi drivers are the first to be victimised.   If

the rear-seat passengers do not belt up, the taxi driver will

be fined and penalised with three demerit points.  Of course,

the  taxi drivers can turn down passengers who refuse to belt

up, but if the passengers complain to the authority about the

taxi  driver's refusal to service them, the taxi driver  will

be  penalised all the same.  If the taxi driver chalks up  24

demerit  points  within  two  years,  he  loses  his  driving

licence,  and consequently, his job. What if he is  the  sole

breadwinner of the family. Many are!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, these taxi drivers will complain

and  seek the help of the MPs.  Of course, we cannot do  very

much  to  help them.  Mr Chairman, I would like to  make  two

suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Traffic Police could be more sympathetic and

lenient towards the taxi drivers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for taxi drivers who have accumulated 24

demerit  points within two years owing to the fault of  their

passengers,  they  should  be  given  an  extra  six  points.

Perhaps, these six points may be for a period of six  months.

In  this way, taxi drivers will not be penalised unduly, just

because   of   the   non-cooperation  of  some   unreasonable

passengers.   These are special circumstances  which  warrant

sympathetic consideration.

introduced into our cars with the implementation of  the  ERP

system  some  years back.  Since then, there have  been  many

cases  of  thieves breaking into vehicles to steal  the  cash

cards that were exposed to view.  I would like to ask whether

it is time, after all these years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



for an upgrade model to be designed and introduced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Chong Weng Chiew for

his  feedback on the effects of the current economic slowdown

on taxi drivers, and he asked if we could assist them in some

way.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic downturn affects everybody, so taxi

drivers  are  not exempted.  I have looked at their  earnings

data  and I notice that their average earnings for last  year

have indeed come down by 10% in the second half, compared  to

the  first half, something like from $2,300 per month on  one

shift  operation  to about $2,100.  But there  are  signs  of

recovery.   This year's data, in fact, show steady increases,

month by month, in their earnings.  Their average earnings in

the  first  few  months of this year, $2,500  for  one  shift

operation,  is  now  much higher than the average  of  $2,150

recorded  in  the last quarter of last year.  This  trend,  I

think, should continue as the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As compared to other workers, taxi drivers have done

much  better.  That is why, as Dr Chong noticed, there  is  a

long queue outside waiting to join this profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is alive to the economic hardship of

Singaporeans during the current recession.  That  is  why  we

have  implemented  various schemes to help Singaporeans  cope

with  the hard times -  New Singapore Shares, rebates on  HDB

service  and  conservancy  charges, utilities  rebates,  etc.

Most taxi drivers are able to benefit from such schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong mentioned the safety belt problem experienced

by  taxi  drivers.  We have checked with the  Traffic  Police

because  this is enforced by them.  Traffic Police said  that

they  do  not  encounter much problem with taxi  drivers  and

their passengers during enforcement.  But certainly, we  will

take a sympathetic approach, as suggested by Dr Chong, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



indeed taxi drivers have uncooperative passengers.  I am sure

that will be a factor that we will take into account.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> I thank the Senior Minister of

State, Mr Khaw for his wonderful reply.  Thus, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W of the

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code WH

5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the efforts by the Ministry to solve some of the

transport woes of Sengkang Town have been most impressive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this time last year, there was only one road, the

very   famous  Punggol  Road  that  connects  Sengkang   Town

residents  to  the  rest  of Singapore,  there  are  now  two

additional  roads  and a total of five  exits  from  Sengkang

Town.   In  fact, by the end of this year, the  LRT  and  MRT

would be ready and my residents would enjoy the option  of  a

sky route out of Sengkang Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Assoc. Prof. Low has expressed earlier on,

the  experiences of LRT riders have been less than  heavenly.

The much publicised breakdowns and accidents have caused much

worry  among my residents and I am pleased to say that  I  am

very  happy with Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan's

reply on that.  I would like to ask if there are any specific

measures  that are taken to ensure the safety and the  smooth

functioning of the LRT in Sengkang in particular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I also urge that the rationalisation of the

public  transport system, especially since the operator  this

time  round  is  SBS  Transit, be slower to  implement  their

plans, to rationalise the entire system, to reduce the feeder

service and trunk service.  Perhaps, it could be put on  hold

until  there  is  some  certainty  that  the  LRT  is  indeed

reliable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the development in the Sengkang Town has been

impressive, the same cannot be said of the road and transport

development  across the Tampines Expressway (TPE).   Here,  I

refer to Punggol 21.  While Punggol 21 has been heralded as a

model town, residents there have been battling long jams in a

less  than good public transport system.  In fact,  the  very

same  old Punggol Road remains the only link that Punggol  21

residents  have to the rest of Singapore.  I  would  like  to

show a photograph here that was given to me by a resident  of

mine.   He  claims that he would need at least half  an  hour

just  to move a few hundred metres to get out of Punggol Road

into  Tampines  Expressway.  I quote him, "The  situation  is

getting  worse over the months as more Punggol residents  are

moving  into  their new homes.  It is beyond my understanding

how  a major town like Punggol can have only one road out  to

the  rest of Singapore."  In addition, he said, "Imagine what

would happen if a major traffic accident closes Punggol Road.

Tens  of thousands of Punggol residents would not be able  to

leave or return to their beloved home."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, Punggol North, while about 5,000 of

my Sengkang households would enjoy the convenience of the LRT

at  the  end of this year, my 6,365 Punggol 21 residents  and

two  schools in Punggol 21 will have to make do with only one

trunk  service, which is Service No. 83.  Meanwhile,  as  the

LRT is being built, dual carriageways are converted to single

lanes, and public transport operators like SBS Transit,  have

claimed that both the LRT and HDB developments in Punggol  21

have  caused some of the roads to become unusable.  As  such,

they  too have been reluctant to bring in more service routes

to serve the population heartland of Punggol 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a growing problem as Punggol 21 is a fast-growing town. In addition, I have one good news and one bad

news.   The good news is, together with the North-East  line,

Punggol  MRT station will be ready by the end of  this  year.

The  bad news is, it is surrounded by vacant land at the west

side of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



Punggol Road, while the population centre is located  on  the

east  side of Punggol Road.  To make things worse, the  other

two  long distance service routes that ply along Punggol have

frequently  rejected the residents' call  to  turn  into  the

growing  Punggol 21 estate because they have  engineered  the

roads  to  go and serve the future population around  Punggol

MRT station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry would look into hastening the

development of the LRT in Punggol 21.  I have confidence that

with the new testings and the measures that have been put  in

place, this LRT will be different.  Of course, it is left  to

be  seen.  In addition, I would also hope that there will  be

an  increase in the number of exit routes from Punggol 21 and

an overall improvement in the transport system in Punggol 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my residents are eagerly awaiting the new

facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, since the Bukit Panjang LRT was launched in

1999,  it  has  encountered a lot  of  problems.  The  Senior

Minister  of  State has already explained why these  problems

occurred.  But these problems have yet to be resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a number of bus service routes have been

withdrawn in Bukit Panjang,  and the residents there have  to

rely  more  on  the  LRT  service.  As  such,   the  frequent

interruptions of the LRT service have caused them  a  lot  of

trouble and inconvenience.  Students who have to go to school

by  LRT will be late, workers depending on LRT to go to  work

will  be late and, worst of all, those who have  examinations

to  take  will lose precious time when they turn up late  for

the papers.   This is certainly cause for concern.  If we  do

not  take immediate steps to rectify the situation, very soon

people  will  lose confidence in LRT, and  the  LRT  will  be

deemed to be an unreliable form of transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Senior State of Minister has

acknowledged  that the Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



Panjang  LRT  service has not been performing satisfactorily.

But  I would like to ask the Land Transport Authority whether

it has got any plan to improve the LRT  service.  I know that

at  the moment, there is some fine or penalty imposed on  the

service provider if their service is not up to the mark.  But

such  penalty  does not help ease the problem  faced  by  the

residents.  I know that the operator does provide  a  back-up

shuttle bus every time there is a breakdown. This is good but

not  entirely satisfactory. It is no replacement for reliable

and efficient service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to suggest to the Minister or

the  Senior  Minister  of State that  unless  and  until  the

operator  is able to provide a reliable service, regular  bus

services should be restored to service the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, should there be a major disruption to the LRT

service   in  future,   the  operator  should  be  asked   to

compensate the commuters, say, by providing free rides for  a

week, or even for a month. In this way, more pressure will be

exerted on the service operator to improve their services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would suggest that if the operator is unable

to  resolve  the problem, and frequent disruptions  continue,

the  operator should be replaced if they are unable to comply

with  the  requirement  to  rectify  the  problem  within   a

prescribed period of time. If there are more interruptions, I

think  we  should  terminate their contract  and  get  a  new

service provider to replace them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I have noted Mr Gan Kim Yong's

suggestions on the Bukit Panjang LRT problem.  As I explained

earlier, let us have some confidence.  The period of teething

problems is over and the last six months' record gave us that

confidence  that they have been able, continuously,  for  six

months,  to achieve that 99.7%, which is a very high  service

standard despite the last two incidents a few weeks ago.  But

those  two  incidents merely confirm that  there  is  nothing

wrong with the system.  This is not rocket



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



science.  LRT has been around for decades.  Like all systems,

it requires to be properly maintained.  You can have the best

of  systems,  but  if it is not maintained, then  it  creates

problems.  Having identified that this is the problem, and  I

think that is the efforts the operator is committed to do, we

will  make sure that the operator delivers on this  one.   It

can  be  done.   It  has  been proven for  six  months  since

September  last year, and I see no reason why  it  could  not

continue that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, I can reassure Miss Penny Low that the

problems  of Bukit Panjang LRT of the past will be  contained

in the history book there. It will not spill over to Sengkang

or Punggol.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point about Punggol roads and so on, and the

various  possibilities, I must confess I am not too  familiar

with  the Punggol area.  The last time I went there was  many

years ago.  But I took her feedback, I have to see what  does

it  mean.  But she did talk about the gap period between  the

opening  of  the Punggol MRT station and when the LRT  opens,

and  there would be a need for service to be delivered during

that period, and this is something that we will sort out with

the operator of the MRT which happens to be SBS Transit.   So

certainly  routes  have  to  be rationalised,  once  we  open

Punggol MRT.  And, as I have reassured Prof. Low just now, we

would  fully take into account the interests and the concerns

of  the residents.  The role of the MPs in coming forward  to

give us that feedback will be crucial, and I will be happy to

facilitate  a discussion between SBS Transit and  Miss  Penny

Low,  and her grassroots leaders, to show them our plans  for

the whole Punggol area, and I think in that way we can have a

more productive discussion.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I thank Senior Minister of State

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head S of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Budget Speech, DPM Lee gave the assurance

that  any changes we make will be done very carefully,  after

full consultation, and without causing disruption, either  to

CPF  members  or to the property market.  This assurance  was

timely  because  there  have been  many  discussions  on  the

possible  changes to the CPF system and such discussions  can

be  easily misunderstood, if not seen in the full context  of

the discussions and consultations.  I would like to raise the

following  concerns  based on feedback I have  received  from

discussions with union members and leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF Minimum Sum. The Minimum Sum helps CPF

members  set  aside sufficient savings to  support  a  modest

standard  of  living  after retirement and  enables  them  to

remain  self-reliant.  I would like to know how, and on  what

basis,  does  the  CPF Board determine the  adequacy  of  the

Minimum  Sum.   Based  on  the current  CPF  Minimum  Sum  of

$70,000,  a CPF member would have $537 monthly from  age  62.

Is  this  sum adequate?  One concern is that the sum will  be

much  lower  if a member pledges part of the Minimum  Sum  in

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, because of the CPF system, we have one of the

highest  saving  rates  in the world.   Yet  many  are  still

worried that they do not have enough cash for retirement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



Recently,  many  have  raised the concern  that  one  of  the

possible  causes  of this is because CPF members  invest  too

heavily in property.  They become asset rich, but cash  poor.

However,  there  was  also recently an  analyst's  report  in

Business Times on 1st of May that there is no over-investment

in housing.  I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower for

its  assessment.  Does the present system lead  to  an  over-consumption or over-investment in property?  If this  is  the

case,  then  should the Government review our housing  policy

and   consider  granting  Singaporeans  with  other   housing

options, such as rental flats?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea hotly debated, in public and the media, is

to  have  a lower CPF contribution rate for older workers  so

that  they  remain  competitive.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Ministry  of  Manpower for its assessment of  the  situation.

Should  the  CPF contribution rate be cut for older  workers,

what  will  be the impact?  Can the Ministry share  with  the

House   the  different  extent  of  impact  should  the   CPF

contribution rate be lowered at various rates for workers  of

different  age  groups, for example,  40,  45  and  50?   For

example, should CPF contribution rate be reduced for  workers

above  40,  45  or 50 years old, how many of them  will  have

difficulties servicing their housing mortgages?   Would  they

be  able  to  save enough CPF for their old age  and  medical

needs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF is fundamentally for old age, medical expenses

and  basic  housing.  We have to continue this system  around

these  core  objectives.  We have to be extremely careful  in

suggesting changes to such a system.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, is too much CPF

money  tied  to housing, and not enough cash for  retirement?

This  was  raised by Minister Lim Boon Heng, and this  kicked

off   a  debate  among  Singaporeans  who  are  worried  that

something is going to happen to their property, their  prized

asset.   But  is  this true or not?  Too much  CPF  money  in

housing?  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



Business  Times and New Paper carried a report by  CapitaLand

to  show otherwise.  They say, "No such thing.  Only 25%  for

public  housing and 15% for private housing."  Who is  right?

Singaporeans  want to know.  So in the New  Paper,  Dr  Money

asked  CPF,  "Is this true?"  CPF kept silent at  first,  but

when  they  were  pressed, they said they had  no  such  data

available.  This is all in the New Paper dated 6th May, 2002.

Of  course, I know CapitaLand's vested interest.  But  surely

CPF should come out and challenge the report.  But apparently

it did not, or I could have missed it as I was away.  Perhaps

the  Minister  could provide the answers.  Is  too  much  CPF

money in housing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later Labour Chief, Lim Boon Heng, went further and

floated  the possible 40 years and above CPF cut kite.   This

was echoed by the Minister for Manpower, Lee Boon Yang's call

to study CPF cut for those above 40 years seriously.  I quote

him.   He  was concerned by the over-priced older workers  in

the  market.   When both Ministers concur, one Labour  Chief,

and  one Manpower Chief, then Singaporeans better sit up  and

listen  carefully.  They had better go back quickly  and  re-examine  their  financial commitments to  their  home,  their

children's  education,  their  mortgages  and  their   loans,

because it would probably turn out to be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I listened to DPM and Finance Minister Lee

Hsien Loong's strong commitment to restoring the CPF to  40%,

at the last debate, and I presume restoration also applies to

the  40 years and above, I wonder how Singaporeans will feel.

This time, the talk is restoration, and not cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many conflicting messages for the employer and

employee.  When you talk about 40% restoration, employers sit

up and look at the bottom line, but employees are happy.  But

when  you tell employees that when you reach 40 years,  their

CPF would be reduced, they are going to be more than sad.  So

if  you  float so many kites, you better bring all the  kites

down  soon and ease the anxiety of those concerned.  We  must

remember,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



when  deciding on this CPF change, that at age 40 and  above,

many  Singaporeans  are  at  the height  of  their  financial

commitment - at their peak.  Remembe, at this age group,  the

children  have  grown  up.  They are  either  in  the  higher

secondary school, in JC or in the university.  They are  also

committed to their mortgages, insurance, and loan repayments,

and  many must have planned to settle, or hope to settle, all

these before they retire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower Minister's reason for support of this idea is

his  concern  that  Singapore's seniority-based  wage  system

could have over-priced older workers in the market, that  has

become  more demanding, and where high-skilled and innovative

workforce  is  key to the country's prosperity,  and  changes

must  be made, including CPF, to be in line with new economic

changes.  So said the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so sure which category of the labour workforce

has many older over-priced workers.  I have no data.  Perhaps

the  Minister  can  enlighten the House  on  this.   I  would

suggest  not to hurry with this because of the low morale  of

many workers in the present downturn.  Perhaps, since we have

made  a  commitment to the present workforce, on  their  CPF,

when  they  first joined the labour market, we  should  start

this,  if  we  have  so  decided,  with  those  entering  the

workforce  for the first time.  I think acceptance  would  be

better  as they would know how to plan with the new  changes.

However, whatever CPF changes you want to do, we must bear in

mind  the  very  fundamental objective of our  CPF,  ie,  for

housing, health and retirement.  You can refine this, but  do

not  change this too much.  As Matthias Yao said, and I fully

agree  with  him, stick to our three fundamentals -  housing,

medical and retirement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I filed this as a $10 cut on a

matter of detail, but it has been elevated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is a simple one. When an employer is

late in paying the employee's contribution, the CPF Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



charges  interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the  amount

outstanding from the due date until the payment is made.  Who

should be entitled to this interest which, at the rate of 18%

per  annum,  is quite close to the exorbitant 24% charged  by

credit  card  companies?  Should it not be paid over  to  the

employee,  who, after all, is bearing the risk of  not  being

paid the CPF contributions, which, in some cases, can add  up

to a few months' worth, if his employer becomes insolvent and

goes under?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to request that the

Minister  for Manpower consider the use of the Medisave  part

of  CPF for the purchase of portable medical insurance (PMI).

This  is  to  allow  employees to use  the  Medisave  to  buy

individual portable medical care products to cover  illnesses

because  their employers are not providing for this  type  of

medical coverage, while they are still working, and also when

they are in-between jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PMI can help to ensure guaranteed long-term

coverage for the employees when they are in-between jobs  and

in  retirement, and to ensure that the accepted coverage will

not be cancelled for subsequent ill-health, provided premiums

are  paid.   I  would  like to augment my  request  with  the

following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Medical expenditure, especially for old age, is the

concern of many Singaporeans.  They are always worried  about

falling  sick  and  having to end up incurring  unmanageable,

huge  hospital bills.  Many fear that the $26,000 savings  in

their   Medisave   may  not  be  enough  should   they   need

hospitalisation and surgery, when they are no more  employed,

or become unemployed.  Many people also fear running the risk

of financial hardship in the end as medical treatment becomes

more expensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Many want the peace of mind by ensuring for better

hospitalisation  and surgical coverage as MediShield  is  for

the masses, and the benefits are limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Help risk pooling through insurance, a risk-transfer mechanism, is a better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



method than just depending on the Medisave alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The use of Medisave to purchase medical insurance

will  stress  the principle of individual responsibility  for

one's  own healthcare needs.  It also encourages Singaporeans

to  better  plan  and save when they are  younger.   This  is

better than to just depend on Medisave alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Portable medical hospitalisation and surgical cover

will  take care of the subscribers in their old age and  they

need  only  pay  low premiums in their younger working  days.

This is certainly better than to depend solely on the savings

in their Medisave account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) There should not be any fear of encouraging the

buffet-syndrome, or of driving up healthcare cost, as long as

they  are accredited insurance companies and carry co-payment

and deductible elements in their policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Lastly, there should not be fear of unrestricted

medical and insurance schemes using Medisave as long as there

is  a mechanism in place that prevents frivolous premiums and

coverage by requiring the insured to pay any difference  with

cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister for Manpower whether more

insurance  companies can be accredited for usage of  Medisave

from  the  present three, so that Singaporeans can have  more

options.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, my points have

been raised and so I will not speak.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Like my colleagues

before  me, I also know from feedback that many Singaporeans,

especially  those above 40 years, are very apprehensive  ever

since  the  Government raised concerns that Singaporeans  are

putting  too  much CPF money into housing, and  subsequently,

also suggested that CPF contribution rates for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



those above 40 years may have to be reduced to make them more

employable.   This is despite the assurances that  have  been

subsequently given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus good that the Senior Minister of State for

Trade  and  Industry has said that changes to the CPF  system

will  be  announced  next  month.   This  will  put  to  rest

unhelpful speculation and uncertainty.  However, I would like

to ask the Minister, if his Ministry, together with the ERC's

Sub-Committee on CPF, could endeavour to seek the views of  a

wide  cross-section  of  the  community  and  comprehensively

assess  the  impact of the proposed changes before finalising

and  announcing  the proposals.  This is because  the  issues

involved  are complex and changing the CPF rates may  not  be

the only, or the best, way to resolve the problems.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many Singaporeans may now realise and agree that

too much CPF money has been ploughed into housing, they worry

that any reduction in the amount of CPF that can be used  for

housing  will  impact  on  their  ability  to  service  their

outstanding mortgages.  This is in addition to the fact  that

many have suffered pay cuts, which have yet to be restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting employers' CPF contribution rate for those above

40  but below 55 is an even greater cause for concern as many

of them still have heavy financial liabilities.  In fact, the

40s  are also likely to be the years when housing consumption

is  at  its  maximum in the family life cycle, and hence  any

tinkering with the CPF would impact them most severely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for this group of workers who are

supposedly in the prime of their working lives, cutting their

employers'  CPF  contribution  is  viewed  by  many   as   an

indictment of their economic worth.  Many experts  have  also

expressed doubt that this would spur employers to engage more

older  workers since the key issue with most of these  people

who have lost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



their  jobs  is that they suffer from outdated  skills.   For

this  category  of workers, it would be better  to  focus  on

skills upgrading and job retraining and changing the mindsets

of both the employers and employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Minister for Finance has announced that the

CPF  rate will eventually be restored to 40%, may I therefore

suggest  that  one  way to start mitigating  the  problem  of

inadequate   retirement  savings   would   be   to   consider

channelling the yet to be restored remaining 4% of employers'

contribution  to  the Special Account, leaving  the  Ordinary

Account intact when the rate is restored to 40%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Minimum Sum could also be increased in

the  future beyond the targeted $80,000 to keep pace with the

cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, there appears to be a problem and we should

fix  it.   However, we should avoid breaking a host of  other

things in the process.  I would thus again like to appeal  to

the  Ministry to carefully consider the ramifications of  any

proposed  changes  to the CPF, as instead  of  the  Singapore

Dream,  many Singaporeans are now nervous about the  prospect

of a possible Singapore Nightmare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the heady asset enhancement days in the early

1990s, many Singaporeans then believed that they would become

asset rich and cash rich.  Since then, many Singaporeans have

realised  that  they  are asset rich  but  cash  poor.   More

recently,  with  the  downturn in  the  property  market  and

suggestions  that changes would be made to  the  CPF  scheme,

many  have  lamented that they are now asset  poor  and  cash

poor, and some may perhaps even find themselves assetless and

cashless!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan Soo Khoon is not here. Mr Seng

Han Thong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the proposal to

reduce the CPF rate at 40 has annoyed many Singaporeans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



However, I have observed that at least there is a group which

is  "bo chap" (can't be bothered) to the proposal - the self-employed  group.   They  are  the insurance  agents,  housing

agents,  hawkers  and  taxi drivers.  They  also  own  public

housing flats, like other Singaporeans, but they pay by cash,

not  CPF.  Thus, they are not caught by the ups and downs  of

the CPF rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument on the issue, in fact, has developed from

rational  public  discussion  to emotional  appeal,  although

nothing has firmed up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many agree that we need to review the CPF rate to

help  older  workers to become more employable,  many  become

emotional  when the age is set at 40.  This is  because  they

are  either on the wrong side of 40 or on the right  side  of

40.    They  thought  they  were  right  the  last  time  and

discovered  that they are wrong this time, that  is,  putting

too  much CPF in housing.  Many, in fact, have confessed that

when  they  signed up to buy a flat, it was  like  signing  a

credit card.  Even when they needed just a 4-room flat,  they

would sign for a 5-room flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, too much CPF in property at the individual level

is  an issue.  We need to resolve their predicament.  Whether

we  should  reduce the rate at the age of 40,  45  or  50,  I

believe,   is   a  political  decision,  and  I   trust   the

Government's political wisdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to move fast to come

up  with  a  decision not only on the rate of CPF  for  older

workers but also to set a cap on the use of CPF for housing.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> The fact that we are a nation of

savers  is  through  no accident.  It is  through  the  sheer

political  will and prudent policy that we are where  we  are

today.  Our people are able to go to bed in comfort with  the

knowledge  that  our  hard-earned  reserves  would   not   be

foolishly  squandered away.  It is also  comforting  to  know

that  our workers' hard-earned money in our Central Provident

Fund are well managed and closely guarded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is so closely guarded that members are

allowed  only  very  limited  utilisation  until  retirement.

Rightly so too that our CPF is not allowed for liberal uses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to present another angle of looking at our

CPF  savings.  CPF's primary role is for "retirement,  health

care and housing".  After you have taken care of your housing

and  bought enough health care insurance, the next  time  you

may use your CPF monies is upon retirement.  You may also, in

a  limited  amount,  use  them for  investment  purposes  and

withdraw  the capital gain, if any, at the end of  the  year.

Even that is being slowly taken away from you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are in a different world. Many people out there

are facing very different types of problems.  Many are facing

bunching  financial problems.  There are those who previously

held  high-earning jobs.  They are also highly leveraged with

house  and car mortgages, and other financial demands.  After

having  lost their jobs, they are pressed by banks to top  up

their  monetary  differences to the deflated value  of  their

property,  cars and other investments.  They will  grow  more

frustrated as their problems mount and bunch while they watch

helplessly  at  their  huge CPF balances  in  their  Ordinary

Accounts.   It  is not uncommon to see an unemployed  person,

who previously may be a bank manager, having $500,000 balance

in his Ordinary CPF Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this group of people, CPF for retirement, they say,

"I may not get to retirement at all!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister thus consider allowing this group of

people  flexible and limited utilisation to  help  them  tide

through these difficult times?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, an immediate concern over

linking  a cut in CPF rate to the age of employees  rests  on

the issue of equal remuneration for equal job performed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of the over-40s whose skill levels may

be  roughly  comparable to those who are  younger.   If  this

group  of  over-40s are doing the same jobs as their  younger

counterparts, and yet have to suffer a pay cut in the form of

a  reduced CPF rate, then, we may find ourselves endorsing  a

discriminatory precedent in the compensation  system  of  our

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this knowledge-based economy, knowledge, skills and

intellectual capital of our human capital puts a  premium  on

the  value  of the job.  If we say, as a matter of  principle

that  since  older workers need to make themselves employable

by  accepting a CPF cut, irregardless of their contributions,

then would this practice not be extended into other areas  of

compensation as well?  Employers may then justify  all  types

of  remuneration cuts to older workers in the name of  making

these workers more employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really want to move towards a compensation system

that  rewards employees for what they do, and not  for  their

age,  then this proposal for a reduction in the CPF rate  may

actually  set  a  dangerous precedent by endorsing  age-based

discrimination.  This, Sir, would then constitute an instance

of reverse discrimination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of

Singapore, it states: "All persons are equal before  the  law

and  entitled  to the equal protection of the law."   If  all

persons  are  equal before the law, we should not  make  laws

that  discriminate against persons in different  age  groups.

Having  different levels of CPF contributions  for  different

age groups is therefore discriminatory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing CPF contributions for the 40s age group tends

to  send  the  wrong  signals to  this  group  of  employees,

particularly  managers,  executives and  professionals,  that

they  are  not  being recognised for their  contributions  to

society.   In fact, in this age group, they are in the  prime

of their working life with plenty of experience and skills to

give to their employers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



in   particular,  and  society  in  general.   Reducing   CPF

contributions  as  a  solution  to  encourage  employers   to

continue   keeping  these  people  on  the  payroll   is   an

insignificant solution, and a knee-jerk solution.   In  fact,

it  is not unknown that a few employers have seen the need to

increase the CPF contributions for the over-50s to be in line

with   the  younger  employees  where  they  see  that  these

employees' services are required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are true to regarding our workers and executives

as  human capital, then why do we zero in on wages as a  cost

of  doing  business?   Why do we not  look  at  wages  as  an

investment in building our human capital?  There are existing

mechanisms  that  can be fully explored to achieve  the  same

result.   For  example, we can use the MVC mechanism  to  the

fullest.  Why bother to tinker with the CPF again when  there

is another option?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all means, we should do what we can, and expect older

workers  to  do what they can, to make themselves employable.

But,  Sir,  the  proposal may not be  an  entirely  fair  nor

effective   means   by   which  to  achieve   the   goal   of

employability.   As such, I would urge the Minister  and  all

those   concerned,  to  seriously  consider  the   long-range

implications of the proposal before even thinking of  passing

it into law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, the problems faced by older

workers have come under much spotlight and discussion lately.

Employers, it seems, are less willing to hire older  workers.

Why  is  it  so?   One key reason is because  of  the  higher

medical  costs.   Employers are not willing to  incur  higher

medical costs associated with the older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible solution that has been suggested is that of

the  medical benefit system.  The system can provide a worker

with  portable  and  continuous coverage during  his  working

years,  and  extending  into even  his  retirement.   It  can

complement and build on existing schemes such as Medisave and

MediShield.   It  helps workers to save  for  future  medical

needs.  Most importantly, under the scheme, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



worker  does not lose out when he changes jobs,  even  if  he

develops  medical conditions.  At the same time,  there  will

not  be unnecessary cost burdens to his employers as he ages.

The  scheme can be multi-tiered to provide a compulsory basic

level  of  coverage  at  the national level  with  affordable

premiums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC has advocated that Singapore move towards a

portable  medical  benefit system.  As a  labour  MP,  I  can

clearly see that such a portable scheme will benefit workers,

as  it  provides all workers with continuous medical coverage

without  affecting their employability.  In  fact,  with  the

economic  downturn,  many  older  workers  realise  the  hard

reality of the existing employer-based medical benefits  that

they have.  It is more like a cheque that, when they need  to

cash  it,  the supporting account could have been terminated.

It is something that is unreal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, "a bird in hand is worth two in the bush".

Thus,  more  and  more  union  leaders  have  accepted   that

portability  is a more effective way to retain  the  workers'

medical  benefits.  However, the response from  employers  is

not  forthcoming.  One reason is that employers perceive that

such  a  system would be more costly.  I would like to remind

the  employers  to treat workers as stakeholders.   Companies

have an obligation to stakeholders and should not reduce  its

corporate  responsibility to enhance  the  welfare  of  their

employees.  I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower what

more can be done to push for a more widespread implementation

of a portable medical benefit system in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to raise an issue

with  respect  to  the  proposed  increase  in  the  Medisave

component  of our CPF to cover insurance premiums  that  will

ensure the portability of medical insurance for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report outlining the preliminary recommendations

for a portable medical benefit scheme, I note that there is a

two-tier  scheme  being proposed, one  covers  basic  medical

insurance, which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



supposed to be compulsory, while the second-tier provides for

an enhanced and optional medical insurance coverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that I would like to raise with the Minister

pertains  to the first-tier basic medical insurance  that  is

supposed to be compulsory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed scheme, employers will have to pay an

additional  1% of the employee's monthly salary as additional

contribution to the employee's Medisave account, subject to a

salary  cap  of  $6,000.  To offset this  additional  charge,

employers will get to enjoy an additional 1% tax deduction of

payroll.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister enlighten the House on whether he

thinks  the proposed 1% increase in monthly salary is  enough

to  pay  for  premiums that will ensure a  coverage  that  is

sufficiently   comprehensive  in  scope  in  the   event   of

hospitalisation?  May I ask if the CPF Board  will  come  out

with  a  scheme that will ensure that premiums are  not  only

kept  affordable,  but  that they  will  ensure  sufficiently

comprehensive coverage for basic medical services?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to that, on what basis will the deductible and

co-insurance elements be calculated?  Will it be sufficiently

low  enough for lower income workers to pay if and  when  the

need for hospitalisation or other needful medical expenditure

arises?

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, may

I  respond  to the Members who have spoken on the CPF  issue.

Eight  Members  have  spoken  on this  question  of  possible

changes  to  the CPF system.  I would like to  address  their

concerns now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a quick word by way of introduction. I am sure

all  Members  are  very familiar with  the  CPF  system.   We

started  out in 1955 as a very basic retirement saving  plan.

Over the years, it has evolved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



into a comprehensive social security scheme to enable workers

to save for their homes, to save for old age and also to meet

healthcare expenditure.  The system has served us  well  over

the  years  since  its inception in 1955.  The  question  is,

going into the future, will the same system continue to serve

us as well as it had in the past?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we are facing more competition. In fact,

competition  is  so fierce that the Malaysian Prime  Minister

recently publicly spoke about skinning Singapore in more ways

than  one.   If  we  are  complacent,  we  may  well  end  up

decorating somebody's trophy wall.  So we should not just  be

complacent  and  depend on an institutional system  that  has

worked for us in the past, to carry us on to the future.   It

is  in fact timely for us to take a hard look at our economic

institutions,  including our CPF system, in  preparation  for

these new challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me make it absolutely clear right from the

beginning that the fundamental objectives of the CPF  system,

home  ownership, retirement and healthcare, are  still  valid

and  relevant and will remain so for the future.  As DPM  Lee

said,   we   do  not  intend  to  muck  around   with   these

fundamentals.  However, we do need to examine whether the CPF

can  be  refashioned  to better cope with  the  new  economic

challenges.   While  the 40% total contribution  remains  our

target, we must still try to see whether we can fine-tune and

seek  a  new  balance for the CPF system to help our  workers

stay ahead and employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of these areas or issues that we must

examine  with  a critical eye?  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang  has  asked

whether CPF for older workers should be lowered and,  if  so,

what  would  be the impact and how serious is the problem  of

unemployment  amongst these older workers.   As  at  December

2001,  the  unemployment rate for older workers aged  40  and

above was 4.9%.  This may not appear exceptionally high.  But

what  is  of  greater concern is that, once retrenched,  they

face  more  difficulty in securing re-employment compared  to

those who are younger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



Their  re-employment rate last year was 62% compared  to  the

younger  workers' re-employment rate of 70%.   It  also  took

older workers longer to get another job.  The median duration

of unemployment for workers aged 40 and above was 14.2 weeks.

For  those aged 50 and above, it was 21 weeks.  This compares

very unfavourably to the 11.5 weeks for younger workers below

40 to get re-employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with continued economic restructuring, we must

expect  this trend to worsen.  There are a number of  reasons

for  this trend.  Older workers may not have the right skill-set  for  the new jobs.  Dr Amy Khor mentioned that  outdated

skills may well be a very important factor for the difficulty

confronting older workers in seeking re-employment.  I  agree

with Dr Khor.  So we have introduced many programmes, such as

the   Skills  Redevelopment  Programme,  the  People-for-Jobs

Traineeship Programme, even basic training, such as  critical

skills  and  skills in IT, to help the older workers  acquire

relevant  marketable skills.  More needs to be done  in  this

area.   Let  me  assure  hon. Members  that  my  Ministry  is

constantly exploring how to better help older workers  bridge

this skills gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, skills upgrading alone may not be sufficient.

Under a seniority-based wage system, the higher cost of older

workers can be an impediment.  This puts older workers  at  a

greater  risk when a company is forced to downsize.  It  also

makes  it  more  difficult  for older  workers  to  seek  re-employment because of their higher wage expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could leave it to market forces to make all

these  adjustments.   But our experience with  promoting  the

monthly  variable component, for instance, since  1999  shows

that  the wage structures cannot be changed readily  just  by

market  forces alone.  Furthermore, for an unskilled  worker,

the  take-home  pay, net of CPF, may well be too  low  to  be

attractive.   And  this  is  one reason  why  some  unskilled

workers  stay without regular jobs.  They prefer to  do  "odd

jobs" for cash without making any CPF contributions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo said that any change to the CPF

contribution rate on the basis of age would be discriminatory

and  unfair.  Let me point out that currently, employers' CPF

contributions  are lower for workers who  are  more  than  55

years old.  Workers below 55 receive a total CPF of 36%,  the

employer  contributes  16%,  the  employee  contributes  20%.

Workers  from age 55 to 60 get a total of 18.5%, the employer

contributes only 6% and the employee contributes 12 1/2%.  In

fact,  the CPF rates for workers above the age of 60 is  even

lower.   When  we  moved to make this change,  there  was  no

allegation  that  it was unconstitutional,  or  that  it  was

discriminatory.   In  fact,  everybody  understood  when   we

introduced this change that it was to help the older  workers

aged 55 and above to remain employed.  And everybody accepted

that it was a good move.  We discussed it thoroughly with the

unions  and  it was accepted that this was a good  move.   In

fact,  over the years since we made these changes, the labour

force participation of the group of workers aged 55 and above

had  increased year by year which shows that it had  achieved

its purpose of helping the older workers stay employed.  So I

think the allegation that it is unconstitutional, or that  it

is discriminatory, is not valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we have to consider is whether some adjustments

in  the  CPF  rates for workers who are approaching  55  will

complement  the  effort  to retrain and  reskill  workers  to

enhance  their employability.  This is a separate issue  from

the  CPF rate in general, which we still aim to restore  from

36%  to  40%  as soon as feasible, as soon as the economy  is

able to bear this additional cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor was concerned that if we change the CPF

contribution  rate,  it  would  cause  bigger  problems  than

benefits  and  urged the Government to look  for  some  other

measures  as  it may not be the best way.  Mdm Ho  Geok  Choo

said  that  the  workers aged 40 are  still  in  their  prime

working years and should not be considered as senior citizens

or  liabilities.  I agree with both Dr Khor and Mdm Ho.   The

CPF  is  a  very entrenched system.  Changes to  contribution

rates for any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



group   of  workers  will  have  far-reaching  impact.    The

Government  would  certainly  not  make  any  change  without

careful consideration.  If any adjustment is needed, we  will

certainly  try  to  zero  in on the group  of  workers  whose

employability we are trying to enhance, in other  words,  the

older group of workers approaching age 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Seng Han

Thong   are  concerned  that  reducing  the  employer's   CPF

contribution for older workers will affect their  ability  to

service their housing loan.  Mr Yeo also asked whether  older

workers  would  then  have enough savings  for  old  age  and

healthcare needs.  Sir, the Economic Review Committee and its

Sub-Committee  on  Wages,  CPF  and  Taxation  are  currently

assessing the impact of various CPF changes on the ability of

mortgagors  to service their mortgages, and the  accumulation

of  savings  for  old age and healthcare.  We will  certainly

continue to adopt a very careful approach in this study.   We

will not disregard the needs of CPF members, especially those

with  housing  commitments.  Let me assure hon. Members  that

surfacing  of these issues for discussion, at this  juncture,

is not indicative of a decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock said that with two Ministers speaking

about  it,  Singaporeans think that the decision has  already

been made and will be implemented.  Let me assure Dr Tan  and

hon.  Members that a decision has not been reached.   We  are

still studying this issue.  The Economic Review Committee and

its  Sub-Committee are looking at the data,  looking  at  the

statistics.  We will study carefully what could be the impact

from the changes that are being considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has also asked whether Singaporeans

have over-consumed or over-invested in property.  Sir, today,

86%  of Singaporeans live in public housing flats and 92%  of

HDB residents own their own flats.  Without the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



CPF  and  the  HDB,  it  would not  have  been  possible  for

Singapore  to attain one of the highest home ownership  rates

in the world.  Is this good for the nation?  The answer is an

unequivocal  "yes".  Home ownership added  to  our  sense  of

belonging, rootedness and share of economic progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we ask a further question: have some Singaporeans

over-consumed  or over-invested in property,  the  answer  is

less  clear.  For those who are prudent and bought properties

appropriate  to  their income to house  their  families,  the

answer  is  "no".   They  have  not  over-invested  or  over-consumed.   But  for those who rush into the property  market

for  speculative gains, especially at the top of the property

boom  and over committed themselves, the answer is a  painful

"yes".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as in everything else, prudence is very important.

CPF members should be prudent in their property purchases and

not  over-stretch themselves financially.  They cannot assume

that  their  wages  will go up year after year,  they  cannot

assume  that  they will never become unemployed during  their

whole  working  lives.  Otherwise, they may  find  themselves

vulnerable  to sudden shifts in the economy and the  property

market, such as the recent recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also need to ask another question. Having

reached  practically full home ownership, going forward,  how

do  we  refine  the CPF system?  There are two aspects  worth

considering.  First, we have announced in year 2000  that  we

will  gradually  increase  the contribution  to  the  Special

Account to reach 4%, 6% and 8%, depending on the age.  Today,

the  rates are 4%, 6% and 6%.  It would take us some time  to

reach  4%,  6%  and  8%, the ultimate  target  that  we  have

announced two years ago.  Beyond that, over the longer  term,

will this target rate be sufficient?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, currently, it is not uncommon for a CPF member

to  withdraw up to 130%, or even 140%, of the valuation price

of  a  property  to service a mortgage.  This obviously  eats

into the saving that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



needs  for  old  age.  By the end of the  mortgage,  the  CPF

member   may   find  that,  even  though  his  property   has

appreciated in value, it is still worth less than  the  total

amount of CPF that he has used up.  Over the longer term,  is

this prudent, or is this sustainable?

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong has asked whether the Government

should  consider setting a cap on the use of CPF for housing.

This  is related to the question of whether it is prudent  or

not  to allow such a high level of withdrawal to service  the

mortgages.   The  ERC  is, in fact, at the  same  time,  also

reviewing CPF housing schemes to ensure that we do not, willy-nilly,  end  up doing what Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and  other  hon.

Members are concerned about, ie, encouraging over-consumption

in  housing.  However, we are well aware that this is a  very

sensitive  area, tied to the assets of many Singaporeans  and

the  health  of the property market.  The Government  has  no

intention of spooking property prices and hurting practically

all  Singaporeans.   We  are  talking  about  fine-tuning   a

basically sound system, and not making emergency repairs to a

broken-down  system.  If any changes are necessary,  we  will

implement  them cautiously and gradually, and we  will  phase

them  in  over  an extended period, probably lasting  several

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for the basis that the CPF Board

uses  to  determine  the adequacy of the  Minimum  Sum.   The

Minimum  Sum  is  pegged  at a level  that  would  enable  an

individual to maintain a modest standard of living,  somewhat

higher   than  the  subsistence  level,  upon  reaching   the

prevailing  retirement  age.  The CPF  Minimum  Sum  was  not

intended  to be the only source of income for retirees.   CPF

members would have withdrawn part of their CPF at age 55 and,

hopefully, invested these CPF savings either in the  form  of

an  annuity  or some other investments to generate additional

income  when  they finally retire at age 62.  They  may  also

have their own private savings to supplement the monthly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



income  from  the  Minimum  Sum.   I  agree  with  Mr   Yeo's

observation that the cash amount that members set aside would

be  much lower, if they pledge their property for part of the

Minimum  Sum.  The property itself may not generate cash  for

the  CPF  members.  Of course, it could, if they are prepared

to sublet part of their property, eg, a room, if it is a 4 or

5-room HDB flat, or, in a more drastic case, maybe willing to

downgrade  to  a smaller property or find a reverse  mortgage

for  the property.  But let me reiterate that the CPF Minimum

Sum  is what its name implies: the bare minimum, adjusted for

inflation,  to  see  us  through retirement.   It  was  never

intended   to  maintain  one's  standard  of  living   before

retirement and after retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew requested that needy CPF members,

who have financial difficulties, be allowed to withdraw their

CPF  savings to meet their current financial problems.   This

is  a very well-intentioned plea.  While I do sympathize with

those  who face such difficulties, I am also fearful  of  the

consequences  when  we rush to unlock the  CPF  savings.   No

doubt,  if  we  face  a prolonged recession  with  very  high

unemployment,  the  CPF  will have to  be  unlocked  to  bail

Singaporeans out, and the Government is prepared  to  do  so.

But, our present situation is not so grave as yet.  Premature

unlocking of the CPF can do us more harm than good.  I  would

like  to  suggest  that we make use of other  Government  and

community  assistance  schemes,  eg,  the  Economic  Downturn

Relief Scheme (EDRS), the many programmes that we have in  my

Ministry for training and job placement assistance, before we

turn  to  prematurely unlocking the CPF  for  this  group  of

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some Members are asking for the CPF to be opened

up,  I note that Dr Tan and Mr Yeo argued that the CPF should

be  re-focused to its original objective of providing for CPF

members'  home  ownership, retirement and  healthcare  needs.

This   clearly  illustrates  the  tension  in  our  different

objectives.   The  more liberal we are with CPF  withdrawals,

the  harder  it is for Singaporeans to accumulate enough  for

the core objectives of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



the  CPF.  So, I agree with both Dr Tan and Mr Yeo,  that  we

should go back to the fundamentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion on the CPF issues, Members of the

House  will appreciate that what I have sketched out are  not

straightforward issues.  I may not have given all the answers

to the questions that Members have raised.  But, these issues

are  interconnected.  Each has an implication on the  others,

and we need to look at these issues as integrated and part of

the  same  solution.  Let me reiterate that no  decision  has

been  made  at  this point in time.  While  Members  and  the

public  are understandably anxious about the outcome  of  the

CPF review, let us wait for the Economic Review Committee  to

thoroughly  review  and debate the issues before  making  its

recommendations.   I would like to assure  Members  that  our

intention  is  to help workers cope with future uncertainties

and to enhance employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to the points that have been raised

by  Mr Yeo and Mdm Ho on the medical benefits system.  Mr Yeo

has  asked  what is the progress and prospect with regard  to

the  implementation of the portable medical benefits  system.

I  would  like  to  update Members  of  the  House  that  the

Tripartite Committee, chaired by former Minister of State, Mr

Othman  Haron Eusofe, had concluded its study on the portable

medical benefits system.  In a nutshell, it recommended  that

a   medical  benefits  scheme,  based  on  the  principle  of

portability,  co-payment  and affordability,  be  introduced.

The  scheme will cover both inpatient and outpatient benefits

supported by a medical insurance structure - deductibles  and

co-payment  features, and allow accumulation  of  the  unused

medical benefits to meet future medical needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed system will ensure that employees are

covered  by medical insurance not only during employment  but

also  when  they  are in between employment  and  even  after

retirement.  By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>



enabling younger workers to start putting aside more  savings

in  their Medisave for their later years, the proposed system

could   also   help  to  improve  cost  competitiveness   and

employability  of  older  workers.   With  the   element   of

deductible   and   co-payment,  the  scheme  will   encourage

individuals to take greater personal responsibility for their

own health, and this will help to contain the rise of medical

costs in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the points raised by Mdm Ho on whether an

additional  1%  Medisave contribution will be sufficient  for

employees moving on to this portable medical benefits  system

to  buy their health insurance, our experience with a similar

system that has been in operation in the civil service  since

1994  is  that,  with an additional 1% Medisave contribution,

most of the employees should be able to buy an adequate level

of  health  insurance.   Of course,  this  will  have  to  be

reviewed over time, and they should also be given options  in

the  choice  of  the level of insurance health coverage  that

they want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that the Economic

Review  Committee's Sub-Committee on Wages, CPF and  Taxation

is  also reviewing the recommendation of the study report  by

the  Tripartite  Committee, and  it  will  then  recommend  a

mechanism  to  implement  such a  portable  medical  benefits

system.  So, we will have to wait for the ERC to complete its

review of this proposal before I would be able to inform  the

House  on what else we need to do and how we should implement

this recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has also asked whether we could allow CPF

members or workers to use their Medisave to pay premiums  for

private  health insurance.  The answer is yes.  We  do  allow

CPF  members  to  use their Medisave to buy health  insurance

from   private-sector  insurance  companies.   In   fact,   I

understand  that, currently, there are five approved  private

medical  insurance schemes, namely, Income Shield and Managed

Healthcare  from NTUC Income Cooperative, Health Shield  from

AIA, Supreme Health from Great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



Eastern  Life,  and  Max Health from the  Overseas  Assurance

Corporation.   These  are the companies  that  have  approved

health  insurance which CPF members can purchase using  their

Medisave  savings.  They can use their Medisave to  buy  this

health  insurance, not just for themselves  only.   They  can

also  use  Medisave to buy insurance for their spouse,  their

children,  parents or grandparents, up to the withdrawal  cap

for  every  policy.  There is a withdrawal cap  of  $660  per

year, and this has been set to prevent premature depletion of

the  Medisave savings.  Private-sector insurance schemes also

have  to  be  designed  with co-payment  and  deductible,  to

moderate  demand  and over-consumption of  medical  services,

which  Dr  Neo  also mentioned as to be important  points  to

consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, over and above this private-sector health

insurance,  CPF  also  offers members  the  basic  MediShield

insurance, which is a catastrophic insurance scheme, and also

MediShield Plus.  Later this year, when ElderShield, a scheme

under  which  senior  citizens  can  be  insured  by  private

insurance  companies, is launched, CPF members can  also  use

Medisave to pay for their ElderShield premiums, not just  for

themselves,  but  also premiums for their spouses,  children,

parents  or  grandparents.   As and  when  we  implement  the

portable medical benefits system, the Ministry of Health  and

the  CPF  Board will also allow workers to use their Medisave

to  buy appropriate health insurance for themselves and their

family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, let me respond to Mr Ong Kian Min's

point.   He asked what happens to the interest that  the  CPF

Board  charges or levies on employers who are late in  paying

their  employees' CPF contributions.  He mentioned  that  the

CPF  charges a penalty interest at the rate of 18% per  annum

on  such late payments.  Let me explain.  Currently, the  CPF

Board gives employers a 14-day grace period, from the end  of

the month, to make the CPF contributions for their employees.

If  payment  is  not made at the end of the  14  days'  grace

period,  a penalty interest is charged.  The purpose of  this

penalty interest is to ensure that the defaulting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



employers  make  the payment as quickly as possible,  and  to

deter  them  from  paying  CPF contributions  late  again  in

future.   It  is  not  true that CPF keeps  all  the  penalty

interest.  The penalty interest is 11/2% per month - that  is

where  we  get  this 18% per annum - but very  few  employers

delay their payment for such a long period of time.  Whatever

penalty  interest  that  the  CPF  Board  collects  from  the

employers,  at  the  end of the day, the  first  charge  goes

towards restoring the lost interest, the interest which would

have  otherwise been earned if the CPF contribution had  been

paid  on time into the employee's account.  That is the  most

important portion of the penalty interest collected that will

be  credited back into the member's account immediately  and,

what is left over, is used to defray the expenses incurred by

the Board in collecting this overdue payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty interest is necessary to ensure that

employers  are  on  time  in  paying  their  employees'   CPF

contributions.  After all, the majority today, 20% comes  out

of  the  employees'  wages and only 16% comes  out  from  the

employer.   So  it is part of the employee's  wages  and  any

delay  is  unfair  to  the employee.  We  have  to  impose  a

sufficiently effective deterrent to ensure that employers pay

their  CPF contribution on time.  I am glad to say  that  the

majority of employers do pay their CPF contribution for their

employees  on time.  It is only a small percentage  of  cases

who are delayed in such payment.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, can I just seek a point of

clarification from the Minister?  I think he did  not  answer

my  question as to how much of CPF money is tied to  housing.

Somebody in the private sector has given a figure of 25%.   I

want to know whether this is correct or not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not have the figures with

me.   I  understand  that  the CPF Board  does  publish  such

figures  on  the  use  of CPF in public housing  and  private

housing.   It is not such a big secret.  It is all  published

in the annual report.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, structural

unemployment has arrived in Singapore and looks set  to  stay

for  some  time.   Over  the  last  five  years,  those  with

secondary  and  below  secondary qualifications  made  up  an

average of 75% of unemployed Singapore residents.  It did not

matter  if  it was a good year or a bad year.  In 1998,  when

our growth rate was minus 1%, this group made up about 77% of

unemployed  Singapore residents.  In a good  year,  in  2000,

when the growth rate was a whopping 10.3%, they made up about

74%, just a minimal drop.  These figures are culled from  the

Labour Force Survey of the Manpower Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems clear that economic growth has had little

effect  on the lot of these workers.  In good years  or  bad,

jobs are not coming their way.  This is despite the array  of

training  programmes  rolled out  over  the  years,  and  the

millions spent on these initiatives.  They are victims of the

restructuring process.  My Parliamentary colleague,  Mr  Khaw

Boon  Wan,  once talked about the Singapore  Cause.   He  was

referring  to  the core ideals of this society - meritocracy,

fair   play   and   equal  opportunities.   This   structural

unemployment is the Singapore Cost.  We cannot allow an under-class  to develop and harden in Singapore.  There are  social

costs  associated  with unemployment.  There  is  a  need  to

change  the employment system to bring it in line with socio-economic changes that make structural reform necessary in the

first place.  We restructure the economy to create more  jobs

for  Singaporeans.  The problem is that in the short-term  to

the   medium-term,   structural  reform  will   create   more

unemployment for this particular group of workers.  It is the

responsibility  of the Government to deal with  the  emerging

employment problems resulting from these structural reforms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present measures may not be effective enough to help

these low-skilled workers find jobs going by the rate of job-matching.   We need to foster the informal economy which  can

provide jobs for these workers.  I would urge the Ministry of

Manpower  to  work  with our Community  Development  Councils

(CDCs)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



to expand job opportunities for these workers - not on an ad-hoc  basis, as some CDCs do now, but in a structured way  all

over  the  island.  These jobless people may,  otherwise,  be

susceptible to engage in illegal activities or rely on public

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how the Government

intends to deal with the problem of structural unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, in August 1999, the Manpower

Ministry  launched Manpower 21, a blueprint to transform  our

workforce  to  meet  our future manpower needs,  enhance  our

competitiveness  and minimise structural unemployment.   Many

developments  have  happened in these three  years.   We  see

record numbers of workers losing their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a close study of the Manpower 21 blueprint

again  shows that its objectives are as valid today  as  when

the  blueprint  was  launched.  For example,  the  vision  of

Singapore as a talent capital is still relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An area that I wish the Government to strive to do

better  is the accurate projections of future manpower  needs

in  the  various  sectors.  This is  crucial,  as  otherwise,

workers may not choose the right skills to be trained in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower for its

assessment   of  the  implementation  of  the   Manpower   21

blueprint.   How  has  the  economic recession  affected  the

implementation  of the plan?  Is the Ministry satisfied  with

the progress of lifelong learning?  What more can be done?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest preliminary estimates by the Ministry show

that  total  employment contracted by  16,100  in  the  first

quarter  of  2002.   It  was the third consecutive  quarterly

decline  in  employment.   The  seasonally  adjusted  overall

unemployment rate was 4.5% in March 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has stepped up its employment assistance

programmes such as People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



Work   Skills  Training  Programme  and  the  Self-Employment

Training Programme.  All these will help, but I think we need

to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such efforts should also continue even as the economy

recovers in the near future, as the jobs that were lost might

not  come  back.  In the Manpower Minister's  own  words,  it

could be a "jobless recovery".  How will the Ministry further

strengthen our efforts to help the retrenched workers and the

older workers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Chairman,  I  know  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  has  set  up

employment assistance centres to help jobless people to  find

jobs.   I also know that the Government has set up a National

Employment  Task  Force  to  coordinate  and  strengthen  the

assistance given to the retrenched and unemployed people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from my meet-the-people sessions, I know that

although  the Ministry of Manpower has been giving this  kind

of  assistance to the unemployed people, many job  applicants

have called the companies recommended by MOM, only to be told

that  no  vacancy was available. Some may be  called  up  for

interview  but,  at the interview, they were  told  that  the

vacancies   had  already  been  filled.  Time  and  transport

expenses were wasted for nothing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these unemployed people have already lost

confidence  in MOM.  They told me that seeking the assistance

of MOM and the CDCs was merely some form of self-consolation.

The result is that their hope of getting a job is dashed, and

they have still to wait for a job opportunity to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th January, the Straits Times reported that a

certain  CDC  had misplaced the application form  of  a  job-seeker,  and the information of companies listed  by  another

CDC for the reference of job applicants was outdated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should re-assess whether the

present mechanism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



to  assist the unemployed people is still effective,  and  is

there  room for improvement.  Assessment of the effectiveness

of this mechanism should be based on the number of people who

are successful in getting a job through the assistance of the

Government agencies concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th April, Lianhe Zaobao reported that out of the

1,600  unemployed   people who sought  help  from  MOM  every

month,  only  about 6% were given referrals for   jobs.   The

question  is: out of the 1,600 unemployed people  per  month,

how  many  people  were successful in  getting  a  job?   The

Minister for Manpower said in Parliament a few days ago  that

about 15% of the people were successful in getting jobs.   Is

he happy with the 15% success rate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when MOM recommends jobs to the people, what

is  the  ratio between the number of vacancies and the number

of  applicants?  If  there are only  10  vacancies,  do  they

recommend  these  10  vacancies to some 100  applicants,  and

consider itself as having helped these applicants?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Ministry of Manpower must have

systematically collected  information on the people who  have

been  unemployed  for  a  long  time    and  conduct  further

analysis on the profile of these prolonged unemployed, so  as

to follow up and resolve their unemployment problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is ascertained that a certain category of

unemployed  people is no longer able to secure suitable  jobs

that  they  would want to undertake in the market,  then  MOM

should  consider  providing employment counselling  to  these

people, to advise them to switch over to other suitable lines

of  employment, so as to prevent them from being  perpetually

unemployed in the face of economic restructuring.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am glad that

Government  expenditure  in the Economic  Development  sector

will  continue  to emphasise worker training  and  upgrading.

This year alone, there will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



be   100,000  training  places  provided  under  the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers who are most vulnerable to retrenchments

during an economic downturn are the older ones. They are most

at  risk  of  remaining  unemployed  even  when  the  economy

recovers, because some industries which they were working  in

may  be relocated to other countries where the business cost,

particularly labour cost, is much lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, over the past few years, quite a lot of

older   workers  have  started  to  accept  the  concept   of

retraining, and have actually put in efforts to upgrade or re-skill  themselves.  The increase in training  allowances  for

older workers could have helped to a certain extent. However,

the  important  consideration is not  so  much  on  how  many

workers have undergone retraining, but more on how many  have

gained re-employment or have escaped retrenchment because  of

their retraining. This is what matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has MOM any plan to encourage our employers to identify

the  new  skills or the fields of work that would be required

in  the  future, so that we could match the workers' training

with  the  relevant skills and know-how to  ensure  that  the

retrained  workers would not be wasting their  time  and  our

resources  on  acquiring  skills  which  are  irrelevant   or

obsolete?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we urge our workers to adapt to change, we must

not  forget also to get the employers to change their mindset

and be more positive towards the older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way can we strengthen our efforts to help our

workers to enhance their employability?   Since employability

and skills are inter-related, I would like to suggest that we

allow  our workers to accumulate and bring forward the unused

portion  of  their 4% employer-based annual training  budget,

like  the  way  we  bring  forward our  unused  annual  leave

entitlement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that MOM look at other countries' best

practices.  We  could  tie  up  with  our  polytechnics   and

Institutes  of Technical Training, to work out some  training

possibilities.  Many countries are constantly  searching  for

new  ways to do things better, and some of them have  already

gone ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the case of Sweden, the government sets

up  an  Individual Training Account (ILA) for each  of  their

workers.  The individual worker can decide how much he  wants

to  put  into  this account and how much to  draw  from  this

account  and  for what purpose. Employers are  encouraged  to

contribute  to their employees' ILAs. Such contributions  are

tax-deductible, and amount to 10 percentage points  of  their

payroll tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be useful for us to consider adopting other

countries'  measures  if  they are applicable  to  our  local

situation.   We  need to find ways and means to  enhance  our

global competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, there are many

training  schemes in place to assist the unemployed  workers,

generously funded by the Government.  In fact, in this year's

budget allocated to MOM, a high percentage, 28%, I note, will

be allocated to lifelong learning, skills upgrading and other

training programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, based on the feedback which I have received,

individual workers still find it difficult to find  out  what

programmes are in place and are confused on the objectives of

the different schemes, as well as how they are funded.  Also,

those  wishing to prepare themselves for other  jobs  because

their  own  jobs are at risk do not know where to  find  such

information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, there appears to be a gap between the information

on  training  and  other labour market information  that  are

available and workers' understanding and knowledge of it.   I

am  aware  that  MOM has set up a website to  assist  workers

called  CareerLink.  But, Sir, we have not reached the  level

yet where everyone in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



is   IT-literate  so  that  they  can  easily   access   such

information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question to the Minister is what more can be

done to ensure that important labour market information, such

as   training,  job  opportunities  and  new  job  areas  are

accessible to all workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, there is a need to link training to jobs.

If  people  still  cannot  find jobs,  even  after  they  are

trained, over time, they will get very disillusioned and  the

value  of training and skills upgrading will diminish.   This

is  particularly  problematic for older  workers  because  of

employers'  strong bias against them.  No  matter  how  well-trained  the  older worker is, he may not be employed  simply

because  of his age.  I am aware that there are fussy workers

but,  on  the  flip side, there are also many  discriminatory

employers although the older worker may be prepared  to  take

lower pay, work shifts or work in 3D jobs.  A unionist in the

banking  sector  told me about a retrenched bank  worker  who

went  for  a  job  interview, but was told that  he  did  not

qualify because he was simply too old, despite the fact  that

he was prepared to take a huge pay cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme,

but   this  programme  appears  to  have  limited  reach  and

application.   So  my  second question  to  the  Minister  is

whether  there  are  ways  of  enhancing  this  programme  to

strengthen its reach and application.  Also, whether there is

a way that we can facilitate employment for our older workers

in some jobs in the non-trading sectors, for instance, in the

schools, hospitals and other Ministries.  I remember  in  the

early  days of Singapore's development, we did reserve hawker

licences for the needy and poor.  The objective then was  not

just economics, but social considerations also played a part.

It  may  not be necessary for the Ministry to outsource  some

jobs, which many Ministries are currently doing, probably  to

save cost, when these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



jobs could then be left for the older workers to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that no matter how much we train

people, if employers still insist on imposing non-job related

conditions for employment, such as language, then it would be

difficult for those retrenched to find employment.  Hence,  I

would  like to suggest that the Minister consider putting  in

place  a  more  proactive  mechanism  to  enquire  into  such

practices, and to do more to educate employers not to  impose

non-job   related  requirements  for  employment.   In   this

respect,  MOM could even consider coming out with  guidelines

on  what constitute good human resource management practices,

one  indicator of which could be whether or not  an  employer

has imposed a non-job related requirement for employment.   I

would appreciate the Minister's reaction on my suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, generally I would like to

commend the Ministry of Manpower for initiating programmes to

help   our   workers  to  be  employed  and  better  trained,

particularly for those who have lost their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Ministry's Report, and as has been widely

known,  older workers, ie, those 40 and above and  those  who

have  lower educational qualification and skills level,  have

greater problems to find re-employment.  There are a  lot  of

opportunities for retrenched workers to get help, as both the

NTUC  and  Community  Development Councils  have  intensified

their  efforts  to match them with available jobs.   Here,  I

would  like  to make two points to help such workers  to  get

jobs  and  enhance their employability.  First,  workers  who

have problems getting re-employed need help in managing their

expectations  in  terms of salary level  and  the  nature  of

available  jobs.  This calls for counselling.   MOM  and  CDC

officers  who  help workers in job matching  are  in  a  good

position to advise retrenched workers about the need to  keep

some perspective in their choice of jobs, in terms of salary,

working hours, distance from work-places, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These officers can also advise them about the skills

training courses that workers should take up in order to take

advantage of the available jobs.  The question is:  are  such

officers  trained to counsel workers?  Will  these  officers,

who are likely to be younger than the retrenched workers,  be

able to communicate with the workers and empathise with them?

I  hope  the  Ministry  can look into the  training  of  such

workers, including the CDC staffers, so that we can help  our

older  and  less  skilled  retrenched  workers  manage  their

employability better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to have a closer link between

job  training and job placement.  I would allude to the point

earlier   raised   by   Mdm  Halimah.   The   People-for-Jobs

Traineeship  programme is a good effort to ensure  employment

for  those who are willing and able to take up relevant skill

courses.   I  believe this programme, which I understand  has

been able to emplace 2,000 workers, should be expanded.   The

number  of retrenched workers, who have problems getting  re-employment,  could grow in future.  So I urge that  we  widen

these  training  for job schemes.  Even though  the  DPM  has

earlier  this  week advised that we should try  out  existing

programmes  to help retrenched workers before venturing  into

new  schemes, I would urge that MOM look into the possibility

of engaging employment agencies in the private sector to help

in this effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end, may I ask the Minister to update the

House  on  the success of the Skills Redevelopment  Programme

and  the  SRP's  Facilitators Scheme, and his plans  for  the

future of the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I do not need to

belabour  the point, but I would like to echo the  sentiments

expressed  by  Mr  Hawazi that the Ministry of  Manpower,  in

fact,  has  done a very creditable job in terms  of  handling

situations.  I work with Dr Ng Eng Hen on the Task Force  for

Manpower, and they are very much on the ball.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my cut, Sir, mindsets have often been said to be the

cause  for  the lack of readiness for training and retraining

and  life-long learning.  How the children are brought up  to

think  about  choice careers is one such mindset.   Will  the

Ministry look into this phenomenon and, if need be, work with

MOE  and other non-formal educational institutions, including

civil  organisations, VWOs and CDCs, to  help  alleviate  the

endemic problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in school, my parents wished that I had

done medicine.  When I failed to get a place in one, a mentor

teased me by saying not to worry, I should make a good nurse.

I clearly ended up with humanities - working as a journalist,

later  doing social work, and later as a politician - and  it

gave  me the opportunity to nurse the community.  I am happy,

and I am sure many other parents too wanted their children to

be  doctors,  engineers, lawyers, and at one time,  in  fact,

Business  Administration  was  the  choice.   They  are  good

professions,  but  the  whole  world  is  so  wide  open  for

different roles to contribute to, and to earn a living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at how the profile of work and professions has

changed,  not  commensurate with what parents were  used  to.

There are workers who wanted to be policemen or firemen their

whole  life,  as  with my experience serving  with  the  Port

Workers' Union in PSA.  Some of them refused to be retrained,

thus  making  themselves inflexible, and not  employable  for

long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, Sir, to continue to be employable, we

need  to  be  nimble.  We need life-long learning,  in  other

words, training and retraining.  As some experts say, perhaps

eight  or  even more times, during our whole work life.   MOM

needs   to  help  create  more  awareness,  and  make  easily

accessible  information  with regard  to  alternative  career

opportunities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, almost all our current training

schemes that are significant are employer-based.  This  means

that these schemes subsidise employers who send their workers

for training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employer-based training incentive schemes remain

relevant and important, but I believe that they are no longer

sufficient.  Sir, as our economy restructures, the employment

structure will also change very fundamentally.  So instead of

a  lifetime  employment with a single employer,  workers  are

more  likely to have to work in several different jobs during

their  life.  And with shorter expected stints of  employment

with  each employer, the incentive for any given employer  to

train  their workers may be further weakened.  Yet,  in  this

new  setting,  as  so  many  of our colleagues  have  already

mentioned,  updated  skills  are so  important  for  lifelong

employability.   So  what this means  is  that  the  existing

policy  of  funding  training, mainly through  employers,  is

likely to miss out on an increasing number of workers who are

caught in the churn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traditionally, I understand that the concern about

funding,   the   employee-initiated  or  individual-initiated

training,  is a fear about wasteful expenditure, a fear  that

perhaps  both  trainees  and training  providers  may  pursue

irrelevant and unproductive learning and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that steps must indeed be taken to minimise

such  risks and waste.  But, given the changed situation,  we

must not let such fears deter us from doing what is necessary

to  help  workers remain employable in this changed  setting.

The Government has taken the first step in this direction  by

supporting the NTUC Education and Training Fund, which allows

individual union members initiate training under an  approved

course list, and then claim for subsidy from this Fund.   And

the  experience,  in the last three years  since  the  Fund's

inception, has shown that workers are indeed very keen to  do

so.  Last year, for example, more than 40,000 training places

were supported under the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the changed operating environment, I

would like to ask the Minister what additional measures  will

the  Government be taking to assist individuals who take  the

initiative and make the effort to upgrade, to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



Some  other  countries,  such as  Britain  and  Sweden,  have

already  taken the step of setting up individual training  or

learning accounts for their workers.  The question is:   will

our  Government also consider the setting up of such accounts

for our workers?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to raise an issue

with  respect to whether enough money has been set  aside  to

train  our  professionals, executives and managers  above  40

years of age who have lost their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various funding or training funds and schemes,

such as the SDF, SRP, Education Endowment Fund, available for

workers.   On  the  other hand, except for  some  pockets  of

training  fund available under the MOM Work Skills and  Self-Employed  Training for unemployed executives, there seems  to

be  a  dearth  of  such  initiatives for  the  professionals,

executives and managers.  For them to survive and progress in

the new economy, they must continually upgrade themselves and

acquire  new  knowledge and skills through higher  education.

While  requests to use the CPF fund for such purposes, except

only  for  studies  at NUS and NTU, have understandably  been

frowned  upon  by Government, especially when the  CPF  money

could  be easily lost through poor academic course, we should

also  not  be averse to exploring alternative ways  by  which

funding   can   be   made  available  to   help   train   our

professionals, executives and managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the Government

facilitate  the setting up of what I call a HEED Fund,  which

stands    for   Higher   Education   Endowment   Fund,    for

professionals,  executives and managers.  The Government  can

help  to  encourage employers, employer groups,  professional

bodies,    charitable    organisations,    foundations    and

individuals,  to  donate  to  the  fund  and  to  match  such

donations,  as  they  have done for the  endowment  fund  for

workers.   The  HEED Fund will help to empower professionals,

executives and managers, with relevant skills which, in turn,

will help to increase their employability and ability to fend

for themselves,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



through   self-employment,  part-time   and   flexible   work

arrangement.   The  availability of such resource  will  also

help  to  attract  investments towards  making  Singapore  an

educational   hub.   My  question  really  is   whether   the

Government  will be positively disposed towards the  idea  of

matching  donations for this proposed fund,  and  whether  it

will lend a hand in facilitating the setting up of this fund.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr

Chairman,  on  behalf of my Minister, I  share  the  concerns

brought  up  by the hon. Members, Ms Irene Ng,  Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang,  Mdm Halimah, Mr Hawazi, Mr Ong and Mr Zainul  Abidin,

regarding   unemployment  and  how   we   can   better   help

Singaporeans  find  jobs.  This Government  ran  the  General

Election   on  the  platform  of  "Jobs,  Jobs,  Jobs".    An

overwhelming  75% of the public voted for us, based  on  that

pledge.   We  are honouring that commitment.  The  Jobs  Task

Force  was  formed in January, 2002, to oversee the  national

effort to help our workers cope with the downturn.  Thus far,

we have some impact, albeit limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked how successful have our efforts

been  together with the job centres and the CDCs, NTUC, SNEF,

SPEM  and other self-help groups.  We are helping about 1,200

Singaporeans to secure jobs each month.  About  70%  of  jobs

seekers   at   our  Career  Centres  receive  referrals   for

interviews,  and 15% of them are successfully  placed.   Many

workers  continue  to  harbour misconceptions  about  certain

industries and are unwilling to take on jobs offered.  We are

highlighting  some of these industries, like marine  industry

and  hotel  sector,  which  have been  chronically  short  of

workers,  and  where jobs are available.  We  are  trying  to

change  mindsets.  We need, and will continue, to work harder

to increase the number of job placements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely with Mr Hawazi that more counselling

and  training are required.  In part, our limited success has

been that there are a limited number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



jobs.   If  the well has a little water, no matter  how  many

times  you  throw the bucket in, you will draw little  water.

It  is  not  that the well is completely dry, but  there  are

little  returns.  The other limitation is that Singapore  has

never  had  a  protracted time of unemployment, so  that  the

expertise  in terms of job placement, job counselling,  never

had  the opportunities nor the length of time to develop.   I

am not ashamed of this.  I am quite happy that we do not have

the  expertise.  But we have learned as we go along.  We will

continue to try to do better.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the MPs will rightly accept, the solution to

unemployment is not job placement but job creation.   Mr  Yeo

Guat Kwang rightly pointed out that even if you train someone

and  there  are  no  jobs, it is a futile  effort.   The  MTI

economists report that every 1% of GDP growth translates into

14,000  jobs.   So  we  need the  economy  to  grow.   It  is

Government's  responsibility to  create  the  conditions  for

growth.   But each Singaporean must equip himself or  herself

with  the  necessary skills so that when the  uptake  in  the

economy arrives, he or she can be employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, equanimity is in order. This is not the

first  recession Singapore has faced.  Severe as it is,  this

recession  would not last forever.  Neither would it  be  the

last.   All countries face business cycles.  So the pessimism

in some quarters of our society is overdone.  Yes, China is a

formidable  challenge.   But  the  Singapore  worker  is   no

pushover.   As Minister George Yeo rightly pointed  out,  the

Washington-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence rates

our  workforce  of the highest quality.  We had uninterrupted

growth  for  the last decade and our surpluses were  ploughed

back  into  infrastructure development and education.   These

continue   to  remain  competitive  advantages.   There   are

adjustments to be made.  But if we are to emerge stronger, we

have to learn lessons from this current recession.  We should

move forward with our chins up and our confidence intact.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important lesson to be learned is that life-long learning is here to stay. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked what

has  happened to the Manpower 21 plans.  They are  very  much

alive.  I agree fully with Mr Zainul Abidin and Mr Heng  Chee

How   that  life-long  learning  is  a  strategic  capability

necessary for our survival.  Lifelong learning must  permeate

the  air  we  breathe, the way we think.  It is no  longer  a

choice,  but  an  imperative for both workers and  employers,

without  which  we  would  not  be  able  to  secure  further

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business cycles are shorter and growth sectors may

change  quickly and completely.  Companies, like Philips  and

Matsushita,  that have relocated their production  operations

may never come back.  Workers will have to be more nimble and

expand  their  skill  sets.   It  is  Government's  role  and

responsibility  to  create  jobs  and  provide  training  for

workers.   But no one can promise jobs that will always  fall

within the comfort and familiarity zones and expectations  of

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi wanted to know the progress of our Skills

Redevelopment  Programme.   Mdm  Halimah  also  echoed  these

concerns  and  wanted  to  know how  effective  our  training

schemes have been in helping workers cope in this transition.

Some  are  heeding the call for more training and benefiting.

To-date,  about  80,000  workers have  taken  up  our  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme since its  inception  in  1999.   Of

these,   70%   of  the  employers  noticed  an  increase   in

productivity.  65% were able to find jobs within six  months.

MENDAKI,  one of our surrogate employers, conducted a  survey

last  year  among the retrenched.  70%, after attending  SRP,

secured  employment in three months, and 80%  said  that  the

training  they  received was useful in  helping  them  secure

employment.  But I agree with Mdm Halimah and other MPs  that

more needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey in 2001 showed that three out of 10 firms did

not  provide employees with training.  So we have an  arduous

task to convince employers and workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



These are current issues that the Jobs Task Force and the ERC

are  grappling  with.  How do we accomplish this?   Is  it  a

question   of  insufficient  funds?   I  do  not  think   so.

Government  has set aside about $200 million for its  various

schemes  and  for various training programmes - the  Manpower

Development   Assistance  Scheme,   the   Lifelong   Learning

Endowment  Scheme,  the  Skills Development  Fund,  the  SRP.

Deputy  Prime Minister Lee has publicly committed more funds,

if required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Yeo have suggested that if we

individualised these funds - in other words, each person gets

his  own learning account - then the user may be more  likely

to  use them.  If we did, individualise these accounts,  will

more  people  take up courses?  Perhaps.  But there  will  be

significant drawbacks.  Even if we say 40% of account holders

use  their  funds, the remainder would be wastage.   Even  if

more  went for training so that they can use up the money  in

that  account, we might not achieve our ultimate goal,  which

is to enhance employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individualised learning account is not an idea which

we  summarily dismiss, but we should try other options first.

Other  countries, like Denmark, have had more  success,  even

without  these  individualised  accounts,  in  getting  their

workers to accept further training as a way of life.  We will

continue  to learn from them.       One recurring  impression

gleaned  from their successes is that specific and  different

approaches,  quite  different  from  student  teaching,   are

required for adult learning.  I guess that is intuitive.   We

all  realise  that  as  we  grow  older,  we  tend  to  learn

differently, and our motivations also change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mdm Halimah and Mr Hawazi that the more

targeted train-and-place scheme might be more effective.  MOM

launched  such  schemes with NTUC and  EDB  for  training  of

aerospace technicians and core centre operators.  We will try

to expand on these schemes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng made a similar point that we need to do

more,  rather than the ad hoc training and matching.  Mr  Yeo

Guat  Kwang  echoed these sentiments.  Indeed, to expand  and

deepen  the effectiveness of these training initiatives,  the

ERC  is  considering  the  need  for  a  national  continuing

employability and training body, including a centre for adult

learning.   These  bodies  can then work  more  closely  with

industry  employers and professional associations to identify

new and emerging skills and needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to create a training and education system for

working  people that is seamless so that prior  learning  and

work  experience can contribute to the acquisition of  formal

qualifications.  We have to study and understand why and  how

adults learn.  We have to, as Mr Low Thia Khiang says, deepen

our  capabilities in career counselling so  as  to  help  our

workers plan for alternative careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that more attention

needs  to  be paid to our professionals, executives, managers

and technicians.  They now form 40% of our workforce.  So  if

we  exclude our foreign workers, which constitute about  25%,

PEMs form the majority of our workforce.  It has by virtue of

its  composition become a strategic advantage.  It  would  be

shortsighted  not  to enhance this asset.  We  must  oversee,

guide,  facilitate the strengthening of our middle-management

capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some schemes in place, together with EDB, in

terms  of enhancing new technology with IDA, in terms of  the

critical  infocomm technology, and with MAS in terms  of  the

financial sector development, and for the strategic  manpower

conversion  programme with MOM.  But we  can  and  should  do

more.  I welcome the idea that Mdm Ho brought up in terms  of

her  HEED.  Government will facilitate, but whether  we  will

donate is something that we will further consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mdm Halimah brought the point across of older

workers, which I will touch



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



perhaps tomorrow when more Members bring up the subject.  But

she   also  brought  up  another  aspect,  ie,  to  eliminate

discriminatory  job advertisements.  I would like  to  inform

her  that  a Tripartite Committee, comprising representatives

from  employers, trade unions and the Ministry  of  Manpower,

was  set  up  in  1999 to study these issues.  The  Committee

recommended  that an educational, instead of  a  legislative,

approach  be adopted.  In line with the promotional  approach

in  dealing  with  this  issue, there  have  been  guidelines

introduced on non-discriminatory job advertisements to  guide

employers  on  how  job advertisements  should  be  presented

without   discriminating  factors,  such  as  age,   language

requirements  or other criteria.  The Tripartite  Committee's

guidelines have been implemented effectively.  To-date,  only

a   small   percentage   of   job  advertisements   stipulate

discriminatory  criteria such as gender, age, race,  religion

or   language.   Notwithstanding  that  these  discriminatory

advertisements  are  no  longer a serious  problem,  we  will

continue to urge employers to put into practice selection  of

candidates based on their merits and capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the exercise, the message we want to

send  to  investors  is  that  when  they  set  up  shops  in

Singapore,  the Singapore workforce has got skills,  training

and attitudes that far surpass that of our competitors.  Yes,

we  cost  more, but the Singapore brand worker is well  worth

it.   When we can do that successfully, we will then be  able

to create jobs, jobs and more jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, do I have your permission to

seek a clarification from the Minister of State?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know from the

Minister  of State whether he is satisfied with the  way  his

Ministry  offers  employment assistance.  Secondly,  I  would

like  to  ask  him  whether or not he is satisfied  with  the

success rate of job-matching at 15%, as he mentioned  in  his

speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Low would clearly know that is

rhetorical and obviously none of us are satisfied.   How  can

we?   That  means  85% are unemployed.  Until  they  are  all

employed,  then  we  will  be satisfied.   Can  we  do  more?

Obviously.  Even if we did more, would we be more successful?

Perhaps  a  little bit.  But if there are no jobs, no  matter

how  much  we  do it, that is not a permanent solution.   The

solution to unemployment is not more job placements  but  job

creation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, our workers have contributed

immensely to the development and growth of Singapore and  the

companies   they   work  for.   They  are   generally   well-disciplined, hardworking, loyal and productive.  In the  face

of   economic   globalisation  and   the   resulting   keener

competition  for investments, jobs and markets,  our  workers

now  know  that  they  have to change, and  this  has  caused

anxiety  as  they fear that they may join the  ranks  of  the

retrenched and the unemployed.  They have to make adjustments

to  the  new work environment where employment structure  has

changed and where the types of jobs have changed, the pattern

of  work has changed and where there is no more certainty  of

lifelong employment with the same employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all these changes, we should ensure that

the  relationship  among  the social  partners  -  employers,

unions  as  representatives of workers and the  Government  - must prevail, and be improved especially as we are undergoing

unprecedented changes.  Our hope to see a new social  compact

must  include  an even stronger cooperation among  the  three

partners.  This relationship can be best demonstrated at  the

company  level.  But this is where it seems we have  to  work

the hardest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a union adviser to four unions, I have received

feedback that some employers tend to be intolerant, and  even

more   intolerant  now,  to  simple  mistakes   among   their

employees,  especially  during these difficult  times.   When

workers  fear  that they may lose their jobs,  such  attitude

among employers creates even more fear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



among  them.  I would like to know from the Minister if there

has  been an increase in the number of complaints by  workers

of the intolerant behaviour or attitude of employers, and how

are these problems between employers and employees resolved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, as many of my parliamentary

colleagues have highlighted, job security is one of  the  top

concerns  of our people today.  Minister George Yeo mentioned

yesterday  that  while  our economy  will  recover,  the  job

situation   is  likely  to  deteriorate  further  before   it

improves.   The  problem is more acute  even  for  the  older

workers.  Manpower Minister Dr Lee said on 13th May that only

8%  of  the  job  seekers aged above 40  who  approached  his

Ministry for help was successfully placed.  This situation is

rather  worrying.  Workers aged between 40 and 50 are  likely

to  be at their most productive age.  At the same time,  they

are  also  most likely to be at a point where they  have  the

heaviest financial commitments.  Being out of job at this age

will  pose  great pressure not only to the workers themselves

but to their families, including their children.

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower Minister also said that one of the main

reasons  commonly  cited includes high wage  costs  resulting

from  our seniority-based wage system.  Sir, I would like  to

ask the Minister what plans his Ministry has to encourage our

employers  and  employees to shift away from  the  seniority-based  system  to one that is based on workers'  productivity

and contribution.  I know that there has been some talk about

possible  reduction to the CPF rate contributed by  employers

in  order to help employers lower their cost of hiring  older

workers.  While the details have not been announced, I  would

like  to  urge  the Minister to consider these  changes  very

carefully because any reduction in CPF will have far reaching

implications and may affect the workers' ability  to  service

their housing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, these changes will not only affect those

who are retrenched, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



will   also  affect  those  who  are  currently  productively

employed.  Worse, it may deal a double blow to those who have

taken a voluntary pay cut in order to find a job, or just  to

stay  in their current job.  Sir, I would like to suggest  to

the  Minister  that  it may be useful to  consider  promoting

greater  use  of a flexible wage system, instead  of  cutting

employer's  CPF contribution for older workers.   Some  years

ago,  the  concept  of monthly variable allowance  (MVA)  was

introduced.   It may not have been as widely accepted  as  we

wish  because  of the recession.  But as Senior  Minister  of

State Mr Khaw said just now, let us have a little faith, give

it time, let us give it a try and it may work after all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of the across-the-board annual increment in

our  seniority-based wage system, perhaps the MVA concept can

be  modified  and extended to deal with the seniority  issue.

For  example,  workers can be given a lower annual  increment

just  to reflect inflation while additional increments should

be  given in the form of MVA, and this will be adjusted  from

year to year to reflect the productivity and contribution  of

the  individual workers.  This means that the wages of  older

workers  may  go  up or may go down, or may  stay  the  same,

depending  on  the individuals.  Workers who  can  contribute

more due to their experience and maturity can continue to  be

rewarded through higher MVAs as they get older.  On the other

hand,  those  who have been doing the same job all  the  time

will not become costly as they get older because the MVAs can

be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the greater emphasis on a flexible wage

system,  such as MVA, is a more effective long-term  solution

than   cutting  the  employer's  contribution  to  the   CPF.

Therefore, Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to consider

the  use  of  MVA, or a modified form of it,  to  help  older

workers before deciding on cutting the CPF rate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, when Singapore met with a

recession in 1985, an important lesson was learnt,  and  that

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



that business cost, including wage cost, cannot be too rigid.

Otherwise,  companies will not be able to adjust to  changing

conditions  and  may  go  bust prematurely.   And  when  that

happens, workers lose their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from that, the first component of flexibility in

our wage system, namely, the idea of having mid-year or year-end  bonuses,  as  an  adjustable quantity,  was  encouraged.

Thus,  when a company does better, it must reward its workers

with  better  bonuses, and vice versa.  That flexibility  was

adequate  in  a  fairly stable environment.  But  as  product

cycle  shortened and the pace of change increased,  then  the

more  refined  instrument of flexibility is  needed  and,  by

"refined",  I  mean that it should not be an across-the-board

national  move,  like a national CPF cut, or an  annual  move

that  you  can  only  do  so with,  say,  a  year-end  bonus.

Something more timely and company-based was needed.   And  it

was  exactly for this reason that the National Wages  Council

recommended  the monthly variable component (MVC)  since  its

deliberation in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to ask the Minister for an update

on  the  progress  of  the implementation  of  MVC  and  what

additional  measures the Government is taking to promote  its

adoption  so  as  to minimise the need for retrenchments  and

also to minimise the need for any future across-the-board CPF

cuts.   Sir,  I  particularly want to mention  this  because,

whilst  we  are  all very much caught up in  the  discussions

about  proposed changes to our CPF system, I think we  should

also  remember  some of the other systemic  adjustments  that

have  earlier  been proposed and are in the course  of  being

implemented and we should not be distracted from  putting  in

place the necessary structures in order to safeguard the long-term cost effectiveness and prospects for our workers.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the Manpower Minister

earlier told us about the problems faced by older workers  to

find  jobs  in  today's market.  It is true that  one  reason

older  workers find it harder to get a job is our  seniority-based wage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



system.  First of all, I would like to put on record  that  I

do  not support the idea of lowering the CPF contribution for

older workers.  You may be older, but if you can do the  same

job  just as well as a younger person, why should you take  a

CPF  cut  for  it?   What is needed  is  not  a  cut  in  the

employer's CPF but a change in the compensation system  under

which  workers are paid - make sure that they  are  paid  not

according  to  their age but according to  their  specialised

skills  and  their  contribution to  the  company.   Like  my

colleagues before me, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mr Heng Chee How, I

would  urge  the Manpower Ministry to look at the  flexi-wage

system  and  see how it can be implemented and  restructured,

rather  than cut the CPF rate for older workers.  The  result

would be that companies would no longer assume that they have

to pay older workers more.  Our older workers should also get

used to this.  But the employers must give them that chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a misconception to say that older workers are

reluctant to take on new challenges or harder work.   Let  me

cite  an example of my office colleague, K.C. Vijayan.   K.C.

Vijayan was a Prison Officer for 24 years and he retired when

he  was  50, about two years ago.  Conventional wisdom  would

say  that,  well, most people would want to  take  it  easier

after  retirement.  But, no, at the age of 50,  he  became  a

crime  reporter for the Straits Times.  Those of  us  in  the

news  business know that the job of a crime reporter is quite

demanding  and to write for a daily newspaper  is  also  very

taxing, with tight deadlines to meet.  And he is working next

to  younger reporters eager to prove themselves.  I asked him

why  he  wanted  to  take on such a daunting  challenge.   He

replied that he wanted to be relevant to society, and the way

to be relevant is to be around people who are younger and who

are at the centre of things.  Then you would know how you can

contribute and the role you can play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, negative attitudes towards older adults are a major

barrier  to  moving  forward.  Many employers  view  them  as

problems  to be solved, rather than resources to  be  tapped.

Older adults themselves often believe these stereotypes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



and  are  consequently fearful of making changes and  seizing

new  opportunities.  The employment system should change  and

so  should  the  compensation system  so  that,  as  much  as

possible, age is not a factor in employment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, two years ago, when we talked

about  older  workers, we referred to workers 60  and  above.

Last year, when we talked about older workers, we referred to

workers 50 and above.  Now, if you are 40 and above, you  are

considered as older workers.  And if you lose your job, it is

very difficult to find re-employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we always cite McDonalds as a model employer which

employs  older workers.  I believe we can come  out  with  an

incentive   scheme  to  help  some  local  food  chains   and

coffeeshop chains to re-employ older workers, like McDonalds.

Many coffeeshops and food courts are employing a large number

of  foreign workers even, at this point of time, when we  are

facing a high level of unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to urge the Ministry to come out

with  a  creative, generous incentive scheme for food  courts

and  coffeeshops  to  implement work  redesign  and  flexible

working  arrangements for 40 plus workers.   We  should  also

review  the existing work permit policy which has  been  very

liberal  in  allowing foreign workers to work in  coffeeshops

and food courts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Many of our colleagues

have  talked about the problem of older workers.  As a labour

MP,  I  would like to raise my concern for the older workers.

Our  main concern is the worsening unemployment situation  of

our older workers, many of whom are lowly-educated.  Although

we have been urging them, from time to time, to upgrade their

skills,  we still read in the newspapers that many  of  these

older  workers  are  turned away at job  interviews,  despite

having taken up our advice to upgrade their skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, it is not that they do not possess the

right skills or mindset, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



more often than not, it is their age that prevented them from

getting   the  job  they  want.   Even  in  many   Government

departments  and statutory boards, we find that many  mundane

jobs,  such as sweepers, car park attendants, cleaners,  etc,

are farmed out to contractors.  As we all know, many of these

contractors  operate  on the basis of maximising  profit.  So

they  would like to employ the cheaper foreign workers rather

than  local workers.  Although our local workers are  not  as

nimble  or  young as the younger foreign workers,  they  have

more than made up for this with their experience and maturity

in  handling difficult situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if given the opportunity, they will be able to put

their  talents  to  good  use.  In  certain  industries,  for

example, in day-care centres and hospitals, we can find  ways

to  make  use of our local workers and put their  talents  to

good  use.   Our  Ministry for Manpower  has  said  that  the

Government  would  give  the  companies  that   employ  local

workers some form of relief for six months. However,  in  the

event  that  the  period  of six months  is  insufficient  in

testing  out  the local workers, can the relief be  extended?

Under  this  scheme, older workers can continue  to  work  in

these  companies.   This  scheme  has  not  been  given  much

publicity  and most employers are not aware of the  existence

of such a scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government Ministries and statutory boards are the

largest  employer in Singapore.  I wish the statutory  boards

and the Ministries would take the lead and set an example  in

recruiting  our  older workers so that other companies  could

follow  suit.   We  often read in the  newspapers  that  some

Singapore  employers were giving ang pows on certain  festive

occasions  to  senior citizens as a form of charity.  I  hope

these  employers can also employ the older workers.  This  is

also some kind of charity.
