  <!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether his Ministry has any plans to link the Land Transport Authority's Vehicle Parking Certificate System to the related departments/bodies in charge of heavy vehicle parking places in order to provide better service to heavy vehicle owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the Member that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is currently studying the computerisation of its Vehicle Parking Certificate (VPC) System. The system, when in place, will allow vehicle park operators to be licensed electronically.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, heavy vehicle owners have to obtain a VPC from the heavy vehicle park operator before they renew their road tax. The computerised system will link LTA electronically with heavy vehicle park operators so that heavy vehicle owners who are allocated parking lots can renew their road tax at LTA without having to produce a physical VPC. In addition, heavy vehicle owners can also enquire about the availability of parking space using this computerised system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA is now exploring the feasibility and cost of the system with a network provider. This is expected to take about four months. LTA is targeting to implement this system by early next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak):</b> Sir, presently, heavy vehicle owners have to pay $6 for a VPC. With this system, will the vehicle owners have to pay any fee?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> We are reviewing the system. It is possible that the charges could be either reduced or waived, but we have not made a decision yet.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [11th July, 1997],
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1997 to 31st March, 1998.". - [Minister for Finance].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the Budget Statement delivered by the Minister for Finance. Some people are disappointed with the Budget, because over the years the tremendous expectations of incentives and various perks have been accorded. With these rising expectations, the present Budget did not provide for these incentives to be given, and it is natural that people have expected more but it has not happened. Therefore, there have been disappointments in various quarters related to the Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the Budget is well thought of and has got long term plans in trying to meet the various challenges ahead, and we should in fact thank the Minister for Finance for thinking through a Budget which would allow Singapore to deal with the various socio-economic challenges ahead. The issue is that social and economic environment changes and therefore we cannot anticipate how this is going to affect Singapore accurately, but we must be able to foresee some of these things and therefore the Minister has taken these issues into consideration. I must say that the Budget has not met with the expectations the people have in mind. Particularly those in the manufacturing and industrial sectors were rather disappointed with the Budget that has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been presented. Indeed, they have expected more because they were anticipating that the economy would be shrinking, the economy is on a down turn and therefore they expected the Minister for Finance to pump prime the economy in order to stimulate it. But I am sure he does not believe in pump priming the economy at this stage, because there are other prudent measures that have been undertaken by the Minister in his well-considered Budget for this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the thing that we should look at objectively is that the Budget is a sober one. It reflects the socio-economic situation around and, therefore, it is in response to a slow economic situation that we are facing and hence it is a prudent Budget which has been tabled in this House. I must say that the Budget itself looks at the long term perspective in terms of how we can further strengthen Singapore's competitive edge and its capacity to meet the challenges ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, Sir, some financial analysts and people have said that we should count our blessings. We are indeed fortunate that because of our prudent policy, the Singapore dollar has remained quite strong. The economic fundamentals are strong and this is what many financial analysts have said. This is true because if we look around, many of the currencies in the region have been affected by speculation, by socio-economic problems which the countries in the region are facing. And if we take the trouble to explore this and look outside Singapore itself, we begin to realise that many currencies in the region are being battered, and many people have lost money if they had invested in currencies of the region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the Singapore dollar itself and the fundamentally strong economic situation and the plans that we have, we have seen that the economy is on track. We have been subjected to various vagaries of other economic changes which we have no control and hence we are naturally going to be affected in some way or other. But if we look at it objectively as a whole, the Singapore economy is moving along, although it is not performing as well as it should, but it is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> performing satisfactorily, according to the various reports and submissions that have been given by the Ministry of Finance together with the economic forecast by the Economic Development Board itself.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is important for us is to ask ourselves this question: why is the Singapore dollar still strong compared to other currencies in the region? I think that is a very fundamental question that we should ask. The Singapore dollar is very strong because, as the Minister for Finance has said, the Budget that has been planned is based on a surplus budget. And it is always good to work on a surplus budget, rather than a deficit budget. Based on a surplus budget that has been planned over the years, the Singapore economy has remained fairly sound and fundamentally strong. Therefore, that is one of the main reasons why the Singapore dollar has remained quite strong despite recent pressures by forex and other speculators on the Singapore dollar. Sir, we should, in fact, appreciate and commend the Minister for Finance for thinking through far ahead in terms of ensuring that the economy stays on track.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should ask ourselves whether a budget surplus is really necessarily good for Singapore or we should, like many other countries, look at the basis of deficit, and in many places budgets are worked on the basis of deficit. Many countries have run into budget deficits and they have gone into borrowing, and this has led many economies into serious problems. I am indeed impressed by the fact that Singapore is worked on a surplus budget and this has enabled us to stay economically strong and to be able to counter against various economic contingencies that we may face in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two issues that I would like to bring up. We have this surplus budget and we are doing reasonably well. I would like to take up two issues which I feel that we should be generous about and we could do more. First, despite the revision of the Singapore Allowance for pensioners - the lowest is about $10 and rising up to $300 or so - I would like to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> say that the impact on the low income pensioners has been very marginal and small. And this is a group of people that we should think of helping them alleviate some of the difficulties that they face. I do not have the figures but I know that there is a sizable proportion of low income pensioners who receive less than $300 a month. If that is the case, many of them are affected by the fact that the minimum household requirement is in fact more than $300.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I feel that the Minister for Finance should be more generous in trying to see what we can do for the low income pensioners. And I have been, together with my colleagues, advocating that we should review and see what we could do, because many of these people have in fact committed very long years of service to the Government. They have indeed done a lot of public good, supported Singapore during hard times and have given the best of their years of service to the nation. It is important for us not to forget them and the meagre increase in the Singapore Allowance needs to be reviewed. We can do a lot more and I would urge the Minister for Finance to relook at the needs of this group of low income pensioners and see what could be done. I would suggest a top-up for this group of people, particularly those who are receiving less than $300, by increasing their base as this would indeed be a tremendous relief for them. This would be a very good gesture and we should, in fact, do the best that we can for this group of people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is that we need to be more generous in giving higher tax rebates for families who need to care for their aged sick parents because there is a growing number of families who need to look after their aged sick parents. We would like many of these aged sick parents to stay within the family so that care and support can be given within the family. The number is likely to become very acute in the near future. We need to take certain positive steps to register those who really look after their aged sick parents and they should be given higher relief than the $4,500 which will be generally accorded to normal families
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> who have to look after their aged parents. There should be some differentiation in terms of support to this group of families who are facing quite a lot of financial strain if they were to continue to look after their aged sick parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to see whether a tax offset can be given against the maid levy, particularly for families that are looking after their aged sick. If they hire a domestic maid to look after the aged person and he remains within the household, there may be a case for us to look at how these families could be supported. I would urge the Minister to consider whether a tax offset can be given to this increasing number of families who engage domestic maids to look after their aged parents. The bottom line is that either you build more institutions to look after a number of them or you encourage families to look after the old within their own neighbourhood or community or within the family itself. The option is to enable the families to strengthen the family's capacity to look after their aged sick parents. It is, indeed, Sir, a serious burden that many families have to face. I would urge the Minister to seriously look at this whole issue because it is an issue that we will face critically in future.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's economy began to show signs of weakening from the third quarter of 1996. According to the Economic Survey of Singapore, in our GDP there was a negative growth of 3.9% in the manufacturing sector in the third quarter of 1996, and there was -0.7% growth in the fourth quarter, and in the first quarter of this year, there was again a negative growth of 6.7%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other sectors of our economy, the building sector, for example, the growth was also reduced from 26.9% in the first quarter of 1996 to 10.7% of the same period in 1997. In the commerce side, the growth was reduced from 10.4% to 3%. In transport and communications, it also dropped from 10.7% to 0.6%. Only the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> financial services sector performed well and was our star performer for the first quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the newspaper report this morning, although our external trade has put up a better performance in the second quarter of this year, we do not know whether this trend would continue. It is still an uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing sector, the problem of rising cost is troubling the SMEs in Singapore and I think the Government should not take it lightly because this might result in many factories closing down. Faced with a situation where the manufacturing sector began to suffer a negative growth in the third quarter of 1996, the Government's reaction was to recommend through the NWC that the workers' average wage increase be restrained to not more than last year's 6.7%. The Government wants the workers to accept moderate wage increases, yet the cost of living here keeps going up. For example, bus fares, MRT fares and taxi fares have increased. Waste disposal charges have gone up, and university tuition fees were raised. Water tariffs will go up by 7 times. HDB flats are getting more and more expensive, and there is this impending electronic road pricing that is sending chills down the spines of the motorists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government does not prudently address the problem of rising cost of the manufacturing sector, resulting in the manufacturing sector not being able to survive or to register positive growth, then there is surely no question of higher wages for the workers. Yet, on the other hand, the Government continues to raise various charges and the ordinary citizens will have to face the serious problem of rising cost of living. Rise in service charges and the cost of living will make life more stressful for the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget gives the people some $3 to $5 a month, or rebates of $100 to $200 a year. In comparison to the higher charges and cost of living as well as the more stressful life, the giving of these rebates is like trying to put out a burning cartload of faggots with a cup of water. It is an utterly inadequate measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Jalan Besar said that the Government was sharing its fruit of success with the people by giving rebates in rental and SC/CC charges through the HDB. What he had forgotten to alert the people in his speech was that these are a very small token of return after the Government raises the charges and taxes. In this so-called "pro-people" budget, the various kinds of rebates given by the Government to the people are not very much. The rebates proposed to be given by the Government to the people total not more $400 million. But the various levies to be collected from the people are increased by leaps and bounds. For example, the revenue from licence fees and permits is estimated to be $3,178.4 million. Vehicles-related revenue is $2,197.7 million. GST collection is estimated to be $1,860 million. As such, the tiny bit of rebates provided by the Government to the people is simply paled into insignificance when compared with all the tax revenues I have just mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a long term strategy for our economy, I think the Government should look comprehensively into how to reduce the cost of living and the cost of doing business here. The dilemma we are facing now is that if we increase the charges and the wages are not increased, the people will have difficulty in making ends meet. 20% of our salary goes to the CPF, which we cannot touch. A small increase in wages will not be sufficient to defray the increases in charges. On the other hand, if we keep on increasing the wages, the cost of doing business will go up and we will lose our competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have argued that we could reduce costs by increasing productivity. But to improve productivity will take time. In the past, we have been attracting more investments and promoting automation to improve our productivity. But to invest in more advanced machinery can have certain limitations because our operation processes now are already highly automated. What we have to look into now is how to improve the quality of our human resources to improve our productivity. To improve productivity, we also have to go through training and to change the work attitude of our workers. It has a lot to do
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with the basic educational level of our workers. All this will take some time before we could see any effect in improving our productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to alleviate the burden of our people, the Government will have to provide more financial support to the service institutions so that they will not have to increase their charges. By providing financial aid to these organisations does not result in the people depending on Government's subsidy because this does not mean providing free services to the people, but just to make sure that the charges will not go up too much. So I feel that the Government should consider giving subsidies to the following areas: public transport, maintenance of HDB flats, waste disposal charges and university tuition fees. Our people will then not have to bear the very heavy burden in our cost of living.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin described the Budget as a "Shenton Way Budget" because it benefits the financial sector the most. I think this is a "Shenton Way Budget" because NTUC is also in Shenton Way and it benefits the workers as well. As for the rebates for HDB residents, our taxi drivers, bus workers and factory workers all live in HDB estates and they also benefit from these rebates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance announced that there will be a surplus of $4.1 billion in this year's budget. Although it is the smallest since 1992, a surplus is a surplus. As we always say in our greeting during the Chinese New Year " The Minister for Finance has done the same. We have surplus year after year. Just now, the Member for Hougang described the rebates as "pittance". This is what we always say. "If we do not give, you complain. We give, you complain even more." I think the Member for Hougang is a Teochew. So let me use a Teochew saying which, translated liberally, means, "if you do not have, you complain that there is none for you. If you have, you complain that it is not good enough."

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can I seek a clarification?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): "If you do not have, you complain that you do not have. If you have, you complain that it is not good enough." Let me give you another Teochew saying which, loosely translated, means, "No big deal!"
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for Hougang also referred to other matters, saying that the workers in Singapore are facing heavy pressure in life. He claimed that the amount of rebates is very small and of not much use. If we look at the rebates, it totals $36 million for rentals. For the utilities rebates, it is $72 million. Which other government in the world can give so much rebates to the people?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hougang also said that these rebates are only a small fraction of the revenues collected by the Government. This is the way we manage the country. Those who are required to pay income tax are the more successful Singaporeans - about 30% of the population. The other 70% do not pay income tax. So those who can afford to buy cars are, of course, richer than the lower income group. So we will tax those who are more successful and plough back the surplus as a rebate to the lower income group. Does the Member for Hougang not agree with this way of reallocation of wealth?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the NCMP also referred to the plight of the workers. He said that some workers had to take on two jobs just to make ends meet. Yes, there might be some workers in Singapore who are doing this. Unfortunately, they do not join our trade unions. If they do, they may come across some good union leaders who can advise them on how to go for retraining and upgrade their skills so that they can get one better-paid job, instead of taking on two lowly-paid jobs. According to my statistics, in July 1997, there are some 9,900 workers attending training courses initiated by NTUC, and in the WISE course, we have 7,200 students. All these people know how to do their work and how to go for retraining in order to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> increase their ability to earn a better income. These workers will certainly sing the song: "Tomorrow will be better".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in seven months' time, we will be debating the 1998 Budget and that will be another budget with surplus. There will be some more rebates for the people, and then the Member for Hougang will say, "No big deal!" But then, how many countries in this world can do this?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make two proposals here. First, the Government should inform every household how much rebate it will get and allow those who are willing, to donate these rebates to charitable organisations. This I will elaborate later. Secondly, the Government should plough back from our surpluses more funds into the charitable organisations for their development and recurrent expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Singaporeans will receive a lot of rebates on utilities, S&amp;C and rental charges and residents of 1-room to 5-room HDB flats will receive the benefits. . A lot of residents do not really know how much rebates they get, and they think it is only a few dollars a month. That is the reason why the Member for Hougang said, "Don't talk too much." But I estimate that every household will benefit by $150. To the lower income family, this is not bad. I think this policy is "pro-people". They not only make the people happy but also grateful. For those who live in 4-room or 5-room flats, they enjoy better conditions of living and they are living quite well. So some of them told me that they feel too shy to accept these rebates, and some of them think that these are small amounts of money which they do not care too much about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that the Government issue a letter to every household informing them how much rebates they will get and at the same time ask them whether they are prepared to donate these rebates to charitable organisations or grassroots organisations. Because the rebates are to be used to offset their payments to Singapore Power and the Housing and Development Board, we should also inform the residents how
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> much utilities rebate, rental rebate and S&amp;C rebate they are getting. The Government can then liaise with the CDC, the self-help groups and other charitable organisations, the Community Chest so that the residents who are willing to donate their rebates to these organisations could do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this may add to the administrative work of the Government, it can nevertheless achieve two objectives. First, all the residents will understand very clearly how much rebate they will get from the Government. Secondly, it will enable those residents who are willing to donate their rebates to these charitable organisations to do so. This is good for bonding the people with the Government and among themselves - the successful and the less successful, and this will be very useful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is now trying to hand over the administration of welfare work to civic organisations. Many of these civic organisations which have taken over the old folks' homes, family service centres, etc, have problems raising funds. They are always short of funds. So they have to start raising funds. That is their first job. The community leaders go to the shopkeepers in the HDB estates to raise funds. Professionals raise funds from the more successful people, and we have more and more fund-raising activities. In the past, every Saturday we walked past the Capitol Theatre, we saw a lot of young people holding metal cans to collect donations by selling flags. Now if you want to raise funds, you cannot depend on the cans alone. You have to use all kinds of devices such as 1900 telephone-calls, the $1,000-a-table charity dinner, and all kinds of lucky draws. The civic organisations have to resort to all these fund-raising activities to help solve their financial problems. Too much time and energy is spent on fund-raising, leaving behind not much time to look after the welfare of the less fortunate people in our society, to help them live a better life. Some volunteers told me that the shopkeepers were afraid to answer their calls for fear of being asked to donate. A businessman told me that he wanted to do charity, but because there
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> were more and more fund-raising demands and the amounts requested were getting bigger and bigger, he just could not cope with them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a fact. Voluntary organisations have not only to raise funds but also to worry about funds. Because the Government has a certain quota for the grant of development and recurrent expenditures for charitable organisations, many civic organisations which have taken over this kind of work have to worry about funds. If they want to extend their facilities or rebuild their premises, the problem is even larger. The Ministry has already fixed a ceiling for such expenditure. But this kind of ceiling must be reviewed from time to time. For example, if a charitable organisation has a recurrent expenditure of $600,000, this organisation will have to look for $300,000, that is, 50% contribution - "co-payment", as in the case of the healthcare co-payment system, in order to prevent abuse. But when civic organisations take over the running of welfare work, they must have the full support of the Government. Since the Government has surpluses, the Government should pay for it. The good work must be financed by the Government and we will be able to do more in welfare work. If you insist on a co-payment in the welfare work, I think it will deter those who are willing to take on welfare work from coming into the picture. Now that they know the Government does not want to pay anymore, they would not dare to take on welfare work. We will then have problems finding volunteers. If we want these volunteers to keep on raising funds all the time, then we are not making good use of our limited resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that in the next Budget to be announced in seven months' time, the Minister for Finance would allocate more funds from the surpluses to give our welfare organisations full support so that we have more volunteers to come forward to look after the old folks' homes, creches and other welfare organisations. If we want to build a gracious and cohesive society, we should have more volunteers to look after our less fortunate
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people. These volunteers should be extending their helping hand and not begging hands all the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Just now, in my speech, I did not mention about personal income tax. I have no objection to the Government's reallocation of resources. Mr Seng mentioned that the Government should write to the people to tell them how much rebates they will be receiving. Can I suggest that in that case, the Government should also tell the people, after offsetting the increases, whether the final figure will be a positive number or a negative number?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are workers in Singapore, particularly those who are less educated, who need to take on more than one job in order to make ends meet. If you want them to go for training or retraining, who is going to support their families? For garbage collectors, what training can we provide them to upgrade their skills and get higher wages?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng mentioned the song "Tomorrow will be better". I too would like to see that the workers in Singapore have a better tomorrow. But under the present circumstances, if their wages do not go up and the cost of living keeps on going up, then I think the workers will be singing "Tomorrow will be more expensive", rather than "Tomorrow will be better".
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer the last part first. He said, "Tomorrow, prices will be more expensive." Of course, if our standard of living is improved, and we have to provide better facilities, then we will have to pay higher prices. So we have to balance cost and expenditure. The Member said that for the workers, it is "tomorrow will be more expensive". If you compare five years ago to today, are the workers not better off now? Every weekend, we see coach-loads of workers travelling across the causeway to have fun, shopping and eating in Johor. Many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> workers take their whole family for overseas holidays every year. Those who are not so well-to-do go to the neighbouring countries, and those who are better off go to China, Japan, Europe and even the USA for holidays. Our workers have also chances to go for overseas study tours. Recently, a group of our transport workers went to Hong Kong to study their public transport system. Even cleansing workers may be sent overseas to study how the advanced countries do their public cleansing work. When the Prime Minister visited the Philippines and Indonesia, he invited our union representatives to join him in his delegation. Very soon he will be visiting Mexico and I am sure he will be asking our trade unions to send representatives to see how the workers live there, as compared to how we live here. I believe that Singapore workers will have a better tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how cleansing workers can go for training, I know that cleansing workers work for four to five hours a day, earning about $800 to $900 a month. Yes, their pay is low. But do they use the remaining part of the day for retraining to increase their income? As I said, doing two jobs is not a permanent solution. They should do one job and go for training during the rest of the day. Then he will increase his earning capacity. A cleansing worker came to see me. If I behave like the NCMP, I will just come to this House and make a complaint. But, no, I did more than that. I offered him a solution. I said to him, "We are short of bus drivers. Can you go and learn to become a bus driver?" He replied, "I never thought about that." That is upgrading his skills. We have the Skills Development Fund to help our workers upgrade their skills. If the worker learns and gets his driving lessons, then he will be able to increase his income from $800-$900 to $1,000-$2,000 a month. In five years' time, with overtime allowance, he will be able to earn $3,000. That is the way to raise his income, and "Tomorrow will be better".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter he raised was that the Government should also set out in the letter how much the charges will be increased. I think these are two separate matters. I said that in this financial year, there are so many rebates that many
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people do not know. Even the Member for Hougang said it was "No big deal!" If we add them up, it is a very large sum of money. If you give the lower income people an angbao of $10, they will be happier and grateful to you. How about $50 or $100? They will be even more happy and grateful! So I think we should not mix up all these costs and expenditures together.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member said that he did not refer to personal income tax. But he was saying that there were a lot of revenues, and the revenues also include income tax. Vehicle taxes are also part of our revenue. What we are trying to do is to reallocate our wealth and narrow the gap between the more successful and the less successful Singaporeans, and strengthening the bonding between the two groups of people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP and the Member for Hougang want to create the impression that this "pro-people" Budget is a very pressurising Budget. He commented that our people here are very hard-pressed and pressurized. Let me take a minute to tell you this story about "Tyranny being fiercier than a Tiger". One day, Zi Lu, a disciple of Confucius, walked past the mountain of Tai Shan and he saw an old woman crying by the roadside. He asked her, "Why are you crying?" The old woman replied, "My grandfather was killed by a tiger. My husband was killed by a tiger, and now even my son was killed by a tiger." Zi Lu reported the matter to his master. Confucius said, "Ask her why she does not move somewhere else to live?" Zi Lu went back to the old woman and asked her, "Since your life is threatened by the tiger, why didn't you and your family move somewhere else?" The old woman replied, "This government here is good. There is no tyrant here, only the tiger. That is why I have decided to continue staying here." When Zi Lu told Confucius what the old woman had said, Confucius commented, "Tyranny is fiercer than a tiger!"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two months ago there was talk about tigers in Pulau Ubin. When we talk about tigers, everybody is afraid. They all
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> come to the main island of Singapore. They are not afraid of coming here, because we have a good government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) The story told by Mr Seng happened many, many years ago. With urbanization, all our forests are being turned into a city, so there are no more tigers in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Government, whether it is like a tiger which will suck our blood, let us leave it to the people to decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rebates versus the increases in Government charges, I think what Mr Seng meant was that we will tell only the good news and not the bad news. He was talking about the cleansing workers who can be upgraded to bus drivers and they could earn $2,000 to $3,000. As far as I know, bus drivers are not paid so much. If they are earning so much, then they must have been working very, very long hours of overtime. Mr Seng has described our workers as very high class, going overseas, study tours, and so on and so forth. . Of course, there are some. We also know that in Singapore, there are some workers' country clubs where they can go and play golf. But the fact is, how many percent of our workers in Singapore really went and played golf or were lucky enough to be selected to go for overseas study tours? Also, for these tours, who pays for their expenses? Do they go free of charge, or do they have to pay for their expenses?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I reply to Mr Low about the bus drivers' income, let me say that I am a Director of SBS. I know the pay structure of the bus workers. Generally, the starting pay is more than $1,000. After three to five years, and if he is hardworking and does a lot of overtime work, he can earn more than $2,000, and even as much as $3,000. This is a fact and my colleague, Mr Ong Ah Heng, who is the Advisor to the Transport Workers' Union, can confirm that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have improved the living standard of our workers and we have improved their income as well. This is also one
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the reasons why bus fares have to be increased. I would like to use the expression: "The wool must come from the sheep themselves". We know that a lot of our workers take their families away for overseas holidays once or twice every year at their own expense and then the whole family goes out on tours at their own expense.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can I also clarify what was spoken by the two MPs because they have mentioned my name in their speeches. Perhaps Mr Low does not understand. For Singaporeans who are living in 1-room or 2-room rental HDB flats, their total income must not be more than $800 a month. If the total family income is less than $800, they can apply to rent a 1-room or 2-room HDB flat. So we are looking after the lower income groups in Singapore. For those who are earning less than $800 a month, but after deduction for CPF, their total income is just about $600. The rebates for water tariffs, utilities and rental and conservancy charges represent quite a large percentage of their income already.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the PAP constituencies, every Member of Parliament gives away a lot of bursaries and scholarships to children of their constituents. Maybe in Hougang, the MP for Hougang did not give such bursaries and scholarships to his residents, and the people in Hougang may be suffering. But in our constituency, we help our constituents. It is a fact.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): First of all, I would like to tell Mr Peh that in Hougang constituency, we have the bursary grants too. It does not come from the Government. It is a fund fully raised by us. So it has nothing to do with the Government. If Mr Peh means to make use of the Government's money to give to the residents, then it will involve a very fundamental question, that is, how should the Government make use of the people's money? I would like to remind Singaporeans what Mr Seng had said about the wool must ultimately come from the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sheep themselves. Basically, what is given to you would be taken away from you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, can I also clarify? In my constituency, for the bursary and scholarship funds, I have raised about $1 million and we have used up about $600,000. All the funds were raised by us through fund-raising campaigns, not from the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): In Hougang, we give out bursaries to needy residents every year. The amount is about $20,000 a year. It may be a little less, but we are able to raise enough money to give away bursaries to our students every year. We have granted more than 80 such bursaries. We have done our best.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify this point? He said that the wool must ultimately come from the sheep and that the Government gives you with one hand and takes back from the other hand. I would say that the Government takes from the fat sheep and give the wool to the thin sheep. It is not taking from the thin one to pay for the fat one.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(

  <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Clarification from the Member for Hougang. I wonder whether he understands when he is talking about the sheep and tiger. Just now, he was saying that he is leaving it to the people to decide whether the Government is the tiger that sucks blood. I would just like to remind the Member for Hougang that the people had indeed decided. At the last election, the ruling Government has been returned with a more convincing victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, I do not deny the fact that Singaporeans had decided that the PAP

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should be the Government. I think Mr Chay Wai Chuen said at the last debate that when the voters voted for me in Hougang, they know what is in store for them. So I also expect Singaporeans who have given the PAP a majority vote to expect what is in store for them. I do not deny that. But I think it is my duty here to air the views of Singaporeans and how they feel about the pressures in life and the cost increases that have inflicted a heavy burden in their life.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> I just want to add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in fact, when it comes to airing of people's views, it is not the monopoly of only the opposition Member.

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Mr Chen.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been reading reports in the press today as to the various reactions to the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance. Everybody seems to think that this Budget is rather dull and no excitement. Even Members of the House were saying that there are not enough goodies for everybody. But if we cast our mind back, this has been the way the Finance Minister has presented the Budget for the last 10-15 years. The Budget has been rather dull every year and the economy kept on going. We get more and more things, tax reductions, and so on. If we look at the other countries, budget time is a time for crisis. There is something always going wrong in the country when the budget is presented and the people always look towards the budget to see whether the government has any solutions to resolve this crisis. You look at the recent budget in Great Britain, the Philippines and a few other
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> countries. We are probably the only country in the world where we have a painless Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in this House always say that the Budget is painless and the pain comes afterwards. But very few countries in the world can afford this luxury of having a budget that has no excitement. But that is not really the key to the situation. The situation is that the Budget has been painless all these years because the Government has taken pains to make sure that there is no pain. By the time the Budget is presented, the various policies are already in place and under implementation. It is because of the smooth implementation of these Budgets that we do not have the ups and downs and the worries and pains that come along with it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think many people in the public, and I must say some Members as well, have missed, one very key point in the Finance Minister's Statement. He mentioned quite extensively the longer term prospects of Singapore and the challenges that we face in the coming years. The challenges are real and difficult. Those of us, especially those of us in the business world, will know what it means. We talk about creating a second wing in the region. I think all of us who are doing business in the region will know that it is very difficult doing business, whether it be in China, Russia, or in any other places.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we ourselves have to protect our own economy because of the challenges posed by the surrounding countries in their attempt to attract investments. The key question is how we react to these challenges. What kind of sacrifice we have to make and what must we do rather than what the Government can do for us. The Government can only do so much. But if we were to secure business opportunities in the region and to increase our competitiveness, we have to play our own part as well and not depend on the Government all the time to hold our hands. So these challenges underline not only this year's Budget Statement but the Statements in the past five years and whatever the Minister has suggested in terms of incentives are meant really to pursue these objectives.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our local businessmen, especially in the manufacturing industry, have complained that the Government is not doing enough for them. The Government can only go so far as to provide finance for small businesses, ie, capital assistance scheme. But the Government cannot provide the entrepreneurship which these industries must have to penetrate the region. And this is up to us. And if we take a recent example of Hong Kong and Singapore, Hong Kong succeeds despite the government. There is no government. But in Singapore, if we were to succeed as well as Hong Kong, I think we must have the same entrepreneurship, the same amount of risk-taking and the same amount of self-sacrifice if we were to carve out a niche in the marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point raised by many Members in this House and also outside is the huge surplus that we accumulate every year. In fact, even the Minister for Finance was a bit embarrassed when he said that this year's surplus at $5.7 billion would be less than the $7 billion we had last year. But many of us fail to see that the budget surplus has been used to finance very major development expenditures. Quite apart from the housing that we have to subsidise quite a lot, the three hospitals that we have or are building cost us about $1.5 billion. The Airport terminals will also cost billions of dollars, and the MRT line will cost $5 billion. Where did all these monies come from? Contrary to what Mr Low Thia Khiang had said that it comes from the people, it has not. The surplus did not come from taxes. The surplus came from the operation of the Government. We did not have to raise taxes to finance all these expenditures. We did not even have to borrow externally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many other countries, you take Taiwan, for example, in order to finance the mass rapid transit system, they have to borrow heavily. In Thailand, they cannot have the MRT system because they have got no money. We are the only country, so far as I know, that can undertake all these development projects
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> without borrowing a single cent. This is what the budget surplus is about. If we did not have this budget surplus, then you can forget about the North-East MRT line, whether it passes through Potong Pasir or not, and you can forget about the hospitals. You can forget about a lot of things. You would not even have an airport that has been consistently considered as number one in the world. So let us get first things first. You must make the money and after that, you can think of distributing it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has said that the wool came from the same sheep. Mr Seng said that the wool came from different sheep. Wherever the wool came from, I think the Singapore Government has returned a lot of this wool to whatever sheep of whatever sizes, except the black sheep, I suppose. We all know where the black sheep are.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has consistently lowered taxes throughout the years, not only corporate taxes but also personal income taxes. Mr Low Thia Khiang may say that the lower income people do not benefit from this reduction. But he would know that now 70% of our people do not pay taxes. This again has not happened in many countries of the world. Not only that 70% do not pay taxes, whenever the Government has to pass on some benefits back to those people who pay taxes, the Government makes it a point to pass back equal benefits to those who do not pay taxes in terms of rebates on S&amp;C charges, utility bills and so on. So everyone gets back something.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the asset enhancement schemes, ie, Telecom, Edusave, Medisave, etc. The amounts that are passed back are not in the millions but they are in the billions of dollars. Where did all this money come from? It is not from the people. It is from the surplus generated, and income tax only accounts for a small proportion. And considering the fact that 70% do not pay taxes, obviously, the lower income people would not have contributed to this surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement made on Friday, we were told that we have to pay much more for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> water, four or five times more. But even in this case, the Government is concerned enough for the lower income people to pass back the entire amount of increase in utility bills in the form of rebates to those in 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB flats. I do not think many governments would be in a position to do that. So it is quite obvious that the Government has been looking after the lower income people all these years, and look after them very well, despite what Mr J B Jeyaretnam and Mr Low Thia Khiang have said.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr J B Jeyaretnam's statement could well be true 30 years ago. But in the 30 years since the PAP came to power, I think we have done more than our fair share, much more in looking after the lower income people than any government you can name me in the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is an increasing mentality in the Singapore people, especially the younger ones now, and it may be our fault, that they have come to expect more and more from the Government. Why doesn't the Government do this for me? Why don't we do that? Why don't you give me this? And it is because for years we have been giving. Rightly so, because of our economic success, which is their effort. But I think it is time for us also to think of the challenges posed by the Minister in his speech. We are facing very difficult times, and normal reaction would not be enough. We ourselves have to do much more, rather than depend on the Government only. If I can refer to the famous saying of Mr J F Kennedy, President of the United States. He said this in 1960 when he became President. This is almost 37 years ago. He finished his speech by saying, "Ask not what the country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." I think this statement can well be applied today. To my fellow Singaporeans, I think we should stop asking: what more can the Government give us? The Government has given you more than enough, quite a fair bit. We should rather ask: what can we do to maintain Singapore as a country that we can be proud of, that we can do business
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in? It depends on our sense of commitment, our sense of sacrifice and our entrepreneurship in order to tackle the next set of problems. These problems are no longer the same that we faced even five years ago. These are difficult ones and it calls for extra commitment from us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has, in his Budget Statement, tried to pass this message across. But as in all budgets, most of the discussion concentrates on the last 10 minutes, the last five pages. But I think the bulk of his message that bears closest scrutiny are the first 20 pages.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with my colleague, Mr Seng Han Thong, that workers in Singapore have a bright future and a better tomorrow to look forward to. Year in and year out, we have good budget presentations by our Minister for Finance, and this year, it is no exception. It is indeed a good Budget. Taxpayers welcome the 10% rebate on income tax payable, and the increased child and wife reliefs. On top of this, there are the CPF Medisave Top-Up and Pre-Medisave Top-Up Schemes. There is also an increase in parents' relief for taxpayers who are living with their parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these show that the Government cares for our people, especially the senior citizens. The Government is indeed doing everything possible to encourage filial piety and to promote Asian values in our country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, those in the financial services sector are most happy with the new tax concession, and companies expanding overseas in their efforts to regionalise will definitely benefit from the Overseas Enterprise Incentive scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that it is a good Budget. Of course, some in the business sector are asking whether more could be done to give a boost to private enterprise, especially now when many of the companies are facing the twin problems of increasing business cost and increasing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> competition. The business sectors, particularly the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are hoping for more measures to boost the economy, and some measures to help cut or contain business cost and enhance our competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the fuller measures will come when the studies and report by the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness are completed. Well, some have called this a "delayed budget", but perhaps an "interim" budget will be more appropriate. Better measures may come later on. However, some want these measures to be effected earlier. In any case, I hope our Minister for Finance will take this into consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I agree with my colleague, Mr Bernard Chen, that we should learn from Hong Kong. Many of us who have visited Hong Kong on business are impressed by the enterprise, creativeness, the self-reliance and self-sufficiency of the people of Hong Kong. Singaporeans should learn from Hong Kong. They are enterprising, they are resilient. If anything goes wrong with their business, they would not blame the government. They blame themselves; they blame on bad luck. They go and consult all sorts of people to improve their luck and they try again. They try new and better methods. They are resilient. They are self-sufficient. We, in Singapore, should borrow a leaf from their book and learn from them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, the people are most pleased with the generous utilities rebates, S&amp;C rebates, rental rebates and the special S&amp;C grants announced by the Minister for Finance. These, I believe, will definitely go a long way to help the lower income groups and it demonstrates again that we have a caring Government that is concerned about the well-being of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on behalf of the residents and the 14 PAP Town Councils, as the Coordinating Chairman of the PAP Town Council Committee, I wish to thank the Government for giving S&amp;C grants of $3 per month for 1-room HDB flats, $4 for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 2-room HDB flats, $5.50 for 3-room HDB flats, and $4 for 4-room HDB flats. These are indeed very generous grants from the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us on the ground managing Town Councils, and for the HDB residents, it is indeed good news, and I must say it is a surprise to us. We did not expect such generous grants at this point. Though it is a surprise, we are nevertheless very thankful and appreciative, and much encouraged by the support given by the Government for the lower income groups in the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-room HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not just those in the business sector who are facing rising costs. Those of us managing Town Councils also have to struggle and wrestle with the rising costs in manpower, in cleaning and maintenance work, in cyclical work, in horticultural work, and in utilities and in water. My colleague, Dr Teo Ho Pin, has referred to them yesterday.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 14 PAP Town Councils have, therefore, no choice but to raise S&amp;C rates from 1st October 1997. Otherwise, the Town Councils will be running into deficit budgets and there will not be enough even for the cyclical works and ordinary maintenance works. Our Town Councils have tried our best to hold back any increase. The last increase was announced way back in May 1993, over four years ago. Costs have gone up significantly since then. For example, manpower cost in one Town Council has gone up during the period by 21.5%, and re-roofing works in the same Town Council by 189%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, PAP Town Councils will try our very best to contain and minimize any increase, and we cannot do less than the Government and will likewise take special care of the lower income groups. The PAP Town Councils pledge not to raise S&amp;C rates for 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB flats beyond the Government S&amp;C grants of $3 for 1-room HDB flats, $4 for 2-room HDB flats and $5.50 for 3-room HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the net result will be that with the matching Government grants, the 1-, 2- and 3-room flats need not pay more from their pockets in the revision of S&amp;C
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> rates. Any such increase will be matched and indeed cushioned by the generous Government grants. The PAP Town Councils wish to play its part and cushion any increase for the residents, despite the rising costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 4-room flats which will receive $4 per month S&amp;C Government grant, there will be some minimal increase above the $4 grant. The full details will be announced in the next few weeks by the Town Councils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, furthermore, the PAP Town Councils will continue to contain operational costs, maximize economies of scale, mechanize the cleaning operations and cut down our dependence on manpower. And I hope our own residents will help us by keeping the estates clean and beautiful, and thereby keep the cost of maintenance down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget Statement announced by the Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget has, in fact, addressed some of the key concerns of ordinary Singaporeans. The income tax rebate and relief for personal taxation is indeed welcomed by many. Also, the rebates for service and conservancy charges and to offset the increase in utilities charges have been warmly received. In fact, Dr Ong has just explained in detail how these increases will be offset. However, there are those who have cynically remarked that this move undermines our efforts to make ordinary Singaporeans view water as an important and strategic resource. I believe this is largely not the case. Many I spoke to from low income families within my own constituency have not only welcomed the rebates but have in fact strengthened their resolve not to waste water.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are some areas in which I would like to address with respect to the Budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> R&amp;D support for SMEs
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generous tax incentives given out to the financial sector must have been welcomed by one and all in that sector. In fact, as mentioned by Dr Tan Cheng Bock yesterday, word has it that this is a "Shenton Way Budget", and I understand Mr Seng Han Thong also mentioned that just now. Clearly, the Government is committed to making Singapore's financial industry the best possible in this region. I am confident that the measures that have been introduced will help the industry in this direction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, however, has been some disquiet about the absence of specific new measures for the manufacturing sector. This sector contributes significantly to our growth and the Government has on other occasions demonstrated its willingness to also help this sector grow and flourish. Hence, the disquiet. I would also add my own concerns here. However, Sir, my interest is with the small and medium enterprises which have over the years contributed to the growth in Singapore. Through sheer hard work, SMEs have in fact managed to stay afloat despite tough competition and rising business costs. DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong noted in his speech at the presentation of this year's Singapore Quality Awards on 16th July 1997 that the number of SMEs has declined over the years. Citing Department of Statistics figures, he mentioned that only 46% of SMEs operating in 1984 were still around 10 years later. And that among those which are still around, only 30% had increases in sales and employment and only 2% became large corporations. These numbers, I think, speak for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has in place a variety of programmes to help SMEs. I understand that the Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) has over 60 development programmes aimed at helping SMEs to grow and develop. Among these, there are programmes designed to help SMEs undertake collaborative research with local universities or research institutes and centres. In this regard, Sir, I wonder if the Minister would consider creating more opportunities to encourage SMEs to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> undertake R&amp;D work. The Prime Minister, in his speech during the recent debate on the Presidential Address, stressed the need for this country to develop its R&amp;D capability in order to stay ahead. I think his call applies to all companies, big and small. The perception, however, is that most SMEs are not willing to undertake R&amp;D work either due to the high cost or risks associated with such activities. This is where I believe a mindset change, something which has been discussed a lot lately, on the part of SMEs is needed. SMEs must begin to realise that in order to stay ahead, they must innovate. My senior colleague, Mr Bernard Chen, has just called for Singaporeans to do something instead rather than wait for the Government to do something for them. This is a case in point. Also, on the Government side, we must find creative ways of attracting these companies to undertake R&amp;D work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small companies, unfortunately, do not have pockets as deep as the MNCs. R&amp;D work usually does not bear fruit for a long time and tends to cost a lot. Hence, the way to go for SMEs is to form R&amp;D consortia where the costs and risks can be minimised but the benefits can be shared by all. I understand such efforts are already in place but tend to involve large companies and have involved companies in a very narrow range of technology areas. Perhaps, the Government may want to consider making such arrangements more accessible to interested SMEs and encouraging efforts in a broad range of research areas. Participating companies could be given some financial incentives to encourage them to get involved. We need to convince more SMEs to participate in such arrangements as the costs and risks involved are minimised. Another way is to encourage big companies, such as MNCs, which are applying for R&amp;D grants to rope in their suppliers, who are usually SMEs. In this way, the entire chain of companies involved benefits. I am confident that many SMEs would welcome some sort of help from the Government to help them remain competitive.

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Funds for National Education</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the importance of National Education, I am somewhat surprised that there is no special provision in the Budget for this undertaking. We have heard several of our top leaders and MPs voicing the need for National Education. Here, Sir, I would like to suggest that perhaps the Government consider starting a fund for National Education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of National Education is to ensure that succeeding generations of Singaporeans will continue to remember how this nation of ours came about despite the odds and the turbulent times we went through in the 50s and 60s. It is an attempt to pass memories down to the next generation. And, in so doing, to mould a people into a nation. The Government has, on its part, undertaken this task through a variety of projects. For example, the education curriculum, as I understand it, will be modified to incorporate elements of National Education. A recently launched exhibition in the Singapore History Museum entitled "From Colony to Nation" attempts, in a simple yet informative manner, to illustrate our short history. I understand a bigger exhibition is planned for next year. This is well and good.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, should not the dissemination and familiarisation of our history be done also by groups outside the Government? After all, the history of our country belongs to everybody. And I believe that there is a role for private groups in National Education. Private groups, by their very nature, would take a somewhat different perspective on National Education. With the inclusion of private groups, Singaporeans would be served a wide menu of presentations on National Education. Some will find one dish more appetising than others. In the end, all will be served. I believe in the long run it would be better for our country if the implementation of such an important subject as National Education includes everyone, as it would bolster a sense of collective ownership in our history.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fund for National Education would attract private groups. They could apply
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for support from this fund to implement some National Education projects. Private production houses, for example, could use this fund to produce children's TV programmes to promote National Education. I am sure we can think of a variety of projects which private groups could undertake. Such an arrangement is not uncommon in Singapore. The Government, for example, has set aside some money which private groups can tap into to fund projects which promote the Singapore Family Values. A Committee known as the Singapore Family Values Promotion Committee (SFVPC) decides on each application for funding.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Sir, a similar fund could be set up by the Government to draw upon the resources and expertise available from private groups and organisations in our National Education effort. This fund would signal to the ground that this Government is serious about National Education and that everyone in Singapore has a role to play in its dissemination.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Support for people pursuing arts education</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our DPM Dr Tony Tan spoke in this House about the need to develop a stronger spirit of creativity and innovation in Singapore. The development of creativity through the arts is important for Singapore for two reasons: to establish Singapore as a cultural renaissance city and to sharpen Singapore's economic competitive edge. I fully support this view. I welcome the move to develop further both LaSalle-SIA College for the Arts and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA). We need capable and talented men and women who can contribute to the artistic and creative life in Singapore, and man the key institutions and bodies which govern art life in Singapore. We will need people to manage the Singapore Art Centre, to guide the National Arts Council and to oversee the many museums that we have here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along these lines, Sir, one question that comes to mind is what incentives are in place to encourage students to pursue a career in the arts? Do we need such incentives in the first place? I believe we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> do. Given a choice, most students would prefer a career in professions such as law, engineering and medicine. In fact, we have seen a trend where students choose to do a course in business rather than engineering. The reasons invariably revolve around the perceived potential income associated with each profession. I believe there is enough talent in this country to develop a vibrant art life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recently launched Singapore Youth Festival which I attended showcase the many talents which are available in our schools, in which even the Minister for Education agreed with me by nodding his head just now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who pursue a career in the arts often do so because they believe in it. However, the remuneration is not always comparable to other professions. Given our goal of establishing Singapore as a renaissance city, I would suggest that the Government provide more incentives for people pursuing education in the arts. These incentives can come in a variety of forms, eg, scholarships, low cost loans and other financial incentives. Such incentives would help to underscore the importance of arts education in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would welcome any move by the Minister for Finance to consider my humble suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just seek a clarification from Dr Ong Chit Chung? He mentioned earlier that the S&amp;C charges increase which the PAP Town Councils are contemplating will be offset by the grants for those living in 1-, 2- and 3-room flats. Is it not possible that, in some cases, the residents may suffer from some marginal increases because of the fact that the Town Councils comprise different areas which were amalgamated after the last general election?
  <br>

  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, each Town Council has to decide, within its boundaries, how best to harmonise different rates. For example, my Bukit Timah Town Council has five former Town Councils within our current purview and we have to harmonise all the rates after
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the general election. We will try our best to harmonise in such a way that it would be fair to all residents, and we will take a benchmark and add on the new rates, bearing in mind the Government grants. So there will be minor differences. But on the whole I think the effect will be cushioned by the Government grant. But definitely, from area to area, each Town Council can make its own adjustment and decide on its own how best to serve the residents and how best to peg it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me congratulate the Minister for Finance for a "pro-people Budget" which benefits the lower income group. However, while adopting these "pro-people" policies, we must also remind our people that they should not take our present economic successes for granted. They must not forget to keep on improving their skills to ensure their life-long employability, and to assist Singapore maintain its leading position in a competitive global economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are debating the Budget, we are very calm and relaxed in our discussion. But, according to my colleagues who have just returned to Singapore, they are apprehensive of the economic problems of countries which they have just visited. Recently, the NTUC sent a study mission to 3 countries in Europe, ie, Switzerland, France and Germany. According to its Report, which captures my attention, the unemployment situation in Europe is very serious. The unemployment problem is mainly structural in nature. For example, in France, the unemployment rate is 12.6% and structural unemployment accounts for 9.7%. In Switzerland, of the 5.3% unemployment rate, 3% is structural in nature. Why should there be structural unemployment?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different economies have different theories. But according to the Report I have received, the three main factors are, first, in the economic context, the technological demand and employment demand are not properly coordinated. In other words, some workers above the age of 40
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> who have lower educational qualification cannot find suitable employment. In the meantime, many companies are upgrading and restructuring and they need more skilled workers. But those unemployed are not able to meet the requirements of employers. That has thus resulted in structural unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other factor is that the unemployed have to share the job with existing workers. In other words, existing workers have to shorten their working hours so as to share their work with the unemployed. Sometimes, two jobs are shared among three workers. However, despite shorter working hours, the workers and the unions are not prepared to accept lower wages. The companies are having difficulty resolving this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most `fatal' factor is the existing rigid welfare system in these countries which has resulted in the Government having to spend more when unemployment rate is high. However, the Government does not have the extra money to spend. With high unemployment, the Government wants to step in to train and retrain these people, but there is not enough money to conduct the necessary training programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about the Singapore Budget, we must not forget that as a trade union leader, our most important job is to help our workers generally. We must maintain our competitiveness and to ensure Singapore's full employment situation. Under such a situation, even if the unions do not ask for a wage increase, the employers will take the initiative to offer wage increase. We must understand that we may not be able to enjoy a full employment situation forever. Take, Switzerland, for example. They have been enjoying 30 years of full-employment, but now they are also facing high unemployment problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when our economy is good, the Minister for Finance and all the other Government agencies must constantly review and implement policies to encourage workers to continuously upgrade their skills. According to our report on retrenched workers, from 1987
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to 1996, the number of retrenched workers in Singapore rose from 3,600 to 11,000. Most of these people are above the age of 40 who have a lower educational level. They are unable to find an alternative job that pays the same salary. If you want them to go for training, they have problems too. A few Members have already touched on this. I will not repeat here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics from the Skills Development Fund, there are 700,000 workers in Singapore above the age of 40, and among them 56%, or 400,000, did not complete their secondary education. So our main task ahead is to encourage this category of workers to continue upgrading their skills to ensure life-long employability. Regarding this, I believe the Government has certain schemes in place already. But I personally feel that the Government has not done enough.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although for the past 18 years we have been rated as the most competitive labour workforce by BERI, in terms of technical skills, we are ranked 39th; in terms of motivation, we are ranked 12th; and in terms of workers' ability to accept changes, we are ranked 7th. As such, when we talk about training or retraining of our workers, it is not only technical training but also training on teamwork, work attitude and other aspects of human conduct and behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Standards and Productivity Board, trade unions, and EDB have been providing some ad hoc training programmes. I think we should set up a coordinating centre for continuing education and training. The NTUC has considered this very seriously. One of the problems we encounter is that our workers were educated in different language streams. We have to encourage them to learn English before they go for skills training courses. This is very difficult. For those who are above 40, I think we should have a nation-wide standard evaluation system to ascertain their skill levels and to upgrade their skills accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have talked about the bus drivers. Like workers in some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> industries, they can only work up to the age of 45. We have to help them find a suitable job later by providing them with career guidance as to what kind of jobs are high in demand in Singapore, and whether these jobs are suitable for them. Therefore, a coordinating centre would be needed to do the study and investigation on the needs of different trades and industries, and the training required. Perhaps we can set a certain quota or criteria on how many workers we want to train or retrain per year. Otherwise, it may be too late to train the unemployed when structural unemployment occurs in Singapore. We will then be faced with the same problem as the European countries. So we must ensure that at least 50% of our workers in our workforce undergo training or retraining programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must have proper educational guidance so that our people can understand the need of training and retraining. They must be willing to sacrifice a few hours every evening to ensure they remain employable for the next 10 to 20 years. At present, our workers claim that they cannot afford the time to go for training or retraining because they need to work overtime or take up two jobs to make ends meet. Therefore, our training programmes must be made flexible in terms of time and contents (so as to meet the needs and the time of the workers) to help them overcome their problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about training fund, the Government has told us that money is not the problem. In Singapore's situation, we have enough funds. Since money is not a problem, the real problem is whether the money has been properly allocated. I think in our Budget, it has not been very clearly indicated as to how we are going to help our workers and employers to undergo the training programme. I would suggest that we set up a National Centre for Training, with financial support from the Government. Since the Government is so generous to train our present students through the Edusave top-up, I think we should also seriously consider setting up a personal skills training savings account for each of our workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the NTUC's suggestion is that the Government and the employers should set up a nation-wide coordinating centre for continuous training for our workers until they reach their retirement age. It is only through skills upgrading, productivity enhancement and full employment that we will be able to improve our standard of living, especially for those low skilled and lowly educated workers. We know that the open-door policies of China, India and other developing countries have intensified competition in the field of labour-intensive industries. If we want to constantly improve our standard of living, I personally feel that the only way is to have full employment and to improve the skills of our workers.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as one of the last few speakers, many of the positive side and accolades about the Budget I intend to mention have already been raised by my colleagues who have spoken before me. Sir, allow me, nevertheless, to briefly present my comments on the Budget and views on some business issues which have been the central subject of discussion yesterday and earlier today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of what the FY97 Budget meant for businesses, I wish to echo my agreement with some of those who have spoken earlier of it being a sharply focused one, targetted at specific components of the financial sector. It contains no sweeping give-aways for business on the surface, and is, therefore, looked upon as quite a disappointing budget for businesses in general.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, closer scrutiny of the Budget, however, suggests that there is indeed light at the end of the tunnel. Hidden goodies appear to be embedded in the expenditure side which I would urge businesses to look at closely for them to take advantage of. For instance, there are financial set-asides to be disbursed under the Economic Development Assistance Scheme and the Cluster Development Fund amounting to almost $300 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> To encourage more research and development initiatives, a whopping $482 million has also been allocated under the aegis of the second National Science and Technology Plan for businesses to benefit from. Businesses also stand to gain from the massive $4 billion in economic and infrastructural expenditure which is twice that of the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, amidst this backdrop, our businesses, especially home-bred SMEs are feeling the intense cost pressures and competition in virtually all areas. Sir, while this situation has propelled many companies to upgrade and automate their existing operations, or relocate to a lower cost environment, many also continue to struggle and are uncertain about what needs to be done, and therefore their future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plight of our local SMEs is a known fact to this House and Singaporeans in general. They continue to be confronted with many problems, such as inertia, lack of professional expertise, generally lower productivity compared to MNCs and difficulties to cope with increasing costs. Feedback from industry associations and business groups suggests that labour cost in general continues to be the leading contributor to escalating business costs. In a tight labour market situation, many of them have to resort to the recruitment of foreign workers and are feeling the pinch of high foreign worker levies. They are once again appealing to the Government to help them by considering further levy reductions to reduce their high operating costs. Sir, I do understand the Government's need to balance economic, business and social factors in our foreign worker policy but I feel that this could be achieved by imposing perhaps more control on the dependency ceiling and quota as a means of control, and therefore allow some room for pricing relaxation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern expressed by this group, Sir, is the pace of restructuring. Many of them understand the Government's intention to encourage or quicken the move into upstream and higher value-added activities in order to increase productivity and preserve our competitiveness. But many of them are asking if
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we are proceeding at an appropriate pace. Some feel that we are moving too fast - without much regard for the fact that the majority of our SMEs lack expertise, financial resources and technology and, therefore, need more time to prepare themselves to switch to upstream activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this is not already done, I suggest that the appropriate Ministry undertake to track and study the readiness and the extent of assimilation of our SMEs in gearing themselves up for the current restructuring phase by employing Econometric Modelling or other suitable techniques.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our SMEs provide slightly less than 50% of employment to our workforce, I believe they continue to represent more than 90% of the establishments in Singapore and they are, therefore, a key pillar of our economy. I know, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Government has done quite a lot to assist them through various assistance schemes and programmes managed by the Productivity and Standards Board, the Economic Development Board and the Trade Development Board. In view of their limitations, I think it is important that the Government continues not only to do more to assist them but also to further promote our SMEs as they are our indigenous and home-bred establishments that will stick through thick and thin with us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, one way to stimulate accelerated growth of our SMEs is to encourage mergers and acquisitions by the more promising ones among them. Such a strategy will enable the pooling and harnessing of scarce resources very much needed by our SMEs. Of course, I am not suggesting the creation of a climate of hostile takeovers but friendly ones. As a means to quickly obtain specific capabilities in some key technologies and know-how, the more established SMEs could consider merging with or acquiring foreign companies, as proposed by Mr Sin Boon Ann yesterday in the context of what we could do with our budget surpluses. This will enable our SMEs to quickly bring in expertise they do not possess instead of trying to reinvent
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the wheel themselves, which not only will take much longer but will also sap their limited resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Retail Sector</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retail sector is another segment in our economy which appears again to have been ignored. Every Singaporean is aware of the predicament of the retail sector, especially in the last several years. Many have gone out of business while those remaining are bleeding and left in the lurch to fend for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant number of them are indeed struggling to survive and the very fact that they are still around, I believe, is due to one primary reason and, that is, they do not know what else to do. They just keep going and struggle to keep themselves afloat. Do we leave things status quo and let them `die a natural death'? Do we simply allow the so-called process of creative destruction to take its toll on these people, without rendering them any help?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is encouraging to note that the negative trend for retailers is somewhat reversed in May, as reported recently, it is too early to assume that this is going to be a sustainable trend. I therefore hope that the cries for help from the retailers will not continue to fall on deaf ears.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Manpower Issues</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on briefly to the subject of our manpower development. With the increased pace of technological change as we gear ourselves up for upstream economic activities, I believe skills and knowledge obsolescence will become a bigger issue in the near future. This concerns particularly our older workers aged 40 and above who also represent the group with probably the lowest education in our workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of increasing retrenchments in recent years, we have been lucky in being able to find replacement jobs for those affected because of our consistently healthy economic growth year after year. However, we cannot assume that this phenomenon will continue into the future
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> nor could we afford to allow it to mask the impact of an unevenly developing workforce. Apart from finding it harder to find alternative jobs if retrenched, these workers, if they are not prepared for the change in our economic environment, will potentially contribute to an adverse impact in our overall productivity as the economy goes through its restructuring motion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are efforts such as the Skills Redevelopment Programme initiated by the NTUC and jointly supported by various Government agencies, I am concerned, Sir, that the pace we are proceeding in addressing this problem is not in tandem with the quicker pace of change in our economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the fact that we have a sizeable portion of our total workfoce falling in this category, I would like to reassert what Mr Lim Swee Say mentioned yesterday about the important need to also invest in our not-so-young Singaporeans. Sir, I think we need to do this with a greater sense of urgency in view of the experience of several European countries, as cited by Mr Lim Swee Say and also by Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon. In a recent conversation I had with a top German banker recently, I was told that there is no solution in sight to the structural unemployment problems in Germany because the country had not adequately prepared for it when things were buoyant. We cannot allow this to happen to us. We just cannot afford it. I know we are not resting on our laurels on this issue as evidenced by what we know is being done again by the NTUC, PSB, ITE and EDB to address this problem, but I would like to urge the Government and these agencies to intensify their efforts in finding more creative approaches in confronting this challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Conclusion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say that although the FY 97 Budget, with an anticipated surplus of $4.8 billion, is expected to be the lowest in five years, it is still very healthy. The increase in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> development expenditure will go a long way in strengthening our long-term future to enable us to continually attract high quality investments and ensure continued economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget is generous in rewarding the man-in-the-street and favouring the financial sector but I hope more could be done to help our SMEs and our local businesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy for FY 97.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the Budget this year is to keep Singapore competitive and to build up social cohesion. These two perennial challenges are our prerequisites for success. But these are challenges, not goals. They are means towards an end, but not the end itself. When all is said and done, we still have to ask ourselves how we measure the worth and meaning of our lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to become a civil society, one in which each and every individual lives a wholesome and fulfilling life, no matter what jobs we do, or where we live, or how much money we make. A society where each citizen actively participates in the affairs of the community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we fall short of this goal. We have succeeded economically. And our per capita is now one of the highest in the world, higher than many developed countries. But we are not yet able to call ourselves a developed country. Not just because we have yet to develop depth in our industry, but also because we have yet to achieve maturity in our social and community institutions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the prerequisite for a civil society is that we value and consider it our duty to contribute to society's development. We should be offended if anyone says that we are not doing enough to care for the community, and to share the wealth that we have with others. We should be ready to say that we have set aside not just part of our wealth, but part of our time, in the service of others. We should be, but we are not yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it is not easy to find volunteers to help out in community work. Often, it is the same group of people who come forward to serve. There are many reasons for this but, basically, most people have not set aside time to serve. In busy Singapore, time is a premium commodity. We need to create a new social ethos if we are to overcome this limitation. At first, I thought that I should speak in favour of five-day work weeks - a topic I think that has come up before - that would free up weekends and give people more time to participate in social work. I still think this would help. But it is not the root of the problem. Years in corporate life has taught me that we will never have enough time unless we set priorities. And setting priorities is a reflection of our values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something which each Singaporean has to do personally. My wish is that all Singaporeans will take stock of their busy schedules and make a conscious decision to free up some time for community work. If we want to be a civil society, we need to change our values and our lifestyles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A civil society cannot emerge by Government policy. We cannot mandate it, or legislate it, or enforce it. But the Government can do more to create the conditions which will foster its emergence. One of these conditions is the climate for creative and open discussion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about the quality of debate in Singapore. Some perceive that the Government does not encourage open debate. Much has also been said about the strictness of laws in Singapore, and how this leads to feelings of being restricted and over-controlled. These perceptions are real, to the extent that people believe in it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, as do most people, in the rule of law. The effective enforcement of laws has helped to make Singapore safe, efficient, and a trusted place to do business in. I also believe in placing markers for open debate - to disallow inflammatory remarks and orations which stir racial hate or seditious emotions. These markers help us to maintain social
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> stability and create quiet conditions in which, once again, business can flourish.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for a civil society to emerge, we must change the perception that the marketplace for ideas and expression in Singapore is restricted and confined. In diversity, we will find even greater strength than in conformity. We can and must search for those means which allow free expression but, at the same time, contain unwholesome and unwelcome behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cite a recent example where a ban was placed on 16 year olds at tea dances. Yes, this measure solves a problem. It is an immediate and efficient fix. And I think many parents who found it difficult to control their children welcomed this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does not solve the problem. I asked a teenager what she thought of this. She told me that, at best, this would only drive them to other locations and, at worst, underground. The need for young teens to meet and to socialise is real. Cutting away their meeting ground does not curb that need. She asked whether I had considered an alternative: to station a police team at the tea dance. Now that may not be very efficient, manpower-wise, but I think it is a step in the right direction. If we think it over, perhaps we can find some other hybrid solution which does not punish the kids for wanting to belong, but helps them stay away from the dark alley ways and the wayward habits of street gangs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can find such a creative solution, which holds back the strong arm of the law, and holds it in reserve for when it is really needed, we will go far in establishing a climate of accommodation and trust. Then more people would be willing to speak up and we would move forward in a virtuous cycle of fostering more discussion, more ideas, more trust and more responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tea dance problem also reflects a larger, underlying impediment to the building of a civil society, ie, that society should still look to Government to solve a problem whose root lies basically in the home. Tea dances started as a fun way
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for teenagers to let off steam. When I was young, we socialised by other means, like catching spiders and fighting kites. But with urbanisation, there are not enough spiders to go around, let alone find space to fight kites in the neighbourhood. We could have joined up with street gangs then, but whether we did or not was a matter of how our parents looked after us, and brought us up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea dances are not evil by design or intent. But they have been corrupted. The problem is not just the street gangs which have infiltrated the dance halls. The problem is also the influence which parents have over their teenage children, and the role models which they set out for their kids. The problem of tea dances is something which parents, and not just the Government, have to address.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to build a civil society, therefore, both Government and each citizen must do their part. On the part of the Government, each department, each agency, each officer, can think about how we can shape policies and programmes which give more choices, allow freer expression of preferences, and which help to encourage community oriented behaviour. As a country, we pay a great deal of attention to our financial resources as evidenced by the care with which the Government prepares its budget. We should pay as much attention to the development of our values and our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as much as we need greater diversity in our economic structure, we also need a broader spectrum of ideas and ideals in our social institutions. Each Singaporean must play his or her part. My wish is that each of us will make time for the community, will speak up, and will take on commitments that will transform Singapore into an open and civil society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion moved by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many budgets in the past, the Government has earmarked large sums of money for the teaching and learning of mother tongue languages in the current Budget. Vast resources have been committed by the Government in the teaching of the Chinese language? We should therefore ensure that our students having learnt the language will use the Chinese language effectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned in my speech in this House on 2nd June this year during the debate on the President's Address that the current syllabus for the teaching of Chinese in schools not only allows our students to competently master the language but is also effective in maintaining the standard at a relatively high level. In terms of usage, Mandarin is now commonly used as a means of communication by the man in the street. We observe it being spoken in hawker centres, markets and other communal areas. This is an encouraging sign.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in certain institutions and on formal occasions, the use of the Chinese language is less frequent. In such an environment, many Chinese educated Singaporeans feel a sense of alienation and they are reluctant to speak Mandarin in public places.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commonly observed scenario is this. A group of young people are conversing in Mandarin in a lift. But the moment a stranger comes into the lift, they will quickly switch to English. Of course, this may be due to the fact that they want to show respect to those who do not understand Chinese. However, some people deliberately reduce their use of Mandarin just to show their competence in English. Should such a trend continue, the use of Mandarin will gradually become confined to only within the lower strata of our society. And even possibly a language used by only a minority of our population in the future. Is this the situation that we would like to see?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may think that such a development is not possible, taking into account the enhanced economic value of Mandarin nowadays which would no doubt spur interest in mastering the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> language. However, one needs to ask this question: does the value in learning Mandarin arise solely from reaping possible economic gains? If so, should such gains diminish? Is the need to master the language negated as well? We should carefully deliberate this issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the economy in China is growing by leaps and bounds as a result of reforms, offering vast opportunities for investments and commercial development. Is the driving force behind the enhanced commercial value in learning the Chinese language? However, as the Chinese economy matures, its growth rate will gradually taper off. In addition, once its capital formation and accumulation reach a desired scale, its need for further foreign investment will not be as urgent as before. With economic progress comes the attendant risk of increasing labour and production costs which will slowly erode China's current competitive advantage derived from a low cost production base. As such, further investment opportunities will be much more limited as compared to the present situation. So in 10-20 years' time, it is possible that China will, like Japan, produce a group of talented people who are proficient in the English language to handle its global economic matters. Then there is no need for our young people to learn Chinese to go into the China market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most people will agree that the need to learn the Chinese language cannot arise solely from the opportunistic pursuit of the economic gains it promises. Rather, mastering the mother tongue is a task undertaken with a view towards the preservation of one's orientation and its cultural values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our outlook, actions and disposition in general should concur with our origins so that our roots and pride are preserved. Consequently, learning the mother tongue should not be viewed as merely a route to any short term economic gain. Rather, it should be perceived as a part of our endeavour to enrich our heritage and mould our cultural awareness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this juncture, Mandarin is still not frequently spoken at major func-
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> tions and occasions, although Government has been pushing the Speak Mandarin campaign and encouraging more Singaporeans to learn the language. Without any special encouragement by the Government, it is feared that the interest in learning the Chinese language will wane. Therefore, it is hoped that the Government will try its best to promote the use of the Chinese language so as to dispel the mindset among our people that Mandarin is spoken only among the lower middle classes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Finance Minister to allocate more funds towards assisting the various Ministries to promote the use of the Chinese language.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak in support of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many speakers have spoken, I just want to add three points in observing the Budget presented by the Minister. Firstly, there were a lot of remarks by business people outside that there was no reduction in corporate tax in this year's Budget. Therefore, it was felt by some people that this Budget has not quite given the goodies that they expect to the business community, particularly at a time when business is not too good in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to ask whether giving a 1% more corporate tax, from 26% to 25%, weigh that importantly in the calculation of investors and businesses. And those who argue that it would must rightfully believe so. But does it? For MNCs, it does not really matter. An MNC that does not know how to differentiate the location of their production and the location of their tax, or take into consideration covers and shelters for their taxes is not much of an MNC. A local profit-making business would not really quibble about 1% more of corporate tax to be given to the Government, and a company that does not profit or making losses would really find it not a practical idea to consider whether there is a reduction of tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue really concerns the marginal struggle business. In that respect, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> suggest that addressing the cost items of doing business is more important than just considering a reduction of corporate tax. And it is in this area that I hope the Minister would consider granting or favouring businesses in lowering their operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of cost items above the line has to be tackled separately, rather than by just bemoaning the Minister for a 1% corporate tax reduction. And I share some concern that unit labour cost rose 3.5% last year, in 1996, and productivity growth declined to 0.7% in 1996. For the unit labour cost increase in the overall economy of 3.5% in 1996, 5.1% increase was due to Government rates and fees. 1.4% increase was due to services cost and 3% increase was due to unit business cost of manufacturing. These figures are found in Table A 2.3 on page 71 of the Economic Survey of Singapore 1997 (first quarter).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look through these figures over the years 1991-1996, the section on Government rates and fees component comes up top. And in five of the six years, this figure shows that the Government figure was top. In two of the six years, the increase in cost attributed to Government rates and fees was in double digits. So I can understand why businesses and businessmen complain about the high statutory cost that they have to bear in businesses. I urge the Minister to look into this area to minimize this large statutory cost that businesses have to bear in order for them to be more competitive in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that many of our competitors have the advantages of lower land cost and labour cost, and are more competitive in attracting investments than us. And we do not need to add to this the high statutory cost to the list.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue which I want to urge the Minister to address urgently through this Budget concerns the productivity and growth decline. This is related to the urge for training and retraining programmes for our workers. The figures in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Economic Survey show that this is the third year in succession where our productivity growth has declined. It was barely 0.7% in 1996, and for the first quarter of 1997, it shows a further decrease, a minus figure of 1.7%. As the Minister has constantly reminded us, we rely on the skills and the managerial capacity of our workforce and our people to stay competitive. We do not have big land or natural resources. The only way that we can be competitive is through raising our productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have expected that the Minister, in his Budget Statement, would provide for some kind of training and cross-training or retraining schemes where we can allow a large part of our labour force, who have been lacking in training and skills, to be retrained during this period when they are employed, and not to wait for the time when the competition has taken away their jobs before they start looking for retraining. We know that a large part of our workforce do not have those literacy and numeracy skills to be trained in the classrooms. Because they are fully employed, there is a lot of pressure for them to do overtime, to stay on the job, to show their commitment to the job and so on, that very often there is little time for them to do anything except in the weekends.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely we can think through some schemes and I think this point was mentioned by Mrs Yu-Foo just now and Mr Lim Swee Say yesterday. There is something that we can do, initiated by the Government, work through with the employers and labour, something we can package to enable this large category, somewhat in the region of a few hundred thousand, to be retrained at this crucial time, and we do not have much more time. There should be no let-up in this retraining and I would say "cross-training programmes". When a worker is engaged in his work, whatever you train him along is training on the job, and employers may find reasons to fund or encourage such training. But we should also package programmes where we can allow workers to cross train, to learn other skills where it may not be economically meaningful for the employer to do so. But we can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> package such schemes, we can reward and compensate employers and employees so that at the end of the line when the workers have to move because the competition has taken away their jobs, there is still something they can go for, and not to ask to be retrained after they have lost their job. So training beyond their present skills is very important.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars over the years in giving transfers to citizens, S&amp;C rebates and utilities rebates. I am all for helping the poor and those who cannot afford. But I do not think all Singaporeans are that poor and cannot afford. If we were to marshal the resources, spend it in the right focused way, to train them and give them this opportunity to learn to fish in another way, in another pond, in another sea, I think that is more meaningful and it is where we should put the resources to train our workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for this opportunity that you have given us to speak our mind and I want to support the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.

   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would first like to thank all Members of the House who have spoken on the Budget in the past two days. As time will not permit me to address every Member's concern in detail, I will focus on the main issues raised, leaving matters of detail which come under the purview of individual Ministries to the Committee of Supply, beginning tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin first by touching on the broad fiscal policies concerning many of the issues raised by Members in the past two days. These policies are fundamental to the economic strategy which have brought Singapore to where we are today and they bear reiteration. I will review Government's taxation policy before dealing with the many areas of concern which have centred around the lack of fresh incentives to help the manufacturing and SME sectors which are going through a difficult period, the apparent bias towards the financial sector in the FY97 Budget and Government's policy on the accumulation of reserves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take these in turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Government's Taxation Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's underlying philosophy has been to tax factors of production as lightly as possible in order to encourage enterprise. This is achieved by having a lower across-the-board tax rate and making available special tax incentives to encourage targetted activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector and some Members of this House were disappointed that the corporate tax rate was not reduced in this year's Budget. I would like to remind them, however, that the corporate tax rate had been reduced by five percentage points over the past five years, from 31% in Year of Assessment 1992 to 26% in Year of Assessment 1997. The most recent tax cut was only made last year and, in fact, will only take effect in the current Year of Assessment. There is therefore no need to make further tax adjustments so soon after last year's revision. As it is, our corporate tax rate is already amongst the lowest in the region. Our tax depreciation provisions are also very generous and have been ranked number one by the 1996 report of the Davos-based World Economic Forum. Coupled with an extensive network of double taxation agreements, unilateral tax credits and generous tax incentives, we have one of the most attractive corporate tax regimes in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past five years, the tax changes made by the Government have reduced revenue collection by about $2.5 billion per year. The Government continually monitors its revenue policies to ensure that tax rates remain competitive and that the tax burden remains as light as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Manufacturing and SME Sectors</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have commented that there is not enough help given to the manufacturing sector and the local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the FY97 Budget. This is not true. The fact is that Government has already put in place a comprehensive set of more than 60 tax incentives and assistance programmes to help the manufacturing sector and the SMEs. For example, the tax incentives available to the manufacturing sector and the SMEs include the Pioneer Incentive, Development Expansion Incentive and Investment Allowance schemes. These tax incentives entail a substantial revenue loss for the Government every year. Based on Year of Assessment 1995 figures, these three schemes alone accounted for a total revenue loss of close to $200 million. This is approximately the revenue which the Government would have lost had we reduced the corporate tax rate by one percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial assistance for the manufacturing and local SMEs is also available under the Economic Development Assistance Scheme and the Cluster Development Fund, for which a total grant of $310 million had been allocated in FY97, an increase of 19% over FY96 allocation of $260 million. In addition, for the SMEs, the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme provides low cost loans to help local companies upgrade and automate their operations and expand their production capacity. Last year, a total of $590 million worth of loans was extended under the scheme, an increase of 13% over 1995. Other financial assistance schemes which the SMEs can avail of include the Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme which provides grants to help SMEs defray the cost of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> engaging external consultants to upgrade and modernise their business operations. In 1996, a total of $12 million in grants was approved. In addition, to assist local companies in business and capability development, the Local Industry Upgrading Programme helps local companies tap technical and managerial expertise of multi-national corporations. $3.2 million was spent under this scheme in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Budget Statement I have also mentioned that development expenditure on economic and infrastructural development will double from $2 billion in FY96 to $4 billion in FY97. This increased expenditure will ultimately enhance the efficiency and hence the competitiveness of Singapore's businesses, including the manufacturing sector and the SMEs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also conscious of the need to contain business costs in the present climate of a slowdown in the manufacturing sector. In my Budget Statement I have also stated that Government is taking measures to ensure an adequate supply and realistic pricing of industrial land. Other measures already taken earlier this year include the reduction in foreign worker levy for workers in the manufacturing sector and the freeze or reduction in JTC land rentals. The reduction in foreign worker levy is expected to cost $14 million per annum while the reduction in JTC land rentals will cost $42 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there are many incentives and assistance schemes for the manufacturing sector and SMEs, and we will continue to monitor and fine-tune these incentives and schemes, wherever necessary. The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness will be studying the issue of Singapore's longer term competitiveness and will, among other things, address issues relating to business costs and the competitiveness of our manufacturing sector and SMEs. The Committee will be reporting its findings early next year and will no doubt recommend new measures to improve the competitiveness of Singapore for the various sectors.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Incentives for the Financial Sector</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House have commented that the Government appears to have gone out of its way to provide a package of incentives for the financial sector in the FY97 Budget and that the incentives appear to benefit the larger financial institutions. Dr Tan Cheng Bock has called the Budget a "Shenton Way Budget". It is true that the financial sector has been singled out for special treatment in this year's Budget. Let me explain why.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong economic growth in the region has led to a rapid increase in the demand for sophisticated financial services. The trend towards the opening up of international financial markets, coupled with the rapid developments in electronic data transmission and information technology, has also led to the integration of financial markets world-wide. Intense competition has forced companies to consolidate and combine to create ever larger institutions which can better afford expensive IT technologies and highly skilled staff. The race is on to create bigger and stronger financial institutions with global reach. Competition for financial centre status in the region will be fierce, especially from a rejuvenated Japan which has embarked on a "Big Bang" reform of its financial system. If Singapore is to retain its position as a major financial centre in the region, it is essential that we attract the larger players to locate in and operate from Singapore in order to build up a critical size of such institutions. When this happens, the industry as a whole will also benefit from the expertise brought in by the bigger players.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in attracting large players does not mean that there is no place for smaller companies, including local companies. In the fund management industry, for example, all approved fund managers have been enjoying a 10% concessionary tax rate for many years, regardless of the amount of funds they manage in Singapore. Our tax incentives are deliberately geared towards encouraging fund managers to continually expand their operations in Singapore. Besides the 10% concessionary tax rate, applicable to all fund managers, in 1995
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we introduced an incentive to tax at 5% the incremental income of approved fund managers who manage at least $5 billion worth of non-resident funds. The new incentive this year will exempt from tax altogether for those who manage at least $10 billion in non-resident funds. Similarly, to encourage the ACUs to expand, the 5% tax on incremental income from all taxable ACU activities will be extended only to those whose taxable income from ACU activities exceeds $50 million. However, all ACUs already enjoy a 10% concessionary tax rate, irrespective of their size.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other tax incentives announced in the Budget, such as the tax exemption for income arising from managing IPO share offerings of foreign currency shares, trading of foreign shares and the extension of tax exemption to syndicated loans which are not underwritten will benefit banks, merchant banks, ACUs, Approved Security Companies and other financial institutions which undertake these activities. A Member has asked whether the award of tax incentives for financial firms could be tied to the training of local staff. However, doing so will impose an additional burden on the financial companies. Ultimately, the decision to employ expatriates or local staff will depend on the firm's bottomline.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Government's Policy on the Accumulation of Reserves</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have expressed concern over the size of the Government's annual budget surpluses. Mr Lew Syn Pau has asked whether the continual withdrawals of liquidity may not have detrimental effects on Singapore's economy. Others have asked whether the surplus could be lowered by giving more incentives to businesses and to promote social cohesion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the rationale underlying Government's budgetary policy. Our basic policy is to run a balanced budget in which all recurrent and development expenditures are met from Government revenues. In years of strong economic growth when revenues are buoyant, we would expect to realise substantial budget
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> surpluses if expenditures are kept under control. As I indicated in my Budget speech, our aim is to ensure that growth in Government expenditure does not exceed GDP growth. In recent years, recurrent expenditures have been capped at around 10% of GDP. As our development expenditures have generally been around 6% of GDP, and revenues have often exceeded 20% of GDP, we have been able to generate healthy budget surpluses, part of which has been returned to the economy in the form of tax cuts and asset enhancement schemes and rebates, and the balance set aside to the reserves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the foregoing, Members can see that the Government's budget surpluses are generated not by over-taxing the economy but are the outcome of economic growth and careful control of expenditures. There is therefore no need for concern that the surpluses will harm the economy in the long term. Members may also be interested to know that our revenue collection is much lower than the G7 countries and comparable to the regional economies, in terms of percentage of GDP. For example, our FY97 revenue collection is projected to be about 19.5% of GDP. This is much lower than the G7 countries' average of between 33% and 48% of GDP. We are also lower than economies like Taiwan, Malaysia and South Korea whose revenue collection is between 21% and 29% of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether the surplus could be lowered to give more incentives to businesses and to promote social cohesion, I would like to assure the House that Government has set aside sufficient funds to help local companies, both in business development and skills upgrading under the Economic Development Assistance Scheme. From the year 1996 to the year 2000, a block vote of $1.3 billion for grants and $3.3 billion for loans will be set aside for the Economic Development Assistance Scheme. Apart from substantial funding for economic promotion, the Government will spend more on transport improvements, such as the building of MRT, LRT and roads. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government will also be spending 20% more on community development this year to further promote social cohesion and a caring and gracious society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked whether Government would state its policy on the accumulation of reserves. A simple answer is that there is no target, as we would like to accumulate as much reserves as possible, in other words, the more the better, always provided that the accumulation does not come from increased taxes causing a drag on the economy and stultifying growth. Except for the recession year of 1985, Singapore has enjoyed continued strong growth over the past decade accompanied by budget surpluses in every year. We believe the present economic slowdown is due to a cyclical downturn in the electronics sector, and the good June figures for non-oil exports would indicate the probability of an economic upturn in the later part of this year. We should also not forget that Singapore has little reserves of land and no natural resources. We have to rely entirely on our financial reserves to meet unforeseen circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to address specific concerns raised by individual Members. Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr Low Thia Khiang have all spoken about the increasing collection from fees and charges from $3.7 billion in FY96 to $4.1 billion in FY97, an increase of 10.8%. This increase is due mainly to the higher COE collections expected in FY97, largely because of the higher number of vehicle quotas to be issued in FY97 in view of the implementation of road pricing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has also asked whether the introduction of the Autonomous Agency (AA) programme will lead to higher fees and charges. As I have mentioned in my previous speeches, the objective for implementing the AA framework is simply to make the civil service more efficient, effective and performance-oriented. The pricing of public services will continue to be a separate policy matter. Hence, the AA initiative per se will not lead to any increase in Government fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has suggested that we introduce a multi-tier corporate tax rate system in order to allow smaller companies to be taxed at lower tax rates. However, Singapore's corporate tax rate of 26% is already low in comparison with other countries. Moreover, a variety of lower tax incentives are already available for selective activities. A multi-tier tax rate system will open up substantial opportunities for tax planning. To guard against this would require more elaborate tax rules. This would, in turn, lead to higher tax compliance cost for small companies which would defeat in the end the purpose of such a tax change.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked how we can further assist local industries and businesses in their efforts to regionalise. I would like to inform the House that there are already several schemes in place to encourage local companies to regionalise. Local companies that are setting up operations overseas can obtain low-cost loans under the Regionalisation Finance Scheme (RFS) administered by the Economic Development Board. This programme is designed to assist local companies acquire fixed assets for their overseas projects. To-date, 60 companies have received about $78 million in loans under this scheme. Local companies can also tap the Business Development Scheme (BDS) which provides grants to defray the cost of organising overseas business missions for the purpose of exploring new technologies and markets, establishing new business contacts or to pursue joint venture arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to clarify Mr Peh Chin Hua's comment of the difficulties of SMEs getting bank loans for investment overseas as a result of its restrictions imposed by the MAS. The MAS does not have any ruling, regulation or guideline which prohibits banks from extending loans for investment overseas. These are commercial decisions which banks have to bear. Banks, in determining whether they would extend loans to any potential borrower, whether for use in or outside Singapore, and whether collateral is needed, would assess the credit-worthiness of the potential borrower and the risk and viability of their project.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has suggested that Government can use some of its reserves to acquire foreign companies and to capitalise on their expertise and experience. What Mr Sin has suggested, that we adopt an acquisition strategy of buying into or even buying over companies to acquire expertise, technology and market access, is in fact one of the strategies of Temasek Holdings and the GLCs. For example, NOL has recently proposed to acquire a large American shipping line called American President Lines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has spoken on the need for Government to track the progress of our small and medium enterprises in restructuring themselves towards more high value-added activities. Mr Magad may wish to note that the Productivity and Standards Board has set up a first stop centre for SMEs called the Local Enterprise Upgrading Centre to provide an integrated package of services to help SMEs upgrade and grow. As I have mentioned earlier, the Government has also implemented several schemes offering grants and loans to enable SMEs to upgrade themselves by the transfer of technology and managerial skills from MNCs and large local companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has also suggested group relief for companies which are venturing abroad. In general, we do not favour the idea of allowing group relief as this will have serious implications for tax revenue. It would also open up opportunities for tax planning which would require complex tax rules to be drawn up to prevent abuse. Singapore also has a full imputation system in which the tax paid on corporate profits is passed on to shareholders through the distribution of dividends. Allowing group relief under a full imputation system, like ours, may mean that the tax authority may have to refund the taxes paid earlier when the company distributes dividends to their shareholders. This could result in serious tax erosion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a concession, the Overseas Investment Incentive allows capital losses from the sale of shares in, or the liquidation of, approved overseas investment to be set off against the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> company's domestic income. Companies which wish to insure overseas investments against risks and uncertainty can apply to the EDB for this incentive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob Ibrahim has asked whether there will be new tax incentives for SMEs to undertake research and development activities. There are already currently a number of tax incentives and grant schemes to encourage SMEs to undertake R&amp;D. These include double tax deduction for approved R&amp;D expenses incurred in-house or paid to approved R&amp;D organisations, industrial building allowances for buildings used by an R&amp;D organisation, and various grant schemes under NSTB, such as the R&amp;D Assistance Scheme and Research Incentive Scheme. There is also the Innovation Development Scheme administered by EDB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the above schemes, there are also grants to assist companies to employ foreign researchers to supplement and complement local R&amp;D manpower resources, such as the Foreigner Researchers Recruitment Programme and the Research Exchange Overseas Programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say has asked for more incentives to encourage water recycling. There are currently three schemes administered by EDB which provide tax incentives and grants to encourage companies to conserve water. In particular, the investment allowance is an attractive scheme which offers companies additional tax deduction of up to 50% of fixed capital expenditure incurred towards water recycling, in addition to the usual capital allowances. In last year's Budget, the scheme has been enhanced by allowing the investment allowance to be offset against the company's income taxed at the normal rate, even though the company is enjoying a tax concession on the project for which the investment allowance is given. The Government fully recognises that water is a key strategic resource and will monitor the response to the various schemes to conserve water. Changes will be made to these schemes, if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have spoken on the need for Singapore to develop our human resources. Mr Lim Swee Say has emphasised the need for more resources to be spent on retraining older workers. Mr Chay Wai Chuen has commented that there is a need for Government to do more to encourage training and retraining of workers in view of the recent low productivity growth. I would like to assure the House that the Government accords very high priority to the training of workers, including the training of older workers. The Government has therefore introduced various schemes to encourage older workers to upgrade their skills continually. Examples include the Skills Development Fund. In FY96, grants committed under the SDF totalled nearly $68 million. SDF funds were also used to train more than 90,000 workers aged 40 and above. This was 27% higher than in the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new initiative is the Total Company Training Plan (TCTP) introduced in September 1996 which aims to encourage companies to adopt a systematic approach to staff training by helping them draw up comprehensive training plans. Under the scheme, companies with approved training plans will be allowed high levels of SDF support.

   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Skills Redevelopment Programme was launched in December 1996 by NTUC to equip the lower educated workers with relevant skills to enhance their employability. EDB and PSB will fund about 70% of the cost of $9 million training programme. The back-to-work programme is targeted at those who have left the workforce for some time and need to be retrained before rejoining the workforce. About 2,500 persons, of whom 43% who are married females in the age group of between 30-50 years, have participated in the programme so far. These new programmes have cost the Government about $20 million in less than 10 months. Our efforts to encourage companies to support more training have also paid off. In 1996, companies in Singapore invested 3.6% of their payroll in training, up from 2% in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has suggested that a national centre for training be set up and for Government to fund such a centre. Government will consider this and other proposals which would raise the overall workers' productivity and enhance our labour resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan has also spoken on the need for Singapore to develop our human resources in the face of regional competition. Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has commented on the implication of manpower shortages in terms of rising wage costs. Manpower is our most important resource. It is a main driving force behind Singapore's economic development. To ensure that we have the necessary manpower to support our economic growth, the Government has and will continue to invest heavily in the training and education of our workforce. Over the last five years, total spending on education has risen steadily at an average of 8.6% per year. For FY97, the increase is even larger, $700 million more or a jump of 18% to $4.6 billion, which comes close to one-fifth of the FY97 Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Edusave Endowment Fund will be increased by another $500 million to reach its target level of $5
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> billion. We will continue to invest in our educational and training infrastructure and expand the intake to universities and polytechnics to improve the quality of our workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To augment our existing pool of manpower, we also seek to attract foreign professionals to come and live and work in Singapore. EDB's International Manpower Programme, for example, attracts foreign talents to work in strategic industries in Singapore. To date, 3,300 professionals have been placed in jobs in Singapore through this programme. We also allow foreign workers in Singapore to complement our limited domestic pool in selected sectors. Companies such as HP and other organisations have also on their part been actively recruiting foreigners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, all these measures will help alleviate wage increase pressures. Nominal wages, as measured by average monthly earnings, have risen by an average of 7.1% over the period 1991-1996. This is due partly to the tight labour market. We must not let wage increases to continuously outstrip productivity growth which has averaged 4% in the last five years, as this is unsustainable and will erode Singapore's longer term competitiveness. This is one of the reasons for the Government's recommendation to moderate wage increases this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Inderjit Singh have also asked for our Government's policy with regard to intensifying the use of industrial land, and whether the differential premium and development charges should be reviewed. Land is scarce in Singapore. We have to optimise its use among competing applications. Although we are carrying out extensive land reclamation for industrial use in Tuas, Jurong Island and other areas, reclamation is costly and there are physical limitations as to how much reclamation can be done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation has studied ways to intensify the use of industrial land. One way is to redevelop old industrial estates where land utilisation is poor, and to relocate the industries
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> affected to other locations where higher plot ratios can be achieved. Assistance will be provided to companies to relocate. JTC has also been implementing new building designs and creative layouts for the standard and flatted factories to make better use of the land. The intensification of industrial land use is estimated to potentially lower the total demand for industrial land by up to 12% in the year 2030, while catering to the quantity of floor space required by industrialists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministries of Law, National Development, Trade and Industry and their agencies have been reviewing, on an on-going basis, land policies which impact on the intensification of land use, including differential premium and development charges. Such reviews aim to strike a balance between providing incentives to encourage lessees to use land more optimally and preserving Government's interest in the value and planning of our land resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also commented that asset price inflation had escalated the costs of doing business in Singapore. I should clarify that asset price inflation is not the main cause of rising business costs. According to the index of unit business costs compiled by the Department of Statistics, rental of industrial premises comprises less than 5% of total business costs for the manufacturing sector in Singapore. In contrast, labour cost accounts for nearly half of total business costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Government is concerned with asset price inflation because of its macro economic and financial consequences. The experience of a number of countries has shown that the deflation required after a prolonged period of asset price inflation could lead to painful economic adjustment as the net worth of households, businesses and financial institutions deteriorates during a downturn. The financial system will also come under severe strain, sometimes requiring costly Government intervention to prevent systemic risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong growth in asset prices has, by and large, reflected fundamental factors like rapid growth in real income and the scarcity of land in Singapore. The speculative element, however, exaggerated price increases, specifically in the residential property market. It was to quell this speculative element that we introduced the package of anti-speculation measures in May 1996. These measures have achieved a salutary effect as housing prices have moderated. The Government has also acted to dampen property price inflation through the release of more State land for both residential and industrial developments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also commented that the strength of the Singapore dollar has made Singapore expensive to US investors, and that the situation has been made worse by the recent devaluation of other ASEAN currencies. As Mr Singh will be raising the same issue in the Committee of Supply, I will respond to this question in detail tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua, the Member for Jalan Besar, has given several comments on reducing business costs. He has asked whether HDB shop rental increases and rental increases for hawker stalls under the Ministry of the Environment could be frozen. On HDB rentals, HDB will be freezing the rentals of HDB properties which are already at market level or 1996 levels for the next 12 months. For properties already enjoying less than market rentals, HDB will continue with their rental adjustments based on existing policies. This is similar to JTC's rental adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to freeze rentals of hawker stalls, Mr Peh would know that they are in fact already heavily subsidised compared to market rentals for stalls in private eating outlets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has questioned the rationale for not abolishing estate duty when the collection is not significant compared to other major revenue sources, and its usefulness as a redistribution tool is limited. He has also expressed concern that the estate duty could force high net worth individuals to tax-plan. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> collection from estate duty is naturally not large when compared to other revenue sources, but only because we target it at the very wealthy estates. But the sum collected in absolute terms is not insignificant. For last year, it was about $70 million. There is still, therefore, a role for estate duty for the purpose of income redistribution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On estate planning, there are many factors involved in estate planning, and it is also not easy to tax-plan effectively. With the high exemption limit and low rates of duty, not many have found it worthwhile to resort to tax planning. Mr Iswaran may wish to note that some countries which have abolished estate duty have imposed other forms of wealth tax, such as the capital transfer tax in the United Kingdom and the gift tax in New Zealand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCMP Mr J B Jeyaretnam has described the Budget as one favouring the rich and not the ordinary man, as the 10% rebate would mainly benefit the rich. It is invidious for Mr Jeyaretnam to make such a comparison. Such rhetoric to score political points is not helpful in maintaining social cohesion. If he persists in continuing in this vein, it will soon solidify his claim to be the Rip Van Winkle of Singapore. Let me point out to him that only about 30% of the high income Singapore residents now pay income taxes and it is these taxes which contribute substantially to Government's tax revenue, which provides the funding for a host of Government programmes designed to help the middle and lower income groups. These include the HDB Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes, Edusave and Medisave programmes, CPF Top-Up Schemes and a variety of grants to the voluntary organisations and self-help groups, the Public Assistance Scheme and the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme and subsidies on flat rentals. Even the cost of the 3% GST has been fully offset for the lower income groups through a package of rebates on HDB S&amp;C charges and flat rentals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the majority of the lower and middle income groups also enjoy subsidies in HDB housing and medical
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> expenses. All these programmes cost the Government about $1.5 billion a year, which is very much more than the revenue forgone through the 10% rebate which is estimated to cost $250 million. The amount is also much higher than the $400 million that Mr Low Thia Khiang claims is all that the Government is giving back to the people. It is also not correct for Mr Low to compare the amount of revenue collected with the amount of rebates given out. Government revenue is primarily used for essential Government programmes, such as education, defence, infrastructure, public housing and health. Rebates, on the other hand, are over and above these programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also claimed that all the rebates given are not sufficient to offset the increases in various fees and charges. However, the real issue is whether Singaporeans could cope with these increases and still enjoy better living standards each year. Even after factoring in the various increases in fees and charges cited by Mr Low, the expected inflation will still be well below the wage increase this year. In addition, for the lower income groups, we have taken special measures to help them. The utilities rebates for the hike in water tariffs announced in this year's Budget is a good example. The amount of rebate given to the 1- to 3-room HDB flats will more than offset the increase in utilities rates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has said that the rental rebate for HDB households represents a mere transfer from one Government pocket to another and that the people would not be impressed by the rebate. I am afraid that Mr Chiam clearly does not understand how the rebate works. Without the rebate, these HDB 1- and 2-room households will have to pay HDB their rentals from their own pockets. With the rebate, they now save between one and two months' rental. They pay less to HDB. It would therefore be more accurate to describe the rebate as a transfer from the Government's pocket to the pockets of those living in 1- and 2-room HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has also said that the higher parent relief would not encourage
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> children to live with their parents as the amounts needed to maintain parents are much higher than the relief. I would like to clarify that the relief is never meant to fully defray the cost incurred on the maintenance of parents. It is to partially offset the maintenance cost. While the Government would want to encourage children to live with their parents, this cannot be achieved by just increasing the reliefs. The higher relief is given more as a recognition to those who live with their parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has asked why the wife relief is only $2,000 whereas the relief for aged parents is $3,500. The quantum of the two reliefs have differed since the Year of Assessment 1990 when we raised the relief for maintenance of aged parents. We have deliberately set the parent relief higher because of the higher cost required to look after the aged and their greater medical needs. The higher quantum of relief for aged parents is also to encourage families to care and provide for their aged parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Lew Syn Pau and Dr Tan Boon Wan have warned against the risk of encouraging a welfare mentality through the giving of S&amp;C and rebates yearly. In particular, Mr Lew has suggested that the rebates be confined to the 1- to 3-room HDB flats. The S&amp;C and rental rebates are aimed mainly at those who are unable to benefit from the 10% tax rebate. In determining the rebates to be given, we are careful to ensure that the amount is not excessive so that it would not result in a welfare mentality. The rebates are also given in a graduated manner with the 1- to 3-room HDB flats enjoying the highest rebates. The 4- to 5-room HDB flats are only given one month's S&amp;C rebate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also some concerns that giving rebates to HDB flat dwellers to pay their public utilities bills is a direct contradiction of the Government's policy of conservation of water. However, such concerns are entirely misplaced. For 1- to 3-room households, while the offset package is more than sufficient to cover
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the increase in utilities rates, these households would still have to pay substantial sums on utilities bills like everyone else. This is because the utilities rebate itself will only cover about 10% to 20% of the annual average utilities bills for the two years from July 1997 to June 1999. In the case of the 4-room households, the utilities rebate would only cover 5% of the annual utilities bill. While the lower income households will not be worse off, they would still have to pay out a very significant portion of their utilities bills in cash. Hence, there will be every incentive for these households to save water and electricity to avoid paying for their utilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has commented on the plight of retired pensioners whose pensions could not keep up with inflation. He has asked whether there are any further reviews to provide top-ups for lower income pensioners. The Government has regularly reviewed the Singapore Allowance. The last revision was made in 1993 when the allowance was revised in connection with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. The Government will continue to periodically review the Singapore Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has also suggested better relief for taxpayers who are looking after their aged sick. With the introduction of GST, around 70% of Singaporeans do not pay income tax. Introducing a tax relief for medical expenses incurred by the aged or giving a higher quantum of relief for taxpayers looking after the aged sick will only benefit those taxpayers who are more well to do. Hence, instead of adjusting tax relief, we have taken the more direct route of helping the elderly by topping up their Medisave under the CPF Medisave Top-Up Scheme as well as the pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme. Many of the retired pensioners will also benefit from the various grants and rebates given in the Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has asked whether the Government could relook into the basis of financing certain core community services which are essential for social development instead of a strict co-payment scheme. The Government will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> providing more funds to voluntary welfare organisations which run social and family services. For FY97, the capital and operating grant for voluntary welfare organisations is expected to come to $73 million, a substantial 35% higher than the amount given out in FY96. The Government has therefore provided considerable financial assistance to help the voluntary welfare organisations. However, giving money alone is often insufficient. The families themselves must play their part as well, especially in the case of juvenile delinquency or taking care of the aged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob Ibrahim has commented that Government should consider giving more incentives to encourage people to pursue an education in arts. The Member may be pleased to note that currently both the public and private sectors are already offering a number of scholarships for arts studies. In particular, the National Arts Council has allocated $1 million in scholarships, bursary and training grants for arts studies in FY97. This is an increase of 15% over FY96.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob Ibrahim has also asked whether a fund for National Education could be set up from which private groups can obtain financial support to run the National Education programme. The Ministry of Education intends to infuse National Education across the whole school curriculum. Hence, it will be entirely funded by Government. There is therefore no need to set up a fund to run the National Education Programme. However, the Ministry of Education is keen to work with private groups and organisations which wish to participate and contribute to the programme. They can collaborate with the Ministry in devising creative materials and media for reaching students and in reaching out to parents as part of the National Education effort.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze, MP for Aljunied GRC, has asked whether Government would be prepared to allocate more funds and grants to promote the use of Mandarin.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> I fully agree with the hon. Member that all Chinese should learn to speak Mandarin in order to preserve our cultural heritage. However, this process is expected to take many years. That is why the Government has been setting aside funds to mount a Speak Mandarin Campaign every year. However, spending money alone is not sufficient. There must also be a willingness on the part of Chinese Singaporeans to use Mandarin in their daily lives. On its part, the Government is actively encouraging staff in its departments to respond in Mandarin to Mandarin-speaking members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to sum up the past two days' debate. As we come closer to the turn of the century, Singapore faces more challenges, more competition and more uncertainties. These are the inevitable consequences of having to operate in an increasingly globalised economy. However, I am confident that we will surmount the future challenges. We have in place a sound and stable fiscal framework. We will continue to invest in our future. With courage, conviction and creativity, Singapore will stay ahead in the 21st century. [Applause.]
