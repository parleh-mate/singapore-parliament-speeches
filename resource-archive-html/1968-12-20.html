<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST JANUARY,</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>1969, TO 31ST MARCH, 1970</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Development Estimates of Singapore for

the  financial year 1st January, 1969, to 31st March,

1970,  contained in Paper Cmd. 28 of  1968.  For  the

convenience  of  hon. Members, I  intend  taking  the

total  for each head of expenditure as it appears  in

the   last   column  of  the  Summary  of   Estimated

Expenditure on pages 5 and 6 of the Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we get on to that, I may perhaps remind

Members that we are on the Development Estimates and

debate on the policy or day-to-day running of the

Ministries of various heads of expenditure that

appear in the Estimates will not be permitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be

allocated for Head 11 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated for this Head is $341,000 for the

period 1969-70. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



main purpose of this sum is to purchase furniture and

equipment and also for works and buildings. We all

know that the National Museum is very important

because it provides educative information to our

people, but in the past it has been neglected. Now

that the Museum is under the Ministry of Science and

Technology, I hope that it will be properly

developed, and since the Minister is a specialist in

biology, he will be able to get exhibits of animals

and insects from all over the world to replenish the

present stock in the Museum. In this way, our student

population will be able to widen their knowledge and

also to learn more about past and present dev

elopments, especially on the history of natural

science.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister two questions. The

captions of the exhibits in the Museum are in English

and the scientific names are also in English. Will

the Minister consider whether the captions can be put

in the four official languages for the benefit of the

people? Secondly, what types of furniture and

equipment will be purchased?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang has a good idea. I shall bring it to the

attention of my officials and ensure that the exhibits are explained in the four official languages -

English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I inform Members of the House how the money

which has been allocated for the National Museum will

be spent? A sum of $185,000 will be spent on works

and buildings. This involves the construction of a

bridge to link up the eastern side of the front and

rear building, the construction of an external wall

to link up the northern side of the front and rear

building, the demolition of garages and construction

of two internal court yard s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $156,000 is allocated for the purchase of

furniture and equipment. This includes electric light

fittings for show cases, moveable show cases for the

public galleries, shelves for reference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



collections and stores, a deep-freeze unit for

storage of animals and carcasses, a freeze drier, an

air-condition unit and two microscopes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $341,000 for Head 11 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 21 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead

101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead relates to "Loan to Jurong Town

Corporation". Can the Minister say in what way will

the allocated sum of $30 million be used to develop

the Jurong Town Corporation in order to supplement

the various amenities and facilities?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

the Jurong Town Corporation asked for a loan of $56

million to finance various development projects next

year. The Ministry of Finance was able to agree to

only $30 million and this sum will be spent as

follows:

development of land, that is to say, land

reclamation, earthworks, construction of roads,

sewers, electrical sub-stations and so on $10.4

million is at Jurong and $2.8 million in the other

estates outside Jurong. The second item is on factory

buildings. A sum of $3.5 million is to be spent on

factory buildings in Jurong for sale or lease to

private enterprise, and $6.5 million will be spent on

constructing factory buildings in other industrial

estates. The third item is on improvement to

facilities in the Jurong wharves. This will entail an

expenditure of $2 million. The fourth item is housing

at Jurong which is expected to cost $2½ million. The

fifth item is a small one in which $200,000 will be

spent on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



industrial water scheme at Jurong. A sum of $1.6

million has been allotted for development of social

amenities of which $1.1 million is earmarked for the

development of Jurong Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other small items such as organisation

facilities - Town Hall -$200,000. I am not quite

clear what this really means. I think the Jurong Town

Corporation has an ambitious plan to construct a very

noble town hall, and maybe this $200,000 will go into

the preliminary studies and designs. Then there is an

item of $100,000 against common amenities and

$200,000 for research and investigations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

103*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to raise under this subhead

concerns the prevention and extinguishment of fire in

Housing Board flats. At the present moment, no fire.

fighting equipment is installed in Housing Board

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you are aware that all new buildings in our

Republic are subject to regulations made under the

Local Government Integration Ordinance, 1963. May I

quote section 147 of the Local Government Buildings

Regulations, 1966, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Every new building, except residential buildings and

business premises under four storeys in height and

not exceeding two thousand square feet in area at

first floor level, shall be provided with water

supply independent of the domestic supply conveyed in

pipes of steel or cast iron and with hydrants and

pumps and extinguishers for the prevention and

extinguishment of fire to the' satisfaction of the

Chief Building Surveyor.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this being the case, may I therefore ask the

Minister to clarify whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



there is an oversight on the part of the Housing and

Development Board to provide fire-fighting equipment

in flats or blocks of flats in the interests of the

tenants? Further, I wish to know whether sufficient

fire hydrants are installed in all housing estates

belonging to the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru):</b> Sir, I am not

moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is an acceptable practice all over the world to grant

exemption from certain requirements of the building

bylaws to low-cost housing in order to bring down the

cost. Similarly, the Housing and Development Board

has obtained exemption from the Chief Building

Surveyor for the provision of fire-fighting

equipment, among others, in our low-cost housing so

that the cost of these housing flats could be reduced

to an acceptable level. There is provision under

section 169 of the Local Government Buildings

Regulations, 1966, for giving such an exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last eight years, not a single case of

fire has occurred in any of the Housing Board flats,

which means that they are very safe and sound.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small fires such as those caused by the tipping over

of kerosene stoves have never been able to spread to

the next flats due to the sound design and non-

inflammable materials used in these multi-storey

buildings. Moreover, adequate hydrants have been

provided in all the housing estates for use by the

Fire Brigade in the event of an emergency. The Chief

Building Surveyor considered these facts and agreed

that exemption from the building by-laws for the

provision of fire-fighting equipment could be granted

to housing estates. Fire-fighting equipment is very

expensive and it is often tampered with or stolen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



when it is stored in the Housing Board estates. In

fact, the Housing Board did install fire-fighting

equipment in the flats built under the First Five-Year Plan but, unfortunately, most of it has either

been stolen immediately after installation or

tampered with by the residents. In view of this, it

serves no useful purpose to spend a large sum of

money to install fire-fighting equipment in the

Housing Board estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has

said that no fire 'can spread in Housing Board flats.

In the last three years, two fires have broken out in

Housing Board flats in the Old Kallang Airport

Estate. More recently, a fire in the Bukit Ho Swee

area almost threatened an adjacent block 'of flats in

the Bukit Ho Swee Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this, I am satisfied that sufficient

hydrants have been installed in the housing estates.

Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for

Head 21 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sum of $131,480,900 under this head is

provided for various purposes, such as "Loan to

Development Bank of Singapore - $30 million", "Loan

to Jurong Town Corporation -$30 million", "Loan to

Public Utilities Board - $20 million", "Loan to

Housing and Development Board -$50 million", etc.

These allocations are very important for our economic

development and prosperity. But I would like to know

the purposes of the other subheads for which various

sums of money have been allocated. Can I have more

details of the item "Seletar Dam - Anti-Pollution

Measures - $463,200", and of the remaining subheads 401, 402, 501 and 601?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In order to ensure high standards

of purity of water when it flows into the Seletar

Dam, certain measures have to be taken in the

catchment area to the reservoir. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



Member for Sembawang will know that unlike the

central catchment area feeding the two reservoirs -

MacRitchie and Peirce - the Seletar Reservoir

catchment area is populated mainly by farmers. It is

not feasible or necessary to resettle these farmers.

But certain safeguards have to be carried out,

namely, the construction of latrines, cess-pits,

pigsties, and so on. This involves a total cost of

$1.8 million, part of which is paid by the Government

and part by the farmers. The scheme is being

implemented in stages. A sum of $454,000 has been

spent this year and the balance will be spent next

year. The project is expected to be completed by the

middle of next year when the Seletar Reservoir will

provide us with a very useful increase in water

storage capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 401 concerns "P.A.B.X. Equipment for

Fullerton Building". I am unable to get details of

the price break-down from the Singapore Telephone

Board. The equipment is manufactured in Sweden and

its purchase price was quoted by the Telephone Board

as $126,547. Before its installation in November last

year, the Telephone Board conducted a survey of

telephone requirements of all the departments in

Fullerton Building with the exception of the Postal

Department, the Telecommunications Department and the

Economic Development Board. The engineers recommended

that an expandable P.A.B.X, unit for 50 exchange

lines and 500 extensions equipped initially with 40

exchange lines and 300 extensions be installed. The

equipment is at present rented from the Telephone

Board at a cost of $23,542 per annum. It is expected

to last for 25 to 30 years and calculations show that

in the long run it is more economical to purchase the

equipment outright as the capital cost will be

recovered in less than seven years' time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $131,480,900 for Head 21 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



Head 31 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House was informed on 3rd December that

the Hotel and Catering Training Centre would be

extended to train more personnel in view of the

expansion in the hotel trade in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree that our hotel trade is now fast

becoming an industry which earns quite sizable sums

in foreign exchange for the Republic and also

provides more opportunities for employment. In this

respect, I have three questions to ask about the

Hotel and Catering Training Centre:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the details of the expansion plans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the built-in facilities mentioned

by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Labour in his answer to my question for oral

answer on 3rd December?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the necessary qualifications

required for the various categories of trainees?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 101."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teong, would you like to speak now instead of moving your amendment* to the total sum, because

under this head there is only one subhead?



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The amendment reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 31 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not moving

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

expansion of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



training  scheme for the hotel and catering  industry

involves the building of a hotel school with  a  view

to  increasing the scope of the training  courses  as

well  as  increasing the intake of trainees. We  have

sought  assistance  from the  Colombo  Plan  and  the

United Nations Development Programme Special Fund for

experts. In fact, a hotel and catering adviser, whose

services  were obtained originally through  the  Asia

Foundation   and  subsequently  through  the   United

Kingdom Government, has been here since June 1967. It

is  expected  that another expert under  the  Colombo

Plan, a waiting and bar services expert, will be here

early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the building of a hotel school, there

are at the moment three possible schemes under active

study.  The  first scheme is to convert  the  present

training  centre into a two-storey building  and  the

building  facilities will include class-rooms,  hotel

bedrooms, a production kitchen, a training kitchen, a

restaurant,  a  bar,  a bakery,  a  hotel  office,  a

language  laboratory, a library, a communal room  for

trainees and staff, store-rooms and a swimming  pool.

The  hotel  bedrooms and the other public  rooms  are

intended to be used for on-the-job training.  A  more

ambitious  scheme  is to build a six-storey  building

with  double  the facilities of the  first  one.  The

third  scheme  is  to convert a block  of  Government

flats  at Nassim Hill Road and, if possible, the  con

struction  of  another block nearby.  But  this  will

involve  much more money than what has been provided.

Anyway,  these schemes are under active study  and  I

think a decision will be arrived at shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the qualifications required for the various

categories  of  trainees, I will just  say  that  for

waiters,    barmen,    waitresses,    the     minimum

qualification will be Secondary II, the  age  between

16  and 22, and the training period will be about  12

weeks; for room stewards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



or room stewardesses, a Secondary II or Vocational II

qualification is required, the age between 20 and 25,

and  the  training period will be six weeks; for  the

receptionist's   course,  a  School  Certificate   is

necessary, the age between 20 and 27, the male should

have  a  minimum  height of 5 feet 4 inches  and  the

female 5 feet 2 inches, and the training period  will

be  about five weeks. For the cashier's course, again

a  School Certificate is required, the age between 20

and  27  years, and the duration of training will  be

only one week.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary the reason for

building a swimming pool at such a centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I think $1.8 million is a big sum

of  money. We are extravagant in going to the  extent

of   building  a  teaching  hotel  which  is   really

unnecessary.  We  have numerous hotels  in  Singapore

which can provide on-the-job training facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> I agree with the Member

for Mountbatten.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the plan is only

on  paper.  It is most likely that the swimming  pool

will  not be built, and that the money will  be  more

usefully spent on other projects. The intention is to

give  the  trainees  on-the-job  training.  In  other

words, it will be run just like an ordinary hotel. We

can  say  that  it is a teaching hotel. The  trainees

will get practical training. For the school a certain

amount of income is possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to the  Member

for  Joo  Chiat,  has  raised  a  doubt  whether  the

swimming pool will be built. I hope it will be built.

I  disagree  with the Member for Joo  Chiat  and  the

Member  for Mountbatten that the facilities  in  this

teaching hotel are too extravagant. I think they  are

necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



if we are to get good results from the training; that

is,  to produce good waiters and waitresses and other

people  dealing with hotel servicing. Unless the  stu

dents  have  the opportunity to train with facilities

similar  to  those obtaining in the  best  hotels,  I

think  they will need to be re-trained when they  are

actually  employed  as  waiters  and  waitresses   in

hotels.  I  hope the swimming pool and all the  other

facilities envisaged in the plan will come through.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I do not quite agree with the

Member  for  Moulmein.  Are we  going  to  train  the

students in the swimming pool? Another point is  that

when   we   have  overcome  the  shortage  of   hotel

personnel, will the Government continue to  run  this

hotel?

clarification.  Before  the  Members  go  into   deep

waters, I must explain that the swimming pool is  not

for  the  trainees but for paying guests who will  be

actually using it so as to give realistic training to

our hotel and catering staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I wish to ask the

a  certain  height before they can  be  recruited  as

trainees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that requirement

applies  only to receptionists. As the Member  knows,

receptionists  should have certain  qualities  -among

others, good looks as well as brains!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Is he qualified?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I do not agree with the

Parliamentary  Secretary when he said just  now  that

the  expansion scheme is only on paper. In fact,  the

expansion plan must be pushed through as we all  know

very  well  that  we  will face a shortage  of  hotel

employees  by the end of 1971. By that time  we  will

have  about 30 hotels requiring something like  9,500

hotel  employees.  Unless we push through  this  plan

urgently, we will not be able to overcome the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



shortage of hotel employees. However, I beg leave to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I am moving a cut in the allocation, in my view the allocation is not enough. An increase should be made. As a graduate of Nanyang University, I have the responsibility of looking after its expansion. Twelve years have elapsed since the inception of Nantah in 1956. The number of

graduates  has already exceeded 3.700. At  least  240

Nanyang  graduates  have returned  from  abroad  with

higher degrees. Some of them have returned to Nanyang

University  to take up teaching posts. The Government

announced   the  recognition  of  Nanyang  University

degrees  sometime this year. Next year there will  be

honours  degree  courses in Nanyang  University.  All

this is very encouraging. In other words, Nanyang

University is up and coming. In a matter of  time  it

will  definitely  be able to make a more  significant

contribution  in the field of higher education.  But,

unfortunately, the allocation for next year  is  only

$100,000. I wonder whether such a small allocation is

enough  for  the expansion of Nanyang  University.  I

hope  the  Minister for Education  will  be  able  to

persuade the Finance Minister to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



make  a bigger allocation. It should be at least  ten

times as much as what is being given now, in order to

meet the expansion needs of Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have several questions to ask under this subhead. Firstly, it is understood that the Language Centre of Nanyang University was set up with Government funds. I want to know whether the present language laboratory has six-channel facilities as originally planned. If the answer is in

the negative, will there be any plans for its improve

ment?  Secondly, I wish to know whether there is  any

training  scheme  for  higher  studies  for  graduate

assistants to take over those departments in  Nanyang

University   which  are  overwhelmingly  staffed   by

oversea  personnel; such as the Department of History

and the Department of Government Administration. With

such  a  training  scheme as part of the  development

programme  of  Nanyang University, there  will  be  a

sufficient supply of highly qualified local staff  to

man the various departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as a portion of the sum allocated for this

subhead  is  intended  for the  purchase  of  library

books,  I  wish  to  know  whether  the  Minister  is

convinced  that  the  present  librarian  of  Nanyang

University is able to maintain the balance  of  books

concerning  Chinese culture published in  Nationalist

China and the People's Republic of China.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   support  the  Member  for  Jurong.  I  wish   the

Government can give more allocation to Nantah. When I

read  the 1969-70 Development Estimates, I was  quite

surprised.  In the allocation for Nanyang  University

for the coming financial year, there is only $100,000

for  the  purchase  of equipment and  library  books.

There is no allocation for the extension of buildings

and  the provision of other facilities. There is  not

even  a  token provision. Does this mean that  Nantah

has  all  the facilities and, as such, does not  need

any  allocation  for  further development  in  fields

other than scientific equipment and library books? In

my opinion, there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



still  many  fields in which Nantah needs improvement

and  development. In the past, Nanyang University has

depended mainly on contributions from the people. Its

expenditure  on  development has been  tuned  to  its

financial resources. All development has been  on  an

austerity basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nantah should be different now. In the light of our

present   national  development,  Nanyang  University

could play an important part in education because  of

the  recognition  of the fact that  it  is  part  and

parcel   of  the  educational  institutions  of   our

country, it  has  a  great role to  play  in  nation

building. All the defects that are existing should be

rectified as soon as possible. In a very short  time,

Nantah   has  been  able  to  produce  many   eminent

scholars.  Some  have gone abroad for higher  studies

and have returned with the most up-to-date knowledge.

Some  have  returned  to teach in Nanyang  University

itself.  We should not allow the knowledge they  have

acquired   to   be  wasted.  We  must  always   renew

ourselves. As the Chinese saying goes, "One  must  be

newer  and newer 'day by day." These scholars  should

not just write articles on what they have learnt, but

should  be  able to put into practice what they  have

learnt. In view of the present scientific development

in  the world, we should encourage them to move  with

the  times by providing them with research facilities

so  that they can further advance their knowledge. We

should  not  let them be stagnant in their scientific

field.  Unless we provide them with such  facilities,

our country will suffer a loss. There is not even  an

electronic  computer in Nanyang  University.  We  may

concede  the  fact that not all research necessitates

the  purchase of equipment, as in some Arts subjects.

However,   equipment  is  essential   in   scientific

research. This is how some Nantah scientific scholars

feel the need to have at least a small computer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the quarters, too, are limited. The

number  is  not enough for the teachers and students.

The  Nanyang  University  authorities  have  made  it

compulsory  for first-year students to  stay  in  the

quarters. As a result, 95



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



per cent of the students are staying in the quarters.

Other  facilities,  too, are  not  adequate.  Nanyang

University  is very far away from the city.  The  stu

dents do not have ample opportunities to take part in

cultural  and recreational activities. We are  trying

to  evolve a rugged society. Yet when we look  around

Nanyang University, we find that there is not even  a

standard  playground for the students to exercise  or

relax themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has told us in this House that Nanyang University will introduce an honours degree course in the coming academic year. The sum allocated is only $100,000. This is the final part of the $1 million Government allocation. Will this sum of money be enough for the introduction and

development of honours degree courses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the press that the Vice-Chancellor

of  Nantah  will  be  retiring. Some  honours  degree

courses  will be introduced as from the next academic

year.  As Nanyang University is entering a new phase,

it  is necessary to appoint a new Vice-Chancellor.  I

wish  to  know whether the Minister has been informed

that  the Nantah authorities have taken any steps  to

appoint a new Vice-Chancellor.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, sometime in the middle of  this  year,

Nanyang  University  did  submit  four  projects  for

Government's consideration. The projects were for the

construction  of additional student hostels  and  the

provision  of  additional staff quarters.  These  two

projects  would  cost  about $3  million.  The  third

project was for the construction of a sports complex.

The  fourth  project  was  for  the  improvement   of

ventilation  for the Great Hall. The  sports  complex

was   estimated  to  cost  about  $620,000  and   the

ventilation  for  the  Great Hall  would  cost  about

$20,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to construct additional staff quarters

was not supported as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



Government's  policy is to encourage home  ownership.

It would be preferable to grant loans to the staff to

purchase  their  own  houses.  As  regards  the   con

struction  of student hostels, about 80 per  cent  of

the students are already accommodated in the existing

hostels.  Compared  with  other  universities,   this

percentage  is  very high indeed and, therefore,  the

need for this project is not that urgent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects for the construction of a sports

complex and improvement of the Great Hall were  still

under  consideration at the time when the Development

Estimates  were prepared. Since no decision  has  yet

been  finalised, no provision was made in the Develop

ment Estimates as regards these two items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the financial stringency, it is likely

that in future only requests of high priority such as

funds  for  improvement of laboratories  for  honours

degree  courses and for research will  be  supported.

Some of the equipment for honours degree courses will

be  arriving very soon. Some of it was purchased  out

of  the $1 million grant for scientific equipment and

library  made in 1966. However, if this equipment  is

found  to  be inadequate, Government is always  quite

prepared to consider further requests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the language laboratory was first installed, it

was equipped with six channels. Later it was modified

to  one channel because it was under-used. Should the

need  arise, the language laboratory can be  restored

to the full six channels without any difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also mentioned further studies

by  local staff. The policy to encourage further over

seas  training  for  graduate  assistants  so  as  to

further  enhance  the  academic standard  of  Nanyang

University   is   being  actively  pursued   by   the

University.  I was told that this year  two  graduate

assistants  from  the Department  of  Government  and

Public  Administration were sent to Canada for higher

training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



under the Colombo Plan. Action is also being taken to

select  another six candidates, either  graduates  or

graduate assistants, from the Faculty of Commerce  to

go abroad for further training next year. Two of them

will  be  under the Colombo Plan and four on exchange

programmes with American universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the purchase of library books for the

University, I think the Member for Jurong will  agree

with  me  that it is not realistic to adopt a  system

whereby  the  number of books purchased  from  Taiwan

matches  the  number purchased from  China.  In  this

matter,  surely  the criterion should  be  that  only

books  which are considered necessary and useful  are

purchased  for the library regardless of the  country

of origin. There is a library committee headed by the

Vice-Chancellor  which  decides  on  the   purchasing

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru mentioned the appointment

of  a  ViceChancellor. Nanyang University is just  as

anxious as the Member for Tiong Bahru that a suitably

qualified  academician  and administrator  should  be

appointed as Vice-Chancellor as soon as possible.  In

fact,  this matter is being pursued actively  by  all

concerned. However, the Member for Tiong Bahru should

realise  that  the  financial  resources  of  Nanyang

University  do  not  permit  it  to  offer  the  same

attractive  material terms obtaining in  universities

in  the  United  States  or  other  Western  European

countries. Furthermore, I think the office  of  Vice-

Chancellor is now no longer that dignified and secure

and isolated from the rough and tumble of the outside

world. Universities in many large cities of the world

are embroiled in student strife and struggle. Some of

the    Vice-Chancellor's   offices   of   prestigious

universities   were   even   seized   by    students.

Illustrious   academicians   who   would   be   ideal

candidates for vice-chancellorship are, therefore, no

longer  enamoured of the post of Vice-Chancellor.  In

the  search for a well-qualified academician to  fill

the post of Vice-Chancellor, both the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



students and staff of Nanyang University can  help  in

creating   a  congenial  atmosphere  for   study   and

research. On the other hand, if students, periodically

indulge    in   agitation   and   sometimes    violent

demonstration,  they  are only  helping  to  make  the

search for a Vice-Chancellor more difficult and  would

only  be inviting the "colonels", since we do not have

"generals", or, worse still, half-baked "lieutenants",

to take charge of the University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): From the reply of

the  Minister, it appears that he is still  interested

in looking after Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 402.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency, there are about nine

primary schools of various streams and the pupils come

to  about 1,000 per year from these schools.  In  this

respect, there is nothing for me to quarrel about. But

there   is  only  one  secondary  school,  the  Jurong

Integrated Secondary School, in my constituency.  This

school  was set up as a result of the Prime Minister's

visit to Jurong Constituency and at the request of the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should not be surprised when I say something

about this school. There are only eight classrooms and

it  is  without  a  hall, or a library  or  laboratory

facilities. Obviously, Sir, in terms of capacity, this

school  is inadequate for the needs of my constituency

and is unable to absorb the number who passes out from

the  primary  schools in my constituency. Furthermore,

it  does not have all the necessary facilities that  a

secondary school should have. Notwithstanding the lack

of  these  facilities, there is an advisory  committee

and,  with  the  cooperation  of  the  principal,  the

students and other people, they have been able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



to   carry   out   a  great  deal  of  extracurricular

activities.  They have been awarded  a  prize  in  the

recent beautifying school campus campaign.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several requests have been made to the Ministry

of Education for further improvement of the school.  I

do  not know whether there is provision to extend this

secondary  school and I shall be much obliged  if  the

Minister can enlighten me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is

enough accommodation to meet the demand for places  in

this  secondary school. In fact, there is room for  16

classes   running  two  sessions  but  only  15   were

functioning  at the end of last year.  None  of  these

classes has a full enrolment of 40 students. The  1968

enrolment figures show a drop of about 11 per cent  as

compared with those of the previous year. Besides  the

Jurong  Integrated Secondary School, there  are  three

other  Government secondary schools along or  slightly

off  Jurong Road that are under-used. As these schools

can  provide  sufficient places for pupils  living  in

this  area, my Ministry does not intend to  build  any

extension to the Jurong Integrated Secondary School.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, That the total sum to  be

allocated for Head 41 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated for this Head is $30,850,070.

Apart from the sum required for the new administrative

building of the Ministry of Education, there are  five

items  of expenditure for higher education. Allocation

is  made  for  Nanyang University, the  University  of

Singapore and Ngee Ann College



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



which  amounts to about $1½ million. The Polytechnic

is  allocated  a sum of about $¼ million.  This  very

clearly  shows that the emphasis is on technical  and

vocational  education.  But  the  sum  allocated  for

primary  and secondary education is very small.  From

the   various  allocations,  we  can  see  that   the

Government  is  biased  towards  the  development  of

technical    education.    From    the    rate     of

industrialisation and the various  changes  that  are

taking  place, we realise that there  is  a  need  to

provide  technical education so that we will be  able

to provide the necessary industrial personnel for our

development needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate

the   Minister   for  Education  on  his   successful

achievement  in encouraging technical education.  How

ever,  I wish to raise some questions. When will  the

Institute  of Southeast Asian Studies be established?

When  will  work  on  it  be  started  and  when   is

completion expected? How and when will enrolment take

place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where will the vocational institutes be

set  up?  Are there any plans for building vocational

schools in the rural areas to look after the needs of

the students in these areas? If students in the rural

areas  desire  to study in vocational  schools,  they

have  to travel all the way to the city because  voca

tional  schools are built only in the city areas  and

the  expenditure on travelling will  mean  a  greater

burden to their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what is the basis for the selection of

principals  in integrated schools? In  my  view,  the

principals  should be bilingual. But, at the  moment,

the  principals of many integrated schools  are  only

monolingual.  Therefore, they have difficulties  when

conversing  with parents, and their senior assistants

have to act as interpreters. Sir, this arrangement is

most  unsatisfactory  and I hope  the  Minister  will

consider   a  better  basis  for  the  selection   of

principals in integrated schools. The emphasis should

be on bilingualism in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



order to provide a more effective administration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish, to raise several points for the

consideration of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, has the Minister any plan to build an

integrated   technical  institute   in   Paya   Lebar

Constituency which has, a student population of  more

than,  18,000? The Minister will recall that sometime

in  1966 I asked an oral question on this subject and

the Minister replied that there was no vacant land in

my  constituency  for  the construction  of  such  an

institute.  At  the  moment,  I  am  aware   that   a

contractor  is  prepared to offer some  10  acres  of

vacant  land  for the construction of a school.  Will

the Minister take prompt action to accept this offer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member

for  Paya Lebar had listened carefully to the  speech

which  I  made on 12th December, 1968, he would  have

realised  that all new school building  programmes  -

both  for primary and secondary schools - have ceased

since  1967  and that there will be no more  academic

secondary school building programme. It is true  that

in  1966  we were looking for land, but now, although

it  is  available, there are no longer any  funds  to

build schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies will

not  have its own building. It will be housed in  the

proposed  new  library building of the University  of

Singapore.  At the moment, I am not in a position  to

say when this new library building will be completed,

because  the whole future expansion of the university

is  now  under  consideration. In the  meantime,  the

institute is being accommodated in a bungalow at  the

University of Singapore. The institute is  for  post-

graduate  research  only and,  as  such,  it  has  no

teaching function, and students will not be admitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made of the appointment of principals in

integrated  schools.  The promotion  of  teachers  to

principalship  is  undertaken by the  Public  Service

Commission.  My  Ministry  can  only  post  bilingual

principals   to  integrated  schools  if   they   are

available. Ideally, principals of integrated  schools

should be bilingual.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister has not answered one point, and that is,

where will vocational institutes be built?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, if the Member

for Sembawang will look at the Development Estimates,

he will find that all the sites for the vocational

institutes are listed there.

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $30,850,070 for Head 41 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for

Head 51 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated for this head is 53,906,710. Our

Republic  has become the fourth largest port  in  the

world,  and  in external telecommunications,  it  has

reached  quite  an important position.  But  the  sum

collected in this respect is rather small.  This  may

be due to large sums of money being allotted to other

more important projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the extension of the runway in the airport, can

the  Minister  say when the work will  be  completed?

Secondly, under subhead 305, where will the  new  car

park  be  situated  and when will  it  be  completed?

Thirdly, when will the jumbo jets call here,  because

they are very important to the further development of

our commerce and tourism?

for  Sembawang. I would like to say that the original

cost  of  the extension to the airport runway  is  $5

million,  but it has since been revised  and  brought

down  to  $3.8  million.  One  million  dollars   was

expended  last  year  and almost  $800,000  has  been

expended  this year. I can say that the extension  of

the  runway  from  9,000  to 11,000  feet  should  be

completed  by  the middle of next year.  Seventy-five

per cent of the work has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next query raised by the Member was on the new

car  park  under subhead 305. I think I have  already

answered  this question a few days ago, but in  order

to  meet the request of the Member, I shall give  him

the  answer again. This car park can accommodate  200

cars  and has been in use since June this year. There

is, however, a sum of $18,000 for next year which  is

the  estimated cost for the construction of  bus  and

car  park  attendant kiosks which will be built  next

year and rented out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's third question was when the jumbo jets,

the Boeing 747s, are expected to arrive in Singapore.

I  think  I  have  given this information  on  a  few

occasions.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do definitely know that some jumbo jets should

arrive at Singapore Airport around 1971. It could  be

earlier.  Therefore, we have a little more  than  two

years  to plan for their arrival. But may I say  that

personally I had the opportunity to visit Seattle two

months  ago? This is the place where the Boeing  747s

are manufactured by the Boeing Company. I am given to

understand  that, except for the number of passengers

involved (that is, twice as many passengers  will  be

discharged  from the jumbo jets), no great difficulty

should  be  experienced, because the jumbo jets  have

been  designed to take off and land on runways  which

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



take the lighter Boeing 707s. I think the plane has

also had a test flight recently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,906,710 for Head 51 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 52 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 52 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 102.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, I shall range over my

next amendment No. (2)*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (2) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 52 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 902.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sum of $150,000 has been provided in 1968

for  the  construction of a new Newton  Post  Office.

When  is  this post office expected to be  ready  for

service? I think the sum of $150,000 will be  revoted

again  in 1970. The present Newton Post Office is  an

old building but I am not objecting to its condition.

I  am  sure that some Members of the House  may  have

noticed  that it looks as if it is sited  in  a  fish

pond  after a heavy downpour. I am saying  this  from

experience.  There  is  difficulty  in  loading   and

unloading the mail bags and the staff and the  public

are inconvenienced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that the

new Newton Post Office will be ready by this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know where the "Mail Loading Pier"

will be built and when is it expected to be completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir. I can well

understand  the  feelings cf  the  Member  for  Anson

because  he knows about the postal services like  the

back of his hand, since he has put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



in  long  and  honourable service in this  particular

department. If I were the only one who could  make  a

decision to build the new Newton Post Office, I would

give  him  the assurance that it would be  done.  But

surely  he  knows that it is not just enough  for  my

Ministry to say that we want it and it is done. There

are  the  usual  difficulties, it is true  that  this

particular item which appeared in the Estimates  last

year may appear again in next year's Estimates and we

may  not have a post office even in 1970. This is not

the  fault of the Ministry of Communications.  It  is

just because there are competing demands for sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to build a new post office for Newton

is  well known. It was actually taken in October 1966

by  the  Economic Planning Unit. In fact, a site  was

selected  by the Public Works Department to have  the

new  post office somewhere around Clemenceau  Avenue,

quite  close  to Newton Circus. Then a  request  came

from  a  different section of the P.W.D, for  a  road

improvement scheme and, therefore, this site  had  to

be  given up to meet the request. In March 1967, the

Chief  Planner  thought  it  a  good  idea  that  the

contemplated  building  of  a  headquarters  for  the

Public  Utilities  Board in  the  Newton  area  could

perhaps provide some space for a post office. Then in

July  1968  - more than a year after that  suggestion

was  first  received - we were told that  the  Public

Utilities   Board  had  decided  not   to   build   a

headquarters  in  that area.  A  site  has  now  been

selected,  again  close  to the  Government  quarters

between Monks Hill Terrace and Bukit Timah Road,  and

quite  close  to the present Newton Post Office.  The

Commissioner  of  Lands replied on the  2nd  of  this

month that he was going to take up this proposal with

the  departments concerned. We are now waiting for  a

reply  from the Chief Planner's Office. So I  suppose

we will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



start building when everybody is quite happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then moved on to the provision

of  "Mail Loading Pier". He wants to know where it is

going  to be and when it is expected to be completed.

It  is planned to build the pier on the present  site

because  the existing one is in a very bad  state  of

repair.  It  is  expected to be completed  within  12

months of the commencement of work.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $275,520 for Head 52 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 61 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Madam

Chan Choy Siong ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Head 61 is $47,900,000. The

Ministry of Interior and Defence was set up not  long

ago  and  it  has already made great strides.  May  I

inquire   how  this  sum  of  $47.900,000   will   be

allocated. And to what use will the Defence  Fund  be

put?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a

question to ask of the Minister for Defence. I notice

that  the  Geylang  Police Station has  already  been

moved   to   a  new  building  situated  between   an

outpatient  clinic and a post office at  Still  Road.

But  it  is still named Geylang Police Station.  Does

the Minister consider it an appropriate name and,  if

not, will he consider changing it since it is no more

in  the  Geylang area but is, in fact, in the  Siglap

Constituency?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, that is all very well, but I

do   not  know  how  this  matter  comes  under   the

Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am proposing to use  part  of  the

Defence Fund to establish a weapons factory, part  of

it for the purchase of initial training aircraft, and

part  of  it  for  scholarship funds for  specialised

training of Singapore Armed Forces personnel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

how is the sum of $47,900,000 to be expended?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that part of  the

Defence Fund will be used for a weapons factory. This

is a laughing matter. Will the fund be sufficient for

the  setting up of an armaments factory? I feel  that

we have not achieved very much with the Defence Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should form a National Defence

Voluntary  Fund on a permanent basis so  that  it  is

open  all  the time to anyone to make a donation.  In

this  way, we can achieve better results with it than

with  the present Defence Fund. The donations to  the

Defence Fund are dwindling. So we must encourage  the

rich  people to donate to the National Defence  Volun

tary Fund. I am raising this point now because I  did

not  have sufficient time to do so previously. I  now

crave your indulgence, Mr Speaker, Sir, to say this.

The  National Defence Voluntary Fund Committee should

try  to encourage everyone to donate. It can issue  a

kind  of  plaque or a certificate to the donor  of  a

certain  amount of money to commemorate his  donation

and spirit of dedication.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when the Japanese attacked Singapore

during  the  last  war,  we had  donations  from  the

public. Today we must ask all rich people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



to  contribute to this new Defence Fund. If  they  do

not do so, they will suffer the same fate as they did

the  last  time  when the Japanese came,  when  their

wives,  money, houses and other property  were  taken

over.  The Government should now try to get donations

from people other than the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong Eng Siong, is your point

that the Minister has not answered your last query.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I just want to

ask  the  Minister whether he can give  some  details

about this $47,900,000 allocation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for

Sembawang had followed closely the speech made by  my

colleague, the Minister for Finance, while presenting

his  Budget,  he would have noted that  my  colleague

gave  as  detailed an account of our defence build-up

as he possibly could. I do not think I can go further

and  give  him more details of the kind of  armaments

that we want to buy for our troops. All I can say  is

that  the  development fund is to  be  used  for  the

acquisition of land, construction of camp sites,  and

purchase of equipment for the troops. That is as  far

as I can go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to find that, in spite of his age,

the  Member for Ulu Pandan is still as energetic  and

patriotic as I would like all our young people to be.

I  can take it that he has contributed all he can  to

the  Defence  Fund. However, there is  not  only  one

committee  working  on getting contributions  to  the

Defence   Fund,  but  there  are  also  hundreds   of

committees. I think the time has come for us to set a

time limit for donations to the fund and not leave it

open.  As I said when announcing a target amount  for

the  Defence  Fund, there are many other  worth-while

funds competing for donations. The contributions that

we have received for the Defence Fund have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



shown that there is a great deal of loyalty and  love

for   this  country.  I  appreciate  very  much   the

sentiments expressed by the Member for Ulu Pandan.  I

think  it  is most timely of him to remind  the  very

rich  in  our  country that if they do  want  to  con

tribute, this is the time to contribute and not  when

it is too late, as happened the last time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the fund would be used to help establish a

rifle  or weapons factory. In the view of the  Member

for Ulu Pandan, this would be insufficient. In a way,

it  is so. If we are really going all out for a large

armaments  factory, this is insufficient.  But  there

are  many  components in the manufacture of equipment

with which we can associate the Defence Fund. My idea

is  to  have the Defence Fund associated with one  of

the  component  parts  manufactured  by  one  of  the

smaller  factories to remind us all the time that  it

is  made possible because all the people of Singapore

have  in  one way or another contributed towards  its

establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $47,900,000 for Head 61 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 62 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 62 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is understood that the sum of $191,000 is to

be provided for the construction and equipment of two

standard-type community centres. One of them will  be

at Kallang Estate in my constituency. However, it has

come  to my knowledge that the request for a proposed

site  for this community centre has been turned  down

by  the  Housing  and Development  Board.  Since  the

proposed  site which was earmarked in  1965  has  not

been made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



available  by the Housing and Development  Board,  is

the question of an alternative site being looked into

by the People's Association?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must also stress that there is a great need for a community centre in the Kallang Housing Estate in view of the fact that at least 40,000 people are living there. Although there is at present a community centre known as the Mount-batten Community Centre at Guillemard Road, it is situated

at  a  remote  corner of the constituency.  For  this

reason,  my constituents are unable to make full  use

of  it.  It is not conveniently located. In fact,  it

serves  predominantly people from the  Geylang  area.

May I expect a favourable reply from the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, whether we will

be  able  to build a community centre for Mountbatten

Constituency will also depend to a large extent  upon

how successful the Member for Mountbatten himself  is

in  helping us to find a suitable site. I would  like

to  remind him that the original site which we  chose

was turned down by him. He in turn recommended a site

which  was  later  found  to  be  required  for  road

extension. All I can say is that we have not given up

hope and that we may still be able to find a suitable

site.  In  this respect, may I request that he  keeps

his eyes open and hunt for a site himself as well?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker.  Sir, I remember that in 1967 I did  request

the  authorities  concerned to  build  two  community

centres    in    the   Thomson   Constituency.    The

Parliamentary  Secretary, on behalf of the  Minister,

told  the  House at that time that the two  community

centres would be constructed at the end of 1967.  But

up  till now there has been talk only and nothing has

been built. I hope the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



will not forget the promise made by his Parliamentary

Secretary  at that time. May I ask him when  the  two

community centres will be constructed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The Minister mentioned just now

that  I had turned down the proposed site. But, as  a

matter of fact, the proposed site was turned down  by

the  Housing and Development Board. I like the  site,

which is very ideal, but it was not made available by

the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> May I clarify? Shall we say that

there were two sites. The first was the original site

which,  according to my information, was turned  down

when  the Member found it to be unsuitable.  Then  on

his  recommendation later on, we went  to  the  other

site. This was the site which will be affected by the

road-widening scheme. Therefore, the application  was

rejected by the Housing Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> There seems to be some confusion.

The  present community centre was converted from  the

Katong  Boys'  Club in 1959 before I was  elected  to

this  House. The selection of that site  was  not  my

choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Minister's request for my assistance

to  look  for  an alternative site, I will  certainly

help  him  to  do  so.  With that,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Madam

Chan Choy Siong and Mr L. P. Rodrigo -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 62 be

No. (3)* as well?



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  Amendment No. (3) , which also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 62 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 403.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 62 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 402.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is purely a point of inquiry on my part. We

have   people's  centres  in  the  form  of   various

community  centres all over the country.  We  have  a

vote,  although  merely token at this  stage,  for  a

People's   Centre.  I  believe  it   must   be   some

centralised  affair. I am sure the Minister  will  be

able  to  enlighten this House because even  at  this

stage there must be some plan set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am ranging over amendments Nos. (2) and (3) ,

may  I ask this question? Now that we have a People's

Centre,   why  do  we  need  a  People's  Hall?   The

facilities  might  be duplicated  or  they  might  be

different. In any case, how would the People's Centre

and the People's Hall develop the people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are token

votes. These are ideas which we have in mind. I shall

try  to  clarify what is meant by the People's Centre

and  the  People's  Hall.  There  seems  to  be  some

confusion  that  since  we  have  so  many  community

centres  all over the island, why should we  want  to

establish a super community centre at Kallang itself?

This  is  not a super community centre. It  serves  a

different   purpose.  Its  objectives  are   slightly

different  in that in the People's Centre there  will

be  two lecture rooms, one with a seating capacity of

100  persons,  and  the other  40  persons.  This  is

largely  to allow the People's Association to conduct

classes for the staff and seminars for the management

committees, in this way, experiences can be exchanged

between  members of the various management committees

as  well  as  the staff of the People's  Association,

which  number  between 1,500 and 1,700.  It  is  also

expected  that  we shall have a staff  club-house  to

enable  the  1,500 odd members of our staff  to  have

some  recreation and a place to get together to  know

one another better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, the 1,500 or 1.700 members of our

staff  are spread all over the island and I think  it

is  essential that, from time to time, they should be

brought  together in a central place where  they  can

get  to  know one another and participate in sporting

or cultural activities of their own interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed that we should have offices for

corporation members of the People's Association which

can  be  rented  out to them at an  economic  rental,

because  we have found that quite a large  number  of

youth  associations, clubs and such  bodies  have  no

offices  or  premises where they can work to  promote

their various activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is put into the Development Estimates as two

items  - People's Centre and People's Hall. Actually,

they  are  two phases of the same project. The  first

phase is the People's Centre and the second phase  is

the People's Hall. As regards the People's Flall, the

idea  is to have a hall of this type to hold cultural

shows that are usually seen or performed in community

centres.  We  have found that present facilities  for

large-scale  performances  of  this  nature  are  not

suitable because the community centres cannot  afford

the rentals charged by the Victoria Memorial Hall  or

the  National Theatre. And it is intended that  shows

or  activities which are encouraged by  the  People's

Association can be performed in this hall at quite  a

nominal rate. Moreover, annually, we hold conferences

of management committees and conferences of the staff

of  the People's Association and we find that  we  do

not  have  the space available for these conferences.

Therefore, it is proposed that the People's  Hall  be

used to hold these conferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, it is just a token vote because,

while  investigating into the possibility  of  having

this  centre  built,  we  came  across  problems   of

foundation.   There   would  have   to   be   further

investigations into the feasibility of building  this

complex and also, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



view  of our financial stringency, it is more  likely

than not that the plans will not be proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, do you wish to speak on

* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Ho Kah Leong and Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total expenditure for this head is

$341,220. I feel this sum is too little. It should be

increased.  There is an item on works  and  buildings

for  rural  community centres. I would like  to  know

where the community centres are to be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Naval Base, which is in Sembawang

Constituency, has been transferred to the  Government

of  Singapore. May I request the Minister to build  a

rural community centre in the Naval Base in future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that there is no provision for the

building   of   holiday  camps.  I  understand   that

applicants for holiday camps have to wait for quite a

long time before they are allotted a camp. Therefore,

I  would  like  to ask the Minister whether  we  have

sufficient holiday camps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point concerns the People's Centre. Last

year,  there  was  a  provision of $92,000  for  the

construction of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



People's Centre. Has this sum been used, and has  the

project been carried out half-way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the  views expressed by the Member  for  Sembawang.  In addition, I wish to take this opportunity

to  deal  with the expansion of kindergarten  classes

run  by  the People's Association. We know  that  the

People's  Association was established  on  1st  July,

1960,  with  a  view to serving the people.  After  a

period  of eight years, the People's Association  has

been  able  to  make use of more than  180  community

centres  all over the island to serve the  people  by

promoting  various useful activities which  are  very

popular  with  them. At the same time, the  community

centres  have  also achieved the aim  of  becoming  a

bridge   between  the  people  and  the   Government.

Therefore,  we  can say that community  centres  have

already gained a place in the social structure of our

country.  In  fact,  in  the  eyes  of  the   people,

community  centres have also taken root in the  daily

life  of  the people. It is because of these  achieve

ments  by  the People's Association that we can  make

further  demands  on  the  Association.  We  ask  for

further  expansion of the activities to be undertaken

by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 17th of this month, the Minister for Defence,

in  reply  to a question by the Member for Sembawang,

disclosed  that  the People's Association  have  been

conducting  132 kindergarten classes in  the  various

community centres with an average yearly enrolment of

12,000  students  who pay about $1  each  per  month.

These kindergarten classes are very popular with  the

parents of the pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present juncture of its development, the

People's  Association cannot turn away from the  duty

of  further  developing kindergarten education  which

should become a link in our whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



education  structure.  My opinion  is  based  on  the

following  three reasons. Firstly, we all  know  that

pre-primary education plays a very important part  in

the  education of children. This is because  at  this

tender  age,  children  are most  impressionable  and

whatever  is taught to them will have a great  impact

on  them  in  later years. The father of kindergarten

education, Mr F. W. A. Froebel, has said  that  with

children  of  tender  age, you can  achieve  with  an

effort  as light as a feather what you cannot achieve

with  an  effort so heavy as 10,000 pounds  in  later

years.  Therefore, children of tender age  should  be

given  proper  kindergarten education.  In  fact,  in

advanced countries, preprimary education has been put

in  as an integral part of the whole education system

in  order  to cater for the needs of the children  in

the  age  group  of four to six years who  should  be

developed intellectually, spiritually, physically and

morally. As the Member for Paya Lebar has mentioned a

few   days  ago, they  should  be  given  a   proper

linguistic  start.  Therefore, we  should  not  allow

kindergarten education to sink or swim by itself.  It

should be given proper guidance and assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next reason is that, from the Estimates

presented  by the Minister for Finance,  we  can  see that defence occupies the most important part and, as a  result  of  the  increase in defence  expenditure, other  estimates  are put on a standstill  basis.  We know  that the Ministry of Education requires a great deal  of  money  for educational reforms.  Therefore,

there  is  little money left for the  development  of

kindergarten education. As a matter of expediency, we

can  make  use of available facilities. Organisations

which  already  have  the  facilities  should  expand

kindergarten  education and the People's Association,

in my view, is the most ideal choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the People's Association has more than 180

community centres throughout the island and a nominal

fee  of  $1  is  charged per pupil per  month.  These

classes are very popular amongst



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



the  parents. Furthermore, the community centres  are

not being made use of in the mornings, other than the

running of kindergarten classes. Therefore, with  the

installation  of  some equipment and  facilities  the

space  available  can be converted into  very  useful

kindergartens. Sir, the People's Association has  the

basic  facilities for the promotion  of  kindergarten

education. This is clear to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to raise some matters of detail in regard

to  the implementation of the scheme I have in  mind.

Firstly,  legislation should be introduced to  ensure

that  kindergarten education becomes part and  parcel

of  our educational structure to be undertaken by the

People's  Association.  We  are  aware  that  special

classes  to  cater for the failures  in  the  Primary

School Leaving Examination are conducted by the Adult

Education Board because the Ministry of Education  is

unable  to  conduct these special classes. Therefore,

on   the   same  basis,  we  can  ask  the   People's

Association to run kindergarten classes. In fact,  it

should be proud to be able to do this.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the present moment, there is only one

committee  in the People's Association to  attend  to

the  affairs  of kindergarten education which  caters

for  12,000  pupils.  This is  obviously  inadequate.

Therefore, an expansion is necessary. First, we  must

form an advisory committee. We should also strengthen

the   administrative  organisation  of  the  People's

Association. The advisory committee should consist of

experts from the Ministry of Education on pre-primary

education   and   representatives  from   educational

bodies,  the  People's Association  and  teachers  of

kindergarten classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in my view, the present facilities in the

community  centres  are inadequate  for  kindergarten

classes. We should buy more teaching aids and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



educational  toys for the children of these  classes,

because children of this age learn better through the

play-and-learn  method  and  free  activities.   They

should  not  be  confined to  rigid  formal  teaching

throughout the three hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may be worried about the expenditure. I think his worry is unfounded. It can be overcome. In my view, there are many members of the public who are always ready to donate money for a good cause. If any additional expenditure is necessary, we can even go to the extent of increasing the school fees for these

classes. So long as the classes are properly  run,  I

believe that the parents will not mind an increase in

the fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in my view, teachers in the kindergarten

classes  should be given professional training.  They

should  be  given  an  opportunity  to  study   child

psychology and children's habits and special teaching

methods.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the teachers in the community

centres have weekly discussions on Saturdays. This is

very  good.  But I think more can be done to  improve

the  teaching methods and the curriculum, and perhaps

kindergarten  teachers can be sent on  a  study  tour

abroad.  On the other hand, steps should be taken  to

strengthen the supervision of kindergarten classes by

sending   qualified  instructors  to  supervise   the

teaching  of the kindergarten teachers. At  the  same

time,  they  can ensure that what the  teachers  have

learnt   theoretically  will  be  put  into  practice

properly.  Only  along these lines  can  kindergarten

education be put on the proper track. Sir,  with  co-operation   from   the  people   and   the   People's

Association,   kindergarten   education    will    be

successful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this head

concerns  the  People's Association  and  I  wish  to

supplement  what has already been said. The  People's

Association  was established in 1960  and  has  since

done   a   great   job.  However,  in   so   far   as

administration is concerned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



there are certain shortcomings. For example, when the

leaders  of  community centres are to be transferred,

Members  of Parliament of the respective centres  are

not  informed where they will be transferred to. This

is  very unfair to Members of Parliament because they

are  advisers  to  the community centres  and  advice

should be sought from them before such transfers  are

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The temporary Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock)</b>: Order.

Mr  Lee, these remarks would have been more relevant

when this topic was debated in the Main Estimates. We

are now on the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in my view, the

transfer  of  community centre leaders  should  be  a

matter   of  consultation  between  the  Members   of

Parliament  and  the  People's  Association,  because

Members  of Parliament are in close contact with  the

Director  and  Assistant Directors  of  the  People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I have a suggestion to make on the

organisation  and  administration  of  the   People's

Association. I think these functions should be handed

over  to the Ministry of Culture because, in my view,

the Ministry of Culture is not given enough work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I merely want

to ask the Minister one question. If my memory serves

me right, the Government announced some time ago that

the  People's  Association intended to build  holiday

flats along the sea coast to enable urban d~ellers to

spend  their  holidays there. But there  is  no  such

allocation   for  this  purpose  in  the  Development

Estimates.  I  wish to know whether any decision  has

been made on this project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I wish to

remind  the Minister that he has not replied to  the

question I raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, after listening to the Member

for  Jurong,  I am more than convinced that  all  the

arguments are against the running of kindergarten



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



classes by the People's Association. The Member  very

rightly  said  that  the  children  attending   these

kindergarten  classes are at the most  impressionable

age  and one must be very careful with what one  does

with  their education, and also kindergarten teachers

should be given very special training. All in all, it

is a very specialised subject and in order to be able

to  teach  these children well, we have to train  the

teachers, and all this costs money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members that the main objective of the

People's  Association  is  not  to  run  kindergarten

classes.  The Association does it as an  adjunct  and

partly  to  provide  a service to the  people.  After

running these classes for some time, however, it  was

found  necessary  to  set up a committee  to  conduct

these  classes, and, having watched the results,  and

especially after listening to the Member for  Jurong,

I  am  more  than ever convinced that the running  of

kindergarten  classes  is not  the  function  of  the

People's  Association.  Instead  of  benefiting   our

population,  we  may  probably do  untold  damage  to

children  of  tender age if the People's  Association

takes over this job.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to differ when the Member for Jurong said that

there  is  a  great demand for kindergarten  classes,

because  when enrolment began this year some  of  the

kindergarten  teachers had to go on a  house-to-house

enrolment   campaign  in  order  to  get   sufficient

children  to commence classes. In fact, some  of  the

classes  have to be closed down. I myself would  like

the  People's  Association to run these classes,  but

owing  to  its commitments and in order not  to  lose

sight  of  our  main  objective, I  think  we  should

concentrate more on what we have set out to  do  than

do  something which we are not qualified to do,  that

is,  running  kindergarten classes. I would  be  very

loath  indeed  to damage our children  at  this  very

tender age by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



providing  them with teachers who are  not  specially

qualified  to  teach them. I do not know  whether  it

comes  within  the province of the  Ministry  of  Edu

cation. But after listening to the Member for  Jurong

today,  I  would like to repeat that I am  more  than

convinced  that the People's Association is  not  the

organisation to run kindergarten classes. In fact, we

will be cutting down the number of classes very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan would like the People's

Association  to  be handed over to  the  Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Then it will be out of

our hands!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I have no objection to this at all.

In fact, it will lighten my load.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked what has happened

to the holiday flats and why there is no provision to

build these flats in the Development Estimates.  This

proposition came about while members of the board  of

the  People's Association were dealing with a request

for  holiday bungalows from the staff of the People's

Association. They requested that since the  staff  of

Government   departments  are  entitled  to   holiday

bungalows,  why cannot they be provided with  holiday

bungalows  also?  This proposition was  discussed  by

members of the board of the People's Association  and

we  came  to  the conclusion that it would  be  worth

while to try a new scheme, that is, instead of,  say,

using two acres of land for two bungalow houses which

will  be  able  to accommodate only two families,  it

would  be  better to build holiday flats so that  for

the  same  amount of money and using  the  same  land

area,   more   members   of  the   staff   could   be

accommodated: also it is possible to let these  flats

out to members of the public. Since the holiday flats

are  primarily for the use of members of the People's

Association, the cost of building them will  have  to

come  from  whatever  funds the People's  Association

has.  This  is  the reason why the provision  is  not

included in the Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



Estimates. A study of the site, the form the  holiday

flats should take, and the cost of building them,  is

still in progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Sembawang, all I can say

is to repeat what I said just now, and that is, plans

for  the  construction of the People's Hall have  met

with  some  snags - foundation trouble  and  probably

later  on  financial stringency - and  therefore  the

project has come to a stop. It was right that the sum

of $92,000 provided for last year was not spent. I do

not know the exact figures expended in the drawing up

of plans and investigation work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look into the question of building a

community  centre  at the Naval Base  when  the  time

comes, because the Naval Base has not yet been handed

to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that answers all the issues brought up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister has not replied to my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not the

Minister who promised him two kindergarten classes in

his  constituency. But I have made it  clear  that  I

would not like the People's Association to extend its

activities in running kindergarten classes. In  fact,

we  should do less and less of this, and I have given

my   reasons.  Also  the  Member  for  Sembawang  has

reinforced  the  reason why the People's  Association

should not be responsible for kindergarten classes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

very much regret that the Minister for Defence has  a

different  idea from mine. I said that  the  People's

Association   has  all  the  prerequisites   to   run

kindergarten  classes. Also the people at  large  can

request  the People's Association to run them.  Sit',

everything depends on our doing things ourselves. For

instance,  if  there  is a shortage  of  kindergarten

teachers  or  if  they  are under-qualified,  we  can

improve  their  training by asking  the  Ministry  of

Education  to  help train them. If the equipment  and

facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



for  the  classes are insufficient,  we  can  try  to

expand them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was just now not engaged on the topic of kindergarten

classes. My question was this. Last year the

Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to a question I

raised in this House, said that two community centres

would be built in my constituency, but so far no

action has been taken. I wish to ask the Minister

when these two community centres will be built,

because my constituents have asked me why the promise

has not been fulifiled.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe there

is  already a community centre in Thomson. There  are

probably  very good reasons why no further  community

centre has been built in spite of the promise.  I  do

not  know what the reasons are. Probably there is  no

suitable  land,  or  the activities  of  the  present

centre do not warrant the building of another centre.

Anyway,  I  promise the Member I will look  into  the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know what the Member for Jurong has in mind, that if we make up our minds to do a thing, we can overcome the difficulties. I quite realise that if we really want to go for kindergarten education in a big way, we can always set up a special Teachers' Training College to train

kindergarten teachers or send them abroad or  provide

special  equipment.  But the main  objective  of  the

People's  Association  is  not  to  run  kindergarten

classes.  First  and  foremost,  I  would  like   the

People's   Association  to  succeed   in   its   main

objective, that is, to bring community service to the

people  and  to  get  the people  to  participate  in

various  activities.  I want that  to  succeed  first

rather  than disperse all our resources in doing  two

things and failing in both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 71 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $182,080 is provided for Head 71. Will

the   Minister  describe  the  different   types   of

equipment  that will be purchased with  this  sum  of

money?  May I also know whether the purchase of  such

equipment will improve the programmes over the  radio

and on television?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the money sought here has nothing to do

with  the  improvement of programmes or the extension

of  programme  hours. The money  is  sought  for  the

installation of machinery, transmitters, and  so  on.

So  I  think  it  is not proper to  raise  again  the

question of improvement of programmes. In 1966, a sum

of  $6,262,147  was  voted by Parliament  to  improve

radio  and  television services by installing  better

equipment.  This  project was not completed  in  that

year  and  a sum of $851,500 was revoted in the  1967

Development Estimates. A further sum of $171,500  was

again revoted in the 1968 Development Estimates.  The

amount  of $100,000 appearing in the 1969 Development

Estimates  is a revote in respect of this project  to

meet a five per cent retention fee in respect of  one

contractor  who  is  expected  to  complete  the  job

satisfactorily in the coming year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr L.

P.  Rodrigo ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 71 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 901.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that part of the sum of $82,000

provided  for fire prevention equipment against  this

subhead  is to be spent on the new television  centre

which  has  already been operational for  quite  some

time.   This  suggests  to  me  that  the  department

concerned  has perhaps, not paid sufficient attention

to  the  question  of  safeguarding  public  property

against  fire,  loss  or damage during  the  planning

stage  and that it has only now come to realise  this

omission.  This apparently reckless attitude  on  the

part  of  the  department is particularly astonishing

when  one remembers that over the last two years  the

department  has  lost more than $« million  worth  of

valuable equipment as a result of fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned to note that this item is

subject to Treasury sanction. Supposing this  is  not

forthcoming, are we to assume that all the  expensive

equipment  and installations will be left unprotected

against the risk of fires?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this amount of

money   is  for  additional  installation   of   fire

prevention  equipment  in the  television  and  trans

mitting  stations in Bukit Batok. For the information

of  the Member, very good fire-fighting equipment has

already  been provided in the T.V, centre. The  money

sought here will be used to improve it further.  T.V.

and  Radio Singapura uses expensive and sophisticated

equipment   which  is  presently  housed  in   rather

inadequate conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two fires within the last four years.

Even   though  every  precaution  is  taken  by   the

Broadcasting Division, the inherent risk of fire will

always be present, especially when highly inflammable

material   is  being  stored  and  used.  There   is,

therefore,  a  real and urgent need for an  effective

automatic fire alarm and prevention system  in  those

areas  which  are  considered  high  fire  risk.  The

provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



of $82,000 is for fire prevention equipment required

for the T.V. centre at Caldecott Hill as well as for

the Jurong and Bukit Batok transmitting stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire referred to by the Member took place two

years  ago  in the old radio centre and  not  in  the

television  centre.  The  old  buildings   were   not

properly  planned and additional huts and sheds  were

put  up  as  and when the need arose. Therefore,  the

fire-fighting equipment there was not very good. With

that  disastrous experience in mind, we have to  plan

for better fire-fighting equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to he allocated for Head 81 he

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated for social welfare is only 540.020

which is extremely meagre and detrimental to the poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



people.  I  wonder  whether this is  because  of  the

increase  in  defence expenditure. Will the  Minister

indicate whether this is so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister have a plan to accommodate

retarded  children who have to wait for a  very  long

time to go to school? For instance, if the Member for

Bukit  Merah wants to go there, he will have to  wait

for half a year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang asked whether the

provision for social welfare has been put at  $40,020

because  of  the increase in defence expenditure.  My

answer  is  "Yes".  Under this head,  there  are  two

projects:   the  Junior  Approved  School   and   the

extension  to  Mt.  Emily Girls' Home.  Although  the

Junior  Approved School has a token vote of  $10,  it

does not mean that the project has been abandoned. In

fact,  we  are  going ahead with it. A sum  of  about

$125,000  has  been  promised by the  United  Kingdom

Government towards the cost of this building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension to Mt. Emily Girls' Home will be

carried  out  next  year  in order  to  increase  the

capacity of this home from 40 to 80 girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's question whether the

Ministry  has plans to accommodate retarded  children

in  schools,  there is an association run  by  people

which accommodates children in this kind of school. I

do not think it is necessary for the Ministry to have

another school of this type.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 82 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 106.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 82 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Open Prison, Ulu Bedok, to be set up has

given  rise  to  two  questions. Is  this  prison  to

replace  the  Outram  Road  Prison  which  has   been

demolished?  In other words, will it accommodate  the

inmates from the Outram Road Prison?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is this. Is the proposed new

prison  to be run on the same lines as those  in  the

colonial  days? In other words, will  the  prison  be

used only for the detention of prisoners without  any

facilities for reformation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 106 concerns the female prison at Changi. In

1968  a  provision of $140,000 has been approved  for

the  construction  of  a cellular  block  for  female

prisoners  in Changi. Why is it that in  the  1969-70

estimates  only a token vote is asked  for?  Does  it

mean  that there is no longer a need to proceed  with

the  project?  Is  it the view of the  Minister  that

there  will be less female prisoners going into  that

prison in the future?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ulu Bedok

New  Open  Prison is intended to accommodate criminal

law  detainees  who are at present housed  in  Changi

Prison and the Remand Prison at Queenstown. With  the

closure

of  the  Pulau Senang Settlement after  the  riot  in

1963,  the  criminal law detainees from Pulau  Senang

were  transferred  to Outram Road Prison  and  Changi

Prison,  thereby  causing congestion  in  both  these

prisons. The congestion in Changi Prison became worse

with the demolition of the Outram Road Prison in 1965



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



and   its  substitution  by  the  Remand  Prison   at

Queenstown,  which has accommodation  for  about  310

prisoners. When the New Open Prison at Ulu  Bedok  is

completed,    the   criminal   law   detainees    now

accommodated  in Changi Prison and the Remand  Prison

in  Queenstown  will be transferred there.  Accommoda

tion  for  400 criminal law detainees is provided  in

the  New  Open  Prison at Ulu Bedok. Of  course,  the

purpose  of  the prison is to rehabilitate  prisoners

and not just to keep them in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question on the female prison at

Changi, the purpose of building a cellular block  for

female  prisoners  is  to  relieve  the  shortage  of

accommodation  at  the  female  prison  and   provide

greater security and conditions of segregation, where

necessary,  for female prisoners. It is  intended  to

build  20 cells in the Cellular Block, Female  Prison

at Changi, to provide accommodation for 20 prisoners.

At  the present moment, the female prisoners at  Moon

Crescent  have only two dormitories, one for ordinary

female  prisoners - that is those who  are  convicted

prisoners, remand prisoners, aliens, etc. -  and  the

other   is   for  female  political  detainees.   The

dormitory  for  convicted  prisoners  has  a  maximum

accommodation  of  30  persons  only,  and  that  for

political detainees a maximum of 10 persons only. The

figure of female prisoners often exceeds this number,

resulting  in  congestion. At present  there  are  35

female   prisoners  in  the  dormitory  for  ordinary

prisoners,  and  six  political  detainees   in   the

dormitory for political detainees. The congestion  in

the dormitory for ordinary prisoners has been the

subject   of   comment  by  visiting   justices   who

periodically visit the female prison.

It  must be pointed out that the old female prison at

Outram  Road,  which  was  demolished  in  1965,  had

accommodation  for 140 female prisoners.  The  design

for  the  Cellular Block, Female Prison, will reflect

an   improvement  in  prison  architecture  and  will

provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



full  security  cells to enable the prisoners  to  be

segregated if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why there is only a token vote of $10, Sir, it

is  because we have not had the full estimate of  how

much it will cost to build this block.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this item concerns prison industries for which a provision of $150,000 is made. Since we are spending so much money on prison industries, what is their total output and what is the amount of revenue collected by the Government per annum? I fully endorse the idea of making use of

prisoners to run prison industries. They will learn a

trade which will be useful to them in making a living

after  they have served their sentences.  I  wish  to

have more details about this.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of

$150,000  provided  for  in the  1969-70  Development

Estimates  is  for the continuation of  the  projects

planned  for,  but not completed in, 1968.  The  main

projects which the prison industries are expected  to

carry  out  in  1969  are  as  follows:  purchase  of

machinery   for  the  manufacture  of  refuse   bins,

$79,500; construction of a workshop to house the wood-

work  industry now under temporary roofing,  $40,000;

and  the  setting  up of a new footwear  and  leather

section,  $17,500. The rest of the provision  is  for

other  projects of a minor nature connected with  the

further development of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



laundry service, metal work section, printing

section, tailoring section and concrete casting

section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An idea of the progress of prison industries, which

commenced  as  a  separate  organisation  under   the

Prisons  Department  in 1955,  can  be  seen  in  the

increase  in the number of workshops. When they  were

first  started, the prison industries  had  only  six

workshops. Today there are 19 workshops catering  for

trades  ranging from laundry, woodwork, cane-work  to

bakery and timber seasoning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the revenue earned and savings made by the

prison industries had increased from $278,000 in 1956

to  $701,000 in 1967 - two and a half times the  1956

figure  - it must be emphasised that revenue  is  not

the purpose for which prison industries were started.

The aim of prison industries is to give an occupation

to the prisoner to help him in his rehabilitation and

train  him  in a trade so as to enable  him  to  find

employment  on  his release. Through the  payment  of

wages  at  fixed rates and industrial bonuses  commen

surate   with  their  skill  and  production  output,

prisoners are encouraged to improve in the  job  they

do and strive to increase output. Under this system a

prisoner can earn an average of $4 per week up  to  a

maximum  of  $10  per week. The wages and  industrial

bonuses  for productivity are charged as a production

cost on the goods and services provided by prisoners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that while there was a vote for

$200,000,  towards  the improvement  of  Jalan  Besar

Stadium in the preceding year, there is only a  token

vote this year. Could I be informed of the plans that

are  made  today to improve Jalan Besar  Stadium?  My

understanding is that the plans are comprehensive and

have  been completed, but the allocation of  $200,000

is   insufficient  and  that  is  why  work  on   the

improvement of the stadium is being held back. I will

be obliged for the information.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1966 a sum of

$200,000  was  provided in the Development  Estimates

for  the  improvement  of Jalan  Besar  Stadium.  The

improvement envisaged then included the provision  of

additional  seating and standing  tiers  and  covered

stands  to accommodate a capacity of 20,000  persons.

It  also  included  provision  for  increased  toilet

facilities,  extra changing rooms and  office  space,

the  reinforcement of the stadium  wooden  fence  for

greater security, the Installation of turnstile gates

at  the entrances and the general improvement of  the

stadium  in appearance. Work on this was not done  in

1966  and,  therefore,  a  similar  sum  was  revoted

in1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, however, the Urban Renewal Department

considered  that  renovation in the manner  envisaged

was inadequate if Jalan Besar is to be turned into  a

subsidiary  sports complex to augment and  complement

the  National  Stadium at Kallang  for  international

games.  As the traffic in the area is very congested.

plans  for  the  development  of  Jalan  Besar  as  a

subsidiltry stadium are being held up until the State

and City Planning Department completes its report  of

the  city  road network in the area. This is expected

to  be  completed in early 1969. As the new  proposal

envisaged  by  the Urban Renewal Department  for  the

development  of Jalan Besar Stadium as  a  subsidiary

sports   complex  will  cost  very  much  more   than

$200,000, a token vote of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



only $10 has been provided in the 1969-70

Development Estimates.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns Erskine Hill Office

Building. This building is intended to house  various

Government  offices in the city area and it  will  be

the  highest Government building in Singapore. As far

as  I can remember, the construction of this building

should  be  completed by 1968 in order to enable  the

Government offices to move in. At the present moment,

it appears that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



further  work  has  to  be  carried  out  before  the

building can be completed. Therefore, I would like to

ask  the Minister why the completion of this building

is not according to schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Development Estimates, a sum of

$3,964,000  is  provided for 1969-70.  What  are  the

reasons  for the increase in this vote over the  1968

vote of $3,450,000?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know how many Government

offices  will be housed in this building when  it  is

completed.  I  understand that the departments  under

the  Ministry of National Development will be  housed

in  this  building. If this is true,  what  will  the

existing   offices  at  Upper  Pickering  Street   be

converted into?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  reasons for the delay in the completion  of  the

Erskine   Hill  Office  Building  are   as   follows.

Originally, the building was intended to  house  only

the  offices  and departments under the  Ministry  of

National  Development.  But  subsequently,   it   was

decided to include the departments under the Ministry

of  Law  as  the Ministry of Law and the Ministry  of

National Development are under the same Minister.  As

a  result of this change, we have to make alterations

to   the   original   plans  to   include   the   new

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, construction work is being

vigorously carried out to try to complete this office

building  by August 1969. The building will  then  be

able to house several Government offices such as  the

administrative  headquarters  of  the   Housing   and

Development  Board, the Public Works Department,  the

Primary  Production  Department, the  Chief  Building

Surveyor's Office, the Planning Department, the  Land

Office,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



the Survey Department and the Registry of Land Titles

and Deeds.

Pickering  Street and the administrative headquarters

of the Housing Board at Alexandra Road, the matter is

still under consideration.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the

past,  people did not believe that the sea  could  be

reclaimed.  Since the P.A.P. Government took  office,

we  can  see  for ourselves vast areas  of  reclaimed

land.  A great deal has been achieved in land reclama

tion.  For example, in Jurong, we have been  able  to

cut  down hills and make use of the earth to fill  up

the  sea. In order to increase the land area of Singapore,  which  is only a small island  of  224  square

miles,  we  have  to  carry out reclamation  schemes.

There  is no objection to these schemes and  I  under

stand  that a great deal of money has been  spent  on

reclamation  which  has been going on  satisfactorily

for  a  long period. The people of Singapore wish  to

find out whether Government has any plans for the use

of  the reclaimed land and whether the projects  will

benefit  them. They are worried because a great  deal

of public funds have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



spent.  If the projects are beneficial to the people,

they  will be happy. And the people who are  affected

by  the  land  reclamation schemes  will  not  regret

having to move out from their places. People who  own

bungalows  and  houses in the Katong  area  are  also

affected  because  the value of  their  property  has

depreciated as a result of the loss of the sea front.

If   land  reclamation  can  give  the  people   more

benefits,  they  will  not  mind  making  sacrifices.

Therefore,  I  want  the Minister to  answer  several

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the extent of land reclamation in

Singapore? Secondly, has the Government any plans for

the  use  of  the land reclaimed under  the  existing

schemes? Thirdly, are these reclaimed areas earmarked

for  industrial  purposes,  development  purposes  or

residential purposes?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 13th of

December this year, in answer to a question from  the

Member  for  Katong, I gave a detailed reply  on  the

reclamation  projects. I am afraid  I  will  have  to

repeat what I have already said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly, as far as the East Coast reclamation is

concerned,  about 1,000 acres of foreshore  extending

from Bedok to the Singapore Swimming Club and another

125 acres from the Singapore Swimming Club to the tip

of  Tanjong  Rhu will be reclaimed. By October  last,

705 acres were reclaimed. Comprehensive plans for the

utilisation  of  the reclaimed land  along  the  East

Coast  are now being prepared. A new coastal  highway

will  first  be  constructed to meet  the  increasing

needs of the East Coast area. In addition, land  will

be set aside for housing, parks, hotels and shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the reclamation in Kallang Basin, 370 acres

out  of  the  proposed 450 acres  were  reclaimed  by

October. Two-thirds of the reclaimed land in  Kallang

will be used for labour intensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



industries and one-third for low-cost housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 10 acres of the foreshore at Pasir Panjang

have  been  reclaimed. This piece of  reclaimed  land

will   be   used  for  the  development  of   tourist

recreational facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 247 acres of swamp land at Kranji have

been  earmarked  for reclamation, out  of  which  160

acres have already been reclaimed. This area is to be

developed for sawmills and related industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards other reclamation projects, 1,000 acres

of  swamp  and foreshore at the east bank  of  Jurong

will  be reclaimed for marine, wood-working and other

industries;  307 acres of prawn ponds  and  swamp  at

Sungei  Kadut for wood-working and other  industries;

108  acres of swamp close to the armaments  depot  in

the  Naval Base for marine and other industries,  and

it is also intended to reclaim further the-land along

the  west coast towards the city to provide  an  area

for the construction of godowns.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, all these

items concern urban renewal, land acquisition and  so

on.  The  question of urban renewal is  a  matter  of

great  concern  to  the people living  in  Chinatown,

particularly those living in very old houses. In  the

Development  Estimates, various  sums  of  money  are

allocated  for  urban  renewal  in  1969-70  in   the

Chinatown area for resettlement and other purposes. I

wish  to  ask  the Minister the following  questions:

Firstly,   where  will  be  the  resettlement   area?

Secondly,   for   what  purposes   will   the   urban

redevelopment area be used?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   people   who   are  affected   by   the   urban

redevelopment scheme will be resettled and they  have

been  informed where they will be resettled. We  know

that  most  of  these people prefer to be  housed  in

Housing  Board flats and we try our best to  allocate

them flats in the neighbourhood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the urban redevelopment scheme, we propose to

build  skyscrapers  and  shopping  centres  in  North

Precinct,  which  includes  Jalan  Sultan,  Crawford,

Victoria  Street  and Beach Road. In South  Precinct,

which includes Outram Road, New Bridge Road and South

Bridge  Road, we propose to build multistorey  flats,

shopping centres and a multi-storey car park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to talk on matters relating to

resettlement. I think Members will agree with  what  I

am  going to say about the resettlement of farmers who

have  been  affected by the Government's redevelopment

scheme  and have to be resettled in some other  areas,

thereby causing them inconvenience and difficulties. I

hope  the  Government can help them  to  resolve  this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, when a certain area

is delineated as a resettlement area for those farmers

who are affected by redevelopment, the authorities  do

not   consider  whether  the  land  is  suitable   for

resettlement.  They  merely build  roads  but  totally

disregard the provision of water and electricity,  and

applications for such facilities are of no avail.  For

instance,  in my constituency, applications have  been

made  for  the  supply of water  by  residents  of  Resettlement  Areas  Nos. 5 and 5A, but  so  far,  these

areas  have  not  been supplied with  electricity  and

water totally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the Minister to consider providing the

necessary  amenities  such as water,  electricity  and

communications before the farmers are resettled in the

delineated areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member  for  Jurong  complained  that  there  are

insufficient  public  amenities  in  the  resettlement

areas.  This  is true, but we have not  neglected  the

requirements  of these areas. In the past  few  years,

the  Government has been taking steps to  improve  the

environment in the resettlement areas and  to  provide

public  and social amenities to enable the  people  to

enjoy  the  same facilities as those provided  in  the

urban areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Jurong that,

in future, all newly developed resettlement areas will

be  given  priority for the provision of social  ameni

ties,  especially the supply of water and electricity.

At present, my Ministry is taking steps to co-ordinate

the  work of the Housing and Development Board and the

Public  Utilities Board in order to solve the  problem

of providing water and electricity to the resettlement

areas before the people are resettled there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

clarify  that  in future there will be no resettlement

area in my constituency, but there will be people  who

will  be affected by resettlement. I am satisfied with

the  reply  of the Parliamentary Secretary and  I  beg

leave to withdraw.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the planning of development by the

Government,  it  appears  that  in  areas  where   the

buildings are shaky and about to collapse, nothing  is

done,  but in areas where the houses are still  strong

and  in  good  condition  they  are  pulled  down  for

development  and  rebuilding.  Furthermore,   in   any

development  scheme,  whether  multi-storey  flats  or

factories  are  to  be  built  in  place  of  existing

buildings,  I  would like to know  from  the  Minister

whether  preference could first be given to  residents

occupying  existing buildings, and  if  the  residents

refuse  to develop their land in accordance  with  the

Government's  plan, then the offer  can  be  given  to

other  local developers. If the other local developers

are  unable to accept this offer, then it can be given

to  foreign  developers. I appreciate that  a  lot  of

money  is  needed for development, but an  opportunity

should  first  be  given  to local  developers  before

foreign developers are invited.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



It will  be futile to attract foreign capital  into

the country if our local capitalists develop projects

in other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister enlighten me on whether local

capitalists  could be given preference in development

projects,  both in buildings and industries?  In  the

rural  areas there are many old buildings  which  are

about  to  collapse,  but when  occupiers  apply  for

permission   to   develop  and  rebuild   the   area,

permission is not given. These old houses are on  Government  land  as  well as on private  land,  but  in

either  case, the Government does not allow occupiers

to  develop  the land nor has it any plan to  develop

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I wish to add a point about the

flood  which occurred on 11th December, 1968.  Places

like  Anson  Circus,  the New Bridge  Road  area  and

Bernam Street were flooded, thereby causing a lot  of

trouble  to the people and traffic. I know  that  the

Government  is  trying its best  to  beat  the  flood

situation, but I hope it will increase its efforts in

this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon:</b> Sir, I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Member for

Anson   said  about  urban  renewal  is  not  exactly

correct.  The Government, in selecting areas  for  re

development, does not necessarily consider  only  the

structural condition of the buildings but also  other

factors such as general town planning and the  system

of transportation. Hence, certain precincts have been

marked or mapped out for urban renewal.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes buildings in these redeveloped areas or

areas  to  be  developed are not necessarily  in  the

worst condition. But, generally speaking, most of the

buildings  in  the  area  will  be  in  a  very   bad

condition. I am sure the Member understands that  the

present  urban renewal programme does not  cover  the

whole  island  of Singapore nor the whole  town,  and

that  there  are still many dilapidated  areas  which

have to remain for some time. Urban renewal is a very

slow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



and expensive process, and the redevelopment of these

dilapidated areas must be properly phased out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's proposal that people living in a

particular area should be given the first opportunity

to  rebuild on the spot, I will say that  this  is  a

good  proposal. But, unfortunately, it does not  work

out  in most cases because the financial backing that

is  needed  to put up multi-storey flats is sometimes

too  much  for one individual, and the urban  renewal

experts have had a difficult time trying to get  hold

of  10 and 12 shopkeepers to combine and rebuild. But

if any of them are prepared to combine and pool their

resources, we always give them the first opportunity.

As  far as foreign participation in our urban renewal

plan is concerned, we welcome foreign capital, but we

do  not give preference to foreign capital over local

capital. The Member will be pleased to hear  that  in

the  first  tenders of urban renewal sites  where  14

sites  were  offered to the public, eight were  taken

up.  Of the eight taken up, six were completely being

done  by  local capital. In two cases,  there  was  a

joint  effort by local and foreign capital. What  the

outcome  of the second tender system will  be,  I  am

afraid I cannot say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more point which I have not dealt with,

and that is the floods which disturbed the Member for

Anson and some of his constituents a week or so  ago.

I must apologise for these floods. But there is quite

a lot of work going on at the moment along and around

Outram  Road.  There is a Housing Board complex,  new

drains are being made, and new roads are being  laid.

Unfortunately, there was a very heavy shower on  that

day  and one of the drains along New Bridge Road  was

blocked. As a result, the water rose. I also have  to

tender my apologies to the Member for Queenstown  who

apparently was stuck along Outram Road. But I  assure

the  Member  for Anson that we will do  our  best  to

alleviate  these  floods  as  far  as  possible,  but

building  operations somehow always  lead  to  floods

even if it is for a short period of half an hour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I stand to be corrected, but I seem to recall

that  we  have,  on  more  than  one  occasion  quite

recently, widely publicised the fact that a number of

rural  abattoirs  will soon be set  up  to  suit  the

convenience  of farmers. Does the token provision  of

$10  suggest that the farmers will have to  wait  for

some time before getting their abattoirs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

construction  of  rural  abattoirs  was  proposed  to

assist   those  in  the  rural  areas  who  find   it

uneconomical  to  send their animals  to  Jurong  for

slaughter  because of the distance and of  the  small

number  of animals slaughtered. The organisation  and

operation  of rural abattoirs should not be difficult

and  will only involve a skeleton staff. However, the

proposal  to  construct  rural  abattoirs  has   been

shelved  for the time being until the pig section  of

the Jurong Abattoir has been put into full operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sum is intended for "Intensive Farm

Improvement Schemes". I am keen to learn what are the

schemes the Primary Production Department has in mind

and whether they are helpful to the ordinary farmers.

Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can enlighten  me

on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore,

it is estimated that some 25,000 families are engaged

in  agricultural activities. Farming in Singapore  is

extremely  intensive and many varieties of  vegetable

crops are grown in rapid succession each year in very

small  units. Under such a system, an efficient crop,

husbandry and farm management are of the utmost impor

tance. In the intensive farm improvement schemes, the

basic objectives are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to carry out a programme of applied research

into  problems of vegetable farming with  a  view  to

increasing agricultural productivity; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to find ways of improving the fertility of swamp

land reclaimed for agricultural purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these objectives, three research units

will  be established: (1) a Soil and Fertiliser Unit;

(2)  a  Plant  Breeding and Soil and  Seed  Selection

Unit; and (3) a Pest and Disease Control Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soil and Fertiliser Unit will undertake

investigations   into   the  feasibility   of   using

reclaimed  swamp  land  for agricultural  production,

soil  improvement and deciding fertiliser regimes  to

increase production. Allied problems like cultivation

techniques will also be investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plant Breeding and Soil and Seed Selection Unit

will  conduct research into different types  of  vege

tables with a view to improving quality and quantity.

The  quality  of imported seeds will be  examined  to

ensure that high-yielding and disease-resistant varie

ties are available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pest and Disease Control Unit will investigate

the  problems of vegetable crops infected with  pests

and  diseases  and  the correct use  of  agricultural

chemicals  to  ensure the maximum  return  from  each

planting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to build a single-storey building at

Sembawang to provide a laboratory and offices for the

intensive  farm  improvement  scheme.  Although   the

scheme was approved in April



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



1967,  funds were only available this year. To  date,

the  construction  of  the  laboratory  has  yet   to

commence as a revision of the cost of construction is

necessary. Part of the equipment required has already

been  purchased and put to use. Research work is  now

in progress. It is envisaged that the construction of

the laboratory can commence early next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is understood that in a small country like

ours,  the available land for agriculture is limited.

Yesterday, when I spoke on agriculture, I did mention

that due to industrial development, there is less and

less  agricultural land. In this respect, I think  it

is  a bright idea to develop our neighbouring islands

for agricultural purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether a

survey  has been carried out in Pulau Ubin and  Pulau

Tekong  for  the purpose of developing these  islands

into  agricultural fields and, if  so,  what  is  the

outcome of the survey?



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, T think this is

the  third occasion on which I have mentioned in this

House  The poverty of the people in Pulau Tekong  and

asked  the  Government whether it  has  any  plan  to

develop  the  place into an agricultural  complex.  I

remember  the  Parliamentary Secretary did  tell  the

House  that  there were plans and that  the  Research

Unit  would  look into the possibility of  developing

this  island into an agricultural complex. But,  Sir,

year after year the same question has been raised  in

this  House.  My  colleague, the Member  for  Jurong,

could  not  resist  reminding the  Minister  and  the

Parliamentary Secretary of this again. I think it  is

time  that  something should be  done  in  these  two

islands,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



especially Pulau Tekong Besar, so that the livelihood

of the residents there could be improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am glad to inform the Member for

Jurong  and  the Member for Changi that surveys  have

been conducted into the feasibility of using some  of

the  40  islands around Singapore for agriculture  or

animal husbandry. They were intensive surveys carried

out  for more than a year. The surveys were completed

this  year. The recommendations are that Pulau  Ubin,

Pulau  Tekong  Besar and Puiau Tekong Kechil  can  be

used  for agriculture and the growing of orchids.  We

have  plans,  foi a start, to redevelop Pulau  Tekong

because  it  is  the biggest island.  It  has  water,

though perhaps a little brackish. We hope it will  be

suitable  for  the growing of orchids.  I  think  the

Member  for Changi will understand that the  Ministry

of  National  Development cannot be  blamed  for  the

poverty  of the islanders who live in Pulau Ubin  and

Pulau  Tekong. But my Ministry will do  its  best  to

develop  the potentialities of the islands in  Changi

in  the  hope  that  our  efforts  will  relieve  the

suffering, if any, of the constituents of Changi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, provision is made under this subhead for the

setting up of a marketing organisation for the export

of  orchids and horticultural products. I would  like

to  know why we are giving preferential treatment  to

orchids  and  horticultural products. Should  we  not

extend the functions of the organisation, as and when

it  is  established, to look after  animal  husbandry

also?  We  produce more than sufficient of  pigs  and

poultry  for our own domestic consumption. At present

the  export  of  such  items is left  entirely  to  a

limited



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



number   of  private  firms.  I  suspect  some   have

insufficient  resources and facilities  to  be  in  a

position fully to seek out export markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, it

seems  that  preference is given to the encouragement

and  development of the orchid industry. In  view  of

the  fact  that most of the farmers, by nature,  grow

vegetables, I would like to ask the Minister  whether

he will conduct a simple course on orchid growing for

farmers.  This  will encourage them to  grow  orchids

which will help them in their livelihood.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I only hope that both Members are

not speaking in contradictory terms. One questions me

on  the wisdom of giving encouragement to the growing

of  orchids,  and  the other wants  me  to  encourage

farmers to grow orchids.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps both are correct. The

cultivation  of orchids, particularly the  export  of

cut  orchid flowers, is contributing considerably  to

the  national economy of the Republic. Orchids  bring

in  foreign  exchange.  In 1967  orchids  brought  to

Singapore more than $650,000 in foreign exchange.  It

is  envisaged that this figure will bc exceeded  this

year.  In fact, for the first eleven months  of  this

year, more  than  a million stalks  of  cut  flowers

valued  at  about $575,000 were exported. Of  course,

the  peak period of export will be December. In order

to  sustain the growth of this industry and  to  keep

ahead  of other competing countries, like Hawaii  and

South  Africa,  there  is need to  inject  scientific

methods into the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that, in contrast to the orchid trade,

the  stage of development in many other horticultural

crops  is  far behind, for instance, the  growing  of

fruits. We import more than 95 per cent of the fruits

consumed in Singapore. We have encouraged farmers  to

grow orchids. Some have done it with success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



But  success with orchid means that they abandon  the

growing  of  vegetables. I hope  that  satisfies  the

Member for Bukit Ho Swee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu was a little concerned

that  we  put our efforts into helping orchid growers

but  do  nothing for the farmers who  rear  pigs  and

chickens. I can assure him that this is not the case.

We have been helping farmers much longer than we have

been helping orchid growers. In fact, the Member will

be  interested to know that we have about one million

pigs in Singapore. This means we have one pig for two

persons.  One  million pigs on this small  island  is

quite a big number. We have millions of chickens.  We

export  chickens and eggs. But I am  ashamed  to  say

that we import three-quarters of our requirements  of

fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own view is that, had it not been for the efforts

of the Primary Production Department about a year ago

when  the swine fever epidemic was at its height,  we

would  have  lost  most  of  our  pigs.  The  Primary

Production Department sends out teams every  day  not

only  to  Jalan Kayu but also to Jurong. These  teams

help  the farmers not only in respect of disease  but

also provide them with better stock. This is what the

Sembawang Research Station does. They rear  pigs  and

sell  stud  boars to the farmers. I do not  think  it

would  be  right  to say that the Primary  Production

Department  is  concentrating on orchid  growers  and

forgetting the farmers who rear pigs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

What  I  was  saying  was that the export  facilities

might  well  be inadequate. As the Primary Production

Department   steps   up   its   extension   services,

productivity  goes up. We are going to  produce  more

and  more pigs. But the existing marketing facilities

might  well  be insufficient and we might finish  off

with  far too many pigs here. As a result, the  price

is  bound to go down. It is a question of supply  and

demand. So what benefits can the farmers expect? This

is an item on organisation for export.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps I heard him wrong. But at the

moment there is no organisation as far as the sale or

export  of pigs is concerned. The export of pigs  was

suspended for some time because of the swine fever in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the export of chickens and eggs, there have

been efforts by the Primary Production Department  to

help  farmers export eggs. The trouble is  that  some

farmers have cheated the importers. When you  have  a

combined  effort at exporting eggs, one  must  assure

the  foreign  importer that the eggs  are  good.  The

experience  of the Primary Production Department  has

been  that one or two rogues or scallywags  have  put

bad  eggs  into the boxes, with the result  that  the

importer   abroad  was  not  interested  further   in

importing  from Singapore. But we have got over  that

phase.  I  can  assure the Member that  whenever  the

price  of  eggs goes down, I have to answer questions

in  Parliament why we do not organise things  amongst

the  producers of eggs so that they can export  them.

And  when the price of eggs goes up, I have to answer

questions  in  Parliament  why  I  do  not  help  the

consumers in getting the price of eggs down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 206.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our stringent financial policy for

1969, it is gratifying and encouraging to note that a

substantial  sum of $250,000 is being set  aside  for

the  purpose of conducting an agricultural survey and

in the setting up of an Agricultural Statistics Unit.

The  purpose of my moving the amendment  is  to  seek

information relating to the formation of the proposed

Agricultural  Statistics  Unit.  Will  the   Minister

advise   the  House  whether  a  suitably   qualified

economist will be engaged to head the unit  and  also

when  and how it is proposed to carry out the survey?

May  I  suggest,  Sir,  that we should  perhaps  also

consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



engaging  the services of a sociologist so  that  not

only  the  economic but also the sociological  aspect

can be fully investigated during the survey?



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the rapid

urbanisation  and industrialisation of the  Republic,

there is an urgent need for comprehensive and forward

planning  in agricultural development in  order  that

this sector of the economy does not lag behind in its

contribution  to  national productivity.  The  modest

achievement  in  intensive  agriculture  and   animal

husbandry in recent years demonstrates that intensive

farming  can  play  some part in  our  economic  deve

lopment  and, with proper planning, it can supplement

considerably our efforts in industrialisation and the

development of trade and services. However, in  order

to   formulate   any  plans,  much   more   essential

information on agriculture and animal husbandry  than

the  present scanty information we have is  required.

It  is  proposed to set up an Agricultural Statistics

Unit  in the Primary Production Department to collect

data for the purpose of formulating plans for agricultural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, it is also proposed to conduct a nation-wide agricultural census apart from the licensing of

all  farmers engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry

and fisheries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed unit will be manned by highly qualified

personnel  with  academic and practical  training  in

statistical work. It will be responsible for planning

and  conducting  the  census,  sampling  surveys  and

market  research  on all aspects of animal,  fishery,

vegetable and horticultural production in the island.

When choosing the personnel, I will bear in mind  the

remarks of the Member for Jalan Kayu.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nation-wide

farm  licensing  campaign, which  was  launched   in

October  this  year, provided reliable and  essential

information on the existing structure of agriculture.

The  campaign  has  also enabled us  to  ensure  more

effective use of limited land resources for farming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



purposes. We can now eliminate some abuses by certain

people  seeking compensation and land  allocation  in

resettlement  cases under the guise of  farmers.  The

response  from the farming community to the licensing

campaign  was very encouraging, and Members  will  be

interested to know that a total of over 20,000  farms

have  been  licensed in the exercise. And  the  basic

information  obtained in the last  exercise  will  be

used  for  planning  and  designing  the  nation-wide

agricultural survey to be made next year.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I trust that the sum of $50,000 is to be spent

on research on hydroponics. I really do not know much

about  this subject. I shall be much obliged  if  the

Minister can give details.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, I suppose you too want to

know what the word "hydroponics" means!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to say something on this subhead. We  are

aware that flooding is a serious problem in the Bukit

Timah  area  and in my constituency.  The  people  in

these  areas have suffered great hardship.  Sometimes

they  are unable to sleep at night because they  fear

that they might be caught unawares by flooding. There

fore,  I urge the Minister to provide funds for flood

alleviation schemes and to instruct the Public  Works

Department  to  redouble their  efforts.  The  P.W.D.

should either raise the road level



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



or  deepen the drains in order to alleviate flooding.

In  particular, the monsoon drains in the Bukit Timah

Road  and Holland Road areas should be deepened. Only

then  will the people in my constituency be safe from

flooding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our country is said to be well known for its

wide  and  clean roads. But in the Bukit Timah  area,

flooding  takes place quite often. Malaysians  coming

down  from  West Malaysia are inconvenienced  because

they  make  frequent  use of Bukit  Timah  Road.  Our

Minister  also goes that way quite often  because  he

lives  in  my  constituency. I am sure he  knows  the

situation  quite well. I therefore urge  him  to  pay

attention to this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I answer the

Member  for Ulu Pandan first and then get on  to  the

technical  subject of hydroponics. I  would  like  to

assure him that I am paying attention to the question

of  flooding,  and  I  have paid  attention  to  this

question  ever  since September 1963. When  there  is

heavy   rain  which  coincides  with  a  high   tide,

especially  a  high spring tide in  Singapore,  Bukit

Timah gets flooded, which means the constituencies of

Tanglin  and Ulu Pandan get flooded. And  I  have  to

rescue  my  constituents,  just  as  the  Member   of

Parliament for Ulu Pandan has to rescue his. We  have

taken  measures  to alleviate, if not eradicate,  the

floods. Bukit Timah has been raised in parts by about

one  and  a  half to two feet. But this is  not  good

enough.  We are cutting two canals in this  area  and

one  in  the Member's constituency itself. One  canal

will  be cut from Bukit Timah Road to Ulu Pandan  and

another  canal from Bukit Timah Road to Kallang.  The

object  of  these  two canals is to drain  the  flood

waters  to Ulu Pandan and to the Kallang swamps.  The

Member  will realise that the cutting of these canals

is  quite  a  big  matter. If he goes  round  to  his

constituency,  he  will  see the  construction  of  a

canal.  That is quite a big job. In fact,  there  are

several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



contractors with different contracts doing  the  work

in several parts. But I am afraid we will have to put

up  with  the floods next year. By 1970, both  canals

will have been completed and the floods in Ulu Pandan

will be alleviated, if not eradicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can go on to hydroponics, I confess I too know

little  about  this  subject. I am  told  hydroponics

means  soilless culture or the art of growing  plants

without  soil  in  water impregnated with  chemicals.

Hydroponics has been employed in the study  of  plant

physiology  for many years and has been adopted  more

recently by commercial and amateur growers as a means

of  producing  crops of high yields  and  quality  at

lower  cost.  It  has been successfully  experimented

with   in  growing  all  kinds  of  vegetable  crops,

particularly in Israel, Japan and South Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the experts, hydroponics has the

following  advantages. Higher yields than  in  normal

farming due to better nutrient and water control.  In

South  Africa,  apparently, yields of over  20  times

those obtained in ordinary soil have been obtained in

vermiculite  culture.  Less labour  is  required.  In

Japan, for example, the labour required is only  half

of  that of normal farming. Secondly, less wastage of

water  and  fertilisers and freedom  from  soil-borne

diseases.  Further, hydroponics is  not  affected  by

soil conditions and any land, whether eroded or hilly

or  tidal  swamp unsuited to normal farming,  can  be

used in the hydroponics system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hydroponics project requires the construction of

concrete   tanks   or  other  types  of   structures,

irrigation and feeding systems, shade and, of course,

offices-cum-store  rooms. Laboratory  facilities  for

chemical  analysis must also be available. These  are

being  set  up in the Sembawang Research Station  for

which a sum of $50,000 is required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In due course, it is hoped that if the research

succeeds, what is learnt at the Research Station will

be  communicated  to our farmers  in  the  hope  that

production  in Singapore can be increased  with  less

labour and cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point of query. If my memory

serves  me  right,  I  did make  a  query  about  the

possibility  of  replacing the  present  tuberculosis

wards  in  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital with new  construction.  I  think the Minister said that  there  was  a

scheme  to  replace these wards. Can I be enlightened

by him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the question put by  the  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens presumably refers to Wards Nos.  12

and 13 of Tan Tock Seng Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



These wards are above ground level  and  have

numerous windows and doors. The ventilation  is  good

and  the height of the ceilings is above 14 feet. The

wards have corrugated asbestos fittings and doors. It

will  appear  that  the  wards  referred  to  are  in

generally good condition and there is no proposal  at

the  moment  to  replace them with new buildings.  In

future,  these  wards  will  be  replaced  with   new

buildings  to  serve  the  changing  needs   of   the

hospital.  However, at the moment, they are providing

good  service to patients and are in no way  inferior

to comparable wards in other hospitals in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a revote of $100,000 for improvement to

beaches.  You will recall, Sir, that when  this  item

was  discussed in this House in 1966, I urged the Government  to  build  beach  resorts  and  recreational

amenities near the seaside for our citizens and  also

to  attract tourists. The Minister for Social Affairs

gave his assurance in this House that he proposed  to

start off with a pilot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



project  at Changi beach, and if it proved  to  be  a

success,  similar projects would be  carried  out  at

other  beaches  in the island. His statement  can  be

found  in Hansard, No. 13 of Volume 25, column  1015,

dated 20th December, 1966. The same subject was again

discussed  on 20th December, 1967, during the  debate

in  Committee of Supply on the Development  Estimates

for  1968.  I was then very dissatisfied  because  no

thing had taken place during 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility for improvement to beaches at

that  time  was transferred to the Tourist  Promotion

Board  which  was  under  the  Ministry  of  Law  and

National  Development.  The  Minister  for  Law   and

National  Development  again  told  the  House   that

several major as well as minor schemes to offer  both

simple and sophisticated seaside facilities had  been

prepared    and    the   Government   had    accepted

responsibility  to  assist  with  the  infrastructure

necessary  to  make these schemes possible.  He  then

assured  the  House that 1968 would see  cleaner  and

more  attractive beaches. His statement can be  found

in  Hansard, No. 14 of Volume 26, column  966,  dated

20th December, 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Development Estimates for 1969-70 now under discussion, you will find that this item comes under the Ministry of Health and the same amount is revoted for the third time. The responsibility to develop and improve our beaches has changed hands two times -- from the Ministry of

Social  Affairs to the Ministry of Law  and  National

Development and now to the Ministry of Health. What I

do  not understand, Sir, is that why, during a  lapse

of  two  years, no beach resorts have been  developed

according to plan. Is this project considered  to  be

of low priority as compared with other projects? Sir,

I can predict that no development will take place now

that  the  Ministry of Health is in  charge  of  this

project.  Surely  the Public Health Division  is  not

expected  to develop the beaches except to clean  and

tidy them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to give his comments

on this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Mountbatten is correct in saying that the  "buck"  is

now  with the Ministry of Health. We have taken  this

responsibility, but solely to keep the beaches clean.

As  far  as this subhead is concerned, it has nothing

to  do  with  building  or improving  beach  resorts.

Perhaps  I  may take this opportunity  to  give  some

facts  to  the Member for Mountbatten.  They  are  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board, which since last year

has   been   charged  with  the  responsibility   for

improvement of beaches, let out on contract in  March

this year the work of cleaning the beaches at Changi,

Loyang  and  Pasir Ris in Singapore island,  and  the

beaches in 12 smaller islands around Singapore.  This

contract  is  still in force and will continue  until

March  1969.  In  November, the Ministry  of  Health,

after consultation with the Ministry of Finance,  was

charged  with  the responsibility for  cleansing  and

maintenance  of these beaches. The present  contract,

which will be allowed to run its full term till March

1969,  essentially covers only, as I have  said,  the

cleansing  and  maintenance aspects of beach  improve

ment in the areas referred to, which include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) clearing and cleansing of beaches and the

beach area;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) clearing and cleansing of parks and open

spaces used for rest and recreation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) cutting grass, trimming trees, shrubs and

hedges;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) removal of refuse from dustbins placed on

the  beaches  and  in the islands  in  the  Malay

kampongs off Changi beach;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) cleaning of all lavatories, bathrooms and

maintaining these in a sanitary condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately half of this vote, that is, $48,500 is

expected  to  be  spent this year  to  reimburse  the

Tourist  Promotion Board for the sum it has paid  out

to  the contractor since March this year. The balance

will be available for use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



in  1969 and it will be utilised essentially for  the

same  purpose,  that  is, cleansing  and  maintaining

these  beaches. Fresh tenders will be called in March

1969  on  expiry  of  the present contract.  This  is

considered  to  be more economical and  operationally

more   feasible  than  undertaking  the   task   with

departmental labour.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of other developments of the

beaches, such as the construction of beach resorts  -

as   stated  by  the  Member  for  Mountbatten - this

responsibility will not devolve upon the Ministry  of

Health.  It is, however, understood that there  is  a

Facilitations  Committee  comprising  representatives

from   various  Government  authorities   under   the

chairmanship  of  the  Chairman,  Tourist   Promotion

Board,  which is making recommendations to the  Board

on  schemes for developing and improving beaches  and

beach resorts. It is further understood that a number

of  such  schemes  have  been  submitted  by  various

interested  parties  and that  these  are  now  being

considered  by  the  Board. This is  the  information

which  I have got with the compliments of the Tourist

Promotion Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as our responsibility is

concerned in respect of keeping the beaches clean,

I assure  the Member for Mountbatten that they will

be kept clean.
