were  appointed Ministers?  So was Parliament not already  in

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and   Industry  if  he  has  any  plans  to  accelerate   the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



the pipeline of the various Ministries, as a means to provide

more  opportunities for local businesses and indirectly  more

employment opportunities for Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would

like  to answer Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 together as they

are on the same issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Thank you. The Singapore

economy  shrank by 0.8% in the second quarter, following  the

weaker  external environment.  The slow-down  is  more  rapid

than what we had earlier expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the major economies have slowed sharply. US growth

in the first quarter was revised downwards significantly from

the  initial  estimate of 2% to 1.2%, as companies  run  down

inventories  at a much faster pace.  The EU has  also  slowed

significantly while the Japanese economy is near or may be in

recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the global electronics industry has

deteriorated  even  more  sharply in  the  last  few  months.

Global semiconductor sales fell by 29% in April and May, down

from -4.4% in the first quarter this year and +22% growth  in

the  fourth  quarter  of  last year.   For  the  whole  year,

industry analysts at Gartner Dataquest expect the industry to

shrink by 20% to 25%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative environment has a large impact on

Singapore's growth as external demand accounts for 80% of our

total  demand.  In particular, our manufacturing  sector  has

declined by 10.9% in May, and is expected to remain  weak  in

the  second half.  Export-oriented services have also  slowed

as  demand  from regional economies fell.  We have  therefore

revised our growth forecast this year down to 0.5% to 1.5%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect unemployment to worsen. The number of

workers  retrenched rose sharply to about 3,200 in the  first

quarter of this year, up from an average of 1,900 in the last

three  quarters of 2000.  We expect more retrenchment in  the

second half of the year as companies, which were holding onto

workers in anticipation of a quick turnaround, begin to  shed

off  workers.   Already, we have seen more companies  putting

their  workers  on  shorter work-week and  compulsory  leave.

There  has also been a significant fall in job advertisements

in  recent months.  Anecdotally, I think all of us would have

heard  or  received feedback from friends and relatives  that

there is a fear that they may lose their jobs because of  the

retrenchment that they see going on around them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the sharper than expected downturn, the

Government  intends  to implement some specific  measures  to

cushion  its impact on companies and workers.  However,  this

will  not be like the $10 billion package in 1998.  The  1998

package  was necessary to restore Singapore's competitiveness

following   the   Asian  financial  crisis  and   the   sharp

devaluation of regional currencies.  The current downturn  is

a  cyclical  slowdown  caused by a severe  drop  in  external

demand,   especially  in  electronics.   We  are  encouraging

Ministries  to  speed up their development projects,  but  we

should be realistic that such pump priming would only  be  of

marginal benefit; leakage is high and it would not be able to

offset the drastic fall in external demand.  The objective of

the  measures  we are working on this time  is  to  ease  the

burden on businesses and workers, while we await the recovery

of the US economy and the global electronics industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the 1998 package is still in place, as some of

the cost-cutting measures in that package have not been fully

lifted.   This includes the 4% point reduction in  employers'

CPF  contribution, the cut in foreign worker levies, and  JTC

and HDB rental rebates.  In addition, at the last Budget, the

Minister  for  Finance  lowered corporate  and  property  tax

rates, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



introduced   various  rebates  and  CPF   top-ups   to   help

individuals and workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are finalising the new measures. I expect to

announce them to this House at the end of the month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

Minister  mentioned that this problem is cyclical in  nature.

I would like to ask the Minister whether this could, in fact,

lead  to  more severe structural problems as there  could  be

more hollowing out of our economy, and therefore lead to more

severe unemployment and retrenchment than earlier expected.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The structural shifts have

been  going on for some time.  This is the reason why we have

been  pressing on with investing in R&D and worker upgrading.

Part of the reason is, of course, the emergence of China into

the  global  market.  And as hundreds of millions of  Chinese

workers who are hardworking and not without ability join  the

global  labour  market, there will be downward wage  pressure

all  around.  Those who are unable to upgrade find themselves

under great pressure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in India, Chinese consumer products are

really  cutting  the ground from under Indian  manufacturers.

When  I  spoke to the Vietnamese Trade Minister recently,  he

was  quite  worried about the way Chinese products  are  fast

entering the Vietnamese market.  They told me that a  Chinese

motorcycle with as good or better quality cost only one-third

of  a  Vietnamese motorcycle.   And we see this now all over,

how  Chinese  products are lowering the cost of clothing,  of

handbags,  of  all kinds of things.  All over Singapore  now,

you  are  seeing sprouting up $2 stores and they are carrying

mostly Chinese products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this keeps cost down, this also presents

challenges to some of the industry sectors.  So the only  way

for  us to maintain our high wage levels in Singapore  is  to

press  on  with  the  education of  our  young,  with  worker

training  and  upgrading,  improving  system  efficiency  and

investing in R&D.  And if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



continue to do that, we should be able to hold our own in the

sectors  that we are very good at.  For example, if you  look

at  the  wafer fabs, I think we remain very competitive,  and

there  are  a  number  of investments on  stream,  they  will

probably be delayed, but I think our basic competitiveness in

semi-conductors remains unchanged.  For disk drives, we  face

a  challenge,  and  the more labour intensive  lines  we  are

losing  to  Penang  and China.  But last year,  when  Seagate

decided to close down its disk drive operation in Penang  and

shed off 5,000 workers, they reconfigured their production so

that  the  labor intensive portions went to Wuxi and Shenzhen

in China, while the higher value-added and the more automated

bits  were  reconcentrated in Singapore, where we  have  been

helping  them  to  build the 'factory of the  future',  which

means  highly  automated lines, you design a product  with  a

view  to producing it, and therefore enabling you to automate

many of the processes.   So sector after sector, we have  got

to  keep  on pushing on with restructuring and ensuring  that

despite  competition from other countries,  we  are  able  to

maintain our high wage levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cyclical downturn may accentuate the process but we

should not mix up the two separate tendencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a

perception in the market that pump priming and other measures

to  boost domestic demand may help offset some of the  impact

of  the negative external demand.  The Minister has explained

why he does not think this might work.  Could he elaborate on

this so that everybody will have a better understanding?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the low end of Government's

forecast of 0.5% for GDP growth this year is very similar  to

that  which Singapore experienced in 1998 which prompts  many

to  ask  the  question why a similar order  of  magnitude  of

Government off-Budget measures is not warranted.   Could  the

Minister please elaborate?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We had 4.6% growth for the

first  quarter.  Flash estimate for second quarter is  -0.8%.

If  we  anticipate 1% at the end of the year, that means  for

the  remaining  six  months, for  the  second  half,  we  are

anticipating  the  economy to be  flat.   And  0.5%  to  1.5%

projection  for the whole year means that we are anticipating

the  second half to be somewhere in between -1% and +1%.  The

following  quarter,  we  expect  the  downturn  to   continue

because, if you look at non-oil retained imports, which is  a

pretty good indicator of what is going to happen in the  next

one to three months, it remains sharply negative, -16% or 17%

last month.  So there is near certainty that the next quarter

will  remain  negative.   But when it  comes  to  the  fourth

quarter, we are not sure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you listen to the American Treasury Secretary, he

said  he  is  quite confident that the US would  be  able  to

achieve  2%  in  the fourth quarter which means  that  things

would begin to look up then.  Stanley Fischer of the IMF made

similar noises.  And there are some indications that consumer

confidence has picked up, that orders have begun to show more

life.  So we are not sure what the fourth quarter would  look

like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we should not be unduly optimistic, we should also

not  be excessively pessimistic.  If you look on the horizon,

yes,  there  are  dark  clouds, but  there  are  also  silver

linings.   If you ask me where we are at now - I do not  want

to  go into the details of the package because that would  be

announced  when they have been finalised at the  end  of  the

month  -  it  is  obviously raining, and the  rain  will  get

heavier.   This is not a passing shower.  But we  should  not

assume that it is going to be a full-blown thunder storm.  It

may  not  be.  We should get our umbrellas ready and  try  to

stay  as dry as possible, but keep watch on the weather.   If

it gets worse, then we have got to do more, but respond in  a

measured  way,  in a calibrated way, and look,  even  in  the

darkest  cloud,  for silver linings which  may  open  up  new

opportunities  for  us,  which means  not  slowing  down  our

restructuring because of the problems we are facing, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



pressing on so that when the weather clears up again, we will

be well positioned and we will be ahead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, with the scenario just painted and the forecast on value

added,  factories  of  the future, and so  forth,  could  the

Minister reflect on the future of SMEs in Singapore  to  face

such competition?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, SMEs

will  face  a  challenge because those who are in traditional

industries  will face the cold wind of competition.   If  you

look around the housing estates, many of our small shops  are

facing  severe challenges because the supermarkets,  the  big

departmental  stores, the franchisees  are  coming  in.   For

those  who  are  unable to upgrade, partly because  they  are

getting  on  in years and their children are not prepared  to

take  over their parents' businesses, or because of bad luck,

or  because of inertia, then we have a package which MND  had

announced  recently to help them exit.   For  those  who  are

prepared to try, we will make every effort to help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now looking at how we may want to reorganise PSB

and   TDB   to  give  a  stronger  focus  to  entrepreneurial

development,  especially among our SMEs.  For those  who  are

prepared  to  try,  there  will  be  all  kinds  of  packages

available  to  help them along.  And those who  have  decided

that  they  want to call it a day, I think we will help  them

exit.   But this varies from sector to sector.  We have  many

discussions with various sectors and there are some who  have

done  well, despite all the problems.  If you look  at,  say,

the  food industry, it is quite interesting the way the  food

industry is being restructured now.  A lot of the otak  otak,

nasi lemak and fishball that we are getting in the shops  now

are  all  made  in factories.  It is a very efficient  supply

chain.   And  there  are others who are unable  to  make  the

adjustment,  so  they  go  through  a  prolonged  period   of

difficulty.   But  this is a large subject,  we  have  talked

about  it,  and we will continue to talk about it.   We  will

institute in the coming months more programmes to help SMEs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, does the Minister see

any  possibility  at all in helping to attract  some  of  the

companies  to  remain in Singapore, ie, companies  which  are

likely to move over to other countries which offer lower cost

structure,  or  attract some of these companies  to  come  to

Singapore?  I ask this because there could be people who, for

some  reason,  could  only  take up very  rudimentary  skills

through all the schemes that we offer.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> In fact, we work very hard on

this.   When  companies indicate that they have  difficulties

with  their  cost structure and are thinking  of  relocating,

usually they alert EDB and we will try and sit down with them

to  work  out a package to help them restructure and  try  to

facilitate their remaining on in Singapore.  And even if they

have got to leave Singapore, we will try to encourage them to

leave   behind  in  Singapore  the  higher  value   elements.

Sometimes,  we succeed, but not always.  But we have  got  to

keep  working  at  this  and provide  an  environment  which,

despite  higher  labour costs and higher land  costs,  yields

greater system efficiency.  And one area in which we  have  a

clear  advantage  is the fact that we provide  a  hassle-free

environment.  We tell them, at the outset, that we will  make

sure  that  they are able to find the skills that  they  need

and,   if  these skills are not available in Singapore,  they

can  import  them  from anywhere in the  world  in  order  to

maintain their operation here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one further advantage which should become more

and  more important in the coming years, which is the way  we

protect  intellectual property rights and provide  for  their

enforcement.  This involves the judiciary, the AG's Chambers,

the  police,  the whole infrastructure.  It would  eventually

extend  into  the life sciences.  And if we can be  the  most

secure  base in Asia for intellectual property, then I  think

many  of the higher value activities will remain here.  Take,

for  instance, Glaxo.  They set up a factory in Suzhou  which

had   to  be  mothballed  because  of  intellectual  property

problems  in  China.  It will take a long time for  China  to

work through all the laws and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



enforcement  procedures.  But in the meantime, if  they  have

got  something sensitive, if they have got secrets to protect

and  if they have got particular codes which contain most  of

the  value  of the product, they will put them in  Singapore.

And  the key is running a system which is efficient, a labour

market which is highly flexible and an access to talent which

is  global.   This is very important.  Then  when  they  come

here, they will be assured.  No businessman wants to plonk  a

significant investment in a place where, after they have  put

in  the money, they face all kinds of obstacles and have  got

to fight them at every turn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

spoken  about  the rising unemployment and he expects  it  to

rise  further.   May  I  ask the Minister  what  message  his

Government  has got at the moment for workers who  are  being

retrenched, or has the Government got no message at all,  and

particularly,  is the Government prepared  to  see  that  our

workers  are not retrenched first before foreign workers  are

retrenched,  which  is  a step that is  being  taken  by  the

Malaysian government?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all of

us, as Members of Parliament, meet our voters and in the last

few months, we could sense the change in the economic climate

on  the  ground.  At our meet-the-people sessions, many  more

are   coming  forward  either  with  financial  difficulties,

worried  about  their  jobs, or have lost  their  jobs.   The

problem is not yet very serious.  But we are beginning to see

it  and  it  is likely to become more serious in  the  coming

months.   I would say our response must be on a broad  front.

First,  make  sure  that  the  children's  education  is  not

affected.  I believe we have a whole slew of scholarships and

bursaries available to make sure that they are looked  after.

With  health care, housing, the basics, the safety  net  will

always be there.  Then those who are without jobs, how do  we

help  them retrain?  MOM has got a labour exchange.  We  have

all  kinds  of  programmes available to help  those  who  are

prepared  to be reskilled to be reskilled.   But there  is  a

particular problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



among  older Singaporeans, particularly those who are  above,

say,  45-50 years old.  In difficulties, sometimes  they  are

the  first to be retrenched, usually they are the last to  be

taken back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, just last night, one of my constituents came to

see me, a 50-year old diabetic who has an MBA and he asked me

whether  I could help get his CPF out because he said  he  is

finding  it difficult to get a job because companies want  to

hire younger people.  If you have diabetes, they said, "Well,

we  have  to incur health care cost looking after you  if  we

take  you on."  I told him that it is not likely that CPF  is

going  to  allow him to take out his money.  But at the  same

time,  I  sympathise with him.  So we have got to be specific

and where we can help, we should help, make sure the children

are looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Government create jobs? I think we have got to

think  harder about this, whether there are not some  service

jobs  which we can provide in the public sector later to soak

up  some  of  them.  They represent a group  of  people  who,

because  they  grew up in an earlier era, have  not  had  the

education.   Above  the  age of 45,  less  than  one  in  two

Singaporeans have more than six years of education.  So  when

we   run   into   the  new  economy,  they  face   particular

difficulties and we have got to think through in  a  sensible

way  how  to help them.  If we just give them money  to  help

them  by, that will be ameliorative but, I think, as a group,

they  will  be demoralised.  We must find a creative  way  to

engage  them  because they are intelligent,  hardworking  and

responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very surprised meeting old colleagues from the army

who are now working in our schools as administrators.  In the

army, because we want to keep our NCOs and officers young, we

retire  them early with golden handshakes.  Many of them  end

up  working as administrative officers in schools.  For them,

running  a  school is nothing compared to running a battalion

or    company.    And   the   teachers   are   spared   those

responsibilities.  Maybe there are other areas  in  which  we

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



think  of similar useful schemes so that those who are unable

to  upgrade  themselves  sufficiently  can  still  have  good

employment.   It  is  a complex problem.   And  I  think  all

Ministries  and economic agencies would have to think  harder

how  to  address  this problem.  It is a problem  which  goes

beyond this economic downturn.  It is a structural problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> I would like

to  ask  the  Minister whether the proposals his Ministry  is

working   on   would   incorporate   the   speeding   up   of

infrastructural projects.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Yes, that is the natural

course   of   action  to  take.   But  we  have  speeded   up

infrastructure  projects  as  a  result  of  the  last  Asian

financial crisis.  So if you look at the latest numbers, even

though  the construction industry has not gone negative,  the

reason  is  that  it  is being propped up  by  public  sector

spending.  In fact, private sector construction spending  has

gone down into the negative.  We are now reviewing in various

Ministries  whether we can bring forward some projects  in  a

sensible  way.  We should not be doing what repeated Japanese

administrations have done, which is just to pump  prime  and,

in  the  end, waste resources.  I do not think we  should  do

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> The Minister mentioned

earlier  about  some specific programmes  to  help  ease  the

burden  of workers and companies.  I would like to know  when

these programmes will be introduced because timing is of  the

essence here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, talking about children, I would like to ask

the  Minister whether he sees it appropriate now to  be  more

generous with helping families cope with some of the problems

with  their  children.  For example,  I  am  alerted  to  the

Straits Times' project for the School Pocket Fund.  It  shows

a  lot of demand.  So should the Government not put money  to

help  children  cope with some of these problems  that  their

parents may face?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, the details of the

package  will  be  announced at the end of the  month,  so  I

should not go into those details now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to programmes to retrain workers and upgrade them,

many  are  already  in  place.  We will  have  to  give  more

emphasis and, if we need to allocate more funds, we will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for helping children with scholarships and bursaries,

there  are  already so many in place, and many of us  in  the

various  constituencies have funds which are  available.   So

when  we hear of cases which are deserving of help, we should

let the MP or the CCC Chairman know and I am quite sure those

funds will be found.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, last question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am afraid the Minister has not

answered my question fully.  But, particularly, I would  like

to   know   what   is  the  Government's  message   regarding

retrenchment,  as  between  Singapore  workers  and   foreign

workers.  Would the Minister answer that?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would

like  to  apologise to Mr Jeyaretnam for not  answering  that

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a temptation in an economic downturn to

say  "out first with the foreign workers and protect the jobs

for Singaporeans."  I would caution against such an instinct.

The reason why we are attractive to many foreign investors is

because  of  the assurance we give them, that  if  they  need

workers,  talent, engineers, cartoonists and accountants,  if

they  cannot find them in Singapore, they can bring them  in.

And,  for  this reason, we run a liberal regime.   If  in  an

economic  downturn, we suddenly say, "Well, you are  foreign,

you  go  out first" even though he may be doing a  good  job,

this  will  unravel  a reputation that we have  painstakingly

built up over the years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two days ago, the CEO of Shell Gas came to see me,

thinking  of setting up an operation in Singapore for  global

solutions to various industries, particularly the oil and gas

industry.    He  has  his  reservations  about   some   other

countries.  I told him, "Do not worry.  You do what you  have

to do in the region.  But what you need in Singapore, we will

provide.   If  you need talent, you bring  them  in."   If  a

company  has  to shed off workers, we should let the  company

decide  whom to shed off.  We are already protecting our  own

local  workers  through the foreign worker levy  and  by  the

quota  requirement  that  a  certain  percentage  has  to  be

Singaporean workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, if we over protect Singaporeans, will we

win?   I  do  not think we will win, because what would  then

happen is that investments will leave Singapore to where they

can access workers at internationally competitive wage rates.

Recently, a group of us was talking to a Singapore doctor who

has worked many years in America.  In American hospitals now,

doctors  no longer clerk their own case sheets.  They  go  to

the  nearest phone, they call up a number, they dictate,  and

it   goes   to  India,  where  there  is  a  whole  bank   of

transcribers.  And they are very smart.  They  know  all  the

medical  terms, drugs, diseases, medical conditions and,  the

following  day, via the Internet, it appears on the  doctor's

screen, he makes his amendments and it is recorded.  In other

words,  in  the  coming years, no sector  can  be  protected,

because  the  moment you try to protect it, it raises  costs,

and investors having choices will move somewhere else.  So it

is  better that we stare the problem in the eyes and make the

adjustment.   The  key  is:  stay  competitive,  continue  to

attract  investments in, and we will be all  right.   And  we

will be all right.

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  if  he  will  give (i) an  update  of  the  current

unemployment situation and the outlook ahead and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



(ii) an evaluation of the accessibility and effectiveness  of

the  current career development and retraining programmes  in

raising  labour productivity and in helping Singaporeans  who

have been retrenched and those likely to be displaced due  to

the  continuing  economic slowdown and spate of  mergers  and

acquisitions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower,  given  the  current  economic  climate,  will  his

Ministry  consider  encouraging  local  employers   to   give

priority to employing Singaporeans who can perform equivalent

jobs, including our healthy elderly, rather than to resort to

engaging foreign employees too readily.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I take Question  Nos.

6 and 7 together, because they are in some way related?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the seasonally adjusted

unemployment rate in March 2001 was 2.4%. This was lower than

the  2.9%  in  December  2000. However,  the  improvement  in

unemployment  is expected to be short-lived as  the  economic

slowdown has triggered a sharp increase in retrenchments  and

a  drop  in  job vacancies.  The number of workers retrenched

rose  sharply to 3,248 in the first quarter of this year from

the  quarterly average of 1,900 registered in the last  three

quarters  of  2000.   Retrenchment in the second  quarter  is

expected to be higher, based on notifications by companies to

my  Ministry  in  recent  months.   At  the  same  time,  job

vacancies  fell significantly from 26,182 in  March  2000  to

19,755  in March this year.  Vacancy rate, ie, the number  of

vacancies,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  total  manpower

demand,  also fell from 2.7% in March 2000 to 1.9%  in  March

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seasonally adjusted job vacancies to unemployed

persons ratio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



fell  to  0.76 (ie, there are only 76 job openings for  every

100 job seekers) in March of this year from a higher level of

1.14  in September 2000.  Today, there are simply fewer  jobs

than  there are job seekers.  Also, the entry of this  year's

cohort  of  tertiary graduates into the labour market  around

this time is likely to aggravate the labour market situation.

They  are  going to find it a little bit harder to  find  the

jobs that they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the labour market is softening, jobs are still

being created.  There are still unfilled vacancies in the job

market,  especially in the services sector.  My Ministry  has

expanded   existing   employment  assistance   and   training

programmes,  and  will also initiate new programmes  to  fill

these vacancies.  Let me give two examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help the lower skilled workers raise their skill

level, the Ministry has been working with NTUC to extend  the

reach  of  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP).   Last

year,  some 20,000 workers were trained under the SRP.   This

was  about 40% higher than the figure achieved in  1999.   Mr

Ong  asked about the effectiveness of such programmes.  In  a

survey  conducted last year, 70% of employers  reported  that

workers  who  underwent  the Skills  Redevelopment  Programme

training had become more productive in their jobs, while  80%

indicated  that  their  workers had become  more  employable.

70%  of  workers felt more confident of handling more complex

job  responsibilities and seeking re-employment after the SRP

training.   Among  the unemployed workers who  underwent  SRP

training, three out of four managed to find a new job  within

three to six months after training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, my Ministry also set up a career

centre,  CareerLink@mom, to provide Singaporeans with  better

access  to employment and training opportunities.  We receive

about  1,600 visits each month.  More than two-thirds of  the

visitors  who  had  responded to  the  centre's  first  three

quarterly  surveys indicated that they were  better  informed

about job choices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



and  training opportunities after using the services  at  the

centre.   Among those who were actively looking  for  a  job,

more  than 20% had found employment within three months, some

through the centre's assistance, and others through their own

efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming months, more employers and workers

will  be  affected by the economic downturn as  well  as  the

restructuring which is taking place in some sectors.  We will

help affected employers and workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we will work with the NTUC, the Productivity

and  Standards Board, and other organisations to  train  even

more  workers.   This will not only enhance the employability

and  capabilities of workers, but will also enable  employers

to  seize opportunities when the economy recovers.   We  will

deepen  and broaden existing initiatives, including  the  SRP

and  the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme (SMCP),  and

also introduce new programmes.  Just last month, for example,

we  launched  the National IT Literacy Training Programme  to

help workers acquire basic computer and Internet skills which

will  enhance their employment prospects.  Where appropriate,

we  will provide additional incentives to make training  more

affordable  to  employers and employees or to those  who  are

unemployed during these difficult times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will encourage more companies not to

downsize   too   quickly   but   to   try   alternatives   to

retrenchments.  Affected companies can put their  workers  on

voluntary pay-cut, shorter work-weeks or make use of the  SRP

to send redundant workers for full-time skills upgrading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise, however, that some companies would have no

choice  but  to  retrench workers.   If  necessary,  we  will

organise  job fairs and other employment facilitation  events

as  we  had  done two years ago in 1998, during the  economic

crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be harder for older and less educated retrenched

workers to find new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



jobs,  especially in totally new sectors or  industries.   To

help   them  make  the  transition,  we  are  considering   a

traineeship programme to help older workers.  The idea is  to

help employers to recruit such retrenched workers to ease the

transition to a new industry sector and work environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, the success of our efforts will

also  depend  on  the  willingness of unemployed  workers  to

upgrade  their  skills and to adapt to a more  difficult  job

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his other question, let me explain that

our  foreign manpower policy is to maintain a controlled  and

revolving   pool   of   unskilled   foreign   workers   while

facilitating   the   recruitment  of   global   talents   and

professionals.  Hence, for unskilled foreign workers on  work

permits,  we  have control mechanisms, such  as  the  foreign

worker  levy and dependency ceiling, to ensure that employers

do  not become over-reliant on foreign workers at the expense

of local workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even in an economic downturn, as my colleague,

the  Minister  for  Trade and Industry, had  already  touched

upon,  we  cannot  totally deny employers access  to  foreign

workers  or  require them to fill vacancies with  only  local

workers.   This is because there are companies  with  genuine

needs for foreign workers to perform jobs that locals do  not

have the skills for, or jobs which many local workers are not

prepared  to  do.   Direct  intervention  beyond  the   broad

controls  will  only result in hardship for these  companies.

This  could prompt them to relocate to neighbouring countries

where  it  is easier to recruit workers at much lower  wages.

As a consequence, instead of saving jobs for Singaporeans, we

will end up losing more jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of highly skilled workers, we should not

prevent  employers  from recruiting the global  talents  that

they  need.   Even as we ride the downturn, we must  bear  in

mind that the availability of skilled workers will be the key

to future



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



success  in  competition.  Talents will be critical  for  our

long-term  viability.  If we make it difficult for  companies

to  meet their skilled manpower needs, our attractiveness  as

an  open  business-friendly location will diminish.   Closing

the  door  to global talents now will send a wrong signal  to

the  people whom we are trying to attract, and it will do  us

harm in the long term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will help local workers with upgrading and skills

conversion programmes which I have mentioned earlier on in my

reply  to the hon. Member's first question.  These programmes

will  be  broadened and enhanced to help, in particular,  the

older workers.  The best way to help in a downturn is to  arm

our  people  with the skills which they will need  to  remain

employable in a changing job market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Minister  to  tell us what is the success rate in  persuading

employers   to   look   at  alternatives  to   retrenchments,

particularly the use of a flexible wage system?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I think employers are quite

amenable  to this suggestion.  We have teams that go  out  to

talk  to employers who come to us and tell us that they  have

difficulty  and  they  may  have  to  lay  off  workers.    I

understand that, at least in the unionised sector, there  are

already  about 30,000 workers who are on such alternative-to-retrenchment programmes, either voluntary pay-cut or  shorter

work-week or some other form of adjustment, including sending

workers  who  are  due for retrenchment  or  who  are  facing

retrenchment to full-time Skills Redevelopment Programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I would say that employers are cooperative

and  they will try to help wherever possible.  But, as I have

said in my answer, there will always be those companies which

are  facing  such  enormous difficulties that  they  have  no

recourse but to let people go.  We will step



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



in to help those workers who are released to find alternative

jobs.   But it also means that these retrenched workers  have

to  be more realistic and they have to be prepared to take on

jobs  in different sectors.  They may be required to take  on

jobs  which they have not done before.  It is here  where  we

will step in to help them to acquire the new skills that they

need to do those jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in the new economy, in the face

of   restructuring  and  relocation  of  companies  to  other

countries,   these  could  be  people  who  may  find   great

difficulties  in  getting a job, for one reason  or  another.

There  could  be people who would be deemed as  unemployable.

Who are they?  What is the current estimated number of people

who  could  be considered as unemployable?  Do we expect  the

number  to  increase as a result of this  downturn  and  what

would   the  Ministry  do  to  help  these  workers  to   get

alternative jobs?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member that as

the   economy  restructures  and  also  with  this   cyclical

downturn,  we may see more and more workers having difficulty

finding  re-employment when they lose their jobs.   One  main

reason  would be that these workers may not have  the  skills

that  are required for the new jobs.  Very often, it  is  the

older  workers  who face this problem, ie, workers  with  low

education,  perhaps  in  their  late  40s,  who   have   this

difficulty  of  finding  an alternative  job.   Even  if  the

economy slows down to the lower end of the estimate of  about

half  percent  for  the  whole year, we  do  not  expect  the

retrenchment  figure  to  exceed  the  number  that  we  have

experienced   in   1998  when  about  29,000   workers   were

retrenched.  As to the number of workers who are at  risk,  I

think it will be much less than in 1998.  We expect our whole

year  retrenchment to be around 20,000, which is already much

more than what it was last year, at 11,600.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what we can do to help this group of workers, we

should  not think of them as totally unemployable.  They  may

have greater difficulty looking for jobs, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



I  believe that even the lower educated older worker can make

a contribution provided the worker himself is willing to also

make an effort.  As I have explained earlier on, we have many

programmes that can help him to acquire a skill to take on  a

job  in  a different sector.  He may not have the ability  to

upgrade his skills in the sector that he has been working in,

for  instance,  in  the electronics industry,  where  we  are

seeing  the majority of the retrenchments taking  place.   He

may  not have the ability to upgrade his skills to do the job

in  the  new  type of manufacturing industry where  he  would

require   sophisticated  computer  skills  to  operate   very

sophisticated  production equipment.  But, certainly,  he  or

she  can  be  trained for a job in the services sector.   And

today,  we  still  have quite a number of  vacancies  in  the

services sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned some weeks ago, in one exercise that we

carried out, we managed to find employers who could offer  us

400  vacancies.   So  workers who  are  retrenched  from  the

manufacturing  sector need not be deemed  unemployable.  They

have  temporarily  lost their jobs.   We  can  help  them  to

acquire  a skill to move into the services sector.   We  hope

that they would take up this offer and come forward.  We will

help  to  retrain them so that they can take on this job  and

minimise  the  trauma or difficulties that the  family  would

face with prolonged unemployment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, has the Government spent money

to  train  foreign  workers or to  upgrade  their  skills  in

preference to local workers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, most of our investment in skills

upgrading  and  training  goes  to  the  local  workers.  The

priority  in  all  our  retraining programmes  is  for  local

workers.  I have said this many times before in this  Chamber

that  we  encourage our employers to recruit foreign  workers

who  are  already capable of doing the job,  rather  than  to

bring  unskilled foreign workers to Singapore and  send  them

for  training. After all, they have such a wide choice  here.

We always have millions of unemployed people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



outside  who  are  looking for jobs.  As  an  employer,  they

should  go out there to look for persons who already  possess

the  set of skills that they need and bring them here, rather

than  to  bring  in totally unskilled workers  and  put  them

through our training programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give the Member an example. Sir, today, if they

bring in an unskilled foreign construction worker, they  have

to  pay  a monthly levy of about $470.  That is to discourage

the  contractor  from  bringing in an  unskilled  worker  and

sending  him  to  our  Building and Construction  Authority's

training  school for training.  If they bring  in  a  skilled

worker, we only charge a levy of $30.  So, they should go out

there,  look  for skilled construction workers, recruit  them

and  save  over  $400  per worker.  Do  not  clutter  up  our

training centres with foreign workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Two supplementary

questions,   Sir.   What  service  sector  is  the   Minister

referring  to  when  he says that older, unskilled  or  lower

skilled workers can be deployed?  Secondly, would this sector

provide  the  same  kind  of pay benefits  or  a  lower  pay,

resulting in a lower income for these workers?  I would  also

like  to  know  specifically what are the measures  that  the

Ministry is taking to help this group of workers to switch to

another service sector.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the Member asked what are the

service  sectors  where there are still  jobs  available.   I

could  give  him  some  examples.  For instance,  the  retail

industry, hotels, food and beverage, food services  and  food

production  and manufacturing.  We found 400 jobs  which  are

available  within  these sectors that I have  mentioned.   He

asked whether the pay is much lower than in the manufacturing

sector.  The good news is that, in many instances, the pay is

almost  the  same  as in the manufacturing sector.   In  some

cases,  in  fact,  the pay is actually  higher  than  in  the

manufacturing sector.  It is a viable alternative for the out-of-work Singaporeans to make an attempt to take on such jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point was: what are we doing to help workers,

particularly  older workers, to retrain for  these  jobs?   I

mentioned  in my answer to the question from Mr Ong  that  we

are  considering a programme where we will help companies  to

recruit  these workers, that is, we will give them  financial

incentives  to  recruit  these older  workers  and  put  them

through  a proper training programme. If you are an employer,

and  you  are  prepared  to  take  in  this  group  of  older

retrenched  workers, we will help you.  We will  provide  you

with  financial support for a period of time  while  you  are

training  the workers.  But you must come to us and say  that

you have a proper training programme so that you do not abuse

the  system.   If you are prepared to put in  the  effort  to

train  the  older workers, we are prepared to give  you  some

financial assistance over a period of time so that the  older

workers will find it easier to acquire a skill and to  adjust

to the new working environment and, hopefully, settle down in

the new jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Could the Minister clarify further

what  sort  of  financial  scheme  he  is  offering  to   the

employers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I emphasised in my response that

we   are  considering  this  programme.    The  details  will

probably  be  announced, together with what the Minister  for

Trade and Industry has said, later on this month.  It is part

of the package of assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, generally, Singaporeans accept the

need for foreign manpower at the lower skilled level and also

selective use of foreign manpower at the top end.   But  many

seem  to  have  the  impression that for the  middle  tier  - technical jobs that polytechnic graduates and so on  will  be

eligible for - there is an excessive reliance by employers on

cheaper,  foreign  alternatives in that  sphere.   Could  the

Minister  elaborate whether that is borne out  by  the  facts

and,  more importantly, whether there is any measure in place

to ensure that such excessive reliance is prevented?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, of course, during difficult

times,  Singaporeans who face the competition will feel  this

natural  reaction against foreigners who are  competing  with

them  in their area, especially those in the middle level  or

in  the  technical jobs.  But the reality is  that  companies

that  recruit middle-level technical staff very often do have

difficulties finding sufficient local employees to fill their

vacancies  or  to meet their demands.  Let  me  give  you  an

example.   We have several petrochemical companies in  Jurong

Island.  They  offer very attractive jobs.  But  for  a  long

time, these companies have not been able to find a sufficient

number  of Singaporeans who are willing to take on  the  jobs

that  they have on offer.  The job comes with a 12-hour shift

pattern and is in a fairly remote location and it is a fairly

demanding job.  Very few Singaporeans are prepared to take on

this  job.  Should we insist that they take Singaporeans only

and  delay their operations until they fill up the posts over

time  with Singaporeans who are prepared to do it?  Or should

we  expect them to increase the pay to a point where they can

overcome the Singaporeans' reluctance to take on these rather

difficult  jobs?  If we do so, we are liable  to  make  these

industries  uncompetitive where they are located.   We  might

lose  the whole industry completely, which means we will lose

even more value-added to the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is to find a balance and we have to leave it

to  the employers to make this decision about who in fact can

make  bigger  and  more valuable contributions  to  help  the

company to remain competitive.  But, overall, we do have some

guidelines and controls to ensure that employers just do  not

bring  in  foreigners purely on the basis of  lower  salaries

without  regard to their ability to contribute.  So  when  we

process applications for employment pass, we do look  at  the

qualifications and work experiences of these people to ensure

that  they are in fact reasonably suitable for the particular

job in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Besides MOM's employment

service, can the Minister tell us whether there are any other

organisations where all these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



unemployed  people can turn to for assistance for  new  jobs?

Can  the  Minister also confirm that the Skills Redevelopment

Programme is in fact only applicable to Singaporeans?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, there are of course many other

private  sector employment agencies apart from my  Ministry's

CareerLink.  NTUC also offers their union members  employment

assistance when they need their help in this manner.   In  so

far  as SRP is concerned, I do believe that the benefits that

we offer under SRP are largely for Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether the

programmes that have been introduced include modules to  help

workers  adjust to the psychological and emotional impact  on

their  lives  and the changes that they are facing,  such  as

losing their jobs?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, 1,600 people visit our

CareerLink@mom  Centre, which is located  in  the  Ministry's

headquarters.  At CareerLink@mom, in fact, we do  offer  such

counselling  service to those who are in need.   We  do  help

them.   In  fact,  we  even  go to  the  extent  of  offering

individual counselling, apart from group seminars, on seeking

alternative jobs and looking for training opportunities.   So

we  do  provide some individual counselling  for particularly

difficult cases to examine their career background  and  then

to  help them plan training programmes so that they can  take

on alternative jobs.  We do help where we can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my question is similar to what

Mr  Yeo  just asked, whether skills training is only confined

to  Singaporeans.  I have got feedback that  foreign  workers

have  been  sent  by private companies to courses  which  are

subsidised  by  the  Government.  Can the  Minister  comment,

please?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, may I suggest that the Member

write to me about the particulars of this case?  Let me  look

into  it  and  see  what  are  the circumstances  where  such

training had been extended.

<div align="center"><b>SERVICE AND CONSERVANCY CHARGES GRANT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Extension)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  the  Special  Service  and  Conservancy

Charges (S&CC) grant as part of the Utilities Save scheme can

be  extended  for  another year in view of the  current  weak

economic situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me explain the background to the

special S&CC grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997, the Government has been helping households

living  in  1-,  2-, 3- and 4-room HDB flats to  cushion  the

impact of the increase in their monthly electricity and water

charges.  In FY2000, the assistance given to these households

comprised  utilities  rebates  and  a  special  Service   and

Conservancy  Charge (S&CC) grant.  The total amount  received

by  each HDB household ranged from $148 to $266, depending on

the flat type.  This was in FY2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, during the Budget debate in March 2001, the

Government  announced  that  it will  enhance  the  utilities

rebates  for  HDB households under a new scheme,  called  the

Utilities Save Scheme.  Under this scheme, households  living

in  1-,  2-, 3-, 4- and 5-room HDB flats will each receive  a

grant of between $250 and $350 in FY2001, this year,  to help

them  pay  part of their electricity and water charges.   The

scheme will cost the Government $226 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dollar terms, for each HDB household, the benefits

this  financial year under the new Utilities Save Scheme  are

more  generous  than the FY2000 package.  As  the  Government

will  be  helping HDB households through the  Utilities  Save

Scheme,  the  special S&CC grant was not  extended  after  it

expired in June 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and MTI are sending a joint letter to all HDB

households to explain why the special S&CC grant will not  be

extended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



and  why  they  are  better off with the new  Utilities  Save

Scheme.

<div align="center"><b>PAYMENT TO MR JOHN OLDS AND MR NG KEE CHOE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Justification)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Senior Minister if he

will explain why he justifies the payment of $10.9 million in

the  year 2000 to Mr John Olds, former CEO of the Development

Bank  of Singapore (DBS) and to ex-DBS President, Mr  Ng  Kee

Choe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Senior Minister):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

banks  and companies have entered a totally new phase.   They

are  no  longer  competing  in  a  domestic  market,  against

domestic  competitors, and not even in the immediate regional

market.  They either make it against global players,  whether

in  the  Singapore,  Asian and global markets,  or  they  get

marginalised.  If they do not provide customers with  quality

products  and  services,  equal  to  the  best  international

players,  they lose the business.  The banks could  rely  for

many  years  on  protection against their competitors.   This

will  not  be  possible  for  much  longer.   So  like  other

Singapore  companies, if they cannot compete  with  the  best

they  will end up as marginal players, both in Singapore  and

abroad.   They  will not grow, shareholders will  dump  their

shares,  and  they will not be able to provide jobs  and  add

value to the Singapore economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies will only be able to compete with

the  best  international players if they have the talent  and

management  systems  to equal the best.   This  means  paying

global rates to attract and retain talent, not rates we  want

to  set  for ourselves.  We do not set the salary scales  for

top  talent,  not  even for Singaporean  top  talent.   These

salary  scales  are set in New York, London, Silicon  Valley,

and wherever else global



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



companies  hire  their  staff.  It is  a  global  market  for

talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many talented Singaporeans are hired by global firms the

moment  they  graduate, sometimes even before they  graduate.

The best Singaporean executives are being hired with packages

that  match  their counterparts in developed markets.   Local

companies  will  not attract the best Singaporean  talent  if

they pay less than their international competitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither can we restrict ourselves to Singapore talent if

we  want to build world-class companies and banks.  We  would

be fooling ourselves to think so.  Few Singaporean executives

have  had  experience  at the senior  levels  of  a  globally

competitive bank, let alone run a major regional  bank.   Few

have  made  a  name  for themselves in the  most  competitive

financial  centres like London and New York,  and  none  have

reached the top.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies and banks therefore have to do what

it  takes to attract the best talent, local and foreign,  and

get  them to work together in a team.  If they deliver,  they

have  to  be rewarded.  If they do not, they will  either  be

replaced or have to accept reduced compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not decide what DBS pays its

executives.  DBS does not seek Government approval on how  it

is  run  or  what it pays its executives.  It does  so  on  a

commercial  basis  and  is answerable  to  all  shareholders,

including  minority shareholders.  But the Government,  as  a

shareholder of DBS, has had no reason to complain  about  the

salaries  DBS pays out to its top executives based  on  their

performance.   The  Government is satisfied  to  leave  these

commercial judgments to the Board of DBS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS has stated that it rewards its staff when they

achieve  pre-set  targets.  65% of the compensation  paid  to

John  Olds  and  Ng  Kee Choe in 2000  was  in  the  form  of

performance  bonuses.  They were paid these  bonuses  largely

because they met their targets.  Ng Kee Choe's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



compensation also included his 31 years' retirement  gratuity

scheme, which was commuted and made as a one-off payment   in

2000.   As  for  John  Olds,  DBS  has  stated  that  he  had

established  a  clear  vision,  guided  the  development   of

internal  changes in systems and processes that improved  the

bank's  financial  performance,  helped  attract  world-class

talent at all levels, and laid a strong foundation for future

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in a new global market environment. We

either  go with the market,  and bring in the best talent  to

help us compete, or we drop out and accept a mediocre future.

Without  top talent, we will not be able to build world-class

companies  that all Singaporeans can be proud of and  benefit

from.   Singaporeans cannot afford to resent the remuneration

packages  that the top performers in banking, the professions

and  industry  receive.   The size of their  remuneration  is

insignificant when measured against the value they create for

shareholders,   and  the  jobs  and  wages  that   successful

Singapore companies will generate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition for top talent is intense. If we are

not prepared to pay, we will not get the best people, and not

even  the second best.  They will go elsewhere. So if we work

up  public  opinion  against the high rewards  that  the  top

performers get, our companies are not going to make  it,  and

Singapore is not going to make it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, in answer to a specific question, we

have had the Minister go into a lot of generalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Can you ask your question, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, as I now understand it, the payment

to  Mr Olds was compensation or gratuity, and not salary  for

the year 2000.  If it was gratuity or compensation, may I ask

whether there was any term in the contract of employment with

him  for  the  payment of gratuity, how long was he  employed

for, and why did he leave?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I thought I spoke quite clearly.

For Mr John Olds, the payment in the year 2000 was largely in

the  form  of  performance bonuses for what  he  set  out  to

achieve, a set of performance targets set up by the bank  and

the  board.  He exceeded these targets and the bank paid  him

accordingly.   For Mr Ng Kee Choe, a significant  portion  of

the  payment  in  the  year 2000 was his gratuity  which  was

commuted into a one-off payment for 31 years of service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister please answer my

questions?   Has he got the contract between Mr Olds and  the

bank  when he was first brought out here?  Was there  a  term

for  the payment of a gratuity or compensation?  And, if  so,

what  were  the  terms?   Could  we  have  answers  to  these

questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I thought I have already made

myself  clear.   Mr  John Olds was brought  here  on  a  term

contract.  He was paid a compensation package which  includes

a  significant  part  in performance bonuses.   The  one  who

received the commuted gratuity for 31 years of service is  Mr

Ng Kee Choe, not Mr John Olds.

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE LANGUAGE REVIEW COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Implementation of recommendations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for Education if

he   will  give  an  update  on  the  implementation  of  the

recommendations of the Chinese Language Review Committee.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  in  January  1999,  the  Ministry  of

Education  announced  a  set of measures  to  strengthen  the

teaching  and  learning  of  Chinese  Language  (CL)  in  our

education system.  These measures are in three major areas:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Pitching CL at a level of difficulty attainable by

the vast majority of students;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Regenerating Chinese literary elite by increasing

the number of students offering Higher Chinese (HCL); and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Helping students with extreme difficulty in CL.



All these measures have been implemented on schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the primary and secondary school CL syllabuses

have been revised and the word lists updated to pitch CL at a

level  of  difficulty  attainable by  the  vast  majority  of

students.   CL  Heads of Department and key CL teachers  have

been briefed on the changes.  MOE officers are currently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



developing  the new instructional materials for  primary  and

secondary school levels based on the revised syllabuses.  The

revised  syllabuses and textbooks will be phased in by  level

from  the year 2002.  As an interim measure, guidelines  were

issued to schools in mid-1999 to help teachers omit the  more

difficult  parts of the existing textbooks and even  out  the

learning load of the students.  Appropriate adjustments  have

also been made to the respective CL examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the four key measures introduced to allow more

students to offer Higher Chinese (HCL) have proven effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More primary school pupils are offering Higher Chinese

at Primary 5.  As a result of efforts to encourage pupils who

have the ability to offer Higher Chinese to opt to do so, the

proportion of P5 students who opted to do Higher Chinese  has

increased from 22.0% in 1999 to 25.7% in 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also allowed more students to offer Higher

Chinese in Secondary 1.  As a result of this initiative,  the

proportion of Secondary 1 cohort who opted for Higher Chinese

has  increased from 15.5% of the Secondary 1 cohort  in  1999

and 16.5% in 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also set up the 10th SAP school, Nan Hua Secondary,

in  the year 2000.  The proportion of Higher Chinese students

in its Secondary 1 intake was 73% in the year 2000 and 78% in

2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the pre-university level, we set up the third Chinese

Language  Elective Programme (CLEP) centre in Nanyang  Junior

College.   More  Chinese Language Elective scholarships  have

also  been made available.  Following these initiatives,  the

number  of  JC  students  in  the Chinese  Language  Elective

Programme increased from 204 in 1999 in the two JCs to 276 in

the year 2001 across the three JCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Academic Year 2002/2003 onwards, students who have

done well in Chinese Language or Higher Chinese at `A'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



or `AO' level will be given bonus points for admission to the

Chinese Language and Chinese Studies courses offered  by  NUS

and  the Communications Studies courses offered by NTU.  (The

bonus  points for entry to the Communications Studies  course

are  also available to students who have done well in Chinese

Language,  Malay Language and Tamil Language).  The  Ministry

will   monitor   the   effect  of  this  measure   upon   its

implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will touch on the implementation of CL "B"

which caters to students who face exceptional difficulties in

the learning of the standard CL syllabuses.  The CL "B" paper

places  greater  emphasis on the testing of  the  candidates'

aural/oral  skills,  40% weighting for this  as  against  20%

previously, and less on the writing skills.  For example, 20%

weighting  to composition versus 35% previously.   To  ensure

that  the  standard of the CL "B" papers is  pitched  at  the

appropriate  level,  the  Ministry  has  conducted  extensive

consultation and trial testing of the specimen papers on  the

target group of students likely to offer CL "B".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals decide on the students' ability for CL "B"

based  on  a  set of Eligibility Criteria that  the  Ministry

announced in end-1999.  These students will be able  to  pass

CL "B" if they put in reasonable effort.  At the Secondary  3

level  this year, 45 pupils opted to offer CL "B".  They  are

attending lessons at 5 CL "B" Centres located in the 4 zones.

The  total number of Secondary 4 students who registered  for

Secondary 4 CL "B" examination in 2001 so far is 189.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the feedback obtained from schools which

have  Secondary  3  CL  "B" eligible students,  most  parents

requested  that  their children be allowed to  continue  with

standard  CL and would consider CL "B" only if these children

really  cannot cope with the standard CL syllabus.   The  low

number of CL "B" students is a natural outcome at this  stage

as  most students and parents are keeping their options open.

The  schools will monitor the performance of Secondary  3  CL

"B" eligible students who continued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



with  standard  CL  and will discuss with the  parents  their

children's progress if they cannot cope with standard CL.

<div align="center"><b>MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGE TEACHING AWARD SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  how many teachers have benefited from the Mother  Tongue

Language Teaching Award Scheme; and (b) whether there is  any

plan  to  provide more incentives to encourage mother  tongue

language teachers to further their studies and upgrade  their

professional level.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Undergraduate Award for Mother Tongue Language (MTL)  Studies

was  implemented last year.  A total of 9 awards  were  given

out in the first year, ie, Year 2000.  This year, a total  of

14 awards were given out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has put in place many schemes for teachers

to  upgrade  and  develop themselves professionally.   Mother

Tongue  Language teachers, like all teachers, are  encouraged

to  apply  for these schemes.  Under the Study Leave  Scheme,

non-graduate   teachers  who  wish  to  pursue  undergraduate

studies can apply for study leave.  Successful applicants can

also apply for further sponsorship in terms of half-pay leave

under the Professional Development Leave scheme and interest-free  study  loans, if they meet the eligibility criteria  of

these other assistance schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers wishing to pursue postgraduate studies also

have  a number of schemes they can apply for.  They can apply

for  full  Ministry  of Education Scholarships,  Professional

Development Leave or interest-free study loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these schemes have attracted strong teacher

interest.   We  will  continue to improve and  introduce  new

schemes  as  the training needs of our teachers  evolve  over

time.

together, as they are related?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the five Members have asked

about  allowing more competition in the provision  of  public

bus   services,  and  allowing  private  bus   operators   to

supplement feeder services in housing estates. Let  me  first

explain  the philosophy and principles underlying the current

competitive framework for the provision of basic  public  bus

services,  so  that  we  can  better  appreciate  the  issues

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have two basic public bus operators, each

serving  different territories on the island.  In return  for

this   privilege  of  being  the  sole  operators  in   their

respective  territories, the Public Transport  Council  (PTC)

imposes on them the Universal Service Obligation, or USO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the USO, each public bus operator has to provide a

comprehensive bus service in the territories allocated to it,

regardless  of  the  profitability of the route.  Apart  from

comprehensive  coverage to ensure that all  commuters  within

its  territory are served, it has to run services  throughout

the day at specific frequencies, even when the demand is low,

in order to maintain a reasonable level of service throughout

the  day.  In effect, the high demand periods make up for the

low  demand  periods on the same route, eg,  during  late  at

night.   This  industry framework, which relies on  extensive

cross  subsidy  across routes as well as  time  of  the  day,

ensures  that  all  commuters have access to  convenient  and

quality bus services throughout the day, and at a uniform set

of affordable fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang, Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Chng Hee Kok

and  Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked about allowing private bus

operators  to operate a lower-cost service to supplement  the

feeder  bus service at peak hours, and about opening  up  the

bus  market  to more competition.  Such a move  would  entail

several crucial implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing private bus operators to selectively choose the

most profitable times and routes for their services, in other

words, to cherry-pick, will adversely affect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



the  ability of the existing operators to continue to provide

services  to  low demand areas or during low demand  periods.

The Government has therefore been careful not to allow cherry-picking,  as  private  operators do  not  need  to  bear  the

responsibility   of   running  regular   whole-day   services

throughout an area - whether profitable or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about allowing free competition in the provision of

basic  feeder  bus services in a selected HDB  estate?   Free

competition implies that the new feeder operator will be free

to  compete on fares, and on the level of service.   Such  an

arrangement  will also have to be extended  to  the  existing

feeder  bus  operator.  One outcome could  be  that  the  bus

operators will compete aggressively along the corridors  with

heavy  demand in the designated estate, and during  the  peak

hours  when passengers are plentiful.  However, residents  in

the  outlying parts of the designated estate may end up  with

less  frequent services, since the operators will  have  less

ability to cross-subsidise them.  Off peak hour services  may

also end up being unacceptably infrequent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are keeping an open mind on the issue of

enhancing competition.  My Ministry and PTC will study  under

what  circumstances  and  conditions  we  can  allow  private

operators  to operate feeder services.  As this is a  complex

issue,  PTC will need some time to fully examine the  options

and their implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked about the measures that will be taken to

ease  overcrowding  during peak hours.  First,  let  me  give

Members  a brief overview of the service quality of  the  two

public bus operators.  A recent audit commissioned by the PTC

showed  that  SBS and TIBS comply with most of the  standards

set   out  in  the  Basic  Bus  Service  Specifications   and

Standards.  The survey showed that overall, there is  a  high

level   of  bus  service,  especially  in  terms  of  service

coverage,  availability and frequency.  This was  also  borne

out  in  a  recent independent survey carried out by  Zaobao.

The  survey showed that 9 in 10 persons polled said that  the

public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



transport here is efficient and reliable, and two-thirds said

that  the public transport in Singapore is world-class.  This

is no small achievement.  Many Singaporeans who have used the

public transport system in other countries do realise that we

have  an  affordable,  good quality public  transport  system

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, while overall service quality is good,

there  is  room for improvement during the peak  within  peak

period.   While commuters accept that buses will be  crowded,

and  even packed, during this period, they expect to be  able

to board their buses without having to wait too long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus companies have assured PTC that they have, in

fact,  been  putting  in more bus capacity  to  address  this

challenge.   In  the last three years, SBS has increased  its

capacity  by 5% although ridership has dropped by  3%.   TIBS

has  expanded  its  fleet by 213 buses.  In  effect,  it  has

increased its bus capacity by 58%, even though ridership  has

only  increased  by 36%.  Both companies have  also  injected

more  buses  into  congested routes  through  better  vehicle

management, and have increased the number of mid-trip  buses,

to provide downstream commuters with empty buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure Dr Vasoo that PTC will continue to

closely  monitor  the situation.  Where the  overcrowding  is

especially  problematic on a particular  service  during  the

peak within peak period, the bus operator will be required to

put in more buses to expand capacity to meet demand.  PTC  is

now  discussing with the bus companies on expanding their bus

fleet with more double decker or Bendy buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, if there is evidence to suggest that

the  public bus operators are not able to take any action  to

ease  the  overcrowding situation, PTC will consider  opening

these  routes to private bus operators.  The last  time  this

happened was in 1998 when selected bus routes were offered to

private  bus operators during the peak within peak period  to

help  meet  the  high  demand.   However,  the  private   bus

operators that took part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



in  providing the supplementary services withdrew  them  only

after  less  than 12 months.    In summary, the  current  bus

framework   provides   bus  commuters  with   good   quality,

affordable  bus  services  at all  times  of  the  day.   Bus

commuters do get good value for their money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still room for improvement, especially

in certain services during the peak within peak period.  This

will be a continuing challenge for the bus companies, as  new

housing  estates  are developed and existing  ones  expanded,

resulting  in  changes in demand.  I have asked  the  PTC  to

closely monitor the performance of the bus companies, and  to

work  with  them to ensure that they are indeed  meeting  the

quality of service standards set by the PTC.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Government consider

SBS  and  TIBS as private commercial companies, or  are  they

required to provide a public service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Why is the Government asking the bus companies to

provide cross subsidies in order to achieve the so-called USO

and seamless transportation system?  Is the Government trying

to have the cake and eat it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the Government consider providing grants to

companies to run unprofitable bus routes, and that  opens  up

the market for competition for other operators to come in?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the two bus companies are

indeed private bus companies.  As to why they are required to

perform the USO, this is a fairly standard procedure  in  the

management of public bus services.  In any country, or in any

city,  it is not possible for all routes to be equally served

unless they are priced properly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of pricing them properly. One is to

allow free market to rein, which means that in the areas with

low  ridership or low demand, the operators will then provide

a service that is fairly infrequent or they should be pricing

the  service  in order to recover cost, which means  for  the

outlying  areas, people have to pay a lot more  for  the  bus

services.   The  other  way is to allow  cross  subsidy,  ie,

during  the  period  when the demand is very  high,  the  bus

company  is able to make money and that will then  cover  the

higher  cost during the low demand period, and which  is  why

the  USO  is  in fact a device to safeguard the  interest  of

commuters  wherever  they are living.  This  way,  they  have

access to a fairly uniform quality of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of grants to run unprofitable routes, it is

best  for  the  Government not to be  involved  in  providing

grants  to actually cover the operating cost of those routes.

It  is better that the services be operated commercially  and

that  the  operators  recover the  operating  cost  from  the

commuters  directly, rather than through  a  grant  from  the

Government.

<div align="center"><b>BANKING CONSOLIDATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Low Thia

Khiang asked whether bank mergers will help make Singapore an

international financial centre.  Mr S. Iswaran and Dr Ker Sin

Tze asked about the effects of consolidation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



on  competition and the availability of banking  services  to

SMEs.   These are important questions prompted by the process

of consolidation that is currently underway. OCBC has made  a

bid  for  Keppel Capital Holdings, which owns  Keppel  TatLee

Bank,  and DBS and UOB have made competing bids for OUB.   If

these  offers are successful, we will have fewer  but  larger

local banks.  Since this is an important issue, I am making a

Ministerial Statement and then we can have questions and full

discussion after that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are understandably concerned about how

bank  consolidation  might affect them.  I  appreciate  their

concerns.   Let  me explain why consolidation is  unavoidable

for  the  banking industry and more importantly is  good  for

Singapore, and let me also explain how some of these concerns

can be met.



<br><br><i>Importance of Consolidation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking industry is undergoing dramatic change

everywhere.   Unless the local banks upgrade  themselves  and

keep  up  with  the  changes,  they  will  become  weak   and

marginalised,   even  in  Singapore.   Consolidation   is   a

worldwide  trend in banking, and is an essential  element  in

the upgrading of local banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the local banks could maintain their market

positions  and grow organically as the economy grew  year  by

year, so long as they conducted their business prudently  and

avoided  mishaps.   But that was in a different  environment,

with   limited  foreign  competition  and  a  slow  pace   of

innovation.   Today competition is fierce and  technology  is

changing  rapidly.   The industry is characterised  by  large

economies  of  scale,  putting  a  high  premium   on   size.

Investors demand that banks earn competitive returns, or else

they  will punish their share prices.  Small banks simply  do

not  have the resources to compete.  They are unable to  out-perform larger banks, either in the quality of service or  in

returns to shareholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even large international banks, many times the size of

Singapore banks, feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



the  pressure  to grow still larger.  They have been  merging

among  themselves,  becoming what  analysts  call  "Godzilla"

banks.  Deutsche Bank, at one time among the largest banks in

the  world,  feels  the need for a merger  partner.   Smaller

banks  throughout the world have merged with  each  other  or

have been swallowed by these Godzilla banks.  The largest  of

the  Godzilla  banks  is  Citigroup, with  an  estimated  100

million  customers worldwide.  HSBC has 20 million,  and  ABN

Amro  13.5  million.   Their  size  enables  them  to  invest

billions   of   dollars   in  the   latest   technology   and

sophisticated systems.  Because they can spread  these  costs

over  millions of customers world-wide, they can  efficiently

deliver  a  wide-range  of customised products  at  low  unit

costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is fewer but much bigger banks. Over the

past  decade,  the  number of banks in  small  countries  has

fallen  significantly.  In Sweden, the number  fell  by  75%.

Switzerland,  with  a GDP and a population  about  twice  our

size,  now has only two big banks - UBS and Credit  Suisse  - both   world-class players.  The Netherlands, four  times  as

big  as  Singapore, has three - ABN-Amro, Rabobank  and  ING,

plus Fortis which is partially Belgian.  Australia, which  is

slightly  bigger  than the Netherlands,  also  has  four  big

banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy is 1/4 the size of Australia's.

Singapore cannot support five local banks.  Our biggest  bank

DBS, even after the merger with POSBank, is ranked only 115th

in  the  world  by  asset  size.  The  logic  of  Singapore's

circumstances is inescapable:  if we want strong banks,  then

they  have to be big banks, and if they are to be big  banks,

then they must consolidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any merger between the local banks will not create a

Godzilla  bank.   The merged entity will still  be  small  by

international  standards.   What  the  Godzillas  are   doing

involves  scale  economies that the local  banks  cannot  get

anywhere  close to. Some might argue therefore  that  whether

the  local  banks  are  very small or  just  small  makes  no

difference to their ability to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



compete.  But this view is incorrect.  Local banks can derive

meaningful  scale  economies if  they  merge,  especially  in

attracting   talent   and   building   capabilities.    Local

consolidation can create viable Singapore banks that can hold

their  own in the local market without Government protection,

and  compete  in  selected foreign markets.   They  will  not

compete  globally with the big players, nor can they  compete

in  every product line.  But they should be strong enough  to

avoid  being  completely marginalised, at home and  in  Asia.

They  will  be  in  a  position  to  expand  through  careful

acquisitions  abroad over time, rather than be left  with  no

choice but eventually be acquired by foreign players.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the giant international banks are already

operating  in  Singapore, some since before the  local  banks

were  founded.   They  have a large share  of  the  wholesale

banking  market,  serving large companies  and  international

customers.  Several have sizeable retail operations as  well.

If  the local banks remain small, they have no hope of making

the  necessary  investments in technology, or attracting  the

talent  to  compete with these world-class  foreign  players.

Their  service standards and product range will fall  behind.

Customers, especially the more sophisticated ones, will  take

their business to the foreign banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will happen even if we do not liberalise the

banking  industry.   The more innovative foreign  banks  here

have  been  able  to  grow  their market  share  despite  the

restrictions  that MAS has placed on their operations.   Over

time,  local banks that cannot compete would become weak  and

marginalised.   At best they would operate  at  the  fringes,

serving niche markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would not be a good outcome for Singapore. Banks

are  a  core  part  of our financial system  and  affect  the

stability of our economy.  Without a group of strong and well-managed local banks, we risk instability in the event  of  an

economic or market crisis.  We saw this in many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



Asian countries during the Asian financial crisis.  It is not

prudent  to  rely solely on the foreign banks  because  in  a

crisis, banks which are more deeply rooted in Singapore  will

be  more  likely  to  act in support  of  our  financial  and

economic  stability.  Foreign banks will  have  large  global

operations, but the commercial interests of local banks  will

be  more  closely aligned with that of the Singapore economy.

That  is why MAS remains committed to fostering strong  local

banks with a major share of the domestic market.  And that is

why we need banking consolidation.



<br><br><i>Competition in the Banking Industry</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has expressed concern that large banks will

engage  in  anti-competitive practices to  the  detriment  of

small  depositors.  The Government will not allow an enlarged

bank,  or a few dominant banks, to use their market power  to

engage  in  monopolistic or anti-competitive practices,  that

diminish  consumer  choice or block entry by  other  players.

MAS  does not think that this is likely because none  of  the

post-merger banks will be big enough to become over-dominant.

Even  if  OUB  merges  with one of the  larger  banks,  their

combined market share of non-bank deposits will be about 30%,

still  significantly less than the share of the largest banks

in other small countries.  The single largest bank in Finland

has  about  40% market share, about the same as the  combined

market share of HSBC and Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country, we have to accept a more

concentrated  banking industry, in which  the  largest  banks

have  a sizeable market share.  MAS believes that there  will

be  sufficient competition in the banking industry even after

consolidation.   The  foreign banks  will  probably  increase

their  share  of the retail market and will provide  vigorous

competition.   MAS'  banking  liberalisation  programme  will

enhance this competition.  Nevertheless, the Government  will

keep a watchful eye over the development of the industry, and

will be vigilant against any abuse of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



market   power.   The  Competition  Act  that  MTI   is   now

considering will help us to do that.

<br><br><i>Small Depositors</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran is also concerned about the effect of

consolidation on the provision of banking services  to  small

customers.    The  Government  will  ensure  that  low-income

Singaporeans  continue  to  have  access  to  basic   banking

services at affordable prices.  We do not expect this  to  be

an  immediate problem.  Charges, where they have been levied,

have  been modest.  Most of the local banks, especially  DBS,

already  provide a basic banking product for small depositors

at  affordable  prices.   We expect this  to  continue  after

consolidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the longer term, banks will feel pressure to

earn  competitive returns for shareholders.  This will happen

even  without consolidation.  Because competition will  force

banks  to watch their bottom lines more closely, and to  make

each product break even.  It will become harder for banks  to

continue  to  cross-subsidise  services  that  they  used  to

provide for free or below cost.  That was a luxury affordable

only in a protected market where profits came easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many other countries, including Australia and the US,

fees  and charges for various banking services exist together

with   robust  competition.   Governments  and  the   banking

industry  have developed guidelines or requirements  for  all

banks   to  provide  affordable  services  to  lower   income

customers.   Banks  in Singapore will face  the  same  market

pressures, so we need to consider similar solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stated the Government's position on this in my speech

to  the  Association of Bank in Singapore on 29th June.   The

Government will ensure that low-income Singaporeans  continue

to  have  access  to  basic banking  services  at  affordable

prices.   However,  we  cannot insist that  the  services  be

completely  free.  Banks are businesses and have  to  recover

their costs.  Public transport and electricity are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



daily  necessities for most Singaporeans.   But  neither  bus

services nor electricity supplies are free, although both are

affordable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association of Banks in Singapore has already

encouraged  all  banks  that engage in  consumer  banking  to

provide  affordable basic banking services  to  lower  income

Singaporeans.   MAS  welcomes this, and  is  optimistic  that

these banks will find ways to meet this need.  The Government

will   monitor  the  situation  closely.   When  it   becomes

necessary, MAS will require all banks with significant retail

operations  in  Singapore to provide basic  banking  accounts

with defined minimum features to low-income Singaporeans.



<br><br><i>Small and Medium Enterprises</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze suggested that one or two small banks be

preserved to serve SMEs.  Unfortunately, this is not  viable.

The  Government cannot require the banks to remain small when

commercial pressures compel them to acquire scale  to  become

viable.   This  would  be unfair to the shareholders  of  the

small  banks.  The banks themselves analysed their  situation

and  decided  that it was no longer commercially  viable  for

them   to   remain  small.   And  this  set  in   train   the

consolidation process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not likely that small banks can serve SMEs better

than  big  banks over the long run.  Smaller banks will  have

fewer  resources  to cater to the needs of  SMEs,  and  their

costs  will  be higher.  A large bank with a well-diversified

portfolio should be able to fund a larger number of SMEs than

a  small bank with a more concentrated portfolio.  And during

an economic downturn, a large bank is better able to maintain

its credit lines to SMEs than small banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the local banks have maintained an interest in

serving  SMEs.   They recognise that SMEs  are  an  important

segment  of  the market.  DBS' Enterprise Banking  Group  has

recently  opened five Business Centres dedicated  to  serving

SMEs.  Keppel TatLee Bank continues to focus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



on  the  SME  market,  offering a  wide  range  of  financial

services  tailored to meet the needs of this  market.   OCBC,

which  has bid for Keppel-TatLee Bank, has established a  new

Emerging Business unit to cater to the needs of SMEs.   So  I

do  not  expect consolidation to affect this interest of  the

local banks in SME lending.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concern of SMEs arises because some have previously

borrowed separately from two or more banks.  If the two banks

now  merge, will the merged bank cut back their total  credit

limit?   I  believe that while the merged bank will  want  to

reassess its exposure to the borrower, it is unlikely to  cut

back  its lending simply because of the merger.  If  the  SME

was  able  to service separate loans from the merger partners

earlier,  it should have no difficulty continuing to  service

the  same total quantum, as one loan, after the merger.   The

bank  has no reason to want to lose a good customer,  and  to

shrink its loan book overnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a supervisory point of view, it is the large loans

rather than small ones which can expose the bank to excessive

risk.   These large borrowers are more likely to be the large

companies and not the SMEs.  The Banking Act imposes a  limit

of  25%  of  a  bank's capital funds on its exposure  to  any

single  borrower.  This is what we call the  Single  Borrower

Limit.   However, should a bank merger cause a large borrower

to exceed this 25% limit, MAS will give the bank a reasonable

time to reduce its lending below the statutory or supervisory

limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks are not the only sources of funding

available to SMEs.  Finance companies and some foreign  banks

have  significant SME portfolios, and products that cater  to

the  needs  of SMEs.  In addition to commercial  credit,  the

Government also has financing schemes to assist SMEs, such as

the  Local  Enterprise Financing Scheme administered  by  the

Productivity  and Standards Board.  So while  we  can  expect

some adjustments as a result of the banking consolidation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



I  believe that the SMEs will continue to be catered to  even

with a more rationalised and efficient banking sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the banks must change and keep

up  with  international best practices to remain competitive.

We  cannot take for granted that our local banks will  remain

strong.   The banks know this and they are in the process  of

consolidation.   The result will be fewer but  bigger  banks.

The  Government views the consolidation among the local banks

as  a  positive  development.  If  it  is  well  executed,  a

stronger group of local banks will emerge, able to hold their

own  domestically, and to compete in the region.  In the long

run,  this  is  the  only  way to provide  Singaporeans  with

banking  services  that are competitively priced,  affordable

and of a high standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the assumption

seems  to be: "The bigger, the better".  Up to a point.   The

Deputy Prime Minister talks about the Government seeing to it

that  the  small account holders will be catered to by  these

big  banks.  I have been asking, in line with a lot of  other

countries, why is it not possible for a banking ombudsman  to

be appointed so that it is not just the Government saying "We

will see to this", but the small account holders will have an

institution to which they can take their grievances  and  see

that  something  is done?  The Association of  Banks  can  no

longer do that job.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr J B

Jeyaretnam's  usual answer to a problem  is:  "Why  does  the

Government not do something about it?" except that,  in  this

case,   the  Government  has  stated  its  position  and   Mr

Jeyaretnam  says, "Why not have an ombudsman to do  something

about it?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have answered this question in the House before. We

do  not  have  the  system  of  an  ombudsman  in  our  whole

constitutional  set-up.  It is not the way we have  operated.

There is no practical problem working with the Association of

Banks.  It is not a statutory body with coercive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



powers  but  it  has  considerable powers  of  moral  suasion

because,  if it talks sense, people will know that  MAS  will

back it up.  And there is competition in the banking industry

in  Singapore, which is really the best assurance  of  people

being  treated fairly by banks.  And if any bank  treats  any

customer unfairly, I would say to him to take his account and

go  somewhere else, and there are many, many other places  he

can go, even after banking consolidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has

not  answered my question on what is the Government's  vision

for  Singapore to be an international financial  centre,  and

whether or not the merger of banks and such liberalisation of

the   financial  market  will  help  us  move  towards   that

direction,  and what is the vision that we could  achieve  by

doing all these things.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a

large question, but the brief answer is, our vision is to  be

a  financial  centre in which the Singapore  banks  occupy  a

significant  market share and hold their own against  foreign

competition.   We want to open up, we want to  allow  foreign

banks  to  come,  we  want  them to  develop  their  regional

business,  also  access the domestic market  and  prosper  in

Singapore.   But  at  the same time,  we  want  large  strong

domestic players to continue to anchor the banking system  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something which can easily be reconciled.

If  we  say  the  foreign banks stay out, keep  this  to  the

domestic  players, then I think we are not going to become  a

financial centre, and that means many jobs and much GDP lost,

and  actually  weak local banks, because  they  will  not  be

competing against strong competitors and will not be able  to

test    themselves    against   what   is    best    practice

internationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we just open up and everybody

comes in, and we do not take special steps to strengthen  the

local  banks  and encourage them to become large and  strong,

then  there is a real risk that we will become an economy  in

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



there  are  no local banks, which is the position  which  New

Zealand is in today.  Because they have opened up, they  have

completely liberalised, there are no New Zealand banks in New

Zealand  today.   Every  bank in New Zealand  is  Australian,

American or international, and there is no need for a banking

regulator  because  the  banks are not  incorporated  in  New

Zealand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not think that is a good position for Singapore.

We  want  strong local banks and a vibrant industry.   To  do

that,   the  banks  have  to  become  large,  they  have   to

consolidate, they have to rationalise.  And that is  why  the

Government thinks that consolidation is a positive  step.  It

will  help  to build Singapore as a strong financial  centre,

and it will also be good for our economy as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with consolidation,

the  local banks are going to be more competitive.  But there

is an expectation, one could say unrealistic or unreasonable,

that  the  onus  for providing basic banking  services  falls

almost  entirely on the local banks and, yet, we are allowing

foreign  banks greater access to the local market to  compete

in  the  more lucrative, high networth and corporate sectors.

Should   we  not  then  make  access  to  the  local   market

conditional on the provision of basic banking services  level

the  playing  field at the outset and also  ensure  that  the

foreign banks that come in factor that into their equation?



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said

in  my Statement just now, we are encouraging all banks  that

engage  in  consumer  banking to provide  affordable  banking

services.  And that means not just the local banks, but  also

foreign  banks  with a significant retail presence,  eg,  the

qualified full banks (QFBs).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that the foreign banks which are operating here

will  take note of this advice from the Association of  Banks

but,  as I have explained, when it becomes necessary, we  are

going to require all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



banks with significant retail operations in Singapore also to

provide  basic banking accounts so that it is  a  more  level

playing  field between the local banks as well as the foreign

banks  tapping  the domestic market here,  which  is  what  I

believe Mr Iswaran is suggesting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, I have some words of

caution  for  you.   Can  you listen  to  me  carefully?   In

allowing you to speak on this Motion, I take it that you  are

aware  that  you are not to make any speech that reflects  on

the  decision  of  the courts.  You have  to  stay  in  line,

otherwise I will rule you out of order.  You may now proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with respect, I

do  not  quite  understand  your restriction  because,  as  I

understand it, all court proceedings are now over.  So  there

are  no  pending  proceedings in court.   The  court  is  now

functus officio.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You did not listen to me carefully.

I said, "Your speech shall not reflect on the decision of the

courts."



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I make it clear that I shall talk

about  the  aspects  of  the  case  which  should  have  been

considered  by the court.  So, in that way, it might  reflect

on  the court's decision.  But I do want the Cabinet, when it

comes to advising the President on the clemency petition that

had   been   sent   to  him,  to  take  these   points   into

consideration.  So that is my whole purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You can proceed to speak and I will

rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I start

on  this,  may  I first of all say that I have  no  pecuniary

interest  in  this.   I have not seen the  man,  nor  have  I

represented him in any proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to make the point that the case has

been  brought to my attention by Think Centre, which has also

supplied  me  the information about the man's background.   I

say this because I have said I did not interview the man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I say that

this  is  not  a disputatious speech or a complaining  speech

that I intend to make.  It is more of a plea.  May I also  go

on  to say that the plea is not just for this man, but a plea

for  all  who may find themselves in the situation  in  which

this  man  found himself and has been convicted and sentenced

to death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I outline several of the facts which had been

presented to me by the Think Centre and the judgement of  the

Judicial  Commissioner, may I say, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,

that   the  conviction  of  this  man  is  founded   upon   a

presumption.   A presumption is something that the  law  says

you  have  got to presume, you have got to accept unless  the

accused  is  able  to  rebut that  presumption,  is  able  to

disprove  it.  Presumptions therefore reverse the  burden  of

proof in criminal cases.  In criminal law, as we have had it,

the presumption is that an accused person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



is deemed to be innocent until he is proved guilty beyond any

reasonable  doubt.  The law did not require  the  accused  to

have to prove his innocence.  But this is somewhat eroded now

by  the presumptions that had been built in and the Misuse of

Drugs Act abounds in presumptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am asking is that before we send a man to his

death,  we must consider whether it is safe enough simply  to

send him to his death upon a presumption, where there are  no

concrete  evidence  or  any other  facts  which  point  quite

conclusively  to  the  man's guilt or  participation  in  the

crime.   The  background of this man, Zulfikar,  is  that  he

became  a drug addict at the age of 14.  I understand  he  is

now  about 31 or 32 years of age.  He has been in and out  of

drug  rehabilitation centres from the age of 14.  So he is  a

confirmed drug addict.  He has not been able to get any  jobs

and his life has been something which I think very few people

would wish for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judicial Commissioner, in his judgement, says, "He

cannot be so simple.  I cannot imagine that he is so simple."

But,  unfortunately, I do not see that any evidence was  laid

before the Court or the Court was informed of his background.

I  do  not think we need expert medical opinion but it  is  a

known  fact that someone who is given to drug taking  over  a

period  of time will have his mental faculties affected,  his

power to think carefully and to rationalise.  He becomes weak-minded and particularly, and I say this again, vulnerable  to

people who try to use him or exploit him.  It is unfortunate.

I  do not know whether the background was brought before  the

Court  but  I  cannot see anything in the  judgement  of  the

Judicial  Commissioner that suggests that his background  was

placed before the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts, as I understand from the Judicial

Commissioner's judgement, are that whilst he was drinking  at

a  pub  in Changi Village, somebody whom he had met, I  think

probably   in  prison  or  in  some  rehabilitation   centre,

approached him and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



asked  him whether he was employed.  He said, "No, I  am  not

employed.   I have not got a job."  And he asked, "Would  you

like  a  job?" and he said, "Yes."  The man later  telephoned

him  and  said,  "Would you go out and pick up something  and

deliver  it?"   It was thus that he became involved  in  this

transaction  or activity that landed him in  Court.   He  was

asked to deliver it to a particular address but, before that,

he  had to go and pick it up from somebody.  When he went  to

pick  it up, he was given a bag with five bundles in  it  and

said,  "This  is  the bag which you have  to  deliver."   The

evidence  would  suggest that it was not  easily  visible  or

apparent  to  anyone, looking at the bag,  to  see  what  the

contents of the packages that were inside the bag.  As I have

said,  there  were five small packages.  I am told  that  the

packages,  when they were unwrapped, the officers had  to  go

through several layers of paper before they could come to the

drugs.  So, it was not clearly visible or apparent that there

was anything contraband inside those packages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the plastic bag containing these packages. Then,

he  was asked to call somebody and to get the directions from

that  man as to where he was to deliver it.  I would  be  the

first  to confess that any reasonable, rational minded person

would  have thought there was something fishy, there must  be

something  wrong.  But we are not dealing, as  I  have  said,

with  a  person who is fully competent in his power to  think

and to rationalise. It is a pity that no medical evidence was

called as to his faculty in that respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the number and was asked to take it to a block

and  that somebody would take it off from him.  When he  went

there, there was nobody there and he called that number,  and

he  was  then asked, first of all, to leave it in a  dustbin.

That must have put him on alert.  But again, he said that  he

did  not think about it.  He left it in the dustbin and  then

later on, he was asked to bring it up to the ninth floor.  He

took it up to the ninth floor. One would have thought that if

he had any power of thinking, he might have said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



"No,  I better get away from all this."  But here was  a  man

who  was  trying  to do a job which had been  given  to  him,

entrusted to him, and he thought that he should carry it out.

When  he  went up to the ninth floor, he was suddenly pounced

upon  by  CNB  officers.  When the packages  were  eventually

opened in the CNB office, they were found to contain 72 grams

of  heroin.   It is in these circumstances that the  man  was

charged with trafficking because the law provides that if you

are in possession of more than 2 grams of heroin, you will be

presumed to be trafficking and there will be a death sentence

if the quantity exceeds 15 grams, as it did in this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his arrest, he told the CNB officers the story

about how he came by it and what he was asked to do with  it.

And  the  Judicial Commissioner commented that  he  had  been

consistent  throughout.  He had said everything, he  had  not

tried  to hide anything.  There was some money found on  him.

Of  course, the suggestion immediately then was it must  have

been  the  proceeds  or profits from his activities  in  drug

trafficking.   But it was later confirmed by Singapore  Pools

Limited  that the man had really won a prize of  that  amount

that was found in his pockets.  At first when he told the CNB

where  he  had collected the money, that happened to  be  the

wrong  place, and so they could not confirm it, but Singapore

Pools  later  confirmed that that money was his prize  money.

There  was  also  evidence led by the CNB  officers  that  he

attempted  to  run and put up a violent struggle.   This  was

denied altogether by the man.  But it is unfortunate that the

Judicial Commissioner did not make a finding as to whether he

accepted  the  evidence  of the CNB  officers  that  the  man

attempted  to run.  Because if the man had attempted  to  run

and that there was that finding by the Judicial Commissioner,

that might point to knowledge on his part.  But that was  not

the  case.   There  was  no  such  finding  by  the  Judicial

Commissioner.   And the Judicial Commissioner  gave  him  the

benefit of the doubt as to the money that was found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, the Judicial Commissioner found that he

was in possession of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



drugs.   One could attack that, but I am not here  to  attack

that.   As I said, he had been found guilty on evidence which

the  court thought was enough.  But I am here simply  to  say

that in such circumstances, the death sentence should not  be

carried  out.  As I said, the Judicial Commissioner  did  not

appear  to  have been aware of his background  in  coming  to

these findings.  I think particular attention must be paid to

his  background and to obtaining some medical advice  on  his

critical faculties.  The Judicial Commissioner found, in  his

judgment, that the man said that his only intention was to do

his job, to hand the bag as he was instructed, to this caller

who had called him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judicial Commissioner goes on to say ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your time is

up.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam's allegations are

not  new.   In fact, he is mouthing allegations which  others

have made.  Quite understandably, Zulfikar's sister has taken

up  his brother's cause claiming that he is innocent.  But it

is  odd that there are others, like Mr Jeyaretnam and, as  he

has  also  mentioned, in cyberspace, people who  even  though

they  do not know the man  -  and this is by admission of  Mr

Jeyaretnam; he has not seen or interviewed the  man   -   and

yet he is standing here claiming that Mr Zulfikar is a simple

minded man. Mr Zulfikar is a naive man.  So he also joins the

bandwagon.  He did not say here in Parliament that the courts

have  made  a  mistake, but alluded to the possibility  of  a

miscarriage of justice.  That is the import of his statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that he is speaking up not only for Mr

Zulfikar but for other people in the same situation as  well.

By  saying that, if he implies that our courts have also made

other  mistakes  and  have  also  wrongly  convicted  accused

persons,  then  I must debunk that.  Because  all  of  us  in

Singapore  know  that our courts take their  jobs  seriously.

Our judges are reputed for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



their integrity and competence.  In fact, we have scored very

well in international polls.  And, indeed, there are checks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You neither have a right of reply,

nor to seek a clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Just a clarification, because ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Jeyaretnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The first point that must be

made  is that there are safeguards in our system and not just

in  the  court  system.   In cases where  there  is  a  death

penalty,   the  Attorney  General  will  give  his   opinion,

marshalling the trial judge's judgment, the Court of Appeal's

judgment,  if any, and also petitions for clemency that  have

been  filed.  And then he will carefully study all these  and

render  his  considered  opinion  to  Cabinet  for  Cabinet's

consideration  to recommend to the President.   That  is  the

first  point.  And indeed in this case, due process has taken

its  course  because  Mr Zulfikar was tried  by  the  learned

Judicial  Commissioner in a trial court.  He was  represented

by  counsel of his choice who, if it was material, could have

adduced  evidence as to the state of mind or mental condition

of Mr Zulfikar, including the fact that he may be naive.  But

this was not done.  And then, of course, the Court of Appeal,

with  a  panel  of three Judges, considered  all  the  points

carefully and decided that the decision should stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is not for us in Parliament to discuss

cases,  because Parliament is not the Judiciary.  Because  if

Members  of  Parliament  are free to  bring  up  cases,  then

political  parties and Members of Parliament who are  unhappy

with   court   decisions  will  raise  them  in   Parliament.

Parliament, as a separate organ of state, should not  discuss

decisions of our courts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam also alludes to the use of

presumptions.   Yes, indeed, there are some  presumptions  in

the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act.   But  let  me  say  that  every

presumption  that  has  been introduced  has  been  carefully

thought  through.  The presumptions have been introduced  for

specific purposes.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam will know that even

in the operation of the presumptions and how they are applied

in  the  law,  they are applied carefully.  For example,  the

courts have said that a man should not be convicted based  on

a  presumption following another presumption.  In this  case,

even  though there was an operation of a presumption, it  was

not  just  the operation of a presumption alone that resulted

in  Mr  Zulfikar's conviction.  Because, first and  foremost,

the  prosecution had to prove that he had possession  of  the

drugs,   and possession includes knowledge.  In other  words,

the  prosecution had to adduce evidence to show  that,  given

all  the circumstances of the case, Mr Zulfikar knew that  he

was  carrying  drugs.  And indeed this was gone through  very

carefully,  both at the trial judge's stage and also  at  the

Court  of  Appeal  stage.  The facts were all  examined  very

carefully.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam has mentioned some of these

facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court's decision was that, based on these facts, it

was wholly unconvincing to believe that Zulfikar did not know

that  he was carrying drugs.  Why would he take drugs from  a

person  he did not know?  Why would he be carrying the  drugs

for  over three hours from Sengkang to Yishun in a taxi?  Why

would he wait for telephone calls without inquiring who  that

person was or what he would get out of the transaction?   Why

would  he not be suspicious, given the fact that he was asked

to  do  so many things; first, to put the drugs in a dustbin,

and  then  to  bring  the drugs up to the  ninth  floor?   Of

course,  the  simple rebuttal to that by  Mr  Jeyaretnam  and

those  of his ilk will be that he is a simple-minded man,  he

is  a  naive man, he is a gullible man.  But imagine  if  you

take  that tack for all accused persons who suffer  from  the

penalty of the law, including the death penalty, then I think

Singapore will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



not,  today,  enjoy  the  standard  of  law  and  order   and

reputation for safety which we enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other societies which will primarily look at

the  circumstances of the accused persons, both  present  and

past.   In fact, some societies will dig up the past  history

of an accused person, how he was mistreated by his father, by

his  peers and so forth and then say, "Let's be soft on him".

But  I would remind Mr Jeyaretnam and others of his kind that

what  is really important is to look at the impact of heinous

crimes  on both society and on the persons directly affected;

in other words, the real victims in the case.  In the case of

drug  trafficking, we are very clear who these  are  -  lives

which  are  wasted, many of them in their prime. And  through

the wasting of addicts' lives, the vicarious wasting of lives

of families who are affected as well.  Can we go soft on drug

traffickers?  I would say no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, do we therefore not comply with the

law?   We  do not do that.  Our laws on drug trafficking  are

indeed tough  -  draconian.  But they must be so, because  we

are dealing with a very serious problem,  a problem that many

other  countries are still grappling with, unable  to  get  a

handle  on.  And these drug traffickers and others who peddle

drugs do not care very much about the effect of their actions

on those who become addicted to drugs.  Drug is big money and

people  who  are desperate for big money will do  such  acts.

And indeed CNB is working hard to be on top of the situation.

I  think  Mr Jeyaretnam must know of recent press reports  of

how drugs have been trafficked into Singapore through various

means,  how  even  in  the  regional  countries,  drugs   are

clandestinely produced.  I think that is the context in which

we  must  view, not just this case, but also other  cases  of

drug traffickers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Jeyaretnam mentions is the

lottery winnings.  The point to note here is that even though

it  was discovered, after the Court of Appeal had decided  on

the  appeal,  that  indeed  he did  win  some  money  through

lottery, this was not a material consideration in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



decision  of the trial judge.  In fact, the trial judge  said

that  he was prepared to give the defence counsel the benefit

of  the doubt that these were lottery winnings.  But that was

not  a  material consideration because the way  the  law  was

applied  was,  as  I mentioned just now, the prosecution  had

proven possession of drugs with knowledge beyond a reasonable

doubt, because all the defence counsel had to do was to  cast

a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge.  But given the fact

of  the circumstances in which he was carrying the drugs, the

fact  that he had the drugs for three hours, which means that

he had ample opportunity to examine what he was carrying, and

given  the fact that he himself was a drug addict  -  he  was

in  fact  arrested way back, his first criminal  offence,  in

1985  for theft, after which he had a string of criminal  and

drug antecedents, and then he was in the DRC on four separate

occasions   -  given that background, does Mr Jeyaretnam  and

other  people  not think that he would, in  fact,  know  that

something was amiss?  In fact, he said that he felt something

amiss.  He knew that he was carrying drugs.  And even  if  he

did  not  know, as the Court of Appeal said, he was  wilfully

blind  to  that fact.  This cannot be a defence  because  you

cannot prove knowledge on the part of the accused.  But  what

the court can do is to look at all the circumstances of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



case  and  then  conclude that it is beyond reasonable  doubt

that  he had that knowledge.  When the prosecution had proven

that,  only then did the presumption kick in.  And  then  the

presumption says that if you are carrying more than  2  grams

of  diamorphine, you are presumed to be trafficking in drugs,

unless you can show, on a balance of probabilities, that  you

were  not trafficking in drugs.  In other words, you have  to

show  that  you  probably  wanted  the  drugs  for  your  own

consumption.   Then you will not be charged for  trafficking.

That  is  how  the law operated.  That is how the presumption

operated in that context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other point is that ---

<div align="center"><b>RENTAL INCREASE ON HDB SHOPS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) how many Housing and Development Board  (HDB)

retailers had their rentals increased by more than 10% in the

recent  rental revision; (b) what are the justifications  for

such increases; (c) how does HDB compute market rentals;  and

(d)  what  measures are being taken by HDB to help  retailers

overcome the uncertain economic conditions.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  why there is a necessity to increase  rental  of

shophouses and industrial premises managed by the Housing and

Development Board in this time of economic slowdown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I address the issues raised by Members, allow me

to  give  the  background  of HDB's  rental  policy  for  its

commercial and industrial premises.  Prior to 1987,  HDB  let

out  these premises on monthly tenancies with rents fixed  at

the  point  of  letting.   Many of  the  older  tenants  were

resettlement cases who enjoyed concessionary rents.   On  the

other  hand,  there  were  some tenants  who  obtained  their

premises via tender and were paying market rents, which  were

much higher.  As there was only one rental adjustment between

1960  and  1987, there was great disparity in the  rents  for

similar HDB premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to all tenants doing business in HDB

premises,  and  to make HDB rents more responsive  to  market

conditions,  HDB  decided to gradually move  all  rentals  to

market.   In  1988,  HDB converted all monthly  tenancies  to

fixed-term tenancies and adjusted its rents at every  tenancy

renewal.   For  tenants who paid above the prevailing  market

rate,  HDB  would reduce their rents during tenancy  renewal.

Those  who  paid  below  the market would  have  their  rents

adjusted upwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tenants who were on subsidized rents, HDB has

staggered the rental increase towards prevailing market  rate

over 4 renewals, at 3-yearly intervals, ie, over 12 years, to

moderate the impact on the tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at June 2001, HDB had 8,400 commercial and 10,200

industrial  tenants.   Of these, 7,900 commercial  and  6,000

industrial  tenants were paying below market  rate.   On  the

other hand, 300 commercial and 4,200 industrial tenants  were

paying above market rents, because the market rate has fallen

over time.   At the point of tenancy renewal, HDB will adjust

the rents of both groups of tenants towards market rate.  For

example,  among  the  227  shop  tenants  who  renewed  their

tenancies  in  the  last three months, 70%  had  their  rents

maintained  or  reduced.  30% had their rental increased,  of

which  half had their rents adjusted upwards between 10%  and

35%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government recognizes that some HDB tenants are

facing  difficulties in view of the poor economic conditions.

Thus,  HDB  has  given rental rebates to its  commercial  and

industrial  tenants since December 1997 to  help  them  lower

their  business cost.  The current rebates consist  of  three

categories:  (a) an across-the board rebate;  (b)  a  further

rebate to reduce rental for tenants paying above market rate;

and  (c) a rebate arising from property tax reduction,  which

is  passed  on  by  HDB.  Taken together,  HDB  tenants  will

receive a rental rebate of 12% - 13% for Year 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in Parliament on 19th April 2001, HDB is

examining  whether and how it can provide further  assistance

to  HDB commercial and industrial tenants. HDB is expected to

complete its review before the end of this month.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked "how does HDB compute market

rentals?"  I would like to inform him that HDB engages a team

of  qualified  professional valuers to determine  the  market

rent   for  its  commercial  and  industrial  premises.    In

assessing  the  market  rent, the  valuers  would  take  into

account  recent  lettings  of  comparable  premises  in   the

vicinity, and make adjustments for the location, size and age

of  the  premises. HDB also allows tenants who do  not  agree

with  the assessed market rent to appeal for a rental  review

or to seek a separate assessment from the Chief Valuer.

<div align="center"><b>RENTING OF HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  the Housing and  Development  Board  is

prepared to waive or shorten the waiting period of 30  months

for  flat  owners, who have sold their flats due to financial

hardships, to rent a flat in mature estates or in areas  such

as  Sembawang  and  Woodlands Estates where  many  flats  are

unoccupied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing policy, an ex-lessee who has sold his

Home  Ownership  flat in the open market is not  eligible  to

rent  a flat from HDB for a period of 30 months from the date

of  sale.   This is to ensure that home owners  consider  the

implications  of selling their flats carefully before  making

the decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB understands that there will be households

who  may  be  in serious financial difficulties and  have  no

choice but to sell their flats.  For such cases, HDB may,  on

compassionate   grounds,  consider   waiving   the   30-month

debarment period on a case-by-case basis.

downward  price adjustment in response to the less  favorable

market  demand; and (ii) will take necessary action to ensure

that  delay  in  the sale of newly-completed flats  will  not

cause  prolonged delay in the payment of retention monies  to

its building contractors.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB offers flats in non-mature estates to applicants on

the  Registration  For Flats System (RFS) queue  through  its

quarterly selection exercises. As there is a time lag between

application and selection of flat, it is inevitable that some

flats  are  not  taken up during the selection exercises  for

various reasons.  These flats are being offered to applicants

in subsequent selection exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pricing of HDB flats, HDB reviews the prices of

its flats regularly to ensure that they remain affordable  to

Singaporean  households, especially young  couples  and  low-income  families. It also takes into account various  factors

such  as  the location and attributes of the flats,  and  the

prevailing prices of resale HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On payment to contractors, HDB informed me that payment

to  its  contractors is not related to the sale of the flats.

HDB's mode and timing of payment to its building contractors,

including the retention monies, are governed by the terms and

conditions  of  the building contracts between  HDB  and  its

contractors.  HDB  assured me that it  has  not  delayed  the

payments to its building contractors.

<div align="center"><b>STATISTICS ON SERIOUS CRIMES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  whether recent crime statistics show  that  an

increasing number of Malays are involved in serious crimes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Malays involved in serious crimes1 is on a

general  downward trend.  This downward trend  is  likely  to

continue for this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Malays arrested for serious crimes per

100,000 persons of the population decreased from 204 in  1998

to  178  in 1999 and 141 in 2000.  In addition, the  absolute

number of Malays arrested for serious crimes in 2000 was  the

lowest  in  3  years.  The crime statistics do  not  show  an

increasing number of Malays involved in serious crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, based on data for the year 2000, the national

rate  for  the number of locals2 arrested for serious  crimes

stood at 65 per 100,000 persons of the population, while that

for  the  Malay population was 141 per 100,000.   The  Police

<div align="center"><b>NETRUST</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology what is the  status

of  the development of Netrust and what is the current  usage

of Netrust in making payments for Government services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two Certification Authorities, or CAs, in

Singapore.  They are Netrust and ID.Safe.  CAs issue  digital

certificates  that allow parties involved  in  an  e-commerce

transaction  to  identify each other through  the  use  of  a

digital signature.  Industry feedback is that such validation

is  crucial  for the growth of secure and trusted e-commerce.

In Singapore, all CAs are subjected to a set of duties listed

in  the  Electronic Transaction Act.  They are also regulated

by IDA, which is the Controller of CAs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAs that are able to meet more stringent requirements,

which  include financial soundness, personnel integrity,  and

strict security controls and procedures, can also participate

in a voluntary licensing scheme.  Only CAs that meet the high

integrity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



security standards set up by IDA will be licensed. In return,

they are able to instil greater consumer confidence.  The use

of  digital signatures recently received a strong boost  when

both CAs in Singapore were awarded licences by IDA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netrust's digital certificates are currently used to

authenticate  some  Government transactions  such  as  custom

declarations,  and transfer of CPF funds.  Netrust's  digital

certificates  are also used in "GeBiz", the  Government  one-stop centre for procurement activities. However, we only need

to  use  digital certificates in Government e-services  where

strong   proof  of  identification  and  non-repudiation   is

required.    Many  Government  e-services  do   not   require

authentication  of  the  user; and  for  e-services  that  do

require  user identity, a simple PIN or password  requirement

is often sufficient.

replace  the  overhead electrical cable, which  is  a  common

sight in many older private estates, with underground cables.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of overhead cables to distribute electricity to

homes  from the cable mains was discontinued since  the  late

1970s.   However,  a number of older private housing  estates

are  still  being served by these overhead cables.  Singapore

Power  has no plans to replace these overhead cables as  they

are working well.  Residents currently served by the overhead

cables can switch to underground supply if they wish for  the

portion from the road into the house.   They can arrange  for

their  contractors  to  lay  lead-in  pipes  and  shift   the

electricity  in-take  points to the front  of  their  houses.

PowerGrid will then lay dedicated cables to these electricity

in-take  points  and  connect them to  the  underground  grid

outside the houses for a standard charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the estates or houses served by overhead cables are

redeveloped, the developers or house owners will be  required

to switch from overhead cables to underground supply.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of companies being wound-up has been

year and 155 in the first half of last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of small and medium companies being wound-up

has  also been decreasing.  72 companies with paid-up capital

of  $500,000 or less were wound-up in the first half of  this

proceedings)  was  raised  from $2,000  to  $10,000  only  in

September 1999.  Given the above statistics, there is no need

to  review  the  minimum debt level at this  point  in  time.

<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY RETIREMENT SCHEME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether his Ministry will consider removing the age limit  of

62  years  for  workers to qualify for participation  in  the

Supplementary  Retirement  Scheme  (SRS)  as  long  as   they

continue to work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding the age limit for participation in the SRS,

the  Government has to weigh the desire of those who want  to

withdraw their SRS savings as early as possible with the  tax

benefits, against those who want to contribute to the SRS for

as long as they wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair solution is to peg the age limit to the

prevailing statutory retirement age, currently 62. This means

that  beyond  age  62,  the SRS account  will  be  closed  to

contributions but the SRS savings will be freely withdrawable

without penalty, and will enjoy the concession of being taxed

only on 50% of the sum withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date on which SRS participants can start withdrawing

their  SRS  savings  is also the date new contributions  will

stop.   Otherwise there will be "round-tripping"  simply  for

the  purpose  of gaining the tax benefits without  subjecting

the contributions to the investment risks which justified the

50% tax concession on sums withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age limit for participating in SRS will rise along

with any rise in the statutory retirement age in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRS has just been introduced. The Government is

monitoring  its progress, and will introduce improvements  as

and when appropriate.  If the age limit for contributions  is

subsequently  adjusted to go beyond the statutory  retirement

age,  the  contributions may have to be subject to a  minimum

period before they may be withdrawn with tax concessions.

public should take to minimize the chances of them becoming a

victim of crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, each Police Division partners

the  community  through  the Community  Safety  and  Security

Programme  (CSSP) to enhance the safety and security  of  the

neighbourhood.    There  have  been  many   successful   CSSP

programmes  for  the  elderly.   For  example,  the   Central

Singapore  CDC,  which  has a high  concentration  of  senior

citizens,  especially  in the Kreta  Ayer,  Jalan  Besar  and

Kampong  Glam areas, started the "Care and Support  Programme

for  the  Elderly" to raise crime prevention awareness  among

its  elderly residents.  Through a series of crime prevention

talks - some of them conducted in dialects - the Police share

with   the  elderly  how  to  protect  themselves  and  their

valuables.   The elderly also form mutual support  groups  so

that the more able members will support and take care of  the

less  able.  If unfortunately an elderly falls prey to crime,

with  his/her consent, the Police would liaise with  the  CDC

for follow up on taking care of the victim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, the Police will in their house

visits  advise  family  members to play  an  active  role  in

inculcating "safe" habits to not only the elders but also all

members  of  the  family.  Some of these preventive  measures

include for example, avoiding wearing expensive jewellery  or

carrying  large  amounts of money, arranging for  someone  to

walk  the elderly home when returning home late, and avoiding

dark and deserted shortcuts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides crime prevention education and working with the

community, the Police regularly patrol the neighbourhood  and

look  out  in particular for the safety and security  of  the

elderly.  The Police also spare no efforts to solve the crime

and arrest the offenders, thereby sending a deterrent message

to other would-be offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, by working hand-in-hand with the community, we

have  managed to keep the crime rate against elderly  persons

low.   The  number of robberies committed on elderly  persons

decreased from 89 cases in 1998 to 84 cases in 1999,  and  67

cases in year 2000.  The number of serious assaults involving

elderly  victims  each year has also been  consistently  low,

with  16  cases in 2000.  Most of these cases  arose  out  of

disputes and misunderstanding within the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the community, the Home Team will work

hard towards our goal of a safe and secure best home for all.

<div align="center"><b>COMPUTER RADIATION IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health,  in view of the dangerous level of computer radiation

that  could  hurt  children, what his  Ministry  will  do  to

moderate the effect of intensive use of Internet learning  in

primary and secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre for Radiation Protection of the Health

Sciences Authority undertook a survey of radiation that could

possibly  be  emitted from computer monitors and the  central

processing units in computers in 1998.  The survey  indicated

that  the levels for both ionising radiation (such as x-rays)

and  non-ionising  radiation (such as UV,  electrostatic  and

magnetic fields) emitted were either non-detectable  or  well

below  international  safety limits.   This  survey  confirms

findings  from  similar studies done on  computers  in  other

countries  and  reviewed by the World  Health  Organisation's

International    Commission   on    Non-Ionising    Radiation

Protection. There is no radiation hazard associated with  the

use of computers.

<div align="center"><b>AIR-CONDITIONING CLASS C WARDS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health, in our overall effort to enhance the comfort level of

Singaporeans living in tropical conditions by providing  air-conditioning  in  work  places and public  transportation  at

negligible costs, will the Minister consider air-conditioning

Class  C  wards in public hospitals to offer comfort to  sick

patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public sector hospitals offer a range of wards to meet

different  needs.   Ward  classes A,  B1  and  B2+  are  air-conditioned.   Ward classes B2 and C are not  air-conditioned

but  are well ventilated and have ceiling fans.  Having  fans

instead  of  air-conditioning does not affect the quality  of

treatment  or the pace of recovery.  This is consistent  with

our  approach to concentrate on effective, up-to-date medical

treatment  at the Class B2 and C wards, and not be distracted

by frills and embellishments.
