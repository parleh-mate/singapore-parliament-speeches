                  </span>: Sir, the purpose of the resale levy
is to make a distinction on the amount of housing subsidy received
by a first-timer and a second-timer HDB buyer. Our priority is to
help Singaporean families get their first HDB flats. Those who have
never benefited from any housing subsidy should get more subsidy
than those who have already benefited once before. The resale levy
amount is in turn based on the flat type of the first subsidised
flat – the smaller the flat-type, the lower the levy.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question for the Minister.
Most families find it difficult – although they recognise that the resale
levy is necessary because there is a second subsidy – to finance
the resale levy component. Would MND consider helping them finance
that portion?</p>

with the concern that the Member has raised because some of my constituents
face similar problems, too. I have always shared with my colleagues
in HDB to try and exercise compassion where we can within the whole framework
of fairness. So long as the fundamental philosophy behind the levy
is not in conflict, we will try to assist where we can. Inevitably,
cases differ from each to the other, so we really need to look at
each individual case on its own merit.</p>

Sir, I thank the Minister for his answer. There are some families
who face difficulties in paying their resale levy. From what I understand,
the resale levy has to be paid in cash. Is it possible for them,
especially those who are lower income, to pay this in monthly instalments,
or to pay through the CPF?</p>

A supplementary question, Sir. I wonder whether Minister has considered
having a differentiation pricing for those who are first-time buyers
and those who are second-time buyers, so that upfront, buyers would already
know what it costs to buy a second time. Otherwise, some buyers
will be hit by the resale levy without even knowing about it.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, levies
are made known to flat sellers upfront. They have to sign a form
indicating that they understand what selling a flat entails. There
is no question of them not being aware of what the levy ought to
be. On the proposed alternative of different pricing so that second-timers
pay a presumably higher price than a first-timer: that is certainly
one alternative. But we would have to see what the first subsidised
flat was for a second-timer buyer. If we use the proposal made by
the Member, we will end up having to look at what was the buyer's
first subsidised flat – was it 3-room, 4-room or 5-room? It can
be rather complicated and confusing.</p>

Sir, I would like to ask the Minister this: there is a perception
among the public that there is a high proportion of Permanent Residents
(PRs) who is also eligible for 3-rooms flats, and that creates competition.
For many low-income Singaporeans, 3-room flats represent soft entry
level for them into the property market. If we looked at the Cash-over-Valuation
(COV) for 3-room flats today, we will find that COVs for 3-room
flats are much higher than COVs for 4- and 5-room flats. If the
COV is taken into account, I think the price of a 3-room flat would
be quite similar to the prices for 4- and 5-room flats. This also
makes it difficult for many of our residents currently in 4- to
5-room flats who wish to downgrade to a smaller flat, as there is
a huge COV barrier for them.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, as
I had said earlier, our priority is to help Singaporean families
own their first flat. For entry-level flats, either 3- or 2-room
flats, affordability is not an issue. Here, the Member is obviously
talking about a second-timer – someone who had bought a first flat,
sold it for whatever reason, and is now trying to come back into
the market, but is facing difficulties. The data do not quite suggest
so. I have been looking at the median income of the latest batch
of BTO flat applicants. For 3-room flat applicants, the median income
is about $2,500 per month. For resale flats, the latest data show
that the median income is $3,000, which is not significantly different
from that of the BTO applicants.</p>

HDB flats, we will help practically every Singaporean family to
own their first flat. We must also tell them, "Buy within your budget
and please keep the HDB flat. If you want to upgrade, that is a
good development but make sure you do your sums, and then, you should
not have a problem upgrading". I think the difficulty for some families
is, for whatever reason, they decide to cash out and then, they
get into serious trouble. While we are sympathetic, I believe the preventive
approach is still important. Let us try to advise our constituents,
"Hold on to your flats. If you need to cash out, it is for good
reasons, for example, to upgrade. If you have genuine financial
difficulty then downgrade and we would try to facilitate and help you
as much as we can." </p>

                  </span>: Sir, this
is one view in the market place. We have to be fair to PRs, too.
The fact is that we see value in granting PR status to some foreigners
– they come here, they make a contribution to the economy and they
need a place to live, too. Offering them the opportunity to buy
a resale flat to stay in is a fair proposition, I think.</p>

boost COVs or resale prices? I have often looked at the breakdown
of prices which buyers pay in the resale market, according to groups
such as "PRs" and "private property owners", who sell their private
properties and so they need a place to stay and they buy an HDB
flat. The data are quite distinct. Typically, the PRs pay the lowest
COVs among the groups we track. The highest COVs are often paid
by the former private property owners, especially those who sell
their private properties in en bloc sales. Probably with a lot of
cash and still needing a roof over their heads, they are the ones
who bid up the COVs. Let us not unfairly blame a particular group
for forcing higher prices in the resale market.</p>

we are familiar with the problem. In the last two, three years, the
imbalance in supply and demand resulted in higher pricings. All
my efforts in the last seven months have been precisely to attack
this problem. I think there are some initial results, so please
be patient. I am quite sure the market will stabilise in due course.</p>

Sir, the Changi Motorsports Hub (CMH) and Sports Hub are different

conditions agreed with the Singapore Sports Council (SSC).</p>

the market conditions recovered. If we had insisted on proceeding
despite the high financing cost in 2009, the cost to Government
would have been significantly higher.</p>

open to pursuing such partnerships where the strengths of both the public

for the general public. In doing so, we must ensure that the public
interest is safeguarded, as we have done for both the Sports Hub
and Changi Motorsports Hub projects.</p>

Sir, I thank the hon. Member for his supplementary question. For
the Changi Motosports Hub, like all other private projects, we will
have to evaluate the financial strength of the consortium and also
their professional ability to execute the project. This will be
a key to us safeguarding a public interest to ensure that the projects
will go ahead. Having said that, we accept that for all private
projects that involve land sales and the private operator taking
ownership and responsibility to build those projects, there will
still be some inherent risks as per any other private commercial
projects. </p>

Sir, a follow-up question for the Minister. In some countries where
they have no reserves or they have tapped the debt capacity to a
large extent, private-public parternership might be understandable.
Singapore is rated triple A.
We have a lot of reserves. What is the value of going into private
sector financing a project where conceivably their interest rates
will be higher than the Government's?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, let me explain why we went into the public-private partnership
for the Sports Hub. In the development of the Sports Hub, we knew that
it was a very significant project that involved not just the construction
of a new National Stadium. More important than just the infrastructural
development, we were very concerned that we should bring in the
expertise to run the whole project in terms of the programming subsequent
to the completion of the project. In this, we want to make sure
that whoever runs the project for the programming portion, has the ownership
to make sure that they do their best and this is why we have structured
the scheme such that for every year after the project is completed,
as they run the programmes, we will reward them or we give them
the Unitary Payment according to their ability to bring in programmes
for us.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0583c770-5965-4c75-982d-fdd66e86aab9">
                  <a name="id-ef463e92-8919-4ece-b942-5c7fafe4e855__id-0583c770-5965-4c75-982d-fdd66e86aab9"><!--a--></a>While we have very good
financial standing amongst the community, this may not be the only
factor that we consider. So, for example, what we have seen now
after the initiation of the Sports Hub project is that, while they
are building the infrastructural part of the Sports Hub, they have
already commenced the programming component to bring in some of
the big sports events. Some of these sports events require a long
lead time to do so. So, we will be quietly confident that once the
project is completed in 2014, not only will the stadium and the
infrastructure facilities be ready, more importantly, the rest of
the programming in terms of bringing in events will also run concurrently
to meet the schedule and the expectations that we have set for them.
So, it is on this basis that beyond the financing cost, we have
gone for a public-private partnership in order to bring people with
the expertise to run some of these programmes and to bring in some of
these mega events to fully utilise the capacity of the new arena
beyond what we ourselves may be able to do, by ourselves.</p>

Prof Faishal Ibrahim asked what the Quality of Services (QoS) standards
are for public bus providers and whether these standards are still

Singapore. </p>

(PTC) regulates the service quality of basic bus services by imposing
a set of QoS standards on public transport operators (PTOs). These
cover a comprehensive range of 20 requirements that focus on areas
important to commuters' travel experience. Examples of these requirements
include adherence to bus trip schedules, minimum service frequency,
maximum allowable bus loading levels, and bus breakdown and accident
rates, amongst others. The detailed requirements stipulated by the
QoS standards are publicly available on PTC's website. The Public Transport
Operators' performances against these standards are also released
by the PTC every six months. </p>

important part of the overall public transport regulatory framework.
These standards directly regulate basic bus services, ensuring that
service levels are maintained. The operators cannot therefore attempt
to reduce costs by compromising the quality of their services, as
they try to increase profits under our fare-cap regime. The end
result is that the operators are incentivised to contain costs while being
required, by regulation, to maintain good service levels. In view
of its important role, the PTC regularly reviews the QoS standards
to ensure that they remain relevant and appropriate. This is done
taking into account the policy intention of improving our bus services
to encourage more to switch to public transport, while maintaining
the long-term sustainability of the bus industry. </p>

may seem small, I can assure Members that the PTC and LTA fully
expect the operators to take non-compliance seriously. The amounts
should also be seen in context. A penalty has to be commensurate
with the nature of the non-compliance, and the degree of impact
it has on commuters. Penalties range from $100 per day per non-compliant
bus service, to $10,000 per month for each non-compliant standard
at the bus fleet operations level; so the numbers vary.</p>

2010 to May 2011, SBS Transit and SMRT were penalised $100 for each
of the 10 instances of non-compliance to standards that are measured
at the individual service level, on a daily basis. This is a small
percentage of non-compliance, considering the number of days in
these six months, and the more than 260 basic bus services between
the two operators. Had the PTOs performed more poorly, they would
have faced stiffer financial penalties according to the number of instances
of non-compliance, and which specific standards they failed.</p>

PTOs have generally been able to meet the QoS standards in recent
periods; we note that the operators have topped up efforts to improve
service performance.
They have already embarked on renewing and expanding their bus fleets, with
SBS Transit and SMRT recently announcing that they will bring in
additional 600 and 238 new buses respectively over the coming two

so that together with the new buses, they will be better able to
meet the QoS standards. </p>

Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for her response.
Three supplementary questions. Could the Minister of State give
some details of the service failures which merited the fines of
$700 and $300 respectively? Second, whether such fines are meaningful
in the context of the PTOs' operating revenue and also in the context
of the cost that must have been incurred to administer this system
of imposing funds? And, finally, if not, what the Minister will do
to ensure that fines levied in future will be meaningful?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
would like to thank Mr Nair for his questions. Since he has raised
the question, it would be useful to share with Members a little
bit more about the kind of standards that the operators are required
to meet. I mentioned earlier that there are 20 requirements in the
standards. Let me just share one of the standards so that Members
have a sense of what the operators are required to do.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9184b012-9708-46a7-9995-d13b94ef9190">
                  <a name="id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-9184b012-9708-46a7-9995-d13b94ef9190"><!--a--></a>Standard 1.2, for example,
tracks whether buses stick to their scheduled departures from the
terminals or the interchanges. There is an allowance of five minutes
given for each bus that is supposed to leave according to schedule.
And not less than 85% of the departures must be within this five-minute
allowance. So that is one standard. And when we look at the service
failures, this is one of the more frequent standards that they fail
to meet. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df4527b4-405d-43d6-8b34-0275110d24c6">
                  <a name="id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-df4527b4-405d-43d6-8b34-0275110d24c6"><!--a--></a>Another standard, that is
also useful for us to know more about, monitors bus availability.
For example, standard 4.4. There are several sub standards in standard
4.4. One of them states that 100% of all bus trips must attain headways
of not more than 30 minutes. So, all bus services must come within
30 minutes. Off-peak, more than 85% must come within 20 minutes.
At peak hours on the weekdays, if they are basic bus services, more
than 80% must be within 10 minutes and if they are feeder buses,
more than 90% must be within 10 minutes. So that is standard 4.4,
that monitors and tracks availability for the different bus services
at different times of the day, and whether they are feeder buses
or basic bus services. This set of standards was introduced in 2006
and they have consistently been reviewed and also tightened progressively.
The QoS standards were last tightened in August 2009. For example,
for standard 4.4 for feeder buses, before August 2009, we only required
85% to come within 10 minutes and then from August 2009, we raised
it to 90% within 10 minutes.</p>

penalties meaningful; are they of the right amounts? It is a very
relevant question and something which the PTC also looks carefully at.
The purpose of the framework really is to spur improvement and it
is useful to see if indeed it has helped to do so. To share with
Members of the House – in the first full year of the penalty framework
being introduced, which was in October 2007, between the period
December 2007 and November 2008, there were more than 100 instances
of non-compliances. More than 100 instances of non-compliance for
which the PTC then levied penalties on the operators. This created
considerable pressure on the operators. They had to buck up and
make sure that by the next six monthly review, they would do better. And
so, as it turns out, for the second and third full years since implementation
of the penalty framework, the number of non-compliances fell to
below 10 in each of those years. In the fourth year, which is the
period that we are talking about, in the first six months, there
have been exactly 10 instances of non-compliance, and so, it is
an uptrend. What this means is a clear indication that more needs
to be done, and the operators are aware of this.</p>

the overall performance – and we understand that here are the standards
and here is the penalty framework that tries to get the operators
to improve – I would say that the standards are fairly stringent
and that the operators have had to keep up as much as they can.</p>

How does the Minister of State persuade us that the operators will
make a concerted effort to improve their services if the amounts
of fines are so low? Some of the figures that the Minister of State
provided do not seem to square with the experience on the ground.
Let me give a specific example of feeder bus service No. 291 in
Tampines. Perhaps it falls into the 10% category because the benchmark
mentioned is that 90% are required to –</p>

I ask the Minister of State where SBS has not shown improvement
in meeting the service standards for a particular route and particular

the field by allowing other operators to also tender for those routes?
My second question is: would the Minister of State also consider
introducing the mini-buses that we see in Hong Kong with the public
light bus services? These are really mini-buses that offer faster
and more frequent services at peak hours and more reliable timetables
for commuters, especially if the present operators may not be offering
those services.</p>

Sir, I thank the Member for her questions. First, on how the PTC
satisfies itself that, indeed, the performance standards that the
operators are required to meet, have been met. In fact, all the
operators have computerised fleet operations and management systems.
Every month, these performance reports are drawn from the databases
and they are submitted to the PTC. There is quite a lot of data, which
is why the PTC takes six months to go through all of them. There
is also an audit trail. The PTC regularly audits the reporting processes
and the systems to ensure that the instances of non-compliance are
properly captured. I would like to assure the Member that there
is a proper system for doing so. Of course, as an additional layer
of checks, the PTC also conducts multiple on-site spot checks every
month to ascertain that the performance data actually matches commuters'
experience on the ground. So, I would like to give the Member that
assurance.</p>

I would like to thank the Minister of State for her reply to the
three separate questions. I think the point that was made was really
the small penalties of $700 and $300. This has to be seen in the
context where the public looks at operators which are running practically
as quasi-monopolies. They look at the operating revenue, the numbers
that they see in those balance sheets, and the fines, and there
is a very significant mismatch. I think that is the issue that the
public is concerned about – that these are not even slaps on the
wrist. While I appreciate the Minister of State going through this
lengthy policy control process – </p>

Sir, as I shared earlier, the purpose of the framework really is
to spur improvement. So, the real test of effectiveness is whether
it has spurred improvement. As I shared with Members earlier, it
is not as though the instances of non-compliance have not been higher
in the past. They had been. Because the PTC had made the message
clear to the operators, they have had to buck up. As I shared earlier
also, the trends will indicate that the operators once again need
to pay greater attention to the service standards. Even though the
amounts seem to be small, by tracking those numbers, we know whether
the operators have responded. If they do not take it seriously,
it does not mean that we have no other avenues of making our views
known to them; it does not mean that we have no other avenues of
asking them to improve. So, we have to look at the framework of
penalties in the whole context.</p>

                  </span>: The
number of new Employment Passes (EPs) issued annually for foreign
professionals in the Financial Services industry has averaged 4,500 in
the last decade, rising from 3,300 in 2001 to 8,700 in 2010. The
net increase of EP holders in the Financial Services industry over
the decade was 9,600, taking into account the outflow of EP holders.
Local employment in the financial services sector also grew by over
66,000 over the 10 years to December 2010, as businesses expanded
in Singapore.</p>

significant steps in recent years to moderate the demand for foreign
manpower. We have phased in the measures, so as to give time for businesses
to adjust, upgrade productivity, and rely less on manpower additions
to achieve business growth. For approval of EPs, we have introduced
higher qualifying salary requirements since July 2011, followed
by further measures that will be effective from this month, that
is, January 2012. The revised salary criteria have been accompanied
by the tightening of educational criteria. The changes are aimed
at ensuring that EP holders recruited are of a good calibre, are
able to contribute effectively to our economy, and to preserve a
level playing field for Singapore professionals (PMEs). </p>

the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) recently
released revised guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in October 2011.
The guidelines, which aim at preserving a strong Singapore core
in our workforce, call for employers to make reasonable efforts
to attract and consider Singaporeans for job positions on merit,
and to train them and develop their potential and careers. The efforts
should include working with educational institutions, career centres
and recruitment agencies to attract and recruit Singaporeans. </p>

measures taken together will emerge over the coming months and the
coming years. We will monitor the impact carefully so as to ensure
the right balance, just as we will continue to remain aware, to
listen out to the feedback from the various communities. In particular, our
policy changes must not end up hurting the interests of the very
same Singaporean employees we are trying to help. Without reasonable
access to foreign manpower, both local and global companies will
not find it viable to operate out of Singapore, or curb their expansion
here. This will lead to the loss of good jobs for Singaporeans at
all levels. Local SMEs with the potential to expand will also be
hampered if they cannot find enough or the right manpower for their operations,
including S Pass and EP holders.</p>

changes to improve the foreign workforce profile, we need to monitor
the overall economic climate and we have to take pains to ensure
that we do so in a sensible and calibrated manner, and provide companies
with active support to upgrade their operations and train up their
people. We will keep this approach of taking measured steps to manage
the growth of the foreign workforce, so that employers are not forced
to cut back on good jobs for Singaporeans.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for his reply. During the last crises

EP and S Passes increased by 54,000, a 20.8% total net increase.

framework is any different from the previous framework in buffering
resident PMETs against job loss during an economic downturn?</p>

                  </span>: I
thank the Member for the question. The revised framework is different
from the framework before. The framework, currently as proposed,
aims at a few things: one, we remain committed to having an open
and diverse workforce, but we do recognise that given where we are
today, we need to moderate that overall growth. The measures are
put in place to tighten both the quality of the foreign workers
and foreign talent coming into Singapore. We are also putting in place
measures so that it levels the playing field. These measures will
take effect in the coming months and years. But there are many other
measures that are put in place to facilitate the maintenance of
employment. For example, in the 2008 crisis, we put in place various
measures including the Jobs Credit Scheme which was very significant.
In fact, I think we had done fairly well in making sure that despite
the very serious economic crisis globally, we had managed to maintain
good employment numbers. Employment did go down but in the overall
context of things, we maintained fairly good employment numbers,
and kept unemployment relatively manageable. Some of the measures
put in place had enabled the economy to grow. The important thing
is that having economic growth allows jobs to be created and to
be maintained for our people. </p>

continue to track carefully. We are aware that the economic circumstances
are becoming difficult, and we are looking at various measures that
were put in place previously and at other new measures that might
be put in place. In due course, we will announce them when the time

Mr Speaker, two supplementary questions. The Minister of State did
not reply to the second part of my Parliamentary Question about which
top three countries the EP holders came from. Secondly, would the
Minister consider some inter-Ministry liaison or assessment when
approving such EPs? For example, in the financial sector, we would
need to consider if such individuals are qualified not just on the
basis of the salaries and educational qualifications. We can see that the financial
markets in Europe are currently experiencing job losses and we do
not want that to affect the employment of Singaporeans here.</p>

relevant one, about the different Ministries exchanging information
to make sure that we are taking in the right people. Salaries and
educational qualifications are two important criteria but there
are also other factors that we use in our assessment. However, we
are mindful of the feedback and will take that into consideration
when considering the people that we bring in. It might be useful
to note that even as we grow and bring in some of these foreigners,
it has allowed – and I think it is important to emphasise this –
our companies to do well and to be able to grow, and that growth
has also enabled Singaporean jobs to be created.</p>

professional jobs for residents have also increased, for example,

thank the Minister of State for the reply. The Government has always
touted foreign labour accessibility as a key competitive advantage
that creates jobs for Singaporeans. But has this accessibility come
at the expense of retrenched Singaporeans? Mr Eugene Wong's story
in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> of 16 December 2011 showed the
general trend of retrenchment but it is not directly related too
much to this foreign labour market accessibility.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
having an open and diverse workforce is important for Singapore,
both for local companies and foreign companies. Local companies
can choose to stay here or to go somewhere else where perhaps costs
are cheaper and more competitive. In the same way, foreign companies
can choose to go to other countries as well because it is very competitive.
However, many of our companies do base themselves here and grow
from Singapore to beyond, and many companies actually do come to
Singapore to invest, setting up regional headquarters and so on.
All these create jobs for Singaporeans. This is something we are
mindful of. It allows the economy to grow but at the same time we
also recognise that there are externalities. So, depending on the
situation, we would have to moderate, as we are doing now, the growth
of the foreign workers and talent in Singapore.</p>

a range of people will be retrenched. We track that carefully. On
balance, what we are quite particular about is that economic growth
and ensuring companies grow and do well will continue to allow jobs
to be created for Singaporeans. And our unemployment and employment
numbers do show that these have a significant effect. We need to
be mindful to make sure that we do not become excessively rigid.
It is a very fine balance to ensure that correct policies are put
in place so that these companies remain competitive and, at the
same time, can make sure that Singaporeans remain the core of the
workforce.</p>

the financial industry is growing. The industry has grown quite
significantly, and local employment in financial services, as I
mentioned earlier, also grew by 66,000 over the last 10 years. This
is quite considerable. This is also reflected by the choices that students
take up in the universities. I do not have the specific numbers
but we do see more students becoming interested and taking up business
modules. In terms of the specific figures, I will get back to the
Member on the breakdown.</p>

query, the 21,300 skilled jobs reported in the 2010 EDB Annual Report
refers to the number of skilled jobs that EDB-supported companies

in Singapore. The eventual mix of local and foreign skilled workers
will depend on a range of factors, such as the companies' ability
to identify and recruit the required workforce locally and the prevailing
labour market conditions at the time of the recruitment. Based on
the Census of Manufacturing Activities between 2005 and 2009, more
than seven in 10 skilled jobs in the manufacturing sector were filled
by locals.</p>

EDB also works with the industry and other stakeholders to ensure
that locals are equipped with the appropriate skills for the jobs created.
In addition to aligning the curriculum of our tertiary institutions

and on-the-job training for individuals. These programmes include
the Initiatives in New Technology (INTECH) grant which co-funds
training in new technology and new growth areas, as well as its Strategic
Attachment and Training (STRAT) Programme which funds overseas training with
leading companies. On average, 3,500 locals were trained annually

Sir, as I mentioned in my reply earlier, more than seven in 10 skilled
jobs in the manufacturing sector was filled by locals. In terms
of recruitment, of course, companies, all things being equal, would
prefer Singaporeans. And we have programmes in place to make Singaporeans
ready to take on these jobs, for example, the two programmes that
I mentioned just now ‒ INTECH and STRAT. So Singaporeans are ready.</p>

we have to be realistic. For example, when we were attracting animation
investments into Singapore, these investments did take place very
quickly. The lead time for bringing in these investments is quite
short and so we did not have enough time to send Singaporeans to
university and for overseas attachments to build up the skills base.
In such situations, of course, we do allow the companies to bring
in foreign talent and workers first to start the investments in
Singapore, and then we will produce the pipeline of Singaporeans
to take these jobs. But for other investments, for example, in solar
panels, these took some time to build up the factory. In the meantime, we
have the time to train our local workers, particularly those from
the semi-conductor electronic sector, to undertake these jobs. So
the situation would depend on the sector. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, from 2003 to 2010, an average of 1,400 applicants

Sir, during the last downturn in 2009, MCYS, together with the National
Council of Social Service (NCSS), worked with Voluntary Welfare Organisations
(VWOs) and Community Development Councils (CDCs) to ensure that Singaporeans
are able to receive assistance and access essential social services.
To help them cope with increased demands and challenges in fundraising,
we provided them more resources, including setting up a $10 million
contingency fund for VWOs.</p>

outlook, we have started preparing contingency plans. Should there
be another downturn, we will work with and provide more resources
to the CDCs and VWOs like the Family Services Centres (FSCs) to
step up their services. They will be given greater flexibility to
extend financial help and subsidies. </p>

we will monitor their caseloads very closely and activate additional
funding quickly should there be signs of more Singaporeans seeking

to educate our students to be sensitive and socially responsible
on religious matters. </p>

schools emphasise the values of respect, responsibility, care and
harmony in fostering racial and religious harmony in Singapore.
Students are equipped with knowledge of the different religious
beliefs, festivals and practices as well as skills for identifying
their own stereotyping and prejudices. Students are also taught
ways to demonstrate respectful behaviour in their actions and words. </p>

diversity amongst the various ethnic communities in Singapore is
reinforced through subjects like Social Studies and History. In
learning about the significance of the various customs and practices,
students will come to respect the customs and practices as unique
to each community. Students also learn about the causes and consequences
of the Maria Hertogh riots and the 1964 race riots to realise the
importance of the continual efforts by every Singaporean to ensure
racial and religious harmony. Students learn about the various measures
put in place in our society to promote inter-racial and inter-religious
understanding, such as creating common space and shared experiences,
formation of Inter-Racial Confidence Circles and Harmony Circles. </p>

supplementary questions for the Minister. I just want to know whether
MOE monitors the effectiveness of the programmes, firstly. Second question,
at what level do we start to introduce these programmes that the
Minister mentioned? Thirdly, if such an incident happened in real
life, are they brought into the classrooms for discussion as case
studies so that the students are even more aware of real-life examples?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I think the first
point on the effectiveness of the programmes: indeed in all the programmes
that we run, monitoring the effectiveness of the programmes and
how they are run form a part of the teaching and learning aspect,
and part of the way we evaluate the effectiveness of our teaching.
His second point was: at what level do we start? We start right
at the very beginning, at the primary school level and, indeed,
even in preschools. Preschools do teach some of these values as
well. On his third question about actions that merit discussion
in the classrooms: these are opportunities which schools and teachers
will take to discuss and reinforce the values. This is part and
parcel of the ongoing discussion and ongoing review.</p>

                  </span>: The programmes that are in place
have two broad components, one is the formal curriculum. In the
formal curriculum, as Members are aware, we have a national curriculum.
Whichever school that our students go to, they will follow the formal
curriculum where all the basic concepts and basic values are taught
in each and every school. Now over and above that, there are programmes
that are outside of the formal curriculum in CCAs, in Community
Involvement Programmes as well as school-based programmes. In these
school-based programmes, different schools have different approaches
to inculcate those values.</p>

there are schools, for instance, that have twinning programmes with
other schools to help our students interact more extensively with students
from other schools. In others, they run pen-pal programmes and other
ways to encourage students to learn all these values. One school,
for instance, organised special trips to Little India and to Kampong
Glam to help our students learn and recognise the differences of
different customs and practices. So indeed, schools do have a wide
range of different programmes to help our students learn these values.</p>

Teo) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Baey for his question. The parent relief
recognises the role of children in supporting their parents in old
age. The relief is granted as a fixed dollar amount with respect
to each elderly person who is a parent, regardless of how many children
he has. The dollar amount is fixed, as it would be inequitable for
families with more children to enjoy a larger benefit than those
with fewer children. An elderly person with no children also enjoys
no such benefit. </p>

relief to more children means that each claimant would only have
a fractional share of the available relief. In practice, this would
raise many difficulties in implementation. Often the duty of caring
for the parent is shared in various ways among children and their
spouses, and sometimes grandchildren as well. Depending on the circumstances
of each family, care can be given in monetary or non-pecuniary forms
and may not be easily quantifiable. There will be practical challenges in
apportioning the parent relief in an equitable manner. Further,
an equal apportionment to all involved may result in not a very
meaningful amount of relief, including for the child who may be
the most significantly engaged in supporting the parent. Nonetheless,
the Ministry of Finance will study this idea further and engage
in consultations to see if it can be implemented practically.</p>

about 151,000 taxpayers claimed a total of $1.16 billion of parent
relief. This cost the Government about $106.4 million in tax revenue
foregone. As for the Member's question on extending parent relief
to all children, there will be minimal tax revenue impact if the
proposal is to share the current quantum of parent relief among
all children. However, the revenue impact will be significant if
every child or grandchild can each claim the full amount of relief
for supporting his parent or grandparent. </p>

Sir, I thank Mr Hri Kumar Nair for his question. The Working Mother's
Child Relief (WMCR) is a gesture to recognise the efforts of working
women in looking after their children. One of the eligibility criteria

A dependent child is one who does not have more than $4,000 of annual
income.</p>

Service (NS) – whether serving NS, or working, or studying in an

the relief was only recently raised from $2,000 to $4,000 in Year of
Assessment 2010. My Ministry will review the income threshold from
time to time.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, a
supplementary question. I thank the Minister of State for her answer.
I understand the purpose and logic of the relief. The problem is
that the relief is up to $10,000 for working mothers and a man who
enters into National Service earns about $4,000 or so. So the upshot
is that a working mother is financially worse off if her son disrupts
his studies and enters National Service. While I understand the
logic of the relief, there is some inequity because, certainly,
the relief is still available if the working mother has a daughter.
So will there be some sort of relief to address that inequity?</p>

you, Mr Speaker. One final attempt. Perhaps, I am mistaken because
it is relief intended to cover children. The working mother will
not be entitled to relief once the child hits 21 or becomes an adult.
And in may cases, once the male child finishes or completes his
NS, there will be a very short time before he becomes an adult and
his mother will no longer be entitled to that relief.</p>

cooked food prices in hawker centres are influenced by a number

                  </span>: Sir,
the Government recognises the value of centre-based care in supporting
parenthood and the development of young children. All Singapore
citizen children enrolled in childcare or infant care centres receive
some form of subsidy. </p>

limited care arrangements for their children while they are at work.
They are in greater need of full-day services provided by childcare
centres, which are more costly. For this reason, working mothers
receive higher Government subsidies compared to non-working mothers
who are more likely to be able to care for their children or to
enrol them in half-day programmes for socialisation and development
opportunities.</p>

flexibility in situations where a non-working mother is unable to
perform the role of primary caregiver for her child, and therefore
requires full-day centre-based care. Examples include situations
where the mother is undergoing training, suffering from a long-term
illness or disability, or required to perform the role of primary
caregiver to another sick or disabled member of the family. Appeals
can be made through the childcare centre with relevant supporting
documents. </p>

                  </span>: I want
to thank Ms Low for that question. I think the basic issue here
is one of vacancies or places available in the childcare centres
for us to provide mothers with opportunities so that they can go
to work. As Members know, currently, we are already ramping up our
efforts to increase the number of childcare centres. Under the plans
that we have for the childcare development for the whole sector,
we have already built almost up to 200 centres, way ahead of the
time that we have set. But even then we know it is not enough. So
it is a question of prioritisation, ie, prioritising the needs of
mothers who are working and who need to place the children in the
childcare centres as against mothers who are not working and who
can take care of the children at home. But notwithstanding that,
we do also provide opportunities for mothers who, although are stay-at-home
mothers, need to place the children in childcare centres because
of specific reasons, like long-term illness, disability or the need
to take care of a family member who is very ill. So there are exceptions
that we will make in those situations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3eb2a0db-5fce-46e1-acb6-740f9a4a35a1">

question about whether we could provide an allowance for stay-at-home
mothers, I think the logic and the rationale are the same, and that
is, we should consider providing support for mothers who are working
and for mothers who are not working and staying at home. And we
are fully sympathetic as we know that stay-at-home mothers have
given up their careers in order to fully focus on taking care of their
children. But there are resources that we need to think of in terms
of how we allocate our resources.</p>

regardless of whether they are stay-at-home mothers or they are
working mothers, they benefit from the Baby Bonus that the Government
gives. So stay-at-home mothers also benefit from the Baby Bonus
that is given to all mothers.</p>

                  </span>: Mr
Speaker, Sir, the amended Maintenance of Parents Act (MPA) aims
to promote a "conciliation first" approach, with legal action as
a last resort. So the legislation provides for the Commissioner
for the Maintenance of Parents to be the first port of call for
first-time potential applicants to play a more active role in helping
parents and children resolve maintenance disputes through conciliation. </p>

agencies to identify and also locate adult children, and assessing
their means to maintain their parents.</p>

to report that the impact of the revisions has been encouraging.
In 2011, 286 elderly parents had approached the Commissioner for assistance
on maintenance matters. Eighty-five percent of these cases received
from January till October 2011 were resolved through mediation,
which means that both the parents and adult children were able to
amicably arrive at a consensus on maintenance issues. This is an
improvement over the previous year of 78%. A larger proportion of families
are also having their disputes resolved by the Commissioner, without
them having to resort to legal action at the Tribunal. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4532dcd6-b01c-45b5-b4e5-1154b1172024">

recorded a lower number of maintenance applications. There were
110 applications for maintenance filed in 2011, as compared to 183
applications filed in 2010. So there is a decrease of 40% which
is a good sign. Even at the Tribunal stage, it is heartening to
see that 41% of the applications for maintenance were settled by
mediation. </p>

the Commissioner was able to expeditiously make contact with over
360 adult children and invited them to attend conciliation sessions. This
would have been difficult prior to the amendments made to the MPA.</p>

I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answer, and I
am very happy to hear the encouraging results. I have two supplementary
questions. The first is on the screening provisions which we have
now included in the amended Act. Would the Senior Parliamentary
Secretary share with us which are the agencies that this has been
applied to? Secondly, it is on the other important aspect which
the new amended Act proposed, ie, the need to actively focus on
case management aspects of cases. These were cases that were settled
through mediation and also cases which were settled through the
Tribunal. I want to ask for an update on this as well.</p>

thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. For the first
supplementary question, the screening process involved all the Government agencies,
particularly agencies such as CPF Board, Ministry of Manpower, etc.
When the mediation process is in progress, the Commissioner's Office
will contact these agencies to obtain the necessary information.
So far, the agencies have been very cooperative in providing the
relevant information to facilitate the mediation process.</p>

on the approach to case management, the Commissioner's Office has
always taken a very proactive approach, in a human-centric approach,
in trying to facilitate the interactions and also the communication
between the parties
in dispute. It is more or less like a case management approach where
emphasis is given to help the parents and also their adult children
to find a middle ground, a ground for consensus so as to settle
the mediation amicably. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin (for the Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Manpower)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, Mr Zaqy Mohamad's question relates to the lack of growth of
real incomes over the last decade amongst Singaporeans at the 20th percentile
of incomes. What happened over the decade was essentially a story
of two halves. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1185548e-d1d2-45b6-908f-30dd464e46ed">
                  <a name="id-ca21234e-6e66-4cea-815a-054ddcc6b6f4__id-1185548e-d1d2-45b6-908f-30dd464e46ed"><!--a--></a>In the first half decade,
Singapore experienced two serious economic downturns. These downturns
had the effect of depressing income growth for all Singaporeans,
in particular for workers in the lower income group. In the second
half of the decade, the economy grew faster and we saw real incomes
grow. For Singaporeans at the 20th percentile, real incomes grew
by 3.1% annually from 2006 to 2010. This was, in fact, higher than
the growth in median incomes of 2.6% per annum during the same period. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cfbabd90-020e-471c-87d9-7ec3b849e567">
                  <a name="id-ca21234e-6e66-4cea-815a-054ddcc6b6f4__id-cfbabd90-020e-471c-87d9-7ec3b849e567"><!--a--></a>It is therefore not correct
to say that real incomes have not increased despite initiatives
such as skills upgrading and job redesign. It was during the latter
half of the decade that we introduced schemes like Skills Programme
for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR), and NTUC and its partners stepped
up efforts to help upgrade jobs at the lower end of the income scale.
Further, older low-income workers began receiving Workfare from
the Government, which would have given many of them an average of
10% increase in their annual income. This had not been factored
in the 3.1% per annum real growth in their pay.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-06e763cd-1786-4cef-81ee-fa8352ea73c3">
                  <a name="id-ca21234e-6e66-4cea-815a-054ddcc6b6f4__id-06e763cd-1786-4cef-81ee-fa8352ea73c3"><!--a--></a>What this also shows, importantly,
is that good, sustainable economic growth is a plus for all Singaporeans,
and especially so for those in the lower income group. When the
economy does not do well, the lower-income group is also more badly
affected.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b912e98d-4c12-4d52-bf87-fb0342a2a4e1">

increasing workers' capabilities is critical to raising their incomes
on a sustainable basis. Amongst other initiatives, the National
Productivity and Continuing Education Council funds the Inclusive
Growth Programme (IGP) to raise the productivity of low-wage jobs
and bring about sustainable income growth for low-wage workers.
The IGP, which is spearheaded by NTUC, requires employers to share productivity
gains with their workers through higher wages. </p>

Scheme provides low-wage workers with incentives to go for and complete
training to improve their skills. It complements the Workfare Income Supplement,
which encourages them to stay in a job and gain experience and capability
over time. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d5efbf9b-2282-466c-bf64-8e57c3c4dcee">

these schemes to improve them, and explore new measures, including
those targeted at jobs with employing significant number of low-wage
workers, such as cleaning and security. Uplifting low-wage workers
cannot be achieved overnight, but the Government is committed to
doing so and we will work closely with our tripartite partners towards
this shared objective. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, as
at the end of 2010, there were around 29,300 nurses in Singapore.
Eighty per cent were Singaporeans and permanent residents, and the remaining
20% were foreigners. </p>

of our nurses are foreigners from countries such as the Philippines,
India and China. Close to 10% of our doctors come from Malaysia
and some 14% come from India and other countries. </p>

intake by 26% from 250 in 2006 to 316 in 2010, through the expansion
of NUS' medical intake and the starting of the Duke-NUS Graduate
Medical School in 2007. Singapore's third medical school, the Lee
Kong Chian School of Medicine, will also start training its first
batch of 50 students in 2013 and gradually increase its annual intake
to 150 students eventually. At steady state, the three medical schools
will train a total of 500 doctors annually.</p>

the nursing intake by 16% from about 1,600 in 2006 to about 1,850
students in 2010, through expanding intakes at ITE and the polytechnics
as well as the Bachelor of Science (Nursing) course at our NUS from
2006. We will further increase the nursing intake to about 2,000.</p>

have also stepped up efforts to attract Singaporeans studying healthcare-related
disciplines overseas to return back to Singapore. In particular,
the public healthcare clusters introduced the Pre-Employment Grant
last year, which provides financial support for overseas Singaporean
medical students during their final two years of study. A total
of 68 awards were given out to Singaporean medical students studying
in the United Kingdom and Australia. </p>

At the same time, Ministers should be paid properly so that Singapore

political appointment holders has been debated in this House many
times, for example in 1981, 1989 and 1993. In 1994, there was an
extensive debate on the White Paper on Competitive Salaries for
Competent and Honest Government which established the previous framework
for Ministerial salaries. Since then, Parliament has had two more
debates about political salaries – in 2000 and most recently in
2007 – when modifications were made to the framework to improve
it, and to respond to new economic and social developments. </p>

debates, as salaries tend to be complex and emotive issues, and
especially so when they are for those holding elected office. But
the Government has not shied away from having them because we believe
that having the right people to lead Singapore will have a fundamental
impact on the future of Singapore. And having the right salaries
is a critical component in having the right people. Given that the
level of political salaries is of importance and interest to all Singaporeans,
we should be open and transparent in discussing it. </p>

Committee for taking on this challenging task. The Committee comprised
a group of eight independent members with deep experience, and prominent
in a range of sectors – social and community service, business,
trade unions and professional services. The Committee sought feedback
widely. They received and considered more than 500 e-mails and letters
from the public and Members of Parliament. They tapped on a human
resource consultancy firm, Mercer, for its technical expertise in
job evaluation, pay benchmarking and design. All Members of this House
had the opportunity to send in their views and suggestions to the
Committee, and I hope that Members availed themselves of this opportunity.
Several Members were interviewed by Mercer. After thorough deliberation
and consideration of the various proposals during 10 meetings over
half a year, the Committee submitted its recommendations to the
Prime Minister on 30 December 2011. </p>

of the Committee are: one, a new benchmark, which is based on the
median income of the top 1,000 earners who are Singapore citizens,
with a 40% discount to reflect the ethos of political service; two,
a new salary framework and National Bonus linked to the socio-economic
progress of average and lower income Singaporeans; and three, removal
of the pension scheme for politicians.</p>

Minister's total annual salary by 36%; the President's annual pay
will now be 70% that of the Prime Minister; the entry-level Minister's
total annual salary is reduced by 37%; and for a Minister's total
annual salary to start from $935,000. </p>

Report has referred to as total annual salaries is commonly described
as "total annual compensation" or "total annual remuneration" in
the private sector. So when we say total annual salaries, we are
really talking of the same thing.</p>

the Committee's Report carefully and is satisfied that the Committee
has studied this subject of political salaries very thoroughly.
They have established a set of key principles. They have explained
the reasons for their recommendations clearly and cogently. They
have exercised their collective judgement in determining how to
balance the ethos of public service with an appropriate salary that will
not deter able persons from taking up political office.</p>

intends to accept the Committee's recommendations. They are fair
and balanced, and are an improvement to the previous salary framework. We
have thus adopted the report as a White Paper and I am moving a
motion to seek Parliament's endorsement for it to be used as the
basis for setting political salaries. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-2bcc8abb-c68c-4a6e-b601-0ee0e93f0888"><!--a--></a>Since the previous framework
for Ministerial salaries was established in 1994, there have been
concerns raised by members of the public as well as Members from
both sides of this House. For example, some have pointed out that
the previous benchmark was tied to a very small group of top earners
who could change from year to year. Volatility of the benchmark
was also perceived to be an issue. Others felt that the GDP Bonus
was too narrowly focussed on economic growth. Some called for a
larger proportion of pay to be variable and linked to performance;
while on the other hand, others wanted to limit bonuses. There were
also issues raised about pensions for political appointees. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e14d0079-36e4-4d40-af1b-b7896c1ca2d5">
                  <a name="motion__id-e14d0079-36e4-4d40-af1b-b7896c1ca2d5"><!--a--></a>Several modifications to
the salary framework have been made since 1994, taking into account
the suggestions as well as evolving economic and social circumstances.
For example, widening the peg from the average pay of top 24 earners
to the median salary of top 48 earners in 2000, moving towards more
performance-based pay in 2007, and including the value of pensions
in the computation of a Minister's total pay when making comparisons
with the private sector benchmark. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b08528e1-562a-44b8-a114-82a8a18a1d35">
                  <a name="motion__id-b08528e1-562a-44b8-a114-82a8a18a1d35"><!--a--></a>Yet, the issue of Ministerial
pay is not just a technical one. If it were solely a technical issue,
we could quite easily hire a compensation expert to help find us
the right formula. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4dec1ed6-2652-4f02-837f-23b85e176792">
                  <a name="motion__id-4dec1ed6-2652-4f02-837f-23b85e176792"><!--a--></a>Let me also state at the
outset, that while we are discussing salaries, the most important
criterion for anyone seeking political office is first and foremost
the motivation to serve our nation and our people. Without that
pre-requisite, we will be choosing the wrong people. On that, I
believe all of us in this House can agree.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d6ca96ba-a3e3-4c50-a7b1-701f35690b89">

salaries calls for a difficult balance to be made between two considerations:
on the one hand, we need to provide a continuing connection between
Ministerial salaries and the well-being and overall progress of Singaporeans – to cement
and strengthen the solidarity between political leaders and Singaporeans.
On the other hand, we need to set salaries at a level which will
not deter able and committed people from serving. This ultimately
is a judgement call.</p>

time to study this matter, and has re-affirmed three principles
as a guide to decide on the salary framework, and where the balance
lies. The Government agrees with these three key principles: first,
salaries must be competitive so that people of the right calibre
are not deterred from stepping forward to lead the country; second,
the ethos of political service entails making sacrifices and hence
there should be a discount in the pay formula; and third, we should
continue to have a "clean wage" with no hidden perks. </p>

through some of the key features of the Committee's recommendations,

Benchmark. Based on the feedback that the Committee received, as
well as the public responses since the report has been released,
most people accept that some form of comparison or benchmark is
needed. Some have proposed their own. The question, however, is
what would make the most appropriate benchmark.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8cc2f5e8-12d5-4329-863e-7ad68ba9dafe">

the Committee's recommendation to use 60% of the median income of
the top 1,000 Singapore Citizen earners as a peg is appropriate.
They have concerns whether these are the right people to compare
against when we consider public office, or whether it is too selective
a group.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1d5952a8-0aaa-4cfb-aef7-30d6caf2d3db">
                  <a name="motion__id-1d5952a8-0aaa-4cfb-aef7-30d6caf2d3db"><!--a--></a>The data for this benchmark
came from IRAS. We do not know who these individuals are, as IRAS
data is confidential. However, I have asked IRAS for some aggregated
data to provide a profile of these 1,000 earners, to see if they
are in jobs which require the qualities, abilities and skills that
we might reasonably expect Ministers to have. They all earn $1.3
million or more, which is the earned income of the 1,000th Singapore
Citizen earner. Members can refer to the information sheet marked
Handout 1 in the package that I have asked to be distributed. These
1,000 earners are in leadership or senior positions in a wide range
of businesses and professions. Four hundred and seventy-four, or
nearly half of them, hold senior management positions. Not all are
CEOs: some are in senior positions but below CEO level, fifth or
sixth in the organisations. They are also from a diverse range of
sectors including manufacturing, wholesale and retail, communications
and transport, healthcare and hospitality. Another 383 come from
the financial industry. Professionals – lawyers, accountants, doctors
and engineers – account for another 143. </p>

when considering potential candidates to take up political office,
the first quality that we look out for is a sense of public service.
We want people who have their heart in the right place, who can

contribute to the betterment of our Singapore and Singaporeans.
This has been, and should always be, the important basic requirement
for any Member of Parliament or Minister.</p>

is not in itself sufficient to run a country well. We therefore
want people not only with a sense of public service, but who also
have many other qualities: organisational and leadership capabilities,
capacity to handle multiple responsibilities, ability to solve problems
and take charge in a crisis, and the ability to hold his own with
world leaders and further Singapore's interests. We are not saying
that only people who are among the top 1,000 earners would meet
all these criteria, or that we will only draw from this pool. Indeed,
many top earners have the competencies but not the sense of public
mission. </p>

this is a reasonable level that reflects the quality and abilities
of people that Singapore seeks to, indeed needs to, bring in as

may still feel that $1.1 million is a very high figure. And it is.
But I hope you will also see it from the point of view of a person
possessing these qualities and also the passion to serve the country.
Now, while he may be prepared to enter politics and serve the people
whole-heartedly, each person faces different personal circumstances
and considerations at the age of 35 or 40, when he has to decide what
to do with the prime years of his life. And for good personal or
family reasons, he may decide to postpone that decision, and ultimately
not take that step. If most decide to wait 10 or 15 years before
joining politics, we would have already missed those prime years
of their service; and we would have a gap in leadership in that
age group. Ultimately even if they came in to serve at a later age,
they would have much fewer years of experience of working with people
on the ground, and of governance; and the ranks of senior, steady
and experienced Cabinet Ministers who have served in a range of portfolios,
seen many crises, encountered many different, difficult situations,
would be thinner and fewer. </p>

who are willing to take the step earlier, we may be losing others
who may not be ready to do so. This will make the potential pool
from which we can draw smaller; and if we have a very deep salary
discount, we may have to choose from a drastically smaller pool.
This will weaken the depth and breadth of the leadership and would
not be a good outcome for Singapore. </p>

full flexibility in considering several other possible benchmarks,

here on two of them. </p>

has been benchmarking to the pay of foreign leaders. But there are
drawbacks with this approach. The Committee's view was that political
pay levels and structures based on domestic political considerations
in one country may not correlate with the conditions in another.
As such, it is more apt to benchmark and structure political salaries
in Singapore based on local factors relevant to us in Singapore,
as salaries can then be linked to the economic and social conditions
here in Singapore such as employment level, and incomes of Singapore
Citizens.</p>

differences between Singapore and many other countries, including
the size and make-up of the population, and the philosophy of governance.
Capable and competent political leadership and good governance have been
critical in getting us, in getting Singapore and Singaporeans, to
where we are today. Our pool of able people is naturally smaller
compared to countries with 10 or 20 times our population, such as the UK or
Japan, and we still have to assemble a Cabinet from this smaller
pool. Our ratio of resources and land to population is also less generous
than other successful countries with similar-sized populations.
Take Norway as an example, which, on a per-capita basis, is the
world's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the Middle
East. Unlike the smaller European countries, we do not have the
cushion of the European Union. We are a small, multi-ethnic country,
set in a volatile region and facing the full force of global competition;
our challenges are complex and many. We are a city-state which is
critically dependent on good governance to survive, sustain ourselves
and achieve success. Hence, the high importance we must place on
getting the best possible leadership from our small population for
Singapore, more so than in other countries. </p>

of medical benefits. Ministers in Singapore have been on the same
medical benefits scheme as civil servants implemented since 1994.
The medical benefits comprise an additional 1% CPF contribution
in their Medisave accounts capped at $1,190 per year out of which
the Minister should buy Medisave approved insurance to provide for
his own hospital care (I hope that my colleagues have all done so),
a co-payment subsidy for outpatient treatment capped at $350 annually,
and 50% of dental costs incurred up to a maximum of $70 per year.

few if not the only country in the world which adopts a clean wage
policy for political leaders, where we put all that Ministers earn
out in the open so that Singaporeans know exactly what they earn.
This is an open and transparent system. Unfortunately, it also has
a serious downside, because whenever comparisons are made, they
are usually based only on cash income. This makes the salaries of
the leaders in other countries look a lot smaller than what they
actually are, as it excludes the cost of the benefits and perks
that their leaders enjoy, some of which are not even known or measurable. </p>

to peg the pay to a multiple of the Singaporean median income, or
to the lowest 20th income percentile. The drawback is that such
a benchmark would not encompass all the areas of work that a government

importance of making a link with the well-being of the man-in-the-street,
and also lower income Singaporeans, and I will come to that when
discussing the recommended National Bonus. </p>

point of the MR4 grade earning $1.1 million total annual salary,
or total annual compensation, would fall outside the top 1,000 earners
and would rank as the 1410th Singapore Citizen income earner. Under
the previous framework, the salary of such an MR4 Minister at $1.58

proposal to replace the GDP Bonus with the National Bonus. In the
past, GDP Bonus was paid out in years of good growth. GDP was used
as a macro indicator of how well Singapore was doing as a country.
It was chosen because it was easily understood, and the data readily
available. Economic growth also provides Government the resources
to build future capabilities for our people and country such as
through education and infrastructure, and to level up lower income Singaporeans
through social programmes. </p>

replacing the GDP Bonus with the National Bonus. Many members of
the public also expressed the view that the salaries of political
office holders should have a more direct link to the well-being
of Singaporeans and should include indicators beyond GDP growth.
The Government agrees that the proposed National Bonus is an improvement
over the previous GDP Bonus. The National Bonus will have more indicators,
and these indicators will be more explicitly linked to the socio-economic
progress of ordinary Singaporeans, namely (i) real median income
growth rate of the average Singaporean, (ii) real income growth
rate of the lowest 20th percentile of Singaporean income earners;
and (iii) unemployment rate of Singaporeans, besides (iv) real GDP
growth rate. </p>

the view that the National Bonus should be more explicit in defining
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for individual Ministers or Ministries,
and asked why there is also a need for individual Performance Bonus
for ministers and how this will be determined. The National Bonus
reflects national outcomes, which the Cabinet and political office
holders are collectively responsible for. The individual Performance
Bonus, on the other hand, reflects the Prime Minister's assessment
of how each member of his team has contributed in that team member's
specific area of direct responsibilities, but also how that team
member has contributed to achieving these overall national goals.
This reflects the way that the team works. We each have specific responsibilities,
but each of us also contributes our views and ideas in Cabinet to
our colleagues, so that we arrive at better and more synergistic
policies and outcomes. The structure of the National Bonus reflects
the collective responsibility for outcomes, while the individual
Performance Bonus reflects the Prime Minister's assessment of the contributions
of the individuals in his team. </p>

it is important to encourage people to serve longer periods of time
so that they develop the instincts and understanding of how our
Government works so that they can serve Singaporeans better. Hence,
the pension is only payable if a Minister serves eight years but
maxes out when he has served 18 years. </p>

are the total annual compensation, including all variable bonus
payments. There are no other payments beyond what is listed inside.
I refer Members to Handout 3. The monthly salary for MR4 and other
grades are derived from the recommendations of the Committee. The
variable payments are based on a normal year. So, if I may cite
an example, the $1.1 million figure for MR4 comprises fixed salaries
of 13 months (or $715,000), and an assumption of seven months of
variable bonuses (amounting to $385,000), based on Annual Variable
Component of one month (following civil service practice), an individual
performance bonus of three months for good performance, and national
outcomes that result in three months of National Bonus. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-39035878-ddad-4223-b941-2a7ba70f1442">
                  <a name="motion__id-39035878-ddad-4223-b941-2a7ba70f1442"><!--a--></a>Of course, in a bad year, when the targets
for components of the National Bonus are not met, the National Bonus
will be cut, and hence the total annual salary will fall. This is
similar to how Ministers' salaries have fallen previously due to
drops in GDP Bonuses and the AVC component, and risen when the economy
has done better. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-90c662fc-7da1-46b6-b3df-93d57f58d36e">
                  <a name="motion__id-90c662fc-7da1-46b6-b3df-93d57f58d36e"><!--a--></a>In addition, Ministerial
salaries have also been cut in years when there was an economic
downturn, for example, in 2002 and 2003, and again in 2009. Ministerial salaries
had also been adjusted periodically as the benchmark rose or fell.
Similarly, the Committee has recommended that this benchmark will
allow salaries to be competitive and respond annually to market
conditions. We will thus update the benchmark numbers (and the actual
Ministers' pay) regularly over the next five years.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 835</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cc34dfdf-708e-4fef-82db-ad13f8ee22d6">

would like to bring forth is this. The Committee recommended a salary
range for each Minister grade in accordance with Human Resource
practice in the Singapore public and private sector. So, if I could
refer Members to Handout 3 again. The monthly salary of each grade
will have a range of 0.9 to 1.1 of the mid-point of that range,
quite typical for salary ranges. However, the starting point of
the MR4 Minister grade will be lower, at 0.85 of the reference monthly
salary. A Minister on this starting point of the MR4 salary would
therefore have 13 months of fixed salary amounting to $607,750.
This represents the basic annual salary, without bonuses, which
a Minister at the start point of the grade would earn. With variable
bonuses in a typical year, this would come to a total of $935,000.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ebecba05-063d-4e78-b1f8-b153e2d1ef71">
                  <a name="motion__id-ebecba05-063d-4e78-b1f8-b153e2d1ef71"><!--a--></a>The lower start point for
the MR4 grade allows the Prime Minister more flexibility on where
to appoint a new Minister. In addition, the Prime Minister could
appoint him even below the MR4 grade, that is, as an Acting Minister
for example on a Senior Minister of State grade – as already is
the practice currently. By so doing, the Prime Minister can test and
assess a newly appointed Minister before deciding whether to give
him heavier responsibilities, and place him on a higher Ministerial
salary or grade. This will help address concerns that new Ministers
who were drawing lower salaries in their previous jobs will see
huge salary gains by joining politics. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-8c733093-2602-4afc-93f6-6602e1838fb7"><!--a--></a>Under the proposed framework,
the Prime Minister will receive a total annual salary package that
is twice the MR4 benchmark, or $2.2 million. The structure of the
Prime Minister's salary will be different from that of Ministers
in that he will not have an individual performance bonus, but his
entire bonus component will be based on the National Bonus. Previously,
the Prime Minister's 2010 salary point of $3.1 million would be
roughly equivalent to the salary of the 175th Singapore Citizen
income earner. I should point out though, that as announced in 2007,
the Prime Minister has been donating his salary increases for five
years from 2007 to charity. The proposed salary point of the Prime
Minister, after taking in the Committee's recommendations, would now
be ranked at the 382nd Singapore Citizen income earner.</p>

changes proposed to the President's salary. The President is Head
of State, and performs important ceremonial, diplomatic and community
roles. The President has significant custodial powers. However,
unlike the Prime Minister, the President does not set national policies
and does not have direct executive responsibility for governing
the country, except as it relates to his custodial role. The Committee,
having taken all factors into account, has recommended that the President be paid the
same monthly salary as the Prime Minister, with 13th month bonus and
AVC, but without the Performance Bonus and National Bonus. This
will give a new salary of $1.54 million, which represents a reduction
of 51% from 2010 levels. </p>

has voluntarily agreed to move to the new framework with effect
from 21 May 2011. As announced earlier by Mr Speaker, the President,
Speaker and Deputy Speakers as well as former President Mr S R Nathan, former
Speaker Mr Abdullah Tarmugi and former Deputy Speakers, Mr Matthias
Yao and Ms Indranee Rajah have agreed to adopt the new salaries
as recommended by the Committee.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-73ebe0b2-2cc1-490c-9fee-bed31229697b"><!--a--></a>Presently, Ministerial salaries
and the salaries of senior civil servants in the Administrative
Service, as well as judicial and statutory appointment holders,
such as judges, the Auditor-General, and the Attorney General, adopt
similar benchmarks. Our basic philosophy for all civil service salaries
has been to benchmark against market comparables, but not to lead
the market. Where there are no comparable jobs (for example, very
demanding jobs with high social value such as in the Singapore Armed Forces
or the Home Team), we have looked at comparable pay drawn by people
with similar qualifications and backgrounds. </p>

in the political salary framework, I have asked the Public Service
Division to study how relevant principles may be applied to the
civil service. The Government agrees with the view of the Committee
that "the element of significant discount or sacrifice expected
of political appointment holders" should not be applied to civil
servants, other statutory appointment holders and judicial appointment
holders as they are professionals and hence should not be subject
to the same degree of sacrifice as political appointment holders. </p>

because it is part of the open and transparent process that we have
engaged in over the years to try to determine political salaries

House have been grappling with this issue for some three decades.
On the one hand, we are clear that political service is first and
foremost about service to the people, our people. We all agree on
that. But we also need to have salaries at a level that will not
deter able persons from devoting the prime of their lives to political
office, so that we can maximise the pool of people whom we can draw
on to form the future leadership for Singapore. Sir, there is no
perfectly "right answer" to this complex issue. It is ultimately
a judgement call. </p>

to be re-examined from time to time to assess whether it remains
appropriate, and whether there are improvements that should be made.

actual numbers arrived at by the Committee are the key principles
that the Committee has distilled after its long deliberations. The
Committee has re-affirmed the key principles underlying how salaries
for Singapore's political leaders should be determined: competitive
salaries so that people of the right calibre are not deterred from
stepping forward to lead the country; maintaining the ethos of political
service which entails making sacrifices and hence providing for
a discount in the pay formula; and a "clean wage" with no hidden
perks.</p>

challenges that Singapore faces. Some of these are most significantly
the financial crisis and the security threats in the period between
2000 and 2002, the SARS crisis, the concerns faced during the Lehman
Brothers fallout that affected the confidence of banks all over
the world, the global financial crisis then and what is going on
in Euro land now. These are clear and present dangers to one of
the vital engines of Singapore's livelihood, the Banking and Financial
Services sector.</p>

sorts of crisis that present themselves, threatening our survival.
How we respond like how we responded after the Lehman crisis will
set the stage in how we compete. Bankers in the profession will
tell you today that we benefit from our position and the political
will we had after the Lehman crisis and we see flows of assets and
trades coming through Singapore as they are not being able to be
done in Hong Kong. Sir, Singapore leaders need to not only manage
well but also have a knack to look around the bend and find space
in the traffic to squeeze through and soldier ahead in tough times.
To do this, we need political leaders with the competence to navigate
us through the worse times. They would also need to have the vision
to bring us to new heights. They would also need, in short, men
of this calibre who are in short supply and countries, corporations,
enterprises and organisations all over the world are looking for
such people. </p>

recruit, how we assess and how to on-board our potential leaders
invariably involves consideration at some point on compensation.
This is a tricky issue. In 1996, Mr S Dhanabalan had explained to
the House why he had changed his mind on his initial stand on the
pay for Ministers when he encountered a difficult time in recruiting
able men and women to serve. Like the English Premier League football, everyone
has an opinion. Everyone is an expert. This issue is emotional enough
to be apoplectic when people talked about the amount of salary Ministers
and office holders get a year. This is because most Singaporeans
do not earn even close to the figures bandied around a Minister's
salary. Therefore, the recommendation talked about making a discount
to their salaries is a good one.</p>

recommendations to cut the salaries and also the significance of
the removal of the pension for office holders, I would, however,
like to sound a caution that upon implementation of the changes,
the incumbent government must place even more importance in recruiting
potential leaders to keep our future secure.</p>

Whether the Government of the day is PAP or otherwise, we are all
in agreement that we need good people not just with a passion and the
right motivation to serve but the ability to do so. We need to identify
good calibre men and women with qualities early. This is because
those who have peaked in their careers with a proven track record
will find it harder to move away from their comfort zone.</p>

of his or her desire and commitment to public service. These good
people would have a lot more to consider before making the move
to the uncertainty of public office. Had the individuals who are
at the prime of their careers continued in their private sector
careers, their compensation may eventually be much higher than the
entry level Minister's pay. More often than not, we need our Ministers
to hit the ground running. We do not have the luxury to mentor our
junior Ministers all the time. We also realise that the Minister's
responsibility is deeper, wider and includes constituencies, if you will, outside Singapore.
For example, the Foreign Minister's portfolio includes – countries
friendly or not at different times relevant to Singapore's space
in the world; the Trade Minister's constituency of Trading Blocs
or areas outside of Singapore that will add or detract from our
path of survival. The build-up of experience and relationships with
external players takes time and a certain amount of savvy that is
more likely to come from a high calibre candidate to begin with.</p>

an individual already at the peak of his career for a switch into
politics the difference in the compensation will discourage him
or her to say "yes". Even for MPs, whether PAP or Opposition, the
decision to enter politics is usually one made with serious discussion
with family members. Consider this, someone who has earned his stripes
in the corporate world, it would follow that their compensation
and lifestyle might also include having a mortgage and commitments
to the family. The difference may make it difficult at that point
for the family to meet the financial commitments, for example, to
their children's education. These commitments are on-going and comfortably
met by their existing remuneration. I would imagine many will simply
say a polite "no thank you". They will probably then serve on their
own terms and leisure and contribute to the society and not to look
towards running a country. To be fair to these persons, I do not
doubt that they have a willingness to serve, but the practical aspects
to make the move cannot be mitigated at that point of time. I am worried
about this. This has a tremendous impact on the well-being of Singapore.
This is a problem that the government of the day will face – whether
PAP or not. This is a perspective that perhaps my fellow Singaporeans
might want to consider as a ball-and-chain in looking for and on
boarding potential leaders.</p>

of the Review Committee, not straying away from our time honoured
principle of having a "clean wage". Globally, we may be the odd
one out in designing the way we pay not only our political leaders
but our civil servants as well. Most Singaporeans, including myself,
grew up with a clean wage system. This is the way we chose to organise
our society. We pay our political leaders and civil servants with
a clean all-in wage. No extra perks and certainly no hidden perks.
In some countries, retired Prime Ministers enjoy certain benefits
for life. Some of these benefits include lifelong pension, use of
a chauffeur-driven cars, a set of staff, all paid by taxpayers.
Many of these benefits, while guaranteed by law, are not transparent
to the general public. And I understand that Australia has such
a practice.</p>

of Facebook <em class="ph i">Weibo</em>, a conversation between two Shanghainese
provides much food for thought. One parent was congratulated when
he told his friends that he was on his way to the travel agency.
His friends thought he was going on a holiday during the Chinese
New Year. But the man sighed loudly saying that he was on his way
to pay for his son's form teacher to go on a holiday to Australia
during the New Year. The cost of the holiday was 25,000 Renminbi
(about S$5,000) and spending money of 20,000 Renminbi. The man was
paying to ensure that the form teacher would ensure his son's third
position in class! </p>

China are known to be paid relatively low salaries not just compared
to Singapore. It is an acceptable way of living in China. Chinese
friends I have spoken to are mostly not aware of how much their
political leaders are paid. Some do not even question. The advent
of the Internet and the mushrooming of social media are paving the
way to many raising questions about everything in China. Some questions underlie a lack of
confidence in the integrity of their public officers. For example,
a director of state land draws a monthly salary of about 12,000
RMB (about S$3,000), yet in the Chinese social media, they asked,
how is he able to afford a Swiss watch on his wrist costing about
400,000 RMB (or S$80,000)? If this happened to us here, Singapore would
be doomed if there is no confidence in integrity of our political
leaders and public servants. </p>

and the challenges facing Singapore and our Ministers would be more
complex and diverse. Let us take a longer term view in choosing
our political leaders. Let us pay fairly and adequately where applicable.
I think if we were to be guided by a sense of vulnerability for
Singapore, we would look at this in the right perspective. Sir,
I support the recommendations of the Ministerial Salary Review Committee. </p>

Speaker, Sir, firstly, I want to commend the Prime Minister for
being willing to accept a complete review of Cabinet Ministers'
pay and to make public the review Report. This shows that the Prime
Minister is transparent in handling this issue. Regardless of the
yardstick used, the salary cut recommended by the review Committee is
indeed significant, and surprised many. I am very proud of how clean
and open the Singapore Government is, as this Government is willing
to listen to every issue that has been brought up by the people.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fa69eae3-3c49-4f77-8367-769ef8c1b3cb">

done well to analyse according to the job scope of Government officials,
and decided on the salaries accordingly. This makes the issue of rewarding
our leaders more transparent, and gain greater confidence from the
general public. In addition, what impresses us was how the Committee
tirelessly explained the reasons and rationale behind the pay cut
recommendations. I hope this is enough to prove to the sceptics
that what the Committee has done is not just a superficial show
to appease the public.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aac1f0be-367c-49ba-9df8-fc81d4be03f6">
                  <a name="motion__id-aac1f0be-367c-49ba-9df8-fc81d4be03f6"><!--a--></a>The review Committee recommends
that the individual performance bonus be linked to the growth in
median real wages of Singaporeans, growth in real wages of low-income
Singaporeans, unemployment rate and GDP growth. This is a wise move,
as one of the key responsibilities of the Government is to ensure
that the nation progress together, that no one will be left behind.
Indeed, protection of the livelihood of the people and the future
of our nation is in the hands of the leaders. Such an important mandate
must be given to people with a strong spirit of public service and
a strong sense of mission. I am pleased with the outcome of this
review and would like to comment on the pay cuts.</p>

Speaker, Sir, let me share my views on the salary review. First
of all, the salary cut should not in any way be viewed as an indication
of demotion, penalisation or an admission of anything amiss. Dedication
and service to the country and its people is priceless. Such service
can never be measured, let alone be equated to a monetary value. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4791bdf8-4903-4ab7-9487-2030fc9a6222">
                  <a name="motion__id-4791bdf8-4903-4ab7-9487-2030fc9a6222"><!--a--></a>Rather, this pay reduction
should be regarded as a pledge of further sacrifices that the leaders
are willing to commit to in the interest of our country and our
people. Forty over
years ago, Singapore gained independence against a background of
an unstable economy and social chaos. The problems were greater,
and the monetary rewards were paltry compared to the responsibilities
that they had to shoulder. Yet, we had passionate leaders coming
forward, their motives purely to serve the nation and steer her
out of dark waters. They did an impeccable job managing the country
and despite our lack of natural resources, we prospered. Many of
us have become self-sufficient, well educated, lead dignified lives
and have our basic needs more than fulfilled. All these achieved within
less than a century from our independence. </p>

Standards of living have gone up, businesses boom and people are
understandably attracted to the private sector where there are many opportunities.
With globalisation, really, the sky is the limit.</p>

on the political office bearers are not lighter or less daunting.
The challenges are now different and so too are the demands on the
ability to deliver a set of solutions. As the world becomes almost
borderless and interlinked, the problems across continents will
inevitably find their way to our shores as though there are not
already enough at our own doorsteps that require attention – bird
flu, economic crisis, H1N1, etc.</p>

what kind of Ministers we need for Singapore. We need a team of
good leaders, men and women of calibre, who can not only engage
with the home ground, tend to their domestic issues on the one hand,
but also concurrently communicate, negotiate and earn the respect
of the international community. They have to understand the complexity
of economic and political issues, exercise brinkmanship and seek
best solutions for Singapore and its people. We need people of a
certain calibre to do this task.</p>

benefited from the practice of meritocracy. Prestige and wealth
go to those who work hard and seize the opportunities that globalisation
offered. Increasingly, it became more difficult to attract talented
individuals to come forward to take the reins of our country. How
many men and women with calibre, talent and experience are willing
to throw away their careers, their materialistic comforts and freedom
to become biblical disciples and serve the nation? My guess is:
there are not many. </p>

salary scheme was drawn up to attract the right calibre candidates
to hold office. Getting to feel the pulse and getting the right
reading of what is a fair salary to pay the office bearers has been
a hotly debatable issue. To the majority who are not in the high
income bracket, looking at the zeros in the numbers understandably
left them in a tizzy. But my friends who are successful in the corporate world
or business circles think otherwise. In fact, very often, whenever
I meet them, they keep reminding me that our Government should not
go soft.</p>

why is it that in Europe, the US and elsewhere, there are countries
that have leaders who are willing to take public office for compensation that
is almost half or less than what we are paying our leaders? My answer
is each country is unique. Look at the stories about politicians
who misused their entitlement to claim expenses unrelated to their
public office. Look at the many scandals that have reverberated
across some countries of Mr Kick-backs and Mr Fix-it. I think those
who have business
dealings in the region would know what I mean. There are no lack
of examples. In fact, the practice of bribing is seen as a custom.</p>

country – we are small indeed – and has no resources. In order to
stay afloat and prosper, we need first class, capable leaders, wise
leaders and hardworking leaders. We need leaders who think ahead,
leaders who plan ahead and leaders who work genuinely for the people
and the country. Singapore has always been envied for having one
of the cleanest governments in the world. The detractors in Singapore
have often denigrated the office of Ministers because of the salaries
they earned as if the money was the mother's milk of politics. If
indeed money was the milk, then it would have been the devil's brew,
and our country would be in tatters.</p>

given me feedback on the outcome of the salary review. The sentiments

the country in the looming recession. Accepting the Committee's
proposal is a right step towards a more promising future. It helps
to boost public confidence in the Government through increased transparency and
addressing public concerns. In the long run, it would help to reinforce

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, the Workers' Party views the Committee's Report
with a sense of hope because it is a step in the right direction.
We agree with the three principles that political salaries should
be competitive, that political service is a calling that has its
own ethos, and their wages should be transparent.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-720ff2de-fcc4-4be7-8fd3-150b484cf692">
                  <a name="motion__id-720ff2de-fcc4-4be7-8fd3-150b484cf692"><!--a--></a>However, the order by which
the principles are applied has produced, in our view, a flawed new
benchmark. Because competitive salary is placed as the first principle
ahead of political service, the Committee has pegged Ministerial
salary to the median salary of the 1,000 top-earning Singaporeans
and then applied a discount for political service.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 844</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4547750b-7416-439b-9c71-b0f5be27a7e0">
                  <a name="motion__id-4547750b-7416-439b-9c71-b0f5be27a7e0"><!--a--></a> If the new benchmark is
accepted by the Government, it will continue to send the message
that top pay is the benchmark by which the calibre of the potential
candidates, the importance of the office ought to be judged, and
that the value of the political office can, in the final analysis,
be monetised. Well, you cannot, not even at the highest income levels.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dbb1ee73-5c9c-4525-8d09-5f64d8b154be">
                  <a name="motion__id-dbb1ee73-5c9c-4525-8d09-5f64d8b154be"><!--a--></a>Political service is a calling.
It is a privilege accorded by the electorate to serve as many of
our Singaporeans as possible. It is primarily a privilege, not a
burden or sacrifice. The principle of political service should come
first and not be treated as a discount factor. Because political
service is in the genre of public service, we propose a "Whole of
Government, People- Up" approach that benchmarks Ministerial salary
to MP allowance, which is in turn pegged to the pay of the civil
servants, benchmarked to the general wage levels. Because political
service starts with our election as parliamentary representatives
of the people, MP allowance should be the starting point. The Cabinet
is the constitutional extension of the Parliament and the institutional
expression that the Legislature has control over the Executive.
It is not, the Cabinet is not an extension of the private sector.
This "Whole of Government, People-Up" approach is a pragmatic reality in
many well-governed developed countries and territories around the
world.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d56afa6c-09d7-462b-bc68-62baa727a620">
                  <a name="motion__id-d56afa6c-09d7-462b-bc68-62baa727a620"><!--a--></a>Is Singapore unique? Of
course but it is not so dissimilar to others that we cannot learn
from their best practices and how they apply good principles. For
example, the Committee writes, "as its international practice in
Westminster parliamentary systems, the political appointment holders
will also receive MP allowances as they have their dual roles of
being MPs". We agree that the Ministers should receive their MP
allowances but that is because Ministers are MPs first. They are
not MPs also, not merely MPs also.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-66bd24cc-2b14-40b5-ad32-a0205eeca361">
                  <a name="motion__id-66bd24cc-2b14-40b5-ad32-a0205eeca361"><!--a--></a> We must remember that in
our system of Government, Ministers are, first of all, MPs elected
by their people as their representatives, not selected by the Prime
Minister from the private sector into the Cabinet and then also
MPs. Parliament is the highest authority in our system of Government
and MPs as electoral representatives of the people should be the
starting point for the determination of Ministerial salary.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5d53bcbf-1e97-407c-8066-15d28aae7edb">
                  <a name="motion__id-5d53bcbf-1e97-407c-8066-15d28aae7edb"><!--a--></a>The Committee's benchmark
to the private sector clouds this fact. Workers' Party recommends
pegging Ministerial salary as multiples of MP allowance. This expresses the
fact that ministers are first and foremost elected as MPs to serve
the people.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c3e73320-46fc-478f-8761-908f130512dc">

peg Ministerial salary to MP allowances? We propose that an entry
grade Minister's monthly salary be five times the MP allowance and
nine times for the Prime Minister.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e4b0c822-c34b-46ca-8ec5-78344eb4db29">
                  <a name="motion__id-e4b0c822-c34b-46ca-8ec5-78344eb4db29"><!--a--></a>As Deputy Prime Minister
said, there are no right or wrong answers and this is ultimately
a judgement call. We propose these multiples based on the increased responsibilities,
additional capabilities and experience required of the different
political offices.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b4e61448-fcd4-4d53-bb45-fb668c178240">
                  <a name="motion__id-b4e61448-fcd4-4d53-bb45-fb668c178240"><!--a--></a>We also believe that it
is where the principles of competitive pay and transparency can
come in to take into consideration some of the factors cited by
the Committee as to why the system of Singapore may be different
from those in other countries. In the words of Deputy Prime Minister,
we believe that the pay should be sufficient to not deter potential
political office holders with desire and ability from serving in
political office without undue concern for their standards of living.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 845</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-bc461a8a-cd6f-4f8b-82ec-ffc35db85a2e"><!--a--></a>Of course, we would like
to see capable men and women in the Cabinet but we do not believe
that our best people for political office are only those who make
the most money. Many of our former and current Ministers did not
come in from the private sector or the top earning professions and
that is as we would expect. </p>

servants who heeded the call of political service by standing for
elections. Political service is in the nature of public service.
We believe that MP allowance should be set with reference to the
salary of senior executives in the regular civil service. This is
consistent with the general practice in many countries and territories
we surveyed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4842faa4-add1-48c8-8f26-bb0bd88ee6e6">
                  <a name="motion__id-4842faa4-add1-48c8-8f26-bb0bd88ee6e6"><!--a--></a>The starting salary of entry
grade senior civil servants in the regular Civil Service, the director
of MX9 grade in the Management Executive scheme of the Civil Service
outside the Admin Service is approximately $11,000 a month. In our
proposal, MP allowance would be about $11,000 a month. Ministerial
salary would range from $55,000 a month for entry grade Ministers
to $99,000 per month for the Prime Minister. We support a clean
wage proposal for transparency in which compensation is fully accounted
for and there are no hidden items.</p>

13th month salary that is keyed into MP allowance, we propose that
Ministers and the Prime Minister receive variable pay of different
bonuses that add up to no more than five months in any year, compared
to 13.5 months for the Ministers as recommended by the Committee.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1c982f64-8a58-4938-b192-d18608083c96">

home up to three or four months' bonuses in a very good year compared
to the 13.5 months that the Committee has recommended. In fact, if
the maximum bonuses recommended by the Committee were awarded, the
reduction in entry grade Minister pay would be 8% and not the 31%
calculated by the Committee.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c454f3e2-53bc-45ff-87bb-249d15b9549f">

Service salary is aligned to general market conditions faced by
Singaporean workers, MP allowance and Ministerial salary would move
with the income levels of many more Singaporeans than with the total
employment and trade income of the top-earning one thousand including
their bonuses, their commissions and their stock options.</p>

help our leaders empathise with the majority of Singaporeans and
not just the very few. The Workers' Party's proposed approach aims
to enhance inclusivity and sensitivity to the progress of Singaporeans rather
than discounted exclusivity pegged to top earners.</p>

has taken the right step forward with the three principles. It is
up to the Government to go further and apply the principles in the
right order by recognising that political service is the first principle
anchored in the primacy of Parliament. Let us place Ministerial
pay on a sound footing in order to ground political leadership in
a strong sense of service to all Singaporeans.</p>

a political blind spot. The Ministers are first of all MPs elected

we can now move on to the second and third principles. In what multiples
should Singapore peg Ministerial salary to MP allowance to ensure competitiveness?
The Workers' Party proposes that an entry-grade Minister's monthly salary

This is still higher than the international standard, sufficient
to reflect Singapore's uniqueness.</p>

that the best politicians must come from the top 1,000 income earners.
Among our current and previous Ministers, there are many who are
not from the private sector or top-earning professionals. Many of
them come from the public sector. Some started from being MPs and
accumulated experience over the years and then become a Minister. </p>

the whole-of-Government approach, with MP allowance as the basis
for Ministerial salary and the MP allowance equal to top civil servants'
starting pay, around $11,000 a month. As civil servants' salaries
are dependent on the economic situation and the market condition,
just like the rest of the workforce, this approach will make sure
Ministerial salaries will not become disconnected with the general
wage level. Rather than discounting from the salaries of the top
1,000 income earners, we think this people-up approach, with civil
servants' salary as the basis for MP allowance and Ministerial salary,
is more appropriate. </p>

clean wage system. However, the bonus suggested by the Committee
is obviously too high. According to the Report, Ministerial salary
will be reduced by 31%, but that is based on an average of seven
months of bonus. However, a Minister can receive as high as 13.5
months of bonus. If he takes them all, his salary is only reduced
by 8% compared to before. </p>

Party proposes that in addition to the 13-month pay, that the Ministers

in a good year, Prime Minister and Ministers can receive as much
as 18 months' salary, not the 26 months recommended by the Committee. </p>

Sir, ask 10 different people how much they think their political
leaders should be paid and you are likely to get 10 different responses.
Sir, that was my experience when I consulted Singaporeans in the public,
private and people sectors through desktop research, face-to-face
discussions and polls.</p>

fighting for causes they deeply believe in, sacrificing part or
all of their salary is not an issue. To the low-wage worker who
earns $5 an hour, a million-dollar pay is unimaginable. To a PMET
(Professional, Manager, Executive or Technician) earning the median
Singapore income of less than $3,000 per month, the million-dollar
pay is an unattainable dream.</p>

the Golden Parachute effect of entrants to politics who enjoy big
windfalls in pay although they had no prior appropriate leadership
experience. Yet to some others in the private sector, the Ministers'
pay is a bargain, compared to the typical $3 million to $7 million
annual CEO packages of local banks, telcos and others. On the ground,
someone quipped that the annual pay of a specific local CEO, which
in a good year can skyrocket to $20 million, could pay for more than
half the Cabinet. <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> reported recently that
the annual incomes of even second tier senior executives in some
big local companies amounted to between $1 million and $2 million. </p>

reminded me very much of the parable of "The elephant and the six
blind men". Each man described the animal according to the part
of the elephant he was touching. And according to the poet, John
Godfrey Saxe's poem of the same parable, all men "disputed loud
and long". The truth of the matter is that all of them are right
except that each view is but a partial view. The same can be said
of Singaporeans' descriptions of the Ministerial pay issue. The
disputes are similarly "loud and long", and Ministerial pay is one
of the most divisive subjects in our country. To heal our land,
it is critical that each one of us takes the time and be open enough
to find out and accept that there are other perspectives. </p>

learnt to recognise my view, like the blind men describing the elephant,
is but one perspective based very much on my own values and season
in life. Mind you, there are indeed people who would still give
up successful careers to do what they believe in. In fact, just
last week, another young banker hung up her corporate suit and joined
the charity I run. But there are not enough of them. I could not
find enough of them who had the right mix of passion and technical
and leadership competencies I need to help me construct our dream
21st century charity and special schools. Finally, through a mix
of monetary and non-monetary measures, such as culture-building,
we were able to attract and retain barely enough talents to sustain
our rapid growth in the sector that I work in. </p>

the additional perspective I wish to offer to the topic of the Ministerial

from my leadership and HR professional's perspective. Sir, I hold
this glass of water in my hand [<em class="ph i">indicating</em>]. Is it half-full
or half-empty? Some of us optimists will say it is half-full. Others,

agree with the recommendations carried in the Report of the Ministerial
Salaries Committee, I cannot, in good conscience, say that the Committee

50%, measures which are hardly cosmetic, the Committee has moved
in the right direction. Like many in Singapore, I thought it was
important that if reference was drawn from what I felt was a more
punishing private sector in terms of pay and accountability, then it
was only right that common compensation principles in that sector
be applied. I am heartened that some of the recommendations I made
in April 2007 were considered and applied and, in some cases, enhanced: </p>

to a broader base of income wage earners and discard the discount
feature. The proposed salary benchmark of the entry level Minister
is now pegged to the top 1,000 wage earners, instead of 48, in Singapore.
A discount of 40% is then applied.</p>

1,000 top wage earners, albeit more reasonable, is still arbitrary
and still smacks of elitism because the base is about 0.05% of the
workforce, assuming a workforce size of two million. The application
of the discount – whether the current one-third or the proposed
40% – is also arbitrary and often forgotten and unappreciated.</p>

leaders' pay be pegged to a simple top percentile income bracket,
for example, 10% or 20% of Singaporeans. Then discard the discount
feature. A quick poll I conducted revealed that many Singaporeans
are likely to understand and accept that their political leaders
belong to the top 10%-20% income bracket in our country. So, a simpler
formula.</p>

strengthen the line of sight between pay and performance. Let us
remove one of the three components of the Variable Pay Component,
that is the Annual Variable Component (AVC) which is one month or
so, and retain only (i) Performance Bonus which relates to the performance
of the individual portfolio; and (ii) National Bonus which is linked
to how our country performs. And then publicise the Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) for individual portfolios so that Singaporeans
have a better understanding of how they are linked to performance bonuses
of the office bearers. Developing and publishing KPIs that relate
to both the routine operations and new initiatives in the especially
essential services such as housing, transport, social services,
and education, are important for better understanding of the size
of the individual portfolios and promote better quality dialogues.
And (iii) expand the National Bonus indicators which are now 100%
linked to jobs and incomes. This is to reduce the potential of excessive
risk-taking or undesirable tactics to boost the numbers of these
composite indicators. For example, starting a third casino to boost
the economy may well boost all four components of the National Bonus –
the real median income growth rate will increase; the real growth
rate of the lowest 20th percentile income will increase; the unemployment
rate will be lowered; and real GDP growth rate will be enhanced
if we only start a third or fourth casino; but the move may well
be an easier path or lazy way to not develop our own tourism products
and is detrimental to the long-term competitiveness and social well-being
of our people.</p>

the benefits package and let us not over-extend the "clean-wage"
principle. Sir, it is a little ludicrous that the dental benefit
of our Prime Minister and our Cabinet Ministers is $70 per year
and their outpatient subsidy is capped at $350 a year. Consider
the provision of common benefits such as car and annual health screening
packages that are typically provided to executives in our country.
Let us not over-extend this application of the principle of "clean
wage" so that it becomes artificial.</p>

the job scope and expectations of political appointment holders.
Sir, one of the underlying factors leading to the constant unhappy
undertone when this subject of political pay is discussed in our
country is the lack of awareness of the duties of political appointment holders
from Members of Parliament to Ministers and even Speakers. </p>

differing views of their roles. The latest episode during which
several Opposition MPs opine that it is the job of Government and
not MPs to directly help the poor and needy and therefore referral
is the key strategy, caused a debate of its own outside the House.
The clarity of duties and goals would be useful even to MPs of the
ruling party. The man in the street, for instance, does not understand
the role of the Speaker of the House and does not have sufficient
information to comprehend how it equates to a Cabinet Minister. </p>

the case of office bearers who hold multiple portfolios, sometimes
up to three roles. It takes more than a human being to do three
roles effectively and leave little time and space for the incumbent
to reflect and reform policies where needed. Sir, instead of sweeping
these rumblings under carpet, it is needful to clarify the job scopes
and expectations of political appointment holders to our people.</p>

a review of the Civil Service leadership pay. One of my deepest
concerns is that this Review excluded the some 300 top civil servants
in the elite Administrative Service (Admin Service). The title of
the Report is entitled "Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government"
but the review has deliberately excluded top civil service leaders,
specifically the Permanent Secretaries and others in the elite Admin Service;
I think 300 of them. This is the group that has often been kept
below the radar from public eye although they play a significant
role in our country in supporting the Prime Minister and his Cabinet
in the development and execution of national policies. Due to their
critical role, some of these elite talents are pegged on the same
salary band with our Ministers.</p>

of the committee of political pay review are accepted, some civil
servants will receive much higher packages than their Ministers. Unlike

the retention of benefits such as the pension schemes which will
be removed from the Ministers' packages. </p>

especially for those who opt for a career in the civil service is
not an issue. However, the same principles of rigour in job evaluation,
job sizing, accountability for KPIs and disclosure must also be
applied. If private firms and charities are expected to disclose
the highest paid executives and their salary bands, there is no reason
why there should be a cloak of secrecy over the Admin Service incumbents.
Sir, I ask the Prime Minister to commission an independent review
of top civil service leadership that will go beyond pay to attract,
develop and retain talent for a capable and committed government. </p>

review of political salaries is a work-in-progress. It needs refinement
but it is moving in the right direction. To reject it and to wait

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to take part in this debate. Like my hon colleague,
Mr Chen Show Mao, I believe that the White Paper's approach in benchmarking
Ministerial salaries to top income earners is fundamentally flawed. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 852</p>

entry-level Ministers' salaries to three-fifths of the median of
the 1,000 highest earning Singaporeans. This group represents the
top 0.06% of Singaporean income earners. It represents no significant
shift from the previous two-thirds M48 formula which pegged Ministers'
salaries to two-thirds of the median among a small group of 48 professionals,
comprising top bankers, lawyers, MNC chiefs and others. </p>

Ministers' salaries against the richest of the rich, reflecting
an approach that appears to be based on a number of questionable assumptions.</p>

Ministerial talents should first be found among the highest income
earners. The Paper states that the benchmark "reflect(s) the calibre
of the people which Singapore needs for good government."</p>

Ministers will be parachuted in from the top echelons of the private
sector, rather than going through the paces of being first elected
as MPs, gaining experience on the ground, before being promoted
to junior Ministers and finally full Ministers.</p>

potential Ministers are often reluctant politicians, who consider
entering politics to be a sacrifice and a burden, rather than a
privilege to serve the nation, and, therefore, need to be coaxed
with monetary incentives before stepping forward.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister for his explanation during his speech earlier.
He was concerned that if we drastically reduced Ministerial salaries,
it might shrink the potential pool of talents to draw from. Mr Speaker,
selecting political leaders is not a game of chance. It is most
important that we are able to identify and recruit good leaders.
The goal should not be to enlarge the pool of people to draw from.
In fact, by filtering out individuals who are – to put it bluntly
– in it for the money, we could actually streamline the process of identifying capable
and passionate political leaders who can take our nation forward.</p>

also expressed concerns that if potential Ministers waited 10 to
15 years before entering politics, we might miss them in their prime
years. I would like to suggest that if people who are truly passionate
about serving Singapore in the political arena that they will make
the necessary financial plans and adjust their future financial
commitments to fit the salary they will be receiving.</p>

Mao has already articulated the Workers' Party's proposed salary
benchmark. I would now like to focus in more detail on the bonuses proposed
in the Paper and what the Workers' Party views as a more appropriate
way of structuring the variable pay of political appointment holders.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 853</p>

of the variable pay of Ministers in the proposed framework: a new
National Bonus, an individual Performance Bonus, an Annual Variable
Component (AVC) and a Special Variable Payment.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-55d135f1-a1e8-4425-9c1e-4e1b3b550559">

Ministers can expect to get seven months' bonus as part of their
"normal" compensation package, and 13.5 months or more in an exceptional
year. The latter will more than double their already high base salary.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-07167509-b2d7-4fa0-ae15-8381a5321788">
                  <a name="motion__id-07167509-b2d7-4fa0-ae15-8381a5321788"><!--a--></a>Sir, the purpose of a bonus
is to provide an extrinsic motivation for a worker to perform well
on the job, especially when his or her base salary is not high.
However, entry-level Ministers' base salary of $55,000 a month already
puts them among the highest wage earners in Singapore, so there
is little reason why it needs to be supplemented by such a large
bonus. More importantly, we need to ask whether our Ministers are
the type of people who need such huge bonuses to motivate them to perform
well. Did they not all claim to have entered politics to serve the
people? I trust that the hon. Members who hold political office
will still be motivated to serve the people of Singapore even without
such large bonuses.</p>

more than just intrinsic motivators to perform well, in a properly
functioning democracy with a first-world parliament, there should
be sufficient extrinsic motivators to spur their performance. These
include: scrutiny by Members of Parliament, the media, civil society
and the public at large. Of course, the most important motivator
for the Ministers is the need to convince voters to re-elect them
during the General Elections.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d126350d-22a3-425a-9901-7c96617e2638">

and allowances have been reduced from as high as 26.5 months under
the previous framework. However, the proposed bonuses are still excessive.
Such large bonuses are usually seen only among senior executives
of large corporations which, of course, are the very people the
Paper proposes to benchmark the Ministers' salaries against. In
fact, bonuses for political leaders are still largely unheard of
in the rest of the developed world. Among the 12 well-governed countries
and territories the Workers' Party studied, we have found so far
that only one country – Japan – makes annual bonus payments to its
Ministers. Japan's Prime Minister received the bonus of just 2.6
months in 2011. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9b2e119-2b63-45f2-9b0f-14fccee4f9a6">

approach of paying out bonuses as high as seven months, simply for
meeting targets. Even in the private sector, seven months bonuses
are generally only paid when both the employee and the company far
exceed their targets. In other words, it is an additional payment
for doing much better than expected. It is not a payment for just meeting the expectations
of their job – that is what their basic wages are for.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6c4752f5-be25-4170-ae3a-77dcbe28fd04">
                  <a name="motion__id-6c4752f5-be25-4170-ae3a-77dcbe28fd04"><!--a--></a>Last year, workers in Singapore
got an average of just over two months of variable bonus, including
the Annual Wage Supplement. On the other hand, our political leaders are
set to receive seven to 13.5 months of bonus, on top of their already
high base salaries. This can only serve to accentuate the empathy
gap between the Government and the people. To bring bonuses down
to a more acceptable level, I propose that the total variable component
do not exceed five months, even in a very good year. If all targets
are just met, the payment should be around three months. This is
an addition to their 13th month Annual Wage Supplement.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 854</p>

approach to policy making, the National Bonus should form at least
two-thirds of the variable component with the individual performance
bonus making up the remaining third. </p>

see the introduction of the National Bonus. The focus on the income
growth of ordinary workers is a welcome departure from the disproportionate focus
on GDP growth, which was the basis for the GDP Bonus of the past.
The previous GDP Bonus could pay out as much as eight months' salary
in a high growth year like 2010. With regard to the performance
bonus, the Paper states that it allows the Prime Minister "the discretion
to reward a political appointment holder based on performance in
his immediate portfolio as well as wider contributions at the whole-of-government level".
I would like to see greater transparency on the performance bonus
component as well as a lowering of its discretionary element.</p>

performance indicators and KPI targets for each Ministry be defined
at the start of the term of government. These KPI targets should
be made public and they should be aligned to the goals that the
government sets out at the Opening of Parliament. Each year, the
performance bonus of the Minister helming that Ministry should be
computed based on the achievement of those KPI targets. Since it
would be impractical to tie each and every Ministry's performance
indicator to the Minister, we could select just the most relevant
KPIs affecting the majority of Singaporeans. For example, the Transport
Ministry could set KPIs at the frequency of MRT disruptions and commuters'
satisfaction survey results. The KPIs could also provide more transparency to
the public on the Minister's performance. Voters might find the
information useful for making their decisions at the ballot box. </p>

the National Bonus, I see no need to retain the annual variable
component and the special variable payment, which are also based
on Singapore's economic performance. I propose that we do away with
them.</p>

have such large bonuses, then the portion of the bonuses should
be deferred rather than having the whole bonus paid out at the end
of each year. A deferred bonus could be structured in the form of
a bonus bank. This is a concept that some financial institutions
introduced in the wake of the last financial crisis to discourage
their senior executives from pursuing short-term results at the
expense of consistent performance over the long term. Only a portion,
perhaps one-third, of the Ministers' National Bonus and performance
bonus should be paid out at the end of each year, and the rest deposited
into a separate account. If, in subsequent years, performance is good,
their bonus bank balance will grow. However, if performance fails to
meet targets at any one year, there should be a claw-back which
deducts from their bonus bank balance. At the end of the term of
government when Parliament is dissolved, the Ministers will get
paid what remains in their bonus bank account. If, say, performance
has been good in the first year of government but poor in subsequent years,
the Minister could potentially lose all that is in his or her bonus
bank account. This would help ensure that Ministers always carefully
consider the longer term consequences of their policy decisions.</p>

I support some of the proposals in the White Paper, including the
removal of pensions and the introduction of the National Bonus.
However, I fundamentally disagree that the top-down approach of
benchmarking Ministerial salaries to top income earners as well
as the principle of paying out huge bonuses to political leaders.
Mr Speaker, for these reasons, I oppose the motion.</p>

Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two questions for Mr Giam. The first:
this is a very interesting proposal. I just want to check if the
Workers' Party actually made this proposal to the Committee back
when the consultations were going on. The second question is this:
while I understand that the Member disagrees with the method in
which the benchmark and starting salary was arrived at, the conclusion
the Member reached is that the starting salary should be $55,000
which is actually higher than what is recommended by the Committee
of $46,750. Where he seemed to disagree is actually the quantum
of the bonus - the range that should be determined. Am I right to
say that that is the main point of the disagreement?</p>

January 2006, I had never imagined I would play a part on Singapore's
political stage. Like all working mothers, I was already feeling
stretched. Becoming an MP on top of my demanding commitments sounded
like an impossible task. My eldest child was in Primary 2. My twin
girls were 5+ and in kindergarten. I questioned what sort of a mother
I must be to even think about it.</p>

to cross my own hurdle, I discussed it with my husband. We had many
long and serious conversations. Even though he understood that it
would mean significant changes to our lives, he agreed to support
my decision to take up political service. But I knew that in his
heart, the pressure he felt then was no less than mine.</p>

becoming an MP? For me, it is because it is a commitment of at least
five years, and possibly 20 years. You know you cannot just walk away.
Someone else will make the decision for you. But on the other hand,
how many countries in the world have the kind of political system
that is so unusually clean, serious and fruitful? Having benefited
from the Singapore system, did I not have the duty to help preserve
it for my children and theirs?</p>

asked me tough questions. Looking back, the toughest one which provoked
the deepest reflection was in fact from my father just a few days
before I was introduced. Having heard my reasons, he asked gently,
"Do you think the sacrifice will be worth it?" </p>

many jobs involve some sort of sacrifice. In my previous role in
the Labour Movement, I had great respect for my colleagues, especially
the Industrial Relations Officers. The IROs keep long hours. They
are often caught in the crossfire between the workers and the employers.
It is emotionally draining. Many of the meetings with union leaders
can only take place after usual work hours. Most events to bring
members together are held on weekends. This impacts their family
lives. It is a tough job. Without passion and willingness to serve,
IROs cannot last long. But even those who are passionate will from
time to time wonder if the union really values their contributions.
This happens if the union has resources but allows staff salaries
or career progression to fall far behind that of their peers working
elsewhere. If the union is serious about retaining its most passionate
and talented people, it cannot avoid the questions of salary and
career progression. </p>

call from the father of a bright girl who had been offered a scholarship
to pursue her undergraduate degree and PhD in a prestigious university. Her
father asked me, "How much will her salary be after she returns
from her PhD?" I explained that we took into account the approximate
five years she would take to complete her PhD. Her salary thus assumed
five years of relevant work experience. After he heard the figure,
the man asked, "Do you know that if my daughter became a lawyer, she
would by then earn double that amount?"</p>

as well that the girl did not take up the PhD Scholarship. She might
have wanted to do research, but could she live up to the expectations
of her father or other family members? It takes great passion and
determination to succeed as a researcher. Nonetheless, before a
person chooses to commit a considerable part of his life to scientific
pursuit, it is reasonable to ask what is involved and whether he
would be severely advantaged by going down the path. While A*STAR
can dismiss a few cases as "not committed enough", it cannot bury
its head in the ground and neglect to keep up a competitive salary
regime. </p>

pay alone will not get you the right people. To do that, a good
selection process must be in place. Thereafter, you need a good
HR system that helps good people feel they are appreciated and wanted.
The overall package must be right. Paying competitive salaries is
also no guarantee an organisation will succeed but it represents
the best chance of getting the best talents which will help the
organisation to capture the best opportunities for growth and development. </p>

in the public sector are not the same as in the private sector,

to accept the Committee's proposal on political salaries, the Government
must consider the level of public acceptance. If the Government
does not explain its position well, if public believes that the
principles are wrong or the salaries too high or just a way for
political leaders to enrich themselves undeservedly, they will make
their views known through the polls when the time comes. Because
of the potential political cost, it is a subject matter most governments
would gladly avoid. But if we do so, we are shirking our responsibility.
As awkward as it is to discuss salaries so openly and publicly,
we have to find a consensus.</p>

this debate was based on the wrong question of "how to pay Ministers?"
I agree. As is the case of IROs and scientists, pay is just a means
to an end. We first decide what kinds of IROs and scientists we
want. Then, we decide how to structure pay to get the right people,
not the other way round. Therefore, to me, the question before us
is really "what type of political leadership do we want for Singapore?" I
will put it to you that there are three things we want.</p>

where the quality of the civil service is very high, you do need
a political leadership whose intellect matches up. Some people have
argued the opposite. They say that because we have such a good civil

to come up with options, and the political leader just chooses options
A, B or C – multiple-choice question. </p>

cannot be the case. Capable civil servants will not accept answering

In my view, the Committee headed by Gerard Ee has put forward a
proposal that deserves strong support. It is by no means a perfect
system because no salary system ever is, even in the private sector.
We always struggle with whether we have got the right balance. Even
in the private sector, the bosses ask, "Are we paying too much?"
We may disagree on a few aspects. But the overall direction, overall
package is the right one.</p>

have to decide if that is so. Can we find people to fill Parliament

people whatever the salary levels are. The question is whether we

Members that the toughest questions I faced had been from my father.
It took me many sleepless nights to find the right answer to whether
"the sacrifice will be worth it". I decided it would be too painful
to carry around the notion of sacrifice. It will cloud my vision
and colour everything I do. Hence, I made the choice not to frame
it as a sacrifice. Instead, I choose to see political service as
a privilege, just as it is serving in the Labour Movement and the
public sector where I was before joining the Labour Movement. It
is an opportunity to do something for the children few moms can. I
am grateful for the opportunity. And every time I land at Changi

much "it is worth it".</p>

to speak on behalf of all my colleagues, I believe they, too, made
difficult decisions in agreeing to take up political service. Just

and right for the kind of political leadership we want for Singapore.
Let us ask if it will continue to help us have political leaders

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, the remuneration of our political leaders has always been a
sensitive and emotional topic. I would like to thank Deputy Prime
Minister Teo Chee Hean for his comprehensive statement on the motion
and I was heartened that the Prime Minister took the step to call
for the independent Ministerial Salary Review Committee to undertake
the review of our remuneration framework last year following the
General Election (GE).</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 860</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-063f7b87-d137-423a-8b10-58b3ab05400b">

in response to the sentiments of Singaporeans at the GE, I hope
that this move is not a knee-jerk political reaction, but one that
leads to a longer term remuneration framework that is fairer and
more acceptable to Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5e7eaa1a-b49e-4959-b11f-3f74a8a0e65d">

have undertaken this motion, because governments know the topic
can be politically charged when the incomes, wealth and family dealings
of political leaders are up for public scrutiny. So, I would like
to convey my respect to all Members in this House – Ministers and
MPs – for putting their remuneration up for scrutiny in the spirit
of transparency and good governance. I would like to credit the Ministerial
Salary Review Committee for taking a step in the right direction
towards a fairer remuneration for political office holders and MPs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ad506472-af4c-422c-8a4a-01e47dd8c549">

of the public, many were surprised by the degree of the cuts. Others,
on the other hand, felt that the salaries were still high. Therein
lies the difficulty in bridging the logical benchmarks – the emotive
aspects of a political office-holder's remuneration on one hand,
and on the other hand, the roles and responsibilities of the political
leaders – that is key to the well-being of the country and the individual citizen
and the people we need to fill these roles.</p>

by the changes to replace the GDP Bonus with a National Bonus linked
not just to GDP, but also to the socio-economic progress of Singaporeans. I
think that this sends a strong signal on our focus to keep unemployment
low, improve the real incomes of Singaporeans and still maintain
a good enough GDP growth. </p>

had this perception that the Government is too growth-focused and
that was because of the way bonuses for the public service was set
up. These were highly dependent on GDP growth. So I support this
change as I hope that this will also send a strong signal of what
the focus of this Government should be and that it is aligned to
our strategic concerns of bridging the income gap, especially at
the median and bottom segments, and ensuring that Singaporeans are
gainfully employed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d53ab0e2-68ac-4e4c-991d-6465ff576bdd">
                  <a name="motion__id-d53ab0e2-68ac-4e4c-991d-6465ff576bdd"><!--a--></a>What I also hope is that
the civil service will also adopt this National Bonus recommendation,
that we also have a more connected civil service to serve Singaporeans
with similar values and level of empathy to uplift our people and
improve their lot. People equate the civil service with the Government.
The civil service is always the first contact point of the people,
and how they perform does matter. Be it about housing, education,
social help or other issues. And the Prime Minister has rightly pointed
out that for the PAP Government, we must get our politics right.
It is about touching
the heart and soul of Singaporeans. We cannot get all policies right
100% of the time. But certainly we can do more to engage Singaporeans,
to connect with the ground and to address their concerns to bridge
the gaps. And I think that Singaporeans also recognise that this
has to be a whole-of-government principle, and not just for the political
leadership. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-6b091eba-03da-4d71-8b34-23fdeb089559"><!--a--></a>Sir, the removal of the
pensions is also timely. For many years, I have found this part of
the package hard to defend as almost all ordinary workers have done
away with pensions many years ago. So, it is time that the political
office-holders get in alignment. I have always believed that Ministers
and office-holders should set the right example and be aligned to
our workers who have made the sacrifice and adopted the CPF-based retirement
savings approach many years ago. We have long said that this puts
less burden on our youths of today and the future generations of
this country and employers. This is the right thing to do, and I
am supportive of this change.</p>

how the salary benchmarks should be made. The proposed formula considers
the median of the top 1,000 Singaporean income earners, taking into
consideration a 40% discount. Some say this should have been a multiple
of median income or some other complex formula. I refer to Workers'
Party's statement earlier. I thank Member Chen Show Mao for his
speech earlier and agree that political office is a calling and
a privilege bestowed by the electorate. But I also think that personal
sacrifice is a sort of commitment any MP needs to take on for the
electorate.</p>

Party called for the benchmarks to be applied against MP allowance
and in turn pegged to civil service benchmarks. One flaw in this
principle is that the civil servants are executives. The civil service
benchmark is meant to attract and retain good people in the civil
service. This means that civil service has to be comparative to
market rates as well, maybe slightly behind but it is still a market-based principle
benchmark. As explained by Deputy Prime Minister Teo, they should
not be subjected to the discount which politicians or Ministers
are subjected to, to sacrifice for the people.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-8c512fa4-b8a3-41fe-82eb-348d2bf843cf"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Workers' Party's
proposed benchmark still puts forth a high base salary of $55,000
yet the benchmark is still market-based and the difference between
the proposal accepted by the PAP Government and the one put forth
by the Workers' Party is that the latter leaves out the principles
of sacrifice and discounts to reflect service to the people.</p>

I think, is really about what a job is worth, whether it makes sense,
given the responsibility and the value to having a capable and honest Government.
With this benchmark, the Committee arrived at a $1.1 million figure, including
estimated bonuses, with an entry-level Minister earning $938,000.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ae484400-bc97-426f-b3f2-40e21f4b7074">

be seen as one benchmark. While we can debate on the philosophy
behind the formula, the core question on everyone's mind is whether
the remuneration figure is too high or too low for the value and
the roles and responsibilities of the various positions involved.
While political observers and many have commented on the formulas,
I do not think anyone has put an alternative number that is acceptable to
everyone.</p>

Prime Minister Teo had mentioned that it is not possible to benchmark
various political salaries of our peers internationally, but for
all intents of fair comparison to rationalise the benchmarks, I
also think that the Committee should still attempt to benchmark all perks, benefits,
tax breaks and other hidden costs of other political remuneration
of other equally developed countries. We can make some assumptions
in the gap. Even if the rankings turn out to be that we are better remunerated,
we know that from that basis, how much premium we hold on keeping
our country competitive despite our small size with no natural resources,
and also keeping our Government clean and corruption-free. This
does not have to be a benchmark but can be seen as a sanity check
and perhaps, in doing so, we may set an example for others to follow.
Any electorate demanding that the government be transparent with political
remuneration may then turn to Singapore as an example to follow.
I think few will argue the need to have a strong and capable government
to lead Singapore. And so, in good conscience, we have to ask ourselves,
what is needed to keep a capable and corruption-free government.</p>

with is that there is just too much emphasis sometimes in justifying
the salary review based on whether the new political salaries can
attract top talents. In the 2007 debate, I questioned the assumption
"that good leadership and visionaries can only consist of the most
intellectual and that money can attract them to serve the people
of Singapore. If we cannot find 25 good men and women, to serve
as Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, out of our population of
five million, what values have our policies inculcated in our society?"</p>

that political office cannot be about money alone. One aspect of
the review principles says a lot about the role of politicians here,
but it is not emphasised as much as it should be and, that is, that
political service ethos entail making sacrifices. And, unfortunately,
the messaging and conversations that happen on the ground end up
to be too much focused on monetary sacrifice.</p>

will entail a lot more sacrifices than just money, I think as Member
Josephine Teo has mentioned as well. For example, family time, especially those
with young families. There is also reputational risk for those who
wish to step forward to greater public scrutiny as well as opportunity
costs to careers – as seen in the recent GE politics that this is
not an iron rice bowl. </p>

on monetary sacrifice, it is sad when politicians are being labelled
as money-minded, and coming into politics for the money. In the
recent General and Presidential Elections, we had candidates who
promised to give a portion of their salaries in return for the vote.
I think this is wrong and sets a wrong political culture for Singapore.
There is a worth and dignity to this office. And one should get
in on the basis of the candidate's abilities. If the person gets
elected, it is up to him or her to decide how to give back one's
earnings without fanfare. If you are doing it with your heart, should one
need to publicise this giving? In Malay, we have a word for this
giving – it is called "<em class="ph i">ikhlas</em>". Giving with a heart, and
not expecting returns. And I know many politicians have done this
for many years, and we should uphold the dignity of this office.</p>

label politicians as coming into office for the money. It is another thing
to try to pinpoint which politician in this House put their names

deter good people from serving, no matter what the benchmarks say.</p>

House have stepped forward with the intent of serving Singapore

the dignity of this political office. I do not think money is the
sole barrier today. The benchmarks would keep politicians comfortable
to focus on the job at hand – and not easily succumb to monetary
temptations elsewhere. And I choose to believe that we have talented
people among the three million citizens that we have today, who
can step forward to serve the country and take this nation forward.
And it is up to the political parties, whether PAP or otherwise,
to find the right talents, who have their hearts in the right place
for Singapore. </p>

this review and debate, is that the electorate is better aware of
the remuneration of the various political offices. Sir, it is also
timely that the Government sets about creating awareness of what
the roles and responsibilities of the various office-holders are.
A recent survey indicated that many Singaporeans did not understand
the role of the President. And often, I get asked if I go down to
the MPS to meet residents only once a week. Nothing wrong with the
statement but people tend to have the impression that this is the
only role of the MP. So like many here, I live, breathe, think politics
every day, almost every moment – even on leave and at home. But
I think we need to continuously bring awareness to the roles we
politicians play. I think not many can differentiate between Ministers
and Ministers of State, or between Parliamentary Secretaries and
Permanent Secretaries.</p>

bridge the gaps between what Government provides and what the constituents
need. But as there is no standard point of reference, I think these

we can trust their judgement on whether a candidate is capable and
can represent their interests if they can weigh the roles and responsibilities

That is a good sign and, with greater awareness, the electorate
can make better judgement if a candidate is worth the value of the

the onus is now on the political parties – PAP or otherwise – to

and uphold our high standards of Government, but also to find those
with a heart to serve and can connect with the people. We have to
develop beyond this monetary aspect of the political office and
re-establish the ethos of public service that is dignified and characterises
servitude to the people. </p>

becomes the main attraction for them to come forward. I am sure that

in <em class="ph i">Lianhe Zaobao</em>, discussing what is most important in our world
today. The article is written by Mr Koh Chin Yee. He felt that in
this world today, the most important is the heart of the people.
I agree. To any successful government, talent is very important, but the heart
of the individual is even more important. However, no government
can function effectively without both of them. What will happen
to the livelihood and welfare of the people if one of them is lacking
in the government? I am sure we all know the answer in our hearts.
Hence, money should not be the reason for getting talents to enter
politics, but it also should not be the reason for losing the talents. </p>

we have seen many rulers who sought talents. Liu Bei went to see
Zhu Ge Liang three times, braving snow and rain, because he wanted
to secure the services of Zhu Ge Liang. Liu Bei's sincerity finally
moved Zhu Ge Liang, who agreed to help him. Zhu Ge Liang gave his
all to serve his country, his spirit became an exemplary model for
others, and his story became an important chapter in human civilisation.
What moved Zhu Ge Liang to accept Liu Bei's proposal was his sincerity.
The Singapore Government's sincerity in attracting talent is no
less than Liu Bei's. However, just sincerity and high pay cannot
attract enough talent to join the Government. From what we can see
in the May elections last year, where the number of candidates from the
labour movement and civil service surpassed those from the private
sector, attracting well-rounded talent to join the Government is
something that the Government needs to work on. Hence, whatever
way is required to attract talents, we should not brush them aside
lightly. </p>

ethics book of filial piety, in the whole of heaven and earth, a
person is the most precious. A Tang Dynasty book on politics(反经)is considered
a miniature version of the <em class="ph i">Book of History</em>
                  (资治通鉴).
It discussed many techniques of people management. A quotation from
the book that left a deep impression on me is, "If you have talented
people, the country will prosper. If you lose talented people, the
country will collapse". What it means is, if you have the talents,
the country will prosper. If you do not have the talents, the country
will not do well. Going back to ancient Chinese history, the Tang,
Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties had all experienced periods
of prosperity because they had abundant talent. And they all declined
eventually because of inadequacy of talents. All these are historical
lessons in governance that are worth pondering upon. </p>

a country, we need talent. Whether it is in a country, corporation
or social organisations, only a few people will eventually make
the final decision. That is why in the Analects, there are specific
chapters discussing the saying that one word can make a country
prosper, while another can bring it down. So, identifying the right
talent, grooming the right talent using the right talents and allowing them
to utilise their potential to the fullest is the key reason why
Singapore is able to develop from a fishing village to a modern
metropolis. Past experiences have shown that positive interaction
between the people and the Government can make the entire society
more efficient, allow us to surpass neighbouring countries, maintain
higher competitiveness and bring about peace and prosperity. </p>

the Ministerial Salary Review Committee has consolidated the views
of various segments of the society, seriously and objectively assessed
the salary framework of the President, Speaker, Prime Minister and
Ministers. And the Prime Minister has announced that the Government
is prepared to accept their recommendations. I believe that this
discussion should be brought to a close after this parliamentary
debate. It takes time to assess if the new system is effective.
Furthermore, the Committee also recommends to review this every
five years and, if there is room for improvement, I am sure in the
next review we can implement changes. With this periodic review,
we will be able to further improve the system so that we can fine-tune it. All of us know
that Rome was not built in one day. Systems will also take time
to build. If we continue to argue about this, it will be counter-productive.

be accused of being "brainless". I am concerned that further debate
of this issue will bring about more worries, and that people will
devote too much energy in the debate, and veer further away from
their original purpose of entering politics. It will also deter
people with a heart to serve from coming forward. If there is a

they be willing to give up their high salaries in the private sector
and accept a public post with a lower salary, almost all of them
would say "I do not have any interest in politics, but I am sure
there are others who are prepared to go into politics". This kind
of response does not surprise me. However, a few young people brought
up a point that set me thinking. They said that under the current
circumstances, Government officials and leaders have become a target
of public attacks. If you do well, nobody will say you have done
well. If you have not done well, then everybody will come down on
you like a ton of bricks. What is more worrisome is that when the
words of Government leaders are misunderstood or distorted by others,
they become public enemy. They said this is a common phenomenon
in cyberspace. That is why some young people feel that the current negative
climate in public opinion is the key reason why they are reluctant
to enter politics. </p>

opinion is one of the important channels to monitor the Government's
performance. Rational, fair and balanced public opinion is a clear
mirror that can reflect the pros and cons of policies. On the other
hand, if public opinion is not rational and fair, it will become
a distorting mirror that distorts facts, belittle the effects of
policies and cause confusion between truth and falsehood. As an
ancient saying goes, "the same person who can bring you success
can also cause you to fail". It is a double-edged sword. If irrational public opinion

people to serve Singapore, to create a better future for our people.
In this way, Singapore will continue to prosper and become a bright
little red dot in the international arena. Sir, I support the motion.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
Ministerial salaries have been a controversial and emotive topic
since 1994 when the White Paper on Competitive Salaries for a Competent
and Honest Government established private sector salary benchmarks
to peg the salaries of Ministers and Administrative Officers. Many
speakers before me have touched on the various important issues
arguing for or against the recommendations proposed by the Ministerial
Salary Review Committee. We have also heard the need to pay competitive salaries
to attract talents. Yes, Singapore is a small country and we have
a limited pool of talents. Competitive and fair salaries must be
paid so that we can attract the right people in their prime to serve
the nation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1b176c8e-1a5c-4797-83a5-c8df58ed5acb">
                  <a name="motion__id-1b176c8e-1a5c-4797-83a5-c8df58ed5acb"><!--a--></a>I remember one of the more
memorable speeches made during the last debate in 2007 was made
by the hon Member, Ms Denise Phua. The Member spoke passionately of
the differences between the public and private sectors. In the public
sector, especially for the political leaders, the main difference
herein lies in the amount of power, influence which one could wield.
The Member warned that concentrating too much of both power and
pay would attract the wrong type of people to public service. This
is a view which I wholeheartedly agree with. Public service is a
calling. High Ministerial salaries or monetary rewards should not
be the reason why people are motivated to serve the nation. As Catherine
Lim wrote in a <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> article in 2007: </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph hcProceduralText" id="id-e55726fb-b4b3-4812-a335-cb4c7bb08c5b">
                  <a name="motion__id-e55726fb-b4b3-4812-a335-cb4c7bb08c5b"><!--a--></a>"No Singaporean with any
practical sense of the real world would want to see a Minister denied a
salary commensurate with his status and dignity or living less well
than any prosperous Singaporean. But, at the same time, no Singaporean
would expect a Minister to feel disgruntled if he is paid less than
the top CEO. If the disgruntlement actually causes him to leave
his job, then he was not cut out for public service in the first
place. Thus, to offer him a matching salary to enable him to stay
would be to demean that office."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-04aa4582-d3b5-4adb-a37f-a7bde4398db6">
                  <a name="motion__id-04aa4582-d3b5-4adb-a37f-a7bde4398db6"><!--a--></a>It is as simple as that.
The motivation for public service should not be pay. But should we
not then pay our Ministers sufficiently well – a salary that is
commensurate with his important role and heavy responsibility as
a Minister? Similarly, is it right to demand an immense financial
sacrifice from people to serve the nation? By this argument, is
it then right to say that we should demand the same type of "financial
sacrifice" from teachers, Police officers, military personnel, nurses,
judges or our civil servants because they should be serving out
of a sense of dedication and devotion to the public good?</p>

the life of one great political leader. His father was a high official
in a small state in British India. He studied law at the University College
of London and became a lawyer. When he finally returned to the country
of his birth, he advocated non-violence and became the greatest
leader India or even the world ever knew. Yes, he was Mohandas Karamchand
Gandhi. His peaceful non-violent resistance movement galvanised
Indians and led to the independence of India. Gandhi earnestly believed
that a person involved in public service should lead a simple life.
He first displayed this principle when he gave up wearing western-style
clothing, which he associated with wealth and success. When he returned
to India, he renounced the western lifestyle he led in South Africa,
where he had enjoyed a successful legal practice. The practice of
giving up unnecessary expenditure, embracing a simple lifestyle
and washing his own clothes, Gandhi called "reducing himself to
zero".</p>

this great leader, I thought to myself that this has to be the epitome
of the self-sacrificial leader. But let us remember that political
leaders in the past, in different parts of the world, served in
different contexts from local political leaders today. The scenarios
and challenges they faced were totally different from those we see
today. But as I read stories of great leaders both in Singapore
and elsewhere, I wondered, what were the common reasons that motivated
them to serve the public good? What gave them the motivation, in
certain admirable situations, to give up everything to serve the
nation?</p>

that we use to attract our potential future leaders. I believe that
up to today, we have been able to attract talents who have joined
the public service not because of pay. Examples include our current
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law, Mr K Shanmugam, our Minister
for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, ESM Goh Chok Tong, then Minister for
Finance, Dr Richard Hu, and the late Dr Balaji Sadasivan, who gave
up their plump jobs in the private sector not for monetary rewards
but in serving the nation. All of us are here in this Parliament
not because of the financial and monetary rewards that are offered,
but rather, inside all of us, regardless of party affiliation, we have
this deep-rooted duty to serve.</p>

pay our leaders fairly. In deciding what a fair remuneration is, we
should also be aware of the sacrifices that one makes to become
a Minister or a political office-bearer. Let us hypothetically explore
several options. On one hand, we can peg pay to private sector salaries,
which is what we are doing currently. On the other, we could offer
all Ministers and leaders of our nation a nominal wage, say $1 a month.
Well, I think there are problems to that. For one, we run the risk
of possible corruption and I am not questioning the integrity of
leaders though. But worse, I think we will only attract people who
are "sufficiently comfortable" or who have attained a certain measure
of success in their lives to come forth and serve the nation. And
I am not saying that all who are rich and wealthy and who come forth,
do not come with a deep-seated intent to serve the nation. Rather
I am highlighting a scenario where only the money rich and wealthy
elite, capable of setting aside their concerns with daily lives, would
come forth and serve and govern Singapore.</p>

Ministerial salaries to a certain percentage of the lowest income
earner is also flawed, for there is the counter argument that Ministers
should be concerned about the well-being of all Singaporeans, rather
than just the lower-income Singaporeans. They should be concerned
about the well-being of all in the nation and should not just focus
on growing the lives and wealth of the poor.</p>

also looked at comparisons with other politicians from other countries.
However, we do not know how the other countries derived their formulae,
and these countries do not face the same sort of socio-historical-political contexts
and environment as we do. Moreover, the pay packets of politicians
of many other countries are not that transparent, and often have
other hidden components. What we want is a clean wage, with no hidden
perks and entitlements, and the current recommendations offer just
that.</p>

for Ministerial salaries, it is important not to be too fixated with
just the private sector benchmarks. While the private sector would
serve as a significant competitor for talent in the civil service,
coming into politics and serving the nation as a leader, as a Minister,
is a unique set of circumstances that cannot be solely compared
to in the private sector. Thus, the pay of a Minister can never
be successfully pegged to and equated to that of the private sector
alone, because the scope and responsibility are very different.
The pay of a Minister must reflect the work he does. The job of
a Minister, or any public servant for that matter, must be to serve
the people.</p>

introduced the National Bonus which draws a direct link between
the salaries of political leaders and the socio-economic progress
of Singaporeans. Besides GDP growth, real or inflation-adjusted
median income growth, the real income growth of the poorest 20%
in Singapore, and the unemployment rate, will be considered in computing
the remuneration.</p>

has alluded to earlier, different people will have different perspectives
– whether to peg directly to private sector pay or peg to senior
executives in civil service which actually in turn is also benchmarked
to private sector, with multiples to peg the responsibility of the
political office-bearer. The fact is there is no really magic formula
in determining the salaries of Ministers. This current recommendation is a
right step forward and we need to regularly review its relevance moving
forward. Having strong and committed leaders is critical in the
survival and progress of Singapore. Our leaders' task must be to
create a nation where all Singaporeans can enjoy the fruits of their
labour and hard work. While pay should not be the key motivator
for political service, it should also not be a deterrent. Let us
pay our leaders a fair wage which reflects the work that they do
in ensuring that all Singaporeans benefit from the growth of the
country and in ensuring that the lives of Singaporeans are all being
looked after.</p>

comparing apples to apples in deciding Ministerial salaries. I would
like to end off with an analogy; one that reflects the type of political leaders
we hope to see in Singapore. The job of a Minister is like the guardian
of an apple tree; in other words, he is the gardener. In tending
to the apple tree, do we pay him low wages, that he is forced to
take the apples from the tree and sell them? Or should we pay the
gardener fair wages so that he is satisfied, such that he is not
tempted to take from the tree but instead would freely share the
fruits of his labour with others? Our Ministers are like gardeners.
They take good care of the apple tree; they put in their time and
effort; they sacrifice their lives, their times and other opportunities,
to devote attention to this tree that is Singapore, sowing the fruits
of their labour such that Singaporeans can share the growth and
fruits of the tree. Let us pay them the right wage that is commensurate with
the heavy responsibility they have been entrusted with. The political
leaders sow the seeds today and we will reap the harvest for ourselves,
for our children and for our future. Sir, on that note, I support
the motion.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute to the

strongly about and one which has deeper implications on Singapore's
political future than some may imagine.</p>

Parliament had this debate on the revision of Ministerial salaries,
I disagreed with the benchmark formula that the Government used
at that time. I considered it unrealistic to peg Ministers' salaries
to just the top 48 people of income earners who change from year
to year, since this is too small a group and variations may not
be reflective of changes of salaries of the first 48 people used
in the benchmark. I also said in 2007 that the Prime Minister should
do away with the benchmark and just use the base salary of $1.2
million which was set in 1994 to determine future salary increases.
Just as a company which has a one-time exercise to determine a remuneration
philosophy, I thought that after more than a decade of having the
salary at that level, we had something that worked well for Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-be8eeff6-26bd-4d56-9fd3-d50a5d348efc">
                  <a name="motion__id-be8eeff6-26bd-4d56-9fd3-d50a5d348efc"><!--a--></a>Sir, the 2007 adjustment
was a difficult one to accept as salaries at that time jumped based
on the unrealistic benchmark formula used. I am therefore happy
that this has now been corrected to a more realistic level and which
is more reflective of what it should be. </p>

it is not wise to use the benchmark pegged against the private sector,
I can understand the review Committee's rationale for doing so.
The Committee, in fact, looked at different benchmark options, including
what the Workers' Party is recommending
of using salaries of Ministers in other countries before recommending the
current formula. The Review Committee sought to correlate Ministers
to talent in Singapore, and therefore recommended that Ministerial
salaries be pegged at the top 1,000 income earners here. I feel
that by expanding the pool to benchmark against the 1,000 income
earners here, it is a lot more palatable than just the 48 income
earners that we had been using in the past. At least at the 1,000th
people level, we may statistically better capture the variance of
salaries of Singapore's top talent from year to year. </p>

the Committee suggests a 40% discount to the median salary of the
top 1,000 earners, reflecting the difficulty of finding the right
benchmark formula as it was previously put at two-thirds of the
benchmark. But I agree with many Singaporeans that it is not useful
to talk about a discount as a measure of public service and sacrifice.
Moreover, the discount figure of 40% is based on a perception that
it reflects accurately the level of discount that should be given
to public service. This is arbitrary and subjective. I understand
though that the Review Committee suggested this approach in absence
of any standard formula or convention that can be logically applied to
this scenario of Ministers doing their job both as a national service
as well as a career.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-71c92516-7edc-4e8b-ac9f-d0bacf075f68">
                  <a name="motion__id-71c92516-7edc-4e8b-ac9f-d0bacf075f68"><!--a--></a>This is, therefore, a much
better approach as compared to what the Workers' Party is suggesting.
The Workers' Party suggested that we peg the salaries to the divisional director
level which is about $10,000 per month, and which is the formula
used in some of the 12 countries that they mentioned. I think we
cannot give a partial solution because in most of these 12 countries
that the Workers' Party is comparing against, there are also a whole
bunch of perks and allowances that are used to determine the final
salary of an MP which is then used to determine the final salary
and allowance of a Minister. I looked at most of the countries that
are suggested by the Workers' Party and guess what? None of them
has a clean wage system. They have many allowances and perks, some
hidden perks. For example, in Japan, where MPs and Ministers get
to rent a house in the prime district at about one-fifth of the
market value. And also in addition to that, all the rest of the
allowances that we know about – medical allowance, housing allowance
and a whole bunch of others. So, therefore, I think if the Workers'
Party wanted a formula, they should have talked about everything
and not just give us a partial solution to compare against.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-88e31f51-7d5c-487d-8970-dfc96762834a">
                  <a name="motion__id-88e31f51-7d5c-487d-8970-dfc96762834a"><!--a--></a>The discount proposed may
not have been necessary as the principle of paying our Ministers
and civil servants high salaries is not a flawed one. It is better
to pay them a clean wage without any perks, as I mentioned before.
In 2007, I agreed with this principle and I will say today again
that I support it. Many quote examples of leaders from other countries
who do not earn as high salaries as our leaders. However, what they
miss is that leaders from other countries get everything else, the
perks that I mentioned, cars, homes, servants and food items, paid
in addition to their salaries. In fact, I learnt that in the UK,
Ministers and MPs also get motorcycle and bicycle allowances in
addition to mileage allowances for the transport that they use.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58dc60c7-e0db-4481-9c08-059cac7266ed">
                  <a name="motion__id-58dc60c7-e0db-4481-9c08-059cac7266ed"><!--a--></a>So our Ministers earn a
clean wage, which means that every other expense is borne personally
by them through these salaries. Nonetheless, intrigued by what the
Workers' Party was recommending, I looked at some of the examples.
I took Britain as an example where a Cabinet Minister has a salary
entitlement of about £135,000 in addition to the allowance of an
MP of about £65,000. And then there is a whole slew of other allowances –
staffing expenditure, communications expenditure, admin and office
expenditure, IT equipment, London calls allowance, London accommodation
allowance, personal, additional accommodation allowance, constituency
office allowance and these do not include things like chauffeured- driven
cars in the range of Jaguars for many Cabinet Ministers and those
who claimed mileage allowances and also the whole range of pension
and medical benefits that they get. Just taking what could be accounted
for, I added these to be £411,000 which is about S$815,000.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb31afb7-483a-41fe-a505-04a8940c0fbe">
                  <a name="motion__id-bb31afb7-483a-41fe-a505-04a8940c0fbe"><!--a--></a>I do not think paying our
Ministers what we pay is overly high. Sir, in France, in addition
to a salary and a number of allowances like what the UK MPs and
Ministers get, they also get free train and plane travel and also
an unaudited expense allowance. The President of the French Senate
commands an undisclosed, virtually uncontrolled expense budget which
is about £2.2 million per year, much higher than what our Ministers
get. On a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis, India pays the most
to their MPs while Japan, Italy and Singapore pay about the same
level. In these countries that I mentioned, their unofficial income
of MPs and Ministers is a lot higher than the official income. And
if you want to have an internationally comparable standard, I think
a good measure would be to look at the GDP per capita on a price
PPP basis. This ratio is about 35 for US and for most Western Europe
and Japan, it is about 10 times for an MP. In Singapore, at the
PPP-GDP of about $59,000 and an MP allowance of $192,000, our ratio is
3.2 which is not overly generous in my opinion.</p>

view that salary should not be an incentive to lure or to attract
talent into public service. However, it should also not be a disincentive.
We want men and women to come forward to serve the country and not
to be tempted by high salaries to join. But at the same time, we
cannot deny that holding political office is a great responsibility
which has deep impact on the daily lives of Singaporeans and the future
of the country. With Singapore being a small and open economy, we
are often vulnerable to a whole bunch of external factors that are
beyond our control and it is not easy for the Ministers to steer
Singapore. The salaries Ministers earn should reflect the responsibility
and significance of their jobs.</p>

of SMEs I know, these days earn more than what the Committee has
recommended for our Ministers at the entry level, let alone the
CEOs of large listed companies. I hope that Singaporeans appreciate
that our Ministers should be getting paid at a level which would
pay for a good person to do a top job regardless of whether it is
in the private sector or the civil service or in Government.</p>

I feel that the current level proposed is not an overly generous one.
And I am glad that the main Opposition party in this House, the
Workers' Party, has agreed to this level of salary based on the
computation that Mr Chen proposed: five times or nine times of an
MP's pay. And this further supports my point that we should do away
with the benchmark for the future - that we already have – all of
us, the Government and the Opposition, have agreed that we have
a good base to start from. The Prime Minister should, in the future,
use this as a basis to determine future salaries and not be caught
in a benchmarking exercise that can be quite emotional.</p>

high salaries, I would also like to see more accountability for
mistakes and problems created as a result of a Minister's poor performance.
If we can peg our Ministers' salaries to the top income earners
in Singapore, then likewise we also should have high standards of
accountability of performance. I hope the Prime Minister will be
quick to take to task a Minister who may perform poorly. And if
a Minister consistently performs poorly and less than satisfactorily, the
Prime Minister should be quick to replace him as is done in the
private sector with CEOs. Here is where the new bonus structure
recommended by the review Committee can play an important role as
it could be used as a useful tool to reward good performers and,
conversely, the Prime Minister may also use it to send a strong
signal to a Minister if his performance is less than satisfactory.</p>

Bonus is a very good idea as it is more reflective of the impact
of policies on the lives of Singaporeans than the previous GDP Bonus.
The new structure is tilted towards the improvements of lives of
a good cross-section of Singaporeans. I commend the review Committee
for listening to feedback about how the GDP Bonus was too general
and, therefore, not a good measure for a performance bonus. </p>

to remove pensions as this now normalises the pay structure of Ministers
with most of other Singapore Government jobs. But we must recognise
and appreciate that this is a huge loss of compensation to the Ministers,
in addition to the salary cuts.</p>

suggest, we will face similar questions. It is therefore best that
we exercise the judgment of whether what the Committee has recommended
as a compensation for our Ministers as fair, and fix our own Singapore
base salary structure which will not require a benchmarking exercise
in the future. I therefore disagree with the proposal for a review
every five years, as five years is too short a time and it will
not be a productive exercise. Each time, we will raise the same
issues over and over again. Perhaps a new Prime Minister in each
era may want to review the structure but I do not agree with a review
every five years. What each Prime Minister can do, before he hands over
to the next Prime Minister, is to decide on good bonuses in good
years and for good performance, and temporary salary cuts in bad
years and for poor performers. This is what we do in the private
sector - not to review the philosophy of salary structures each time
there is a need to adjust salaries.</p>

we should not talk about sacrifice and discounts, the recommendations
by the Committee reflects huge reductions in compensation for our political
office-holders. We will never find the perfect comparable benchmark
to compare with – not the private sector, not with Ministers in
other countries but we must believe that the extensive review exercise
by the Committee has identified the appropriate level of compensation
for our Ministers. This time, the Workers' Party, the main Opposition
in this House, has agreed to the level proposed. In the past, in
fact, they had disagreed. And this time, I am happy to note that
they have agreed to this. So let us use this as our base for future
determination of salaries.</p>

we will continue to see good men and women attracted to public office
to serve Singapore even with this new salary structure. I am sure
we will be able to attract those who are already successful in their
careers and who have been at the prime of their careers for some
time, and with the will to do national service. However, we also
recruit talent based on potential and I worry about our ability
to attract such people with the potential to serve but who have
not yet reached their prime and peak of their careers, especially
in these times of much greater public scrutiny, as mentioned by
Mr Sam Tan just now.</p>

I will then move on to the question specifically. The Member spoke
about a "clean wage". Under the Committee's proposals, the bonus
that can be accrued by Ministers is up to 13.5 months. Does the

of bonus? Because I am sure it is more than getting an allowance
for riding a motorcycle or bicycle.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
support a level of bonus even higher than the 13.5 months if the
Minister deserves it. In 2008-2009, when we faced a terrible financial
crisis, I think Mr Tharmum Shanmugaratnam as the Finance Minister
should have got a much higher bonus than what he may have got. In
the private sector, I think contrary to the issue raised by Mr Giam,
it is not two or three months of bonus. Even in a small company
that I know of last year, a person at the middle level had about
10-11 months of bonus whereas the CEO had about 15 months of bonus.
And in the financial sector, it is even higher than that. So the
13.5-month bonus is not an overly high number; it is something that
is required to reward talent for the good job that they do. </p>

                  </span>: It does
not contradict because Ministers' salaries are reported every year
in the Budget Book. I think there is also a recommendation for the
Prime Minister to share with the House on a yearly basis what the
Ministers have been paid. So it is declared. What is not "clean"
is, if the 13.5-month was not declared and the formula for determining
that is not declared. Now, there is a clear formula on how a Minister
can achieve whatever bonus that he is entitled to, based on very
clear perimeters. This is, in fact, an excellent way of measuring
performance that is very objective, it is not subjective at all.</p>

Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, thank
you for allowing me to join in the debate at this late hour. It
is certainly fashionable now to lay into this whole topic of Ministers'
pay, to attack perceived "fat cat" salaries and decry the loss of
the spirit of public service that was the hallmark of our pioneer
leaders. But amidst the cacophony of sound, it is essential that
we maintain a level-headed perspective about this debate: to temper
idealism with realism, to remember that nothing exists in a vacuum,
least of all, our country; to strike a balance between the ethos
of public service and the need to attract and retain talent in our
leadership.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 875</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2cfc1a90-8bd3-42c6-b5e2-2cee43966750">
                  <a name="motion__id-2cfc1a90-8bd3-42c6-b5e2-2cee43966750"><!--a--></a>One of the sub-plots that
has drawn considerable comment is the benchmark adopted by the Committee:
the median income of the top 1,000 citizen earners, less 40%. It
is criticised by some to be elitist; there is no relation to the
lot of the common Singaporean and likens public office with the
profit-driven occupations of commercial enterprise. Far better,
it is said, to peg salaries to the median income of all Singaporeans or
of the lowest 20% – and now with the latest proposal by the Workers'
Party – to that of senior civil servants and then apply a suitable
multiple to that figure.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-248a2385-0b77-43c8-8a19-5ce581357da9">

criticism overlooks what the Committee was trying to achieve. The
Committee was not seeking to monetise the value of public service
or to treat the Cabinet as an extension of the private sector as
the hon Member for Aljunied, Mr Chen Show Mao has alleged. Rather,
the Committee was looking at the talent pool among Singaporeans
from whom the Government would seek to draw its future leaders.
It is true that income-earning capacity, just like academic credentials
or lofty positions in corporations, is not a conclusive determinant
of the qualities to be a leader. That is where the ethos of public
service comes in and what the 40% discount was meant to address.
But make no mistake – our citizens demand top performance from our Ministers
who, in turn, are drawn for what is considered to be the likely
pool of top performers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-703e506c-35f2-4fc4-abee-811fe47c3450">
                  <a name="motion__id-703e506c-35f2-4fc4-abee-811fe47c3450"><!--a--></a>Purely by way of illustration,
there was considerable excitement in political circles when Mr Chen
Show Mao himself threw his hat into the political ring. This was
not because Mr Chen was considered to be a "median-income" sort
of guy or somehow an emblem of the lowest income quartile of society.
But rather, with his sterling qualifications and his position then
as a partner in an international law firm, he was proof that Opposition
parties could also attract the sort of top talent that, one day, perhaps
may form the Government.</p>

suggested benchmark of median income which is then multiplied by
a reasonable number? The first issue is how you derive this multiple.
Is it five times, 10 times or 20 times? Whichever multiple you use
will be seen as arbitrary and appear to be an exercise in backward
rationalisation. You work out the salary figure you want and then
you derive the multiple to get there. The second issue is how does this
method better justify the salary as identification with the men-in-the-street?
Once you apply a multiple, any multiple – five times, 10 times,
20 times – you lose that identification with the median income and
you can be equally accused of being elitist. </p>

matrix that appears in the Committee Report was Mercer's figure
of $2.29 million for the average pay for CEO of a similar public-listed company.
That was considered by Mercer as the closest approximation to a
Minister's job. That may be so, but in my view, it is still not
that close. The budget of a Ministry runs into the billions of dollars,
more than that of the typical public company. The number of employees
of a Ministry can be in the tens of thousands, bigger than most
public companies.
The impact of a Minister's decisions and policies affect a far wider
group than any public company. </p>

of the MRT trains, the Transport Minister is called to account.
When a portion of Orchard Road floods, the Minister for Environment
and Water Resources has to answer questions on "ponding" and pumps.
No one is complaining about this – that is the nature of public
office. But if the closest approximation of a Minister's job, which
is still less onerous than that of a Minister, pays $2.29 million,
and the Committee's recommendation would mean that a Minister earns less
than 50% of that, is that not a reasonable balance to strike? Is
that not an appropriate financial sacrifice to make for public office?</p>

that is not enough, that public office should not be linked with
competitive salaries even with the 40%-50% discount. I respect their
view but would caution that idealism must be tempered by pragmatism,
by a sense of the world we live in. We would all like our leaders
to be not only honest, clever, hardworking, probably good looking
as well, but so public-spirited that they would take office regardless
of the pay, regardless of whether they could provide sufficiently
for their family or for their own retirement. Ms Denise Phua dubbed
them "superhero politicians". There are such people around but are
there enough for one to form a government, generation after generation? </p>

would like to earn a good living and to earn more if they could.
Does it mean that a potential leader is not public-spirited if he
or she is willing to take a pay cut but still wants to ensure a
certain standard of living for their family? Or are we confining
our choice of leaders to those who not only are extremely capable
but also have the disposition of a religious leader or social worker
when it comes to something as mundane as a salary? Is it wise for
us to confine our pool of potential leaders to such a restrictive
category?</p>

symbolic salary or one that is not linked to the potential income
that the leader could make if he chooses a different path, brings
with it other dangers. It is difficult to speak about this diplomatically
but it is well recognised. There are many political leaders in other
countries, who draw an official salary which appears low but are
rich beyond imagination because they use their power for illicit
gain. There is a list circulating around the Internet about the
top 20 or 30 highest paid political leaders in the world and all
of them are from the Singapore Government, presumably, to make the
point against high Ministerial salaries. But if the list was expanded
to include the top 20 or 30 richest political leaders, I believe
there would not be a single Singaporean Minister among them. Clearly,
a low or symbolic salary would not put off such persons who see
public office as a route to greater riches but through indirect means.
The complete opposite to the clean wage Mr Inderjit Singh was talking
about. But are these the sort of persons we want to find for leadership? </p>

of having salaries which are not pegged to competitive benchmarks,
even with the hefty discount, is that it tends to limit those coming
forward to serve to those who have inherited wealth or who have
already made their fortune. The United States and the United Kingdom
are two countries which are acknowledged as leading democracies
with first-world political systems, if not always parliaments. It
has been pointed out many times that their leaders get paid less
than our Ministers despite ruling
over larger countries. What is sometimes overlooked is the background
and composition of their leaders.</p>

Money.co.uk</em>, an article called "The Cabinet Rich List" by Glen Owen
talking about United Kingdom: "It is the £60 million Cabinet. David
Cameron's coalition government has adopted fairness as one of its
defining slogans, but his team of Ministers has been drawn almost
exclusively from the ranks of financial elite – leading to accusations
that politics is once again becoming the preserve of the wealthy".
On number three of "The Cabinet Rich List" is George Osborne, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, with a net worth, that means assets less liabilities,
of £4.6 million. The description is "the youngest Chancellor for
more than a century holds a £2 million stake in his father's luxury
wallpaper company, and lives in a £2 million family home in London's
Notting Hill. Its constituency property adds another £600,000".
And number five on "The Cabinet Rich List" is the Prime Minister
David Cameron. The Prime Minister has a net worth of £4 million.
The Prime Minister and his wife both come from wealthy backgrounds
and enjoy substantial property assets of their own. Their London
home has been valued at £2.7 million and their constituency house
is £1 million. Both are in line to inherit fortunes from their parents.
The combined wealth of the Camerons' parents has been put as high
as £30 million. Then at number 12 on the list is the Deputy Prime Minister
Nick Clegg with a more modest net worth of £1.9 million. This is
what the description of his state of wealth: "Like his coalition
partner Cameron, Clegg's father made millions in the City. While
Clegg senior has an impressive international property portfolio
worth several million pounds, the Lib Dem leader's own wealth comes
from a £1.5 million property in Putney and a constituency house
in Sheffield". </p>

citing figures from the <em class="ph i">OpenSecrets.org</em> which is published
by the Center for Responsive Politics, of the estimated net worth,
assets less liabilities, of members of the executive: "In 2008,
the Republican government contained figures such as Henry Paulson,
the Secretary of the Treasury with an estimated net worth of US$125
million and Dick Cheney, the Vice President with a net worth of
over US$30 million. Even the President George Bush, was worth about
US$9.5 million. In 2010, the Democratic government contained figures
like Hilary Clinton, the Secretary of State, with an estimated net
worth of US$31 million, and William Daley of over US$28 million.
Even President Barrack Obama, perhaps thanks to good book sales,
was worth US$7.3 million". </p>

these countries or their political systems. But it reinforces the view
that every country must choose its own system based on its own economic conditions,
social modes and particular limitations. What works for the UK and
the US may not be right for Singapore. We are a small country. True.
But that is precisely the challenge – how to make this "little red
dot" with no natural resources, small population, tiny domestic
market relevant against our giant neighbours and in this ever changing world.
All while trying to maintain our multi-ethnic, multi-religious identity.
To institute a system of remuneration that tends to draw our leaders
from the saintly, the power-hungry, and the already-rich is not
a course we should take. We need the best government we could find
regardless of race, religion or background, provided they have the
public interest at heart. We need a system of remuneration not to
attract candidates to public office with the promise of riches but
not to deter them either, by imposing over large sacrifices of a
financial and personal nature.</p>

on the quantum of salaries themselves. The views articulated are
divded. Some say the cuts are not deep enough. The benchmark to

understandable given that most Singaporeans do not earn anything

                  <a name="motion__id-2e27dee3-b6f1-4b01-a97e-705cdfab416c"><!--a--></a>I have four points to make.
Firstly, we must bear in mind that this is the first time the review
has been made by an independent committee comprising well respected
and experienced individuals from the private sector, the Labour
Movement and the social sector. The Report is not the work of politicians
or civil servants who may be perceived to have vested interests. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57bd5157-097d-468e-983b-47bdcfc3c109">
                  <a name="motion__id-57bd5157-097d-468e-983b-47bdcfc3c109"><!--a--></a>This eight-member committee
individually and collectively have impeccable management and human
resource expertise. In turn, they are ably supported by Mercer, a
firm recognised to be an international expert on remuneration issues.
They spent seven months painstakingly seeking feedback and deliberating
on the issue before coming up with the recommendations. I sincerely
believe that the long-term interest of the public and the future of Singapore
are uppermost in their minds even as they ponder long and hard over
the issue.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-40d4d268-8955-415d-8a32-e6cfd066eb7f">
                  <a name="motion__id-40d4d268-8955-415d-8a32-e6cfd066eb7f"><!--a--></a>In fact, I applaud the Committee
in courageously accepting the appointment, knowing full well that
the subject matter is extremely delicate. To do justice to their efforts,
we should objectively evaluate their recommendations and respond
rationally to them, whatever our political inclinations. That this
independent, expert committee has, after careful deliberation, chosen
to affirm the three principles of competitive salaries, a "clean
wage" and the ethos of political service which entails making sacrifices
indicate that these are sound principles which we should not easily
dismiss. I note that the Workers' Party has also stated its support
for the principles.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-d06ae580-808d-4648-a659-addd6952a802"><!--a--></a>Secondly, we must also bear
in mind that the contentious salary benchmark, the benchmark for
entry level Ministers, has been broadened considerably compared
to before, although some people take the view that this resulting
salary is still too high. A key contention is why the need to link
Ministerial salary to the pay of the top 1,000 Singaporean earners?
Why not the top 2,000 earners, or 3,000 earners? We should not forget
that there is a 40% "public service discount" to the benchmark.
The discount would effectively drop the effective salary to maybe
the median of the top 2,000 Singaporean wage earners. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-82b6482b-5224-494f-a432-18fb2f5b9b09">
                  <a name="motion__id-82b6482b-5224-494f-a432-18fb2f5b9b09"><!--a--></a>Other options: why not link
it to the pay of Ministers in other countries or the median income
of Singaporeans? Better still, just pay them a "reasonable" wage
that will allow them a comfortable lifestyle but no more? In retort,
how really does one set the cut off point for a "reasonable" wage?
The same argument applies to any benchmark or multiplier one cares
to pick.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-509631b5-3cc5-43a5-bd9d-d9fb0cd91e36">
                  <a name="motion__id-509631b5-3cc5-43a5-bd9d-d9fb0cd91e36"><!--a--></a>The Workers' Party has proposed
what it calls a more "people up approach" in setting Ministerial
salaries following what they consider are practices elsewhere in
the world. This is based on what they judge as a "reasonable" multiple
of a Member of Parliament's allowance, and this in turn is pegged
to the salaries of divisional directors in the civil service, excluding
the Administrative service. But what exactly do they mean by a "people
up approach" to setting Ministerial salaries? How does pegging salaries
to the pay of civil servants be said to be "people up"? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4b65e66c-cb8e-4765-aac4-d510530f2fb3">
                  <a name="motion__id-4b65e66c-cb8e-4765-aac4-d510530f2fb3"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the presumption
that the Workers' Party makes is that political service is in the genre
of public service. That is only partly true. Political service is
more than public service. Civil servants are not subject to the
votes of citizens nor do they need to carry the ground in policy
making. So, pegging ministerial salaries to civil service salaries
is an inadequate mechanism to account for the burdens and responsibilities
that come with the job.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cda1dcb7-2b00-4e5f-acd8-b8948cdffb01">
                  <a name="motion__id-cda1dcb7-2b00-4e5f-acd8-b8948cdffb01"><!--a--></a>Secondly, in order for the
civil service to draw capable people into the service as a career,
it also adopts the principle of competitive salaries taking into
account relevant private sector salaries at all grades. So why is
this principle not acceptable to the Workers' Party when it comes
to pegging Ministerial salaries? Instead of first pegging MP's allowance
to the pay of divisional directors which is already pegged to market norms,
and then arriving at the Ministerial salaries using some multiple,
which is arbitrary, would it not be much more transparent to peg
Ministerial salaries to the competitive salaries that the calibre
of people we are looking for in Ministers earn, or have the potential
to earn, coupled with a discount for the ethos of public service? Currently
as the MP allowance is a percentage of the entry level Minister's
salary (17.5% of
MR4 benchmark), the latter is already conversely a multiple of the
former! I do not see how their proposed formula is an improvement
over the Committee's recommendation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0e87732c-83d7-485b-bd19-7e4f546b9600">
                  <a name="motion__id-0e87732c-83d7-485b-bd19-7e4f546b9600"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, what multiple should
be applied to the MP's allowance so calculated to arrive at the
Ministerial salary? Arithmetically speaking, if the multiple is
high enough, the outcome could be the same as what the committee
is recommending which is so in this case where the Workers' Party
has come up with a similar base salary of $55,000 per month for
a new Minister.</p>

in <em class="ph i">TODAY</em> dated 7 January, asked, "What makes our politicians
so unique that they should not be compared with others elsewhere?"
But to which country should we compare? As one Forum writer to <em class="ph i">TODAY</em> noted,
we are a country unlike any other. He asked, "Is there a similar-sized
country in terms of population, land area, economy, lack of natural
resources and is multiracial, multilingual, multicultural and multi-religious?" </p>

do we have a big brother to fall back on, as in the case of Hong
Kong? Are we endowed with oil and mineral reserves which we could
draw on to fund budget deficits or cushion any economic crisis,

precisely because government is such a serious and strenuous business,
it should be in our collective interest to attract the most committed and
capable people for the job. The work demands are onerous and getting
more so – amidst the vulnerabilities of our small size, there are
complex international and domestic issues to deal with, sudden crises
that occur, multiple trade-offs among policy choices, difficult
decisions to be made. We need honest and capable men and women, strong
and yet able to listen and flexible enough to change course where
necessary, who can deal with foreign leaders, who can sell Singapore
and attract investors, hold steady in a crisis, and who have a good
grasp of global issues, who are unbounded in their thinking by convention,
and who have sound judgement.</p>

about the demands of a Minister in Singapore, just take a look at
Minister Shanmugam. Unfortunately, Minister Shanmugam is currently
not here, or Members can take a closer look at him. Some four years
ago, he was a top litigation lawyer. No doubt top litigation lawyers
face enormous pressure and work long hours when trials are on. Yet
I observe – apologies to the Minister – he certainly has more white hair
than before he was appointed a Minister. And, I stand corrected
by medical experts – I do not think that is purely due to ageing
or just genes! I contend that this is more a sign of the pressures
and stresses of political office. </p>

this white hair barometer applies to Dr Ng Eng Hen, who had a lucrative
medical practice before he entered public office. When he was made
a Minister, I noticed that his white hair index went up several
notches. Mr Speaker, Sir, women's hairdo and men's hair colour receive
equal attention in this House!</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-2e9ecb83-b43a-485c-a2d8-a9db888e347d"><!--a--></a>On a more serious note,
to paraphrase what the Committee says, the aim is to attract the
best in their prime to give of their best to Singapore. To ensure
Singapore continues to succeed, we will need to be able to attract
as many capable people as possible to enter politics, even before
the peak of their careers. We cannot leave it to chance nor wait
till they have made
enough money for themselves and their family before they enter politics
as is the case in some other countries. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-9eae9767-8284-4ad8-99d1-65025c5c6d1c"><!--a--></a>Of course, there are other
criteria for public service, such as character, values, and passion
to serve that must be considered and that Deputy Prime Minister
Teo has noted are in fact pre-requisites. But by the same token,
individuals who desire to be in public office and are willing to
take hefty pay cuts do not necessarily make good politicians. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 881</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a069f5cc-0a19-406f-babc-33ac689ea2da">
                  <a name="motion__id-a069f5cc-0a19-406f-babc-33ac689ea2da"><!--a--></a>So to the Workers' Party's
allegation, this approach of pegging pay to the top 1,000 income
earners, does not assume that political talent is found only among
the top 1,000 earners. As journalist Chua Lee Hoong rightly pointed
out in her commentary in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> dated 14 January,
this is not equivalent to saying that people who are top earners
in the private sector will make good political leaders or that good
political leaders will necessarily earn top dollar in the private
sector. Rather, benchmarking to the pay of the top 1,000 Singaporean
earners is intended to reflect the importance and high demands of
political office, and the calibre of people that the government
should attract to meet those demands.</p>

the qualities required or short-change the people of Singapore by
appealing only to the sense of sacrifice and moral high ground.
We need to be realistic in our expectations. This argument of sacrifice
for public office can only carry us so far. I hasten to add that
the turbulent era during Mr Lee Kuan Yew's generation formed the
crucible for the spirit of public service to manifest as it did
in the past. But today, we are not living in revolutionary times
and able people have choices. </p>

unsuitable people who are motivated by high salaries to come into
office but we must also not make entry into politics too heavy a
price to pay that it deters people from considering political office.

it is good practice to adopt international benchmarks, besides the
fact that most countries do not adopt a "clean wage" system, it
must be remembered that we are looking for capable Singaporeans
who have myriad opportunities across the globe. For such talented
individuals, the opportunity cost to entering politics is not the
pay of other politicians across the world, but the pay they could
earn as highly mobile global talent. In my view, political talent
is even scarcer than business, professional, managerial or sports
talent, especially as we cannot go on a global talent search for
politicians as one could for the CEO of a listed company. Singapore
must be run by Singaporeans who have deep stakes in this country.
Surely, it is only fair that we look at the opportunity cost to
these people if they were not in politics, rather than what politicians
in other countries earn.</p>

Committee's recommendations that deserves credit is the removal
of the pension scheme, the replacement of the GDP bonus with a National Bonus
that uses four socio-economic outcomes as measures and five yearly
reviews by an independent committee. All these are direct responses
to the public's concerns about the previous salary formula. </p>

National Bonus, some economists feel that not all the four indicators
reflect accurately citizen's welfare and could be replaced with
other indicators. Yet others feel that the four indicators could
be prioritised and given different instead of equal weightage. Sir,
I submit that, ultimately, there is no single formula that can satisfy everybody
and a judgement call has to be made. The Committee had noted that
it had considered a wide range of indicators before settling on
the four. </p>

recommendation for a regular five-yearly review of the salary framework
by an independent committee would ensure that the framework remains
appropriate over time and that the process remains transparent to
the public. The time frame of five years, which is about equivalent
to a term of government, is reasonable as it provides a sufficient
time horizon over the length of a typical economic cycle for the
Committee and the public to assess the appropriateness of the formula
and propose any changes to be made. </p>

we should not lose sight of the fact that the pay formula should
be forward-looking. It is not so much about the current office-bearers
as it is about the kind of government we desire for Singapore to
serve Singaporeans into the future. It should set the foundation
for a robust compensation scheme that recognises the spirit of personal
sacrifice in public service, but at the same time does not deter capable
newcomers to political office and form the strongest possible team
to maximise Singapore's chance for continued success. This should
apply not just to the PAP but to any political party.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Teo Chee Hean</strong>
                  </span>: The intent
of the contract framework is to allow Ministries the flexibility
to recruit officers to undertake specific projects over a specific
period or as a means to assess the officer's suitability for the
job. Currently, Ministries can appoint officers either on permanent
tenure subject to a probation period, or on contract.</p>

have found the contract framework useful to appoint new officers
to assess their suitability for the job. This is beneficial for
both the Ministries as well as the officers as it allows both parties
a period of time to assess whether there is a good fit before making
a permanent commitment. If the Ministries had to decide before such
a period of mutual assessment, the Ministries may be hesitant to
make a job offer at all. For officers who have performed well in
the job and are assessed to be suitable for a long term career with
the Civil Service, Ministries will offer the candidates permanent
positions after one or two years. The contract arrangement serves
as a gracious way for officers who do not have a good job fit to
exit. Their departure can then be tied to the end of their contracts
rather than a failure to be confirmed, or for them to resign after
a short period of service. Such contract officers enjoy the same
service benefits as permanent officers. </p>

                  </span>: Cleanliness
is important to Singapore and to Singaporeans. A clean and hygienic
environment enables us to lead healthy, comfortable and secure lives.
We want our surroundings to be litter-free and well-kept; we all
want to live in clean neighbourhoods that we can proudly call home. </p>

to sustaining and improving the level of public cleanliness in Singapore.
Since 2006, more enforcement officers have been deployed daily.
In 2010, we reviewed the frequency of public cleaning and the availability
of waste bins at litter hotspots. In September 2011, we set up the
Public Hygiene Council (PHC) to galvanise efforts by the community
and industry to improve cleanliness and hygiene in Singapore. </p>

littering in housing estates remains an ongoing challenge. Our laws
against high-rise littering require the witnessing of the offence before
prosecution can take place. Hence, apprehending high-rise littering
offenders is manpower-intensive and involves long hours of staking
out to catch the offender in the act. My Ministry is currently exploring
some technology solutions. Despite the best efforts of our enforcement
officers, it is not always possible to catch the offenders as most
of the offences are committed at night, which makes it more difficult
to clearly identify the offender. Therefore, encouraging greater
community ownership and civic responsibility remains the dominant
approach in curbing the irresponsible and dangerous behaviour of
high-rise littering. On this front, NEA has appointed Litter-Free Ambassadors
to educate the public through house-to-house visits. </p>

we have been carrying out litter-count surveys to track our progress.
The findings show some improvement in selected hot spots. However,
we agree that more can be done. We have taken reference from countries, such
as Australia and the UK, to inform our public cleanliness initiatives.
We will continue to learn from countries like Japan, where strong
social norms and habits on cleanliness and community responsibility
have developed, and adapt and tailor strategies that will work best
for us. </p>

a renewed Keep Singapore Clean Campaign. In a recent NEA study,
almost 40% of respondents have indicated that they would litter
out of convenience rather than make a conscientious effort to bin
their rubbish. Therefore, while the government will continue to
ensure a comprehensive and effective cleansing regime, we must also
focus our efforts on developing stronger community norms of social
responsibility amongst all residents of Singapore. </p>

campaign will focus on four areas: education, engagement, enforcement
and improved infrastructure. We will be working closely with the
schools, grassroots organisations and other stakeholders in the
community to reinforce the value of taking personal ownership and
responsibility for the cleanliness of our surroundings. We will
step up our educational outreach to foreign workers on the desired standards expected
in Singapore. We will do more to engage Singaporeans to develop
new ideas and solutions, and ingrain a stronger sense of shared
social responsibility and civic-mindedness in our people. Our penalty
regime of fines and corrective works has been found to be effective,
and a more visible enforcement presence on the ground will be considered
for littering hotspots as a deterrent. We are also reviewing our
cleansing infrastructure with the view to improving bin design and timeliness
of cleansing schedules.</p>

Police (TP) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) have an arrangement

to be awarded qualified civilian driving licences. </p>

conversion framework as it is satisfied that the SAF's training
and testing standards and emphasis on driving safety are robust
and comparable to civilian test regimes. As such, SAF Servicemen
recommended by the SAF to be awarded civilian driving licences do
not have to undergo TP's competency tests to convert their driving
licences. TP's primary consideration is to ensure that the driving competency
skills of SAF Servicemen holding converted driving licences are
on par with other motorists who have successfully cleared TP's competency
tests.</p>

As part of the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (or
Next Gen NBN) project, a Network Company (NetCo) Request-for-Proposal
(RFP) was conducted in 2009 where OpenNet was awarded the project.
As part of its NetCo contract, OpenNet is required to deploy its
fibre-optic network and rollout the nationwide fibre to 95% of homes
and offices by 2012. As of 30 November 2011, the Next Generation
Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN) has achieved 83% nationwide
deployment where homes in areas already covered can subscribe to
the various Next Gen NBN-based residential broadband access plans offered
by seven service providers. OpenNet's rollout will continue into
2012 to cover 95% of all homes and offices. Thereafter, from 2013
onwards, OpenNet has a Universal Service Obligation to fulfil all
reasonable requests to install new fibre termination points. IDA
continues to closely monitor OpenNet's obligations under the contract
and reviews OpenNet's performance regularly. </p>

chosen not to accept OpenNet's initial free installation of fibre
into homes, the existing NetCo contract does not require OpenNet
to re-offer another free installation at a later date. Nevertheless,
IDA has been facilitating appeals from home owners who have missed
out on OpenNet's initial offer, and OpenNet has acceded to the large
majority of these appeals. IDA is also engaging OpenNet to consider
the possibility of charging a lower installation fee for such home
owners that decide to sign up for retail fibre broadband services. </p>

In the second and third quarters of 2011, 3,040 workers were retrenched.
(Fourth quarter numbers are not yet available.) Of these, 2,090 or
69% were residents – which is close to the resident proportion of
our workforce<a href="#fntarg_4" name="fnsrc_4">
                     <sup>4</sup>
                  </a>.
The number retrenched over the period was lower than the 2,480 residents
retrenched over the same period in 2010; and significantly lower
than in the period before the 2008-2009 recession. What this illustrates
too is the fact that a certain number of retrenchments occur at
all times, even when the economy is healthy as it was in 2010.</p>

that taxis are an important means of transport for the less mobile

variations in their transport needs also exist. The majority could
be accommodated by most taxi models, while some require larger or
special taxi models. For example, those who use high-back wheelchairs
need to be ferried using larger vehicles which can accommodate the
height and weight of the wheelchairs. It is with the objective of
ensuring that such wheelchair users have access to transport services
which meet their needs that LTA has worked with SMRT to extend the
statutory lifespan of all 15 units of its London Taxis for an additional
year up to March 2013, while we work with the various stakeholders
to determine possible longer-term solutions.</p>

                  </span>: The Government
has implemented several measures to manage the growth of our population.
Following the tightening of the immigration framework in late 2009,
the number of persons granted Permanent Residence (PR) fell from
79,167 in 2008 to 59,460 in 2009 and 29,265 in 2010. </p>

workforce have also been tightened to moderate our dependence on
them. Measures include higher qualifying salaries for Employment
Pass (EP) and S Pass holders, the tightening of eligibility requirements
for EP holders, and further changes to the foreign worker levy rates
and tiers for S Pass and Work Permit (WP) holders.</p>

ramping up our infrastructure to address demand. We have increased
the supply of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats and private residential
units through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. Over the
next few years, we will significantly enhance the capacity of our
MRT network, by adding new lines as well as increasing the capacity
of existing lines through measures such as procuring more trains.
We are also working with the bus operators to ramp up bus service
levels and capacity, to reduce crowding and waiting time and improve
connectivity. We are improving access to healthcare facilities through
new hospitals, such as the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital to be opened
in 2014. We will also bring forward the development of Sengkang
General Hospital to 2018, from the original timeframe of 2020. Moving ahead,
the Government will continue to plan and develop our infrastructure
to support the needs of our population.</p>

                  </span>: Interim
Rental Housing (IRH) is meant for families in financial hardship
requiring urgent temporary accommodation. About 1,600 families are
staying in IRH, under a co-sharing arrangement. IRH flats are 3-room
or larger flats, and co-sharing helps tenants reduce their individual
rental cost.</p>

able to get along well. So far, we have received about 40 feedback
cases concerning flat-sharing. These cases were resolved amicably
through mediation, or by re-pairing the tenants with another family,
or re-locating them to another IRH flat. </p>

to the IRH Scheme, HDB has introduced additional guidelines to facilitate
better pairing of households. This includes capping the number of
occupiers per flat, and arranging for the two families to meet up
before they are paired. Nevertheless, it is also important for IRH
tenants to exercise mutual respect and tolerance for one another.</p>

                  </span>: Subsidised
basic dental care is available at the polyclinics, while the full
range of subsidised tertiary dental services – such as for crowns,
bridges, dentures and root canal treatment – is available at the
National Dental Centre (NDC). Only procedures deemed cosmetic in
nature, such as dental laminates and bleaching services, are not
subsidised. Government subvention to these institutions for providing subsidised
dental services amounted to around $23 million in FY2010.</p>

the average waiting time for subsidised dental treatment. At NDC,
the median waiting time for the first appointment is around 18 days.
At the first appointment, patients are assessed and triaged. Those
who need treatment urgently are cared for first. Elderly patients
who need urgent denture replacements to function are also prioritised.
In general, patients are placed on waiting lists only if their conditions
are stable and pain-free. For elective dental procedures, the waiting
time would depend on the type of procedure being carried out. Patients
requiring crowning and dentures are usually seen within three to
five months; more complex procedures like root canal treatment,
which is a multi-staged treatment regime, will typically take longer
for the whole treatment process. However, patients experiencing
severe pain or who require emergency dental treatment will be attended
to on an urgent basis, regardless of their subsidy status.</p>

initiatives to prevent bicycle thefts. First, Police has designed
a new Bicycle Security Label with unique serial codes. The security

these labels island-wide. </p>

the effectiveness of bicycle locks with alarms that go off when
the locks are tampered or cut. A pilot study of the new lock was
conducted in 2011 in areas under Tanglin Police Division's jurisdiction.
During the pilot, bicycle theft cases in these areas decreased by
24% compared to the same period in 2010. Police is reviewing the
results with the local community groups and will explore how this initiative
can be rolled out to more areas.</p>

crime prevention posters will deter bicycle thefts at these publicly

fares collected per trip, have fallen since Distance Fares was introduced. </p>

2011 also shows that the number of commuters who benefited from
Distance Fares has continued to increase. Overall, 72% of all commuters saw weekly fare savings

71% based on the data taken in January 2011. The figure for Senior
Citizens is also higher at 78% in August 2011, compared to the 70%

                  </span>: The vast
majority of medical conditions can be managed in primary care, either
in our polyclinics or GP clinics. But some patients may need specialist
consultation. To allow us to better target specialist resources
and subsidies for patients with clinical needs, there is a need
to ensure that only those requiring specialist services are referred
to Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC). This is why we require patients
to be first assessed by the polyclinic for referrals to the SOC
as subsidised patients. Besides referrals from polyclinics, inpatients
discharged from the acute hospitals'
subsidised wards requiring continual outpatient specialist care
are also eligible for subsidised care at SOCs because they are already
assessed by the hospital.</p>

Psychogeriatric Programme (CPGP) was launched in 2007 to improve
the mental health of the elderly through community partnerships.
Currently, there are three CPGP teams that train staff of eldercare agencies,
including nursing homes, to understand and manage mental health
problems in the elderly, including screening their vulnerable clients
for dementia and depression. To date, CPGPs have trained over 1,200
staff from the Intermediate and Long-Term Care (ILTC) sector through
more than 100 training sessions. </p>

the capabilities of existing ILTC services to better cater to the

stakeholders to develop other community based mental health services to increase
early detection and support persons with mental illness in the community. </p>

is an important consideration, and it is indeed one key consideration
in the P1 registration framework. But it cannot be the sole consideration. Other
considerations that we need to take into account include the presence
of siblings, parental ties to the school and community involvement.
To elaborate, Phase 1 of the P1 Registration Exercise gives priority
to parents who already have a child studying at the school of choice.
Phase 2 recognises the contributions and ties that parents have
with the school. For schools to thrive, the support of key partners
like former students and the community are critical, as they help
to build up and maintain a school's tradition and ethos, and support
its students. However, these considerations do not guarantee a place in
the school of choice as admission each year depends on the demand
for and availability of school places in the particular school.</p>

we cannot ensure that a child can gain admission to the school of
choice even one that is within 1 km of his or her home, MOE seeks
to ensure that every child can gain admission to a primary school

                  </span>: I had explained
the Committee of Inquiry's (COI) Terms of Reference at length in
my statement to this House last week. To reiterate, the COI will establish
the technical, systemic and other causes that may have contributed
to the disruptions, and make recommendations to minimise a recurrence
of the incidents of 15 and 17 December based on their findings.
This would include assessing whether the current regulatory regime
is sufficiently robust. </p>

convening a Committee of Inquiry is a serious matter. The extent
and severity of the service disruptions on 15 and 17 December, and
the potential safety risks that they posed are what warrant an independent
inquiry into the causes of the disruptions. Nonetheless, if there
are previous incidents or events that may be relevant or had contributed to the events
of 15 and 17 December, the COI has both the latitude and the obligation
to consider them. It is not intended that the COI look at the smaller
unrelated events as that would only dilute its focus. </p>

                  </span>: The objective
of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)'s control measures
on stray dogs is to keep the stray dog population in check, with
a view to ensure public health and safety. Stray dogs are potential
carriers of rabies and they can also pose a threat to public safety,
especially when they are in a pack.</p>

will round up and impound the stray dogs. AVA works with the animal
welfare groups, such as the Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD) and
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to sterilise
and re-home stray dogs which are suitable for adoption. As there
are more strays than potential adoption homes, an inevitable control
measure is to put the strays down humanely.</p>

the stray dog problem. We intend to explore further with concerned
stakeholders how best to improve the re-homing process. We also
hope to tackle the issue upstream at source. We believe that responsible
pet ownership by the community is key. Pet owners must be responsible
and must not abandon their pet dogs, leading to more strays. Feeding
of strays is also not encouraged as this can lead to uncontrolled
population growth if the strays are not sterilised. </p>

MAS conducts periodic stress tests of the banks and insurance companies
in Singapore. Their aim is two-fold: to assess financial institutions'
ability to withstand adverse financial and economic shocks, and
to evaluate the potential impact on Singapore's financial stability.
These stress tests are normally conducted annually, although more
frequent stress tests may be carried out when the situation warrants
it, for example, during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The most
recent stress test, conducted in the early part of last year, shows
that all major financial institutions would continue to maintain
adequate capital buffers above MAS' regulatory requirements under
the prescribed stress scenarios.</p>

has been subject to international peer review and is aligned with
international best practice. Let me describe briefly how it works.
MAS identifies a range of external and domestic risks as part of
its ongoing financial surveillance operations. It also draws on
risk assessments by international organisations such as the International
Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board, and exchanges with
other central banks and financial regulators, industry players and private
sector analysts. MAS then develops scenarios using stressed values
for key risk parameters, such as credit spreads, yield curves, economic
growth and property prices. Banks and insurance companies are then
asked to conduct stress tests based on these scenarios. To ensure
that the results are robust, MAS engages the financial institutions to
challenge their underlying assumptions and review their stress test
methodologies.</p>

stress tests, MAS requires financial institutions to conduct more
regular stress tests on their own to address risks that are specific
to their operations. The boards of directors and senior management
of financial institutions are expected
to review the stress test scenarios and results as part of their
risk management processes.</p>

economies have disclosed stress test results for individual institutions
during the recent crises afflicting them, as a way to calm volatile markets
and restore confidence in their banking systems. Like other jurisdictions
whose financial systems have remained sound and stable, Singapore
has not had to do so. MAS prefers to retain stress tests as a pre-emptive
supervisory tool to encourage financial institutions to have appropriate
capital planning processes and risk mitigation plans across a range
of stressed conditions.</p>

that the public can use to assess the risks carried by financial institutions.
These include the annual reports and published financial statements
of financial institutions as well as reports by MAS such as the
Financial Stability Review and Monthly Statistical Bulletin. MAS
also continually reviews what additional data relating to risk can
be published. For example, in July 2011, MAS decided to release more
housing loan data to help the public assess housing market conditions
and their impact on banks' housing loan portfolios.</p>

                  </span>: The
Government uses green labelling to provide information and raise
public awareness, thereby influencing consumer choice towards more
environmentally friendly products.</p>

Labelling Scheme (MWELS), NEA's Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme
(MELS) and Fuel Economy Labelling Scheme (FELS) are schemes that
respectively provide water, energy and fuel efficiency information
to consumers to encourage better-informed purchasing decisions that
take into account the operating costs when household appliances
and cars are purchased.</p>

have so far been effective in leading consumers to choose more water
and energy efficient appliances. For instance, the share of water
efficient water fittings (models that attained 1-tick or more) registered
under MWELS has increased from 850 models by almost eight times
to 6,600 models as of November 2011, since its introduction in 2009.
75% of the 331 washing machine models registered under MWELS possess
a water efficiency rating of 1-tick and above. The share of energy efficient
refrigerator and air-conditioner models (3- and 4-tick models) registered
under MELS have also increased from 46% to 79% and 30% to 57% respectively
from 2008 to 2011.</p>

exercise on climate change-related issues led by the National Climate
Change Secretariat (NCCS), a number of suggestions have been received
on improvements to existing energy labels. One of the suggestions
was to include the estimated energy cost of operating the appliance.
NEA is reviewing the design of the energy labels and will look into
incorporating this cost into the energy labels in a way that balances
between providing timely and accurate information, and the associated
costs to suppliers and retailers when these energy labels have to
be updated when household electricity tariffs change.</p>

been effective as a step towards the mandating of performance standards.
After introducing the MELS in 2009, NEA subsequently implemented
the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for household air-conditioners
and refrigerators on 1 September 2011. MEPS remove the most inefficient models
from the market by prohibiting the sale of appliances that fall
short of a specified minimum energy efficiency level. They help
consumers avoid being locked into the high operating cost of inefficient
appliances. MEPS also encourage suppliers to bring in more energy
efficient appliances as technology improves.</p>

complemented by the Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) scheme. The scheme
aims to encourage the purchase of green vehicles, which are more fuel
efficient and emit less air pollutants than their conventional equivalents,
by narrowing the cost differential between a green vehicle and a
conventional equivalent model. The GVR scheme provides rebates for
electric, petrol-electric hybrid and CNG vehicles and is valid until
31 December 2012. The Government is currently undertaking a review
of measures to promote the adoption of green vehicles, as part of
efforts to promote
sustainable development and reduce emissions. More details will

Plan" (ECo Plan) by the South West CDC bring the community and corporations
together to improve energy and water efficiency. An example of an initiative
under these programmes is the light bulb exchange programme, where volunteers
help replace the light bulbs in the homes of low-income families
with energy efficient ones. Such ground-up initiatives by the community
and the corporations help raise environmental consciousness and
promote resource conservation, and we encourage more of these.</p>

                  </span>: The
management of bird nuisance requires action from several different
agencies. These measures include trees management, food waste management
and occasional culling of birds as a last resort. For example, (i)
NParks and the Town Councils maintain and prune trees regularly
in areas where there are large numbers of nests; (ii) NEA ensures
increased cleaning frequency at hot spots to remove litter which
may act as food source for the birds and bird droppings; (iii) NEA
ensures that operators of food outlets at hotspot areas observe
good housekeeping practices, and requires refuse points to be properly
secured with nettings and other anti-bird devices; (iv) both AVA
and NEA take enforcement action against people who feed birds as
this can result in littered premises; and (v) occasionally NEA and
Town Councils cull crows and pigeons as a last resort.</p>

of responsibility amongst agencies was based primarily on the nature
of the intervention required, rather than the specific species of
bird involved. This
inadvertently led to a situation where there was some ambiguity
over mynahs in particular. MND and MEWR have decided that, henceforth,
AVA will coordinate the work of all the agencies involved whenever
problems caused by birds arise.</p>

                  </span>: As part
of the plan to address railway noise, LTA has embarked on an island-wide
noise measurement study along the entire length of all elevated
MRT tracks island-wide. The study is expected to be completed by
April 2012, and will enable LTA to identify locations that require
special attention. So far, the appointed consultant has completed
noise measurements for more than 50% of the 500 identified residential blocks.
Concurrent with the study, LTA is also looking into appropriate
noise mitigation measures, including the implementation of low noise
barriers (LNB). </p>

piloted at two locations. In June 2011, LNBs were installed at the
new Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP) viaduct and platform
at Jurong East Station, which come as close at 15 m to HDB blocks.
These LNBs have helped to reduce noise to around the same levels
as before the implementation of the JEMP. In November 2011, LTA
also piloted LNBs along the open tracks next to the Bishan MRT Station,
where the configuration of the MRT tracks and structures includes a
tunnel portal that is located in close proximity to the flats. The
unique design of the existing portal contributes to higher noise
levels for surrounding residents as train noise is amplified when
the trains exit from the tunnel portal. The appointed contractor
is currently at the design stage of the project and implementation
is targeted to be completed by July 2012.</p>

                  </span>: The Enhanced
School Zone scheme was developed and introduced in 2005 to enhance
safety at primary schools, as younger students were identified as
vulnerable road users due to their limited experience in using roads.</p>

designed with red textured surfaces laid along partial sections
of the road fronting a primary school. Its purpose is to alert motorists
that they are approaching a section of the road where there may
be school activities and to watch out for students.</p>

scheme is a special scheme which is limited to primary schools and
special schools, where it is most needed. This is so that the scheme
can sustain its effectiveness and motorists would not see them as
common road markings, which
could be the case if it is proliferated to other schools. LTA has
in place other measures to enhance road safety at all schools in
general, including secondary schools. These include pedestrian crossings
and traffic devices such as humps, strips, railings, and so on. </p>
