<div align="center"><b>MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF SINGAPORE FOR THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL 1975 TO 31ST MARCH, 1976</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of

Singapore  for  the financial year 1st April,  1975  to

31st  March, 1976, contained in Paper Cmd. 3  of  1975.

For  convenience, I shall take the totals for each head

of   expenditure   in  the  Main  Estimates   and   the

Development Estimates as they appear in the  fifth  and

sixth  columns respectively of the Summary of Estimated

Expenditure on page 43 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I draw the attention of hon. Members to the

Statement which appears at the bottom of page 41 of the

Paper?



<br><br>The totals in respect of the Main Estimates for the two

Heads,  A "Civil List for the President of the Republic

of Singapore" and B "Statutory Expenditure", are not to

be  voted,  and  I  shall, therefore,  not  take  these

totals.  Further,  the  total amount  to  be  voted  in

respect  of  the Main Estimates is $2,202,770,19()  and

not the sum of $2,646,319,300 shown on page 43.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect of which amendments stand in the Order Paper

Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head C -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head C be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has been the function of the Presidential

Council  up to now? As amounts of expenditure had  been

allocated for the Council in previous years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



I  would  like  to  know  how these  amounts  had  been

utilised in carrying out the functions of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Presidential Council is supposed to

safeguard  the  minority  rights  and  interests.   How

successful has it been so far, and what has  been  done

to fulfil these obligations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know how often does the

Presidential Council meet.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the functions of the Presidential

Council  are  spelt out in Articles 811 and  811.  They

are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) . . , to consider and report on such matters

affecting  persons of any racial or religious community

in  Singapore  as  may be referred to  the  Council  by

Parliament or the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) . . , to draw attention to any Bill or to any

subsidiary  legislation  if  that  Bill  or  subsidiary

legislation  is  in  the  opinion  of  the  Council   a

differentiating measure.'



<br><br>A differentiating measure means:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any measure which is, or is likely in its practical

application  to be, disadvantageous to persons  of  any

racial   or   religious  community  and   not   equally

disadvantageous  to persons of other such  communities,

either   directly  by  prejudicing  persons   of   that

community or indirectly by giving advantage to  persons

of another community.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council is served by the Office of the Clerk of

Parliament,  and  for the present  it  is  intended  to

continue  with this arrangement. A total  provision  of

$54,010   is   included  in  the  Main   Estimates   of

Expenditure to meet expenditure on manpower  and  other

operating expenses for the servicing of the Council  in

case  at  some later date it should be decided  that  a

separate  office  be  set  up  for  the  Council.   The

anticipated  expenditure to be met will be  expenditure

on  purchase of subsidiary legislation, Supplements  to

the  Gazette,  printing of the Council's Annual  Report

and stationery. Council members are not remunerated  in

any way. The total expenditure under the vote in FY  73

was  $1,549.20.  Expenditure  to-date  in  the  current

financial year is $2,277.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 81K (5), the Council is required yearly

to compile and present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



to the President a report on the working of the Council

during  the  preceding 12 months, and such reports  are

presented  to Parliament. The last report  covered  the

period  14th  July,  1973 to 31st July,  1974  and  was

presented to Parliament on 7th September, 1974 as Paper

Cmd.  13  of 1974. Copies of the report were circulated

to  all Members. In that report it was stated that  the

Council  had  examined 44 Bills and  three  Acts  after

their  passing by Parliament and had received  a  large

number  of subsidiary legislation for examination,  and

that it had made no adverse report on any of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council meets whenever Bills which have been

passed   by   Parliament  are  referred   to   it   for

consideration and reports in accordance with its  terms

of  reference.  As  always, the Council's  reports  are

presented  to  Parliament and copies are circulated  to

Members.  Proceedings of the Council are  conducted  in

private.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

explanation, I wish to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $54,010 for Head C ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head H -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head H be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (a) of subhead AAA 3090.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am rising to perform an almost annual ritual.

This  question of compensation for accidents  involving

Government  vehicles  has  cropped  up  several   times

before.  In 1973 I said that if the situation  did  not

appear  to  get better I would say something  about  it

again, and that is why I am standing up before you here

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information in the old volumes of

Hansard, in March 1973 a total sum of nearly $125,000

was paid out in compensation. According to a question

which I tabled for written

answer, the total for FY 74 for the 11



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



months  of  1974 is $376,398.80, a sum that  represents

three  times what it was in 1973. The matter has really

become  much  worse. But to compound the  situation  it

would appear that compensation has to be paid even  for

accidents involving Police vehicles because  a  sum  of

$62,000  has  been  paid out in  respect  of  accidents

involving  the  Police. Under such  circumstances,  the

situation  requires some very strong admonition  either

from  the Minister or in some way through the Attorney-General's Chambers. It is for this reason that  I  have

risen to speak on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the appropriation for 1974 is

$100,000 while the sum that is going to be paid out  or

has  been paid out so far is $376,000. This discrepancy

between  the appropriation and the actual sum paid  out

has  appeared again and again in the Estimates. Sir,  I

suggest  that when the next Estimates are  prepared  we

put  in  a sum that is perhaps closer to the experience

that  we  have had so that Members can have an idea  of

the  extent of compensation that has been paid, instead

of having to find out by asking for a written answer to

a question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as for accidents involving Government

vehicles,  the  expenditure under  this  head  for  the

financial year 1974-75 up to 28th February this year is

$139,489.92.  This sum was required  to  settle  claims

arising  out of accidents involving Government vehicles

which  were settled out of court. The vast majority  of

these cases were dealt with under the provisions of the

Treasury Collision Agreement between the Government and

48  insurance  companies. The  Agreement  provides  for

contribution towards the cost of repairs to  Government

vehicles  insured by one of the signatory companies  in

the event of accidents between these vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the vote was used to settle claims in

accidents caused or contributed to by the negligence of

Government drivers. The sums incurred in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



number  of accident cases dealt with in the last  three

financial years are as follows:



<pre>



                                    No. of

     Year              Amount       Cases



   1972- 1973        $124,831.94    233

   1973-1974         $149,925.55    271

   1974- 1975        $139,489.92    254

   (up to 28th Feb.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>



These   figures  show  that  the  number  of  accidents

increased slightly in the last two years compared  with

the  financial year 1972-73. This can be said to be due

to  the  increasing  number of  vehicles  used  by  the

various  Government Ministries and departments.  Whilst

the  number of vehicles used by the Ministry of Defence

is  not known to me, the fleets of the Ministry of  the

Environment  and the Police Department  have  increased

considerably. In 1972, the Ministry of the  Environment

had  350 vehicles but by 1974 this number had increased

to  419.  The  Police  fleet  has  increased  from  664

vehicles in 1972 to 842 in 1974.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another consideration which perhaps has a greater

bearing  on  this expenditure is the sharp increase  in

the  cost of repairs. The sum of $100,000 allocated  to

meet  accidents for the financial year  1974-75  was  a

conservative figure. The sum expended in the  financial

year 1973-74 amounted to nearly $150,000. For the first

11  months  of  the financial year 1974-75,  a  sum  of

$139,489.92  has been spent, and we expect this  figure

to  increase  to  about $150,000 by the  close  of  the

financial year. For these reasons a budget of  $150,000

for the new financial year would not be an unreasonable

estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for the discrepancies between the

amount  asked for in previous financial years  and  the

actual  amount spent was the unforeseen sharp  increase

in  the  cost of repairs and the increase in the number

of accidents. In 1971, for example, the average cost of

each  accident was about $370 but by 1974  the  average

cost per accident had increased to $550.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers of Government vehicles are subject to a far

greater degree of control than the ordinary driver. Not

only are they liable to criminal proceedings which  may

be  initiated but they are also subject to departmental

proceedings which may result in their dismissal,  where

appropriate.  In the case of the Ministry  of  Defence,

Singapore Armed Forces' drivers are not only liable  to

disciplinary proceedings but may also be ordered to pay

or  contribute  towards the cost of  repairs  to  their

vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao, you have actually exceeded the

guillotine time. Would you like to withdraw your

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> In that case, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,099,940 for Head H ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $563,000 for Head H ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head J -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pollution caused by lorries, taxis and other

commercial  vehicles  has decreased  considerably.  Yet

there  seems to be no decrease in the pollution  caused

by  buses  owned  by the Singapore Bus Service.  It  is

common   to  see  buses  continuously  emitting   smoke

throughout their journeys. I am sure the Minister  must

have  noticed  this. What efforts  are  being  made  to

reduce  this  health hazard? In complete contrast,  the

Scheme  B buses are in excellent condition and  do  not

emit  poisonous smoke, although all the buses are using

the  same fuel. To make matters worse, some of the  SBS

buses  are  so  noisy that if one is not careful  one's

eardrums may burst especially if one happens to be  too

close to the engine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Showa Maru incident was given immense

publicity as a result of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



the   unique  damage  caused  to  Singapore   and   our

neighbours.  Our  neighbours have already  made  public

their  claims  for  the damage. The damage  to  us  was

greater than that to our neighbours. Besides the damage

we  have also incurred a huge expenditure in our  fight

to  minimise the pollution. What was the outcome of the

Foreign Ministers' meeting which was specially convened

to  discuss this incident and its related issues?  What

measures  are being taken to ensure that tankers,  like

the  Showa  Maru, do not create further damage  to  our

waters and seashores?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think we all know that the main  cause

of  excessive smoke from buses, cars and other vehicles

is bad maintenance of their engines. Anyway, because of

the  enforcement  action  taken  by  the  Registry   of

Vehicles and the Traffic Police, matters have improved.

Owners  are  more  careful and, with the  exception  of

buses, they have maintained their vehicles quite  well.

There  has been an improvement in the control of  smoke

pollution  all over Singapore. I quite agree  with  the

Member  for  Anson that Scheme B buses are  in  a  much

better  condition. They do not make so much noise,  nor

do  they  emit  smoke as much as the SBS buses.  But  I

would like to inform him that Scheme B buses are not as

heavily  used  and  so there is less deterioration  and

thus  easier  to maintain. I can assure him  that  with

more

new  SBS  buses coming to the scene and with a team  of

army personnel helping in the maintenance of the buses,

the  situation will improve. However, it will  be  some

time before any improvement in the SBS could be seen.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, on behalf of my

colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, answer the

Member  for  Anson's query on the Showa Maru  incident?

The incident, as the Member knows, brought our Foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



Minister   and  those  of  the  neighbouring  countries

together  to discuss the safety of navigation  and  the

control  of marine pollution in the Straits of  Malacca

and  the Straits of Singapore. As the Member would have

read in the press, a Ministerial Council was formed  as

a  result  of the meeting. A Traffic Separation  Scheme

and  the use of additional navigational aids were  also

considered  at  the  meeting and, if  implemented,  the

safety  of  navigation in the Straits would be  further

enhanced. The Foreign Ministers also agreed that  there

should  be  cooperation  and consultation  amongst  the

three countries when submitting claims for compensation

arising out of oil spills. These are measures to ensure

that  while oil tankers, including the Very Large Crude

Carriers, use the Straits of Malacca and the Straits of

Singapore,  they will not create oil spills  to  damage

our waters and seashores and those of our neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Showa Maru incident itself, the Port of

Singapore  Authority has submitted  a  claim  for  $3.8

million.  These are specific claims on amounts actually

expended in both fighting pollution and preventing  the

spread  of  pollution  caused by  the  oil  spills.  As

regards   general  damages,  the  matter  is   somewhat

complicated and is still under consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, on the matter of buses I

think   there  is  no  proper  control  over  them.   I

understand that spare parts are allowed to  lie  in  an

open  space and anybody can take them out. There is  no

proper  control  by SBS, and therefore you  can  expect

their  buses to give out smoke. However, I withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, may I clarify the position? I am

not  responsible for the mechanical maintenance of  the

buses,  but  partly  responsible for  the  control  and

monitoring  of  pollution caused by the buses  emitting

smoke. If the Member wants satisfaction about how spare

parts are used by the SBS,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



I think  he should ask my colleague, the Minister  for

Communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be

allocated  for Head J be reduced by $10 in  respect  of

item (a) of subhead AAA 8101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of parks in the Public Utilities

Board  premises at MacRitchie Reservoir  is  indeed  an

advantage  for  the  people. It is  essential  that  we

develop parks because more than 40% of our people  live

in   high-rise  flats  and  need  an  environment   for

relaxation, lots of trees, greenery and serenity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in MacRitchie a restaurant enables those

who  can  afford to refresh themselves. I  presume  the

rental is high and so the cost for refreshment is  also

high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the park authorities to ensure

that  the  park is not littered and stringent  measures

have been taken to ensure that this is adhered to. Soft

drinks  are  not  allowed  in  the  park  for  fear  of

littering, and rightly so. It would also result in  the

restaurant being put out of business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of each year, many school

children frequent the MacRitchie Reservoir, not because

they  want  to enjoy the serenity of the park  and  its

surroundings  but  because, as  part  of  their  school

activities,  they need to participate in  cross-country

races.  These children go there as groups organised  by

their schools. Of course, the usual formalities have to

be  carried  out  when applications  are  made  by  the

schools  to  the Ministry of Education for the  use  of

MacRitchie  Reservoir as a cross-country  track.  These

applications  are  normally  approved  by   the   Water

Department, Public Utilities Board, and conditions  are

set  down  governing the use of the reservoir premises.

These   conditions  are  issued  by  the  Chief   Water

Engineer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions to be observed are on standard

cyclostyled sheets and there are ten conditions in all.

Most  conditions  stress  on anti-littering  and  anti-pollution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



measures  that  need  to be taken. However,  regulation

(10),   "No   soft  drinks  are  allowed  in  reservoir

grounds", puzzles me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is usual for children, after having run a cross-country race of 2.1 miles for girls and 3.1 miles for

boys, to want to quench their thirst with some ice-cold

water  or  soft  drinks. To run between two  and  three

miles  is  pretty tiring especially in our hot climate,

and  it  is  more than usual for children to need  more

than  one  bottle of iced soft drink or more  than  one

glass of ice-cold water at the end of the race. But  as

soft  drinks are not allowed in the reservoir  grounds,

there  is  no  alternative  but  for  the  children  to

purchase these drinks from the restaurant at the fairly

exorbitant price of 35 cents a bottle which, mind  you,

is  not  iced  because  the great  number  of  children

participating makes it very difficult for  the  caterer

to ice hundreds of drinks. So the children will have to

make-do   with  warm  bottled  drinks  which  is   most

unsatisfying.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many of the children do without drinks at

all  because  they cannot afford them at  such  prices.

Many children have to dig into their savings for thirst

quenchers  during  cross-country races  at  MacRitchie.

Some  children,  because they  are  more  capable,  are

chosen  to  represent  their schools  in  cross-country

runs, so they turn up more than once to MacRitchie  and

incur still greater costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to understand why if these cross-country races

are  organised  by schools, and school  principals  and

teachers  are responsible people, the PUB  cannot  make

some  arrangements so as to enable schools to  organise

their  own thirst quenching facilities in the car  park

in  the reservoir ground. Children can then be provided

with   cheaper   and  ice-cold  drinks.   If   properly

organised, the drinks would cost no more than 5 cents a

glass   or   even   cheaper.  The  money   saved,   the

satisfaction derived by the children, and the assurance

that MacRitchie is not littered, would be enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



arguments  for the Chief Water Engineer to  allow  soft

drinks  into  the  reservoir grounds  during  organised

cross-country races.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think the key to the complaint

made here is the term, "if properly organised". In  the

experience of the PUB, on many occasions when  students

participated  in cross-country runs in the  reservoirs,

they  were  found  littering. So  I  say  "if  properly

organised"  is  the answer. Our experience  shows  that

these  runs  have not been properly organised  on  many

occasions.  That  is  the  reason  why,  among  the  10

conditions imposed by the Chief Water Engineer for  the

use  of  MacRitchie Reservoir is one  disallowing  soft

drinks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after listening to the eloquent appeal from the

hon. Member, I think arrangements can be made with  the

schools  and  the Chief Water Engineer for children  to

have  ice-cold cheap drinks, if the runs  are  properly

organised.  I will take this matter up with  the  Chief

Water Engineer of the PUB, and between the Ministry  of

Education and the PUB they should be able to work out a

scheme  to prevent littering in the reservoirs as  well

as to provide cheap cold drinks for the children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, that was the most satisfactory answer by the Hon.

Minister.  I thank him very much for his consideration,

and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampung Kapur)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 8201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the more we deal with the daily affairs of the

people,  the  more  we  meet  with  problems.   It   is

inevitable. The PUB has to ensure the supply  of  water

and  electricity to 2.2 million people  involving  some

500,000  consumer  accounts.  The  consumers   are   of

different   levels  of  education  and  have  different

capacities for understanding. The PUB has to depend  on

some 160 meter-readers to go from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



house  to  house to read the meters for the calculation

of consumers' monthly bills. It is not an easy task for

each  meter  reader to visit some 3,000  households  to

read  meters to any degree of satisfaction.  Therefore,

most of the monthly bills give actual readings once  in

every   two   months  or  are  based  on  the   average

consumption over three months. This mode of calculation

is  contained in the bills sent by the PUB to consumers

for their information. Using the pretext of shortage of

personnel  or the wording as appearing on the  bill  in

order  to  arrive  at  any calculation  is  groundless,

inaccurate  and unreliable. For instance, in  the  last

year  certain consumers' bills suddenly jumped by  100%

to  200%. After enquiries by letter, the bill  for  the

following  month returned to normal. But after  two  or

three  months  the bill would again increase  by  200%.

This is rather erratic and puzzling. To the rich people

it  does  not matter very much, but to people in  lower

income  group who have very tight budgets, it  it  very

disturbing to have to meet the high cost of PUB bills.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b>

Mr  Yeo, are you on the right subhead - Loan to  Public

Utilities Board?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, I am talking first on the complaints about PUB

bills, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the low income group people, it is a big burden to

them. Sir, to meet the problem of shortage of staff and

the   dissatisfaction  of  the  increasing  number   of

consumers,  and  to  rectify  the  situation   to   the

satisfaction  of  both sides on a long  term  basis,  I

suggest that every household should be given the  right

to  record their own consumption of public utilities so

that  this  record can be used by the PUB to  calculate

the  following month's bill. To do this the PUB  should

carry out publicity campaigns through the press and  TV

to tell the people how to record their bills correctly.

To  facilitate easy reading and recording, diagrams and

instructions  can  be  included in  the  PUB's  monthly

bills, also PUB



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



meter-readers can turn up on the first such occasion to

help the consumers record correctly and to avoid future

contention. Through the mass media, the PUB  should  be

able  to  educate members of the public on how to  take

readings  of their consumption rates. All the necessary

diagrams  can  be  given to help the consumers  to  get

proper  readings  and to submit them  to  the  PUB  for

billing  according  to  their  own  readings,  and  any

adjustments  may be made later against actual  official

readings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at my Meet-the-People sessions, I

received  complaints from members of  the  public  that

there had been irregularities and unnecessary increases

in  the  PUB bills. Perhaps other Members of the  House

have  also  come across such complaints. Therefore,  by

education and other means of teaching consumers to take

their  own  readings, we will be  able  to  reduce  the

number of consumers' complaints and this will also help

solve  the  PUB's shortage of meter-readers  and  other

problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think the Member believes that

attack is the best means of defence, and that is why he

is  complaining  loudly for a start. I agree  with  him

that  it  would  be a very good thing if consumers  can

read their own meters. In fact, the PUB is planning  to

teach  consumers to read their own meters. As  long  as

consumers  take their readings correctly and send  them

in by the scheduled date, the PUB will be able to check

them  from  time to time. That will save us  a  lot  of

expenditure  in  engaging meter-readers.  There  are  a

total  of  400.000  accounts, and  there  are  about  a

million meters to be read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working on a documentary with the RTS at the

moment  and  it  is expected to be ready  by  May.  The

documentary will teach the public how to read their own

meters.  We  are also printing cards for  consumers  to

record their meter readings. These readings can then be

checked by the meter readers from time to time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take this opportunity to say that

the complaint about 100-200% increase in the consumers'

bill is not quite true. I have come across cases where,

in actual fact, consumers have used a 100% or more than

the previous month's consumption. In one of my Meet-the-People sessions, I had a consumer who showed me his PUB

bills.  The  average for six months was about  $80  per

month,  but for the month in question the amount billed

was  about  $200.  I  asked  him  whether  he  had  any

celebration  in his house. He said no. On investigation

it  was found that a dinner party took place for  three

successive nights to celebrate a wedding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB bills can increase substantially because of a

leaking  water  pipe  or a faulty  meter.  Under  these

circumstances, the consumer can ask for the meter to be

checked, and if the meter is proved to be faulty, there

will be a refund or the leak detected and repaired.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not fabricating all these complaints about

the  undue increase of PUB bills by 100-200%. In  fact,

on  Friday, the 14th of March this year at my Meet-the-People session I met a member of the public who came to

see  me  with his PUB bills. His monthly bills were  at

first $14.56 and then it increased to $51.88. So if  it

is  necessary, I can give the Minister a photostat copy

of the bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for accepting

my  proposal to educate the consumers to take their own

meter readings, as this will solve the problem and give

a  lot  of  convenience to the people. I beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,247,700 for Head J ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1002 (The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that we had a very short time

in  which to build up a credible defence. But under the

enlightened  leadership and planning  of  the  Minister

concerned, we have made great achievements and  success

in  this  regard. The strength of our Armed Forces  has

been  increasing from day to day and they are  able  to

take  up  the responsibility of defending our  country.

These  are  achievements which  are  not  mean  by  any

standard,   particularly  for  a  small  country   like

Singapore.  We  should be proud of  such  achievements.

Although  the defence build-up has been on  the  proper

lines   and   is   proceeding  smoothly   for   further

development, there are some shortcomings which  require

our attention. I would like to take this opportunity to

bring up three points for the attention of the Minister

concerned.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the relaxation of part-time national

service.  I have received complaints that the only  son

in  the  family has not been exempted from the national

service, particularly when his parents are old or  sick

and  are unable to look after their own business. Under

such  circumstances the only son is  required  to  look

after  the  small  family  business  which  cannot   be

properly run by the aged or sick parents. But exemption

is   not   normally  granted  in  such  cases.  Another

complaint  I have received is from an only son  who  is

required to help his aged parents to rear pigs. He  has

asked  for a change from full-time service to part-time

service,  but his application was rejected.  There  are

other  cases  of financial difficulties which  make  it

necessary  for national servicemen to ask for part-time

service  instead of full-time service. There  are  also

requests for national service call-up for brothers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



to  be staggered. But all these applications have  been

rejected.  The  cases that I have cited  are  deserving

cases because these people come from very poor families

and  they are faced with great financial (difficulties.

So  I  feel that the Minister concerned should consider

their   cases  more  sympathetically  and  grant  their

applications for transfer to part-time service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a need to provide more recreational

and  cultural activities in the camps. Over the  recent

years we have such activities in the camps. It is  good

for  the  national servicemen and our soldiers to  take

part in wholesome and cultural activities. This is part

and  parcel  of  the  build-up of  their  cultural  and

spiritual  life. I would like to support this  kind  of

activity, as it will provide our soldiers and  national

servicemen opportunities for recreational and  cultural

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of content perhaps there is still room for

improvement. According to my understanding,  the  songs

and the music played during such activities are more of

the  popular type. No doubt they may be quite  pleasing

to the ears hut they are not cultural music in the true

sense of the word. They are pop music, a crazy type  of

music,   very  loud  and  boisterous  and  will   cause

spiritual   degradation.  So  for  our  soldiers   such

dissipating  type of music should not be encouraged.  I

would  like  to propose to the Minister concerned  that

the   cultural  and  recreational  activities  provided

should   contain  marches  and  other  healthy   songs.

Listening in to more and more marches will heighten the

Spirit of our soldiers and boost their morale. In  this

way   our   soldiers  will  feel  a  sense  of   pride.

Furthermore, I understand that the physical  activities

like  sports  and  games are quite  popular  among  our

soldiers  in  the  camps.  Unfortunately  there  is  no

systematic training for such sports and games. I  would

therefore like to propose the setting up of a sports or

physical  education unit in the Armed  Forces  for  the

promotion of physical education among our soldiers.  In

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



way  there  can  be  more  sportsmen  trained  for  our

national teams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there have been quite a lot of complaints

about  misconduct on the part of our soldiers.  I  have

received   complaints  that  some  soldiers  misbehaved

themselves in public. Some soldiers have been  said  to

have made catcalls to girls, when driving in their army

trucks.  This is a very serious matter and is a  breach

of  good conduct on the part of the soldiers. This will

bring  our  army into disrepute. Though the  number  of

soldiers  guilty of such misconduct may be very  small,

it  will nevertheless affect the good reputation of the

great  majority. Therefore, I would like  the  Minister

concerned to pay special attention to this complaint of

misconduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that some soldiers, and even

officers,  keep  long hair. Since there  is  an  Action

Committee  against  long hair  in  Singapore  and  that

people  with long hair are to be served last,  I  think

this  ruling should be strictly enforced in  our  Armed

Forces.  We  should not tolerate long  hair  among  our

soldiers.  Our  Senior Parliamentary Secretary  in  the

Defence  Ministry  has already set a  good  example  by

cutting  his  hair short! So our soldiers and  officers

should  emulate him. There is every reason to stick  to

the short hair rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the British

withdrawal  from the region was followed by  a  Defence

Agreement  between Australia, Britain and  New  Zealand

aimed  at strengthening our defence capabilities.  Now,

the  Australian  troops  have been  withdrawn  and  the

British  troops are reported to be on the  verge  of  a

complete withdrawal. Only the New Zealanders are  left.

It  seems  as  though some of our defence partners  are

very  unreliable.  Furthermore, this  sort  of  defence

agreement drawn up by countries thousands of miles away

seems  to  suit their convenience rather than ours.  Do

you  not think, Sir, it is better that we draw up a new

Defence Agreement among the ASEAN countries, which  are

closer to the shores of Singapore, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



could  play  an  effective  role  in  the  defence   of

Singapore  and also in the defence of each country?  We

cannot rely on foreigners. Instead we should rely  more

on our neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been reported that the army regulars have

been  given a $25 increment to overcome inflation. This

is  unfair. The national servicemen are doing the  same

work and they have to meet the same expenses. They  too

help  in  the defence of the country. They too help  in

the maintenance of their families. Furthermore, married

regulars   are   provided  free   transport,   gratuity

allowances  and quarters, which benefits  the  national

servicemen  are not entitled to. There is  considerable

dissatisfaction because of this disparity  between  the

regulars  and the national servicemen as  far  as  this

increment is concerned. Would it not be wiser  to  give

this  increment  to  all  servicemen,  irrespective  of

whether they are regulars or national servicemen, since

the  cost  of  living  affects everybody  and  not  one

particular group alone. Why cannot we be fair to all?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this year onwards the National Day Parade, on an

experimental basis, will be decentralised. It  will  be

held  in different districts in different forms. May  I

know   how   these   programmes   are   going   to   be

decentralised? Will there be a variety of parades, etc.

or is it going to be the same everywhere?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago I queried the conduct of army drivers

because  of  the  numerous  accidents  they  had   been

involved in. We were then assured that the standard  of

driving  would improve. Unfortunately, I have to  raise

this  question again because I continue to see reckless

driving by some army drivers. It seems that some of the

army drivers and our bus drivers are equally bad on the

roads.  Once an army driver is in a 3-tonner, he  seems

to  think  that he owns the road and all other vehicles

like  cars, motor cycles and bicycles are just midgets.

It is a common sight to see army drivers speeding along

everywhere. Their recklessness is a source of danger to

other  drivers. It is high time that stern  action  was

taken against these reckless drivers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army, in fact, the Defence Department introduced

SAFE  Supermarkets, one in Beach Road and the other  at

Dempsey  Road. Business must have been very bad because

a  lot of passes had been issued to Government servants

and  to  numerous  Statutory Boards. Unfortunately,  it

seems  that  the  purpose of the  SAFE  Supermarket  at

Dempsey Road is lost because of the distance. A look in

this Supermarket will clearly reveal the very few items

on display and these are of poor quality. Rusty-looking

tins  or  containers are displayed in a shoddy  manner.

Maybe something could be done to reorganise the Dempsey

Road  SAFE Supermarket. In these Supermarkets only army

personnel  are  allowed to buy beer at special  prices.

Unfortunately,  the reservists are not allowed  to  buy

beer from this Supermarket. May I know why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that in the establishment of

the  Army,  there  are many senior posts  like  Warrant

Officers,  etc, which are still left vacant,  although

many loyal and dedicated men who have put in many years

of  service  could fill these vacancies.  But  this  is

never done. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junior officers, like the staff sergeants, are

quite   frustrated   because  of  lack   of   promotion

prospects.  Furthermore, the pay of these officers  are

nothing   compared  to  the  salaries  of  the   Police

sergeants. Could something be done to revise the salary

scales of the army in general?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang is quite wrong about

Mindef policy in regard to the call-up of only sons who

have to look after the aged parents. The policy is that

if  the  young man is the sole supporter of the family,

he  is not called up for full-time service. In fact, in

1974,  238 such cases were approved when they  appealed

against full-time national service. During the Meet-the-People  sessions and elsewhere, Members  of  Parliament

are  told  rather biased stories by parents,  which  on

investigation turn out to be inaccurate. But if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



the  fact  is  that he is the sole breadwinner  in  the

family  and  enlistment  into  national  service  would

impose  hardship  because of decline  in  income,  then

there  is  a  clear case for exemption  from  full-time

service.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding cultural activities in the SAF, every person

has  his taste and if the Member for Sembawang does not

like  pop songs and loud music he need not turn  up  at

the  road  shows of the SAF. But he is quite  wrong  in

suggesting  that  if we only play marches  and  rousing

music  the  soldiers'  morale  will  go  up.  This   is

entertainment and relaxation for them and they want  to

forget the rigours of military training. Therefore,  we

have   to   give  them  something  which  they   enjoy.

Unfortunately,  the  Member for  Sembawang's  taste  of

music does not coincide with that of the soldiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of sports, there is a sports officer

in  every  unit. The trouble is this. We  do  not  have

enough  sports fields and even in the biggest and  best

battalion  camp  you  often  find  there  is  only  one

football  field  and  perhaps two or  three  basketball

pitches. That is about all that is available for nearly

a   thousand  men.  This  is  totally  inadequate.  The

solution is that we have to make-do with what we  have,

in  view  of the shortage of land and money being  none

too  plentiful. The ideal solution is beyond the  grasp

of SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding misbehaviour and catcalls to girls, in my

five   years   as  Defence  Minister  I  received   two

complaints on this subject from girls who were outraged

by  soldiers making catcalls at them. On investigation,

it  was  found  that it was not just a  matter  of  the

soldiers  being  high-spirited  but  they  were  rather

nasty.  So the soldiers were duly court martialled  and

sentenced  to  40 days' jail. But there were  only  two

cases in five years. If the hon. Member's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



girl friends are subject to this kind of treatment, and

if  they  object  to it, then please let  me  have  the

details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding long hair, I think this is a very general

allegation.  Standards are being  maintained.  I  would

advise  the  Member for Sembawang to  look  at  an  RTS

illustration  of what constitutes long  hair  and  what

does  not  constitute long hair. I can assure him  that

the hair style of my Senior Parliamentary Secretary  is

not taken to be the ideal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants the $25 increase to be

extended to national servicemen. When we decided not to

give  this  additional sum to national  servicemen,  we

explained that the purpose of this $25 is to  meet  the

additional  cost  of food, transport and  clothing,  as

against  the  NWC 9% increase which is  the  result  of

economic  growth and general sharing of prosperity.  So

we  have  to  distinguish these two  elements  of  wage

increase. The $25 is meant to offset the rising cost of

living  last year and the subsequent 9% increase  which

was  a  share of the bigger GNP growth which  Singapore

achieved.  Nearly  all  the  national  servicemen   are

unmarried and they live in camps. They are fed and they

get  free  transport, free meals and free clothing.  So

they are protected from the cost of living increases to

that  extent. In fact, it is the taxpayer  who  has  to

meet  the  additional cost of feeding and clothing  the

soldiers,  whose  cost  has nearly  doubled  in  recent

years. On the other hand, the regular soldier generally

lives  outside the camp and he has to feed himself.  He

has got to look after his family and clothe them. He is

not  protected,  to  the same extent  as  the  national

servicemen,  from  the effects of price  increases.  So

there is really no case for giving this $25 increase to

national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether National Day parades will

be  the  same  or  whether there will be  variety,  the

answer  is that there will be variety. The form of  the

parade  will be under the direction of the Minister  in

charge. Generally speaking, what we aim to achieve is a

more informal atmosphere, a happier and less

precise  parade, as compared with the central  National

Day parade at the Padang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reckless driving, I do not think the Member for

Anson  can  say that his complaint last  year  had  not

brought any result. Partly because of what he said, the

SAF has bought equipment to catch army drivers speeding

by installing radar traps in various places. The Member

will  be glad to hear that last year 328 soldiers  were

fined  between $20 and $100 each for speeding.  But  by

and  large,  the  accident rate in  the  Army  has  not

reached  the  dangerous limit. I  will  give  him  some

figures  if  he is interested. In 1974, there  was  one

accident  per 45,000 kilometres, and in 1973 there  was

one  accident per 47,000 kilometres. So in  1974  there

was  a  slight deterioration. We are trying to  improve

the situation as best as we can, but so long as most of

the drivers are national servicemen (and this will have

to  be  the position in the national service army)  you

cannot expect the same high standard of driving  as  in

the  regular army where all the drivers are experienced

and long-term professionals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point about NCOs. Here again, the Member has

been  misinformed. Last year there were four  promotion

exercises  carried out for regular NCOs. About  480  of

them were promoted, which comes to about three-quarters

of  those who were within the promotion zone. In  fact,

the  number  of vacancies in the senior  ranks  of  the

NCOs, a vital cadre of the Army, is so serious that the

risk  is the other way round - we promote people faster

than they normally would be promoted.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Honourable Minister has not replied to the

question on supermarkets.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Here again, I am afraid the facts do

not  bear out about what the Member has said.  When  we

opened the Dempsey Road Supermarket in April 1974,  the

reason  was that the Beach Road Supermarket was  rather

crowded  as it comprises only a very small room.  There

were spare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



buildings in Tanglin Barracks and we thought  we  would

open  a supermarket there. We were almost certain  that

having  two supermarkets would be too big for  the  SAF

which  after all is not all that big, and therefore  we

decided to extend in stages to various departments  and

branches of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the two supermarkets have a combined

annual  turnover of about $4 million. For instance,  in

January  1975 Beach Road Supermarket had a turnover  of

$202,000   in   that  month  alone  and  Dempsey   Road

Supermarket had a sale of $189,000. I do not think  the

Member  is correct in saying that the goods in  Dempsey

Road Supermarket are inferior. They are the same as  in

Beach  Road Supermarket. In fact, they are the same  in

supermarkets  elsewhere. They buy  the  same  brand  of

goods. But Dempsey Road Supermarket will be moving into

consumer durables and will enter into some kind of easy

instalment  payments for members of  the  SAF  and  the

civil  service,  who  will  be  able  to  buy  consumer

durables  like  refrigerators, radios,  tape-recorders,

etc, on fairly good terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what new forms of energy have been thought of as

suitable  alternatives to oil for Singapore?  Since  we

have  ample  sunshine, has solar energy been considered

seriously, and has any experimental station been set up

to  study  its  usefulness to us? Has any thought  also

been   given  to  the  use  of  monsoon  winds  as   an

alternative  source of energy? It may seem  ridiculous,

but  I  am  afraid  to  say that we  have  been  rather

complacent  on  the study of energy resources  or  even

utilising  alternative sources  of  energy  instead  of

increasing our dependence on oil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that the recent student trouble we had

witnessed in Singapore has been mainly caused by  non-citizens. Why has the Registrar of Societies allowed a

union to exist, whereby -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Member for Anson say what has this got to do with the Ministry of Science and Technology?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister for Science and Technology is in

charge  of the University of Singapore. Therefore,  the

Minister  will  have  to  answer  my  question  on  the

students' union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-citizens who have no stake in this country can and

have  manipulated the union for their ulterior motives.

A  union,  even a students' union, which  permits  non-citizens  to manipulate its members against Singapore's

interest should be struck off, or clauses should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



be  inserted  into  the constitution  to  prevent  non-citizens from holding any office whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is observed that a bulk of the provision of

$60.26 million under this Head is required for Phase  I

of  the  development of the new University of Singapore

Campus  at  Kent Ridge. I presume that  with  this  new

building  there  would  be  a  greater  intake  of  our

students  from the various pre-University  classes  and

Junior  Colleges.  I  wonder to what  extent  can  this

building accommodate our students. Sir, I have  to  ask

this  question because, at the present time, it is  not

easy  for  our  students to gain entry into  our  local

university, because of competition and also because  of

the  high  standards set. As such, many of our students

are  thinking  of  enrolling in  overseas  universities

where  chances  of admission are very much  greater.  I

would,  therefore, urge the Minister to  see  that  our

students  do  get  their higher education  in  our  own

higher institutions.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has been studying

alternative sources of energy besides the present usage

of  fuel  oil. Our main consideration, of  course,  has

been  to  collect information and data on  the  use  of

nuclear   energy,  in  conjunction  with   the   Public

Utilities Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must warn the Member for Anson that my

Ministry is not directly in charge of generating energy

for public consumption. All that we do is to act as  an

information  gathering centre  which  can  be  used  to

provide  relevant data for the Public Utilities  Board.

No  decision has been made on the use of nuclear energy

in  the  near  future as there are still many  pressing

problems  which the Public Utilities Board  is  facing,

over  and  above which the Public Utilities  Board  has

still  to operate its new fossil fuel power station  at

Senoko.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some research has been conducted by the

Mechanical Engineering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



Department  of  the  University  of  Singapore  on  the

possibilities of using solar energy. The Member may  be

aware  that  Singapore  is not a desert.  Singapore  is

covered with clouds very frequently and it seems to  be

raining  almost every day. But we have first to collect

information on how much sunlight or radiation from  the

sun  falls  on Singapore throughout a whole year.  This

information has now been obtained and we are using  the

data  to formulate ways and means by which solar energy

can  be  used. The use of solar energy for  cooking  in

villages which are not supplied with electricity or gas

is  quite  common in India and other African countries.

These   solar  cookers  can  be  bought  very  cheaply.

However, I do not foresee in the near or distant future

Singapore  housewives  turning  on  to  solar  cookers.

Nonetheless, it is our intention that we should conduct

experiments  so that solar energy can be  utilised  for

industrial  purposes rather than for domestic  purposes

and  in  this way we hope we will be able  to  be  less

reliant  on fossil energy. Or equally, with the growing

use   of  air-conditioning  in  supermarkets,  shopping

complexes   and  domestic  homes,  the  Department   is

conducting research into methods of using solar  energy

for  air-conditioning. However, the  research  has  not

been  completed because the Department is still waiting

for  vital pieces of equipment which are necessary  for

the  development of apparatus that will be used  as  an

air-conditioner. This is all that I can say as  far  as

alternative sources of energy are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Member for Anson will realise that even

the  oil-producing countries are less interested in the

use  of solar energy but more interested in the use  of

nuclear energy. If he had read the newspapers two  days

ago  he  would have learned that the Shah of  Iran  had

already  ordered nine nuclear reactors from the  United

States.  I  think it is in our interest that we  should

look  for  alternative sources of energy. I share  with

him his concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of non-citizens in the University of

Singapore who have taken

a leading part in creating problems, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



would  only add that the Member for Anson must be aware

that prohibition of entry against six non-citizens  has

already  been  issued and they will not be  allowed  to

enter into Singapore again. But we do take note of  the

recommendation or proposal made by the Member for Anson

that  non-citizens  should not  be  permitted  to  hold

office in student organisations in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Member has asked how many students can be

accommodated at Kent Ridge. I am in full sympathy  with

the Member for Anson and all other parents who find  it

difficult  for  their  children  to  enter  our   local

University.  I must say that the difference  in  points

for  admission  of students into the University  varies

from  a  maximum  of  64  points  obtained  at  an  HSC

examination  to  a  minimum of 32 points,  which  is  a

difference  of  100%.  We cannot  go  lower  than  that

because  we  have  undertaken a statistical  study  and

discovered  that  there  is a correlation  between  the

grades  obtained at the A level and performance at  the

University.  This has not only been our experience  but

it  has also been the experience of universities in the

United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of other indicators of ability, we have

to  rely  entirely on the grades obtained  at  the  HSC

examination.  For  this reason  we  can  only  take  in

students who satisfy not just the minimum grade but the

accepted  grade. For example, in areas  of  study  like

medicine and engineering, we require students who  have

performed  very well in the HSC examinations. Otherwise

among  the  students who have been  taken  below  these

accepted grades, the possibility of their dropping  out

is  very high. They will drop out of the course in  the

first  or second year, because these are tough courses.

I believe that it is preferable for us to train doctors

who can cure than to train doctors who cannot cure.  So

the   Member  for  Anson  will  accept  the  fact  that

standards have to be maintained and that we just cannot

absorb  or  admit students on an ad hoc  basis  without

bearing in mind quality, as well as the possibility  of

meeting our manpower needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of doctors, if the Member for Anson had read

his  newspaper two days ago, he would have come  across

an article published by the medical profession in which

complaints were made of doctors in Singapore  migrating

overseas.  Obviously it seems a bit absurd that  if  we

are  to keep on taking in more doctors or more students

for training in medicine and the end-result is to cause

more   migration  because  they  cannot  compete  among

themselves,  then we are investing in a  holed  pocket.

For  this reason there is a need for a quota. We cannot

keep  on taking in endless numbers of students who,  by

virtue of the profession they are trained in, have very

great   mobility.  Medicine  is  one  profession  which

provides  a  student with this particular mobility.  He

can move from one country to another country. Canada is

short  of  doctors. Australia is short of doctors.  New

Zealand  is  short of doctors, and so also  the  United

States. So doctors can move very freely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very important that those who are

accepted  into  the medical school in Singapore  should

have some sense of obligation. Considering that we have

spent  a  considerable sum of money  on  their  medical

education, they should at least devote their skills for

some  years to patients in Singapore rather than  think

of  their own selfish interest. Their running away from

competition  among  themselves, or  the  so-called  rat

race, is not going to help us solve the problem.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our anticipation is that by 1980 the

University  will  be able to taking a  total  of  6,700

undergraduates  as  compared to the present  number  of

5,500 undergraduates, i.e. 1,200 more by 1980. This  is

another  five years' time. This represents  probably  a

22%  increase.  I  last  made a speech  that  we  could

increase by 25% in 1982.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head L be reduced by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what part does the Chemistry Department play in

controlling sea pollution around Singapore and for that

matter other types of pollution in Singapore? Does  the

Chemistry  Department  insist  on  guidelines  in  work

conditions  and safety precautions in shipyards?  There

seems  to  be far too many workers dying of  chemically

poisonous atmosphere in certain work places. Could  not

the  Chemistry  Department play an  important  part  in

setting guidelines for safety precautions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventeen posts have been abolished from this

department.  The officers were previously  required  to

inspect  ships,  and this duty has been transferred  to

the  PSA. May I know the reason for the transfer of the

responsibility  from the Chemistry  Department  to  the PSA?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, once these posts have been abolished and

the PSA takes over this function, can the PSA personnel

suitably  inspect  the  ships? Do  they  set  the  same

standard  as  that required by the 17 officers  of  the

Chemistry Department?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was some

dispute between the Port of Singapore Authority and  my

Ministry on the inspection of ships for what is  called

"hot work", which means that welding will be allowed in

ships  when it is declared free of inflammable vapours.

For   several   years  the  Chemistry  Department   was

responsible  for  issuing  licences  for  hot  work  in

shipyards.  But  because of the  increasing  number  of

tankers  coming into port, the PSA which is responsible

for  the waters around Singapore believes that the duty

of  inspecting  ships falls upon the  Authority  rather

than on my department. This problem was then studied by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



Management  Services  Department  of  the  Ministry  of

Finance  which  recommended that  the  ship  inspection

section   of   the  Chemistry  Department   should   be

transferred  to the PSA. Cabinet approved the  transfer

to  enable  the  PSA  to carry out  its  function  more

smoothly. But whether they are able to perform the  job

better than the Chemistry Department or not, I am in no

position to tell. If there are more explosions, then  I

think the Member for Anson should put this question  to

the Minister for Communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third consecutive year that I am going to

speak  about metrication. Some Members may wonder  why.

But  let me say one thing - we are not progressing fast

enough  in  the  implementation of metrication  in  all

aspects  of  life in Singapore. Take the  markets,  for

example. We still find weights being measured in katis,

tahils,  pounds and ounces. The daching - the notorious

instrument  used by businessmen to swindle consumers  - has not changed in the least. When is metrication going

to be a feature of life in the markets, particularly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that a higher provision is being voted for the

Metrication Board as it plans to intensify the pace  of

metrication  in  the retail sector. May  I  also  know,

besides the retail sector, what other divisions has the

Metrication Board in mind to promote metrication in the

next financial year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was stated in

the   Addendum   to  the  Presidential   Address   that

metrication  in  the public sector has  been  completed

more  or less and that efforts of the Metrication Board

will  be directed at the private sector beginning  this

year. However, before we embark upon this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



campaign it is necessary that the infrastructure should

be laid. It is true that metrication appears to be slow

in  the  private sector but, in reality, if the  Member

for Anson were to visit supermarkets, emporiums and  if

he  buys  petrol  at  petrol stations,  he  would  have

noticed  that all measures are now in metric. What  has

happened,   of  course,  is  that  we  have  introduced

metrication so gradually and so painlessly that it  has

not  been  felt. But we have got to be very careful  at

the  retail  trade sector, particularly in the  markets

where  housewives and servants do not fully  understand

the  relationship between the traditional kati and  the

metric measures of a kilogram.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Board has come out with a model of a

daching calibrated on the metric scale. Unless we first

abolish  the present daching scale which is  calibrated

in katis, it is obviously very wrong and foolish of the

Metrication Board to suggest introducing two  types  of

dachings,  because  then housewives would  be  cheated.

Therefore, a considerable amount of propaganda and some

legislation  may  be  necessary before  we  can  induce

hawkers  to  convert to the metric system. The  Weights

and  Measures Office, which is attached to the Ministry

of  Finance,  is really concerned with the daching  and

they have to be consulted. With due consultation it  is

quite  possible  that we can abolish  the  daching  and

insist on other types of measuring instruments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Member for Anson had experience in dealing

with  businessmen, traders or hawkers,  he  will  fully

understand  that  regardless of what type  of  weighing

machines  we  use, there are always ways and  means  by

which dishonest traders can cheat housewives. It is not

the  metric system or the imperial system that is being

used  to  cheat housewives. It is the machine  that  is

being  used. So the Member for Anson has to be a little

more  patient before we can find effective results next

year.  In fact, I anticipate that it will take  another

three  to four years before metrication in the  markets

becomes feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I bring up my points with regard to the

question of our foreign affairs, I would like to  quote

from the President's speech on 21st February, 1975,  as

contained in Hansard, [Vol. 34, No. 1, col. 10] on  the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our foreign policy must take into consideration the

new situation arising from the gradual scaling down  of

American  and Western military presence in the  region.

The  overwhelming Western influence in the  region  has

been correspondingly reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lead other powers to seek greater influence

for  themselves  in the area. It will be  important  to

cooperate  with our neighbours to safeguard our  common

interest. ASEAN can play an important role in lessening

the  leverage  the great powers can otherwise  have  in

exploiting differences and conflicts within the region.

It  can  also quicken the pace of regional co-operation

and economic development. This in turn will

strengthen stability and peace in the area.  ASEAN  can

help  member  states adjust to the rapid  geo-political

changes  in the region as the consequences of  American

withdrawal from direct involvement with the problems of

Indo-China  work  themselves through,  and  a  regional

balance   is   established  without  any  great   power

hegemony.  ASEAN will soon have a permanent Secretariat

which  will  coordinate  the  many  regional  economic,

social and cultural projects being implemented.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on the President's Address on 25th

February,  I had referred to this particular aspect  of

foreign  affairs. I am more concerned with the question

of  regional cooperation and I am happy to see  that  a

permanent  Secretariat for ASEAN  will  be  established

although,   as  stated  very  broadly,  its   functions

primarily will be to co-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



ordinate the  many  regional,  economic,  social  and

cultural projects to be implemented.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Hon. Minister for Law and

National  Development, who is the Acting  Minister  for

Foreign  Affairs, what are the scope and  functions  of

this  ASEAN Permanent Secretariat to be set  up?  I  am

fully  in support of the policy stand as laid  down  in

the  Addendum to the President's speech with regard  to

our  foreign  policy. I believe that ASEAN,  since  its

inception,  has  progressed  to  the  extent  that  the

relationship among its member-states is getting closer,

both bilaterally and regionally. In that respect, ASEAN

will  have  a  very important role to  play  in  global

affairs.  As  such,  how  and  in  what  way  can  this

Permanent  Secretariat  help  ASEAN  to  achieve   this

objective?  I  would  like the  Minister  concerned  to

elaborate on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, undeniably, our efforts in matters of foreign

affairs  have  reaped considerable  success  in  recent

years.  Because of our foreign policy of non-alignment,

we  have  now  won  the  general  friendship  and  good

relationship   with  our  neighbouring  countries.   In

addition  to  our original ties of mutual contact  with

our  neighbouring countries in this region, we are  now

having more ties by setting up bilateral relations with

West  Asian  countries  for  the  promotion  of  mutual

interests.  At the moment we are living in a  world  in

which  every  one is mutually dependent on  the  other.

Therefore,  for the sake of survival and in  the  long-term  interests, we must be more careful and active  in

carrying out our foreign policy to win more friends and

to  get more benefits. For these reasons, I would  like

to ask the Minister two questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What more active foreign policy measures will the

Ministry  carry out to promote friendly relations  with

West  Asian  countries in order to get the benefits  of

mutual trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In what countries will our foreign consulates and

embassies be established?



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

under  this  Head, I wish to raise a matter  of  policy

affecting the interests of our ambassadors and  mission

staff serving in our missions abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the question of citizenship status of

children  of  the  ambassadors and mission  staff  born

abroad.  As you know, the provisions on citizenship  in

the  Constitution  provides for citizenship  status  by

birth,  by  descent and by registration. Only  a  child

born  in Singapore of a citizen parent is a citizen  by

birth.  A  child born abroad is a citizen only  if  the

child's  father at the time of the child's birth  is  a

citizen by birth or by registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further provision requires that a minor becoming a

citizen  by descent must take the oath of renunciation,

loyalty  and  allegiance to the State within  one  year

after reaching the age of 21 years, and that if such  a

child does not on reaching adulthood make this oath  of

allegiance he loses his citizenship status completely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ambassadors and mission staff abroad are serving

the country and sometimes under stress and tension, not

to  mention  the frustrations which the officials  from

the  Treasury  from  time to time manufacture  for  our

mission staff abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously our ambassadors and mission staff are

considered  loyal since they represent  our  nation  in

national matters in the international scene. Yet  their

children born abroad are citizens by descent and suffer

the  adverse presumption of disloyalty since the  child

on  reaching adulthood would have to make  an  oath  of

renunciation  and  of allegiance  and  loyalty  to  the

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now even criminals serving in prison have the

satisfaction  despite  their overt  disloyalty  to  the

State  and  country,  of  having  their  children  born

citizens of Singapore by birth and that too in a State-subsidised hospital. But our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



ambassadors  and  mission staff in  this  respect,  you

might say, come off much worse than criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as I have noted earlier, the child born

abroad  is a citizen only if the child's father at  the

time of the child's birth is himself a citizen by birth

or registration. This is a recent amendment which makes

it  more unfavourable for the child of an ambassador or

a  mission  staff born abroad. Since  the  child  of  a

mission  staff  born  abroad  would  be  a  citizen  by

descent,  that child on reaching adulthood and marrying

and,  in turn, having a child who is born abroad  would

not   be  a  citizen  at  all.  This  works  out   most

unfavourably  for  our  ambassadors  and  their   staff

abroad. In other words, there is an in-built deterrence

in   this   situation  which  prevents  or  discourages

officials  in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  serving

abroad  from  advising their children to serve  in  the

Foreign   Service   abroad  in  future,   because   the

grandchild will not be a citizen at all, if born abroad

in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to this freak situation, as it appears to

me,  is to amend the Constitution to include a proviso,

as it has been done in other Constitutions, to make the

child born abroad a citizen by birth if, at the time of

the  child's birth, his father himself is a citizen and

in the service of the State. Aside of that I do not see

how  this problem can be solved, apart from taking  the

course of action of making it possible for the wife  of

the  ambassador or the mission staff serving abroad  to

come  back  to  Singapore for the birth of  her  child.

This, of course, would entail considerable expenses and

the  officials  in the Treasury would  shrink  back  in

horror.   It   is  unfortunate  that  this   unpleasant

situation has been allowed to go on to this date, and I

would urge the Minister to take measures to remedy this

situation  in fairness to our ambassadors  and  mission

staff  presently serving abroad and who may be  serving

in the future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, would you like to answer

these questions first?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Yes, Sir. With your permission, I would rather deal

with three of them instead of six at one go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Punggol who is interested in the

ASEAN  Secretariat. From its modest beginning  in  1967

when the ASEAN Declaration was signed in Bangkok, ASEAN

has   steadily  grown  into  an  effective  and  lively

regional  organisation.  ASEAN  has  now  11  Permanent

Committees and seven Ad Hoc Special Committees to  deal

with  the ever-increasing activities which come  within

the ambit of intra-regional cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ASEAN has not remained closed and exclusive.

ASEAN  continues to seek close contact and  cooperation

with  its  immediate neighbours as well as  with  other

nations  and  regions.  ASEAN has  now  established  an

official  dialogue  with  the EEC,  Australia  and  New

Zealand.  Even the United States is also keen  to  have

such  a  dialogue with ASEAN. Until now,  these  varied

activities  of  ASEAN were dealt with by  the  national

secretariats  in  the member-countries,  and  as  ASEAN

grows  these  activities will also widen in  scope  and

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has therefore come for ASEAN to have a

central  Permanent Secretariat to coordinate all  these

activities.  Hence, the decision of the  ASEAN  Foreign

Ministers to establish such a secretariat for ASEAN  in

Jakarta is not only another indication of the viability

and  permanency  of  ASEAN but  also  of  the  need  to

streamline and to coordinate its growing activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year a meeting of the ASEAN senior

officials from the establishment of the Secretariat was

held  in  Thailand,  and  it  was  decided  tentatively

amongst  other  things  that the  proposed  Secretariat

shall be a compact and efficient body designed to  meet

the  needs  of  ASEAN.  The  Secretariat  will  have  a

Secretary-General whose rank will be equivalent to that

of an Ambas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



sador; three Bureau Directors responsible for economic,

science  and  technology, social and cultural  matters,

will  assist the Secretary-General. The other staff  of

the proposed Secretariat consist of a Foreign Trade and

Economic  Relations Officer, an Administrative Officer,

a  Public  Information Officer,  two  Auditors  and  an

Assistant  to the Secretary-General. Serving Government

officials  in the ASEAN countries will be  selected  to

fill   the  various  posts  in  the  proposed   central

Secretariat. It is hoped that this Secretariat may come

into being some time this year.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Sembawang - the provision

of  $2 million has been entered under subhead BAA  4001

for staff and expenses for established missions abroad.

The  creation of new posts of Ambassadors as  and  when

the  need  arises  will be made  by  the  issue  of  an

Establishment Warrant. This is necessary because, until

a  firm  decision has been reached to establish  a  new

mission, it will be pointless to provide for more posts

of Ambassadors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major difficulties in setting up missions

abroad is to find persons of calibre and experience  to

fill  Head  of  Mission  appointments.  Therefore,  the

provision  of  $2 million is adequate  for  any  urgent

expenditure  that  might  be  required  in  setting  up

missions before recourse has to be made to the Treasury

for additional funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is interested in West Asia.

The  Government recognises the position West  Asia  now

holds  internationally, and the Ministry will therefore

spare no effort in, creating goodwill between Singapore

and  West Asia and will actively encourage official and

private  visits  to  West Asia to seek  more  areas  of

cooperation  with the countries there. If manpower  and

finance  permit,  it  is  the  intention  to  establish

diplomatic missions in two or three countries  of  West

Asia  and  to  complement residential home-based  staff

with a system of Consuls or Honorary Consuls.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has a point. Under

Article  55 (1) of the Singapore Constitution, a  child

of a member of our foreign office staff born abroad and

registered  at  a  consulate or  embassy  of  Singapore

becomes a Singapore citizen by descent. However,  I  am

aware that foreign service officers, who are parents of

children   born  abroad  and  by  registration   become

citizens by descent, are disturbed by this. The  reason

is  that, under the provisions of Article 55 (2) of the

Constitution,  a  minor  who  becomes  a   citizen   of

Singapore by descent may lose his citizenship status if

he  does  not take the oath of renunciation, allegiance

and  loyalty  in the prescribed manner and  within  the

stipulated  period,  which is within  12  months  after

reaching  the  age of 21 years. These officers  rightly

feel  that  since  they are required by  Government  to

serve  abroad,  their children born  outside  Singapore

should  enjoy  the  same  citizenship  status  as   the

children  of  home  civil  service  officers  born   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider this to be a proper matter for the Ministry

concerned to look into with a view to finding out  ways

and  means  whereby foreign service officers'  children

born  outside  Singapore could, by  registration  at  a

Singapore  consulate  or embassy,  become  citizens  of

Singapore by birth rather than by descent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the deteriorating situation in Vietnam and Cambodia and

the absence of US forces in the region, particularly in

South-east  Asia, and the very recent  announcement  by

the  new  Thailand  Prime Minister-designate  that  the

25,000  US  troops  will have to  be  pulled  out  from

Thailand - all these appear to me to cause a threat  to

the  security of the countries in South-east  Asia  and

Singapore  -  would  the Acting  Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs inform this House what alternative arrangements

will  be  made to fill the vacuum, and is any  military

arrangement being considered by ASEAN to safeguard  the

security   and  political  stability  of  its   member-countries?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, whether American troops withdraw from

Thailand  or  not  is  a  matter  for  the  Thais   and

Americans. As for the conflict in Indo-China, it is  an

internal  matter for the people of these  countries  to

decide.  We  are  witnessing a civil  war  between  two

parties.  In dealing with each country, our  Government

has  consistently  adopted a policy of non-interference

and  has  recognised  the government  in  situ  as  the

government in power, irrespective of its ideology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view the security of Southeast Asia is best

ensured  by  the existence of a multi-polar balance  of

power. The presence of a number of powers including the

major  powers  will enable Singapore to  safeguard  its

sovereignty  and  independence  since  the  choice   of

alignment  with individual states on particular  issues

would  depend on the merits of each case. On the  other

hand,  single power hegemony may mean that our  freedom

of  action  could  be  limited by  the  need  to  avoid

antagonising the dominant power even when our interests

are adversely affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for ASEAN, there are no multilateral military

arrangements being considered by the member  countries.

Each  country maintains its own defence forces. ASEAN's

most  useful  role would be to serve as a catalyst  for

regional  economic integration and assist in  fostering

closer links between Southeast Asian leaders.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few days ago

our  Foreign Minister led a delegation to China. May  I

express  my  regards for a successful mission  by  this

important  delegation. May I know the purpose  of  this

trip and the benefits it will bring to Singapore? May I

also  ask  to  what  extent will  it  help  to  Improve

relations with the Republic of China, and will it  help

to establish diplomatic relations between Singapore and

China?  I  feel  this is the right  time  to  establish

diplomatic relations between the two countries. We have

been  neglecting  a  country that is  too  huge  to  be

neglected.  In  fact, it has been neglected  too  long,

just because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



a few countries in the West and maybe in the East too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago the Shah of Iran visited Singapore.

Before  that a Singapore delegation visited the  Middle

East  countries. This is a good sign. What have we done

so  far  in furthering or improving our relations  with

the Middle East countries? The Middle East counries are

now  playing  a  very crucial part in world  trade  and

world  politics.  It  is high time that  Singapore  too

played  an  important part in bettering trade relations

and  diplomatic relations with the various Middle  East

countries. We do stand to benefit a very great deal  by

establishing a close relationship with these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every year a few ASEAN training awards are given

and  a  few  of  our local personnel have been  trained

overseas. May I know how many awards have been given so

far,  and  how  it has benefited Singapore  as  far  as

foreign  policy  is  concerned?  Is  there  any  scheme

whatsoever to increase the number of training awards or

to  send our personnel on longer periods of training to

gain more experience in foreign policy, etc.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know the recent meetings of

our  ASEAN partners on the controversial issue  of  the

safe  passage  in  the  Straits of  Malacca.  What  new

formula  for the safe passage of the Straits  has  been

proposed?  How far has Singapore's trade been  affected

by   these  restrictive  regulations  which  are  being

considered?  Do we stand to gain or lose by  these  new

regulations?  Could  the  Minister  elaborate  on   the

subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if the Member for Anson wants to know

what  purpose  is  served by the trip to  the  People's

Republic  of China by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,

perhaps  he  should  wait  for  his  return.   In   the

meanwhile, I will do my best to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, this is the first visit by a Singapore

Minister to China. It has provided a useful opportunity

for an exchange of views on international,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



regional and bilateral matters. This visit has  enabled

the Minister to engage in face-to-face discussions with

members  of the Chinese Government and they  must  have

obtained a clearer understanding of Singapore.  Another

beneficial  aspect of the visit is that it has  enabled

the  two  sides to discuss ways and means of  expanding

trade with each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has stated on several occasions that we

recognise  the People's Republic of China. However,  we

shall  wait  for  our closest neighbours  to  establish

diplomatic relations before doing so. In the meanwhile,

exchanges of visits and every other form of cooperation

will  be  explored.  We  have,  in  fact,  had  several

exchanges of sports teams since Singapore responded  to

participate  in the Afro-Asian Table Tennis  Tournament

in  1971. The Chinese badminton team has been here, and

so  has  their  soccer team. Sixteen  delegations  from

professional  and business organisations  have  visited

China  since  1971 and there will be more  such  visits

this  year. Extensive trade ties exist with  China.  In

fact, China is our 12th largest trading partner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for improving relations with West Asian countries,

I  have  nothing further to add to what 1 have said  in

reply to the Member for Sembawang. As for ASEAN awards,

my  Parliamentary Secretary will give  the  Member  for

Anson more information in a little while.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Straits of Malacca, I have partly answered

the  queries  earlier  this afternoon.  But  perhaps  I

should  repeat that the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia,

Malaysia and Singapore met in Singapore in February  to

consider and agree upon measures to enhance the  safety

of  navigation in the Straits of Malacca and  Singapore

with  particular reference to the safe passage of  Very

Large  Crude  Carriers.  The meeting  did  not  discuss

matters  pertaining to the status of the  Straits,  the

three countries agreeing that the proper forum for this

question  is  the  Law of the Sea  Conference,  now  in

progress at Geneva.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the meeting, a Traffic Separation

Scheme  for  the Straits is expected to be implemented.

Experts of the three countries are studying the details

involved.  Essentially, the Scheme  demarcates  certain

areas  in the Straits for vessels in passage, with  the

objective   of   avoiding  collisions.   It   will   be

implemented in such a manner as to minimise  disruption

to  traffic  through the Straits; the  whole  objective

being  the avoidance or minimization of collisions  and

accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been recognised that owing to the depth of the

Straits  and other topographical factors,  there  is  a

limit  to the physical capacity of the Straits to carry

very large vessels exceeding a certain draught. A group

of  technical experts from the three countries has been

formed  to study the limitations that should be imposed

on  these vessels and to submit recommendations to  the

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, could I ask the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs to answer the question on ASEAN awards?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

amendment (The amendment standing in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting

reads as follows:(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced

by $10 in respect of Head AAA 4001.)  on the same subject. Could the  Member  for Anson  therefore wait until the Member for Punggol  has

spoken, when I will then deal with the whole subject?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have established quite a number of embassies

and  missions abroad since our independence. But may  I

ask whether they are sufficiently staffed? I understand

that  nearly  all  our  missions are  understaffed  and

overworked.  If that is so, can something  be  done  to

improve the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what measures our officials

abroad  are taking to attract trade, tourism and  other

economic benefits to our country? I would like to  know

the various activities that are being undertaken by all

our embassies abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 1 wonder whether the Government has any plans to

open  up  any  more new embassies abroad  in  the  near

future.  If  the answer is yes, may we know where  they

are going to be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the answer is that as Singapore is  a

small   country   with   relatively   small   financial

resources, care has to be taken to ensure that there is

full  utilisation  not  only of manpower  but  also  of

public  funds.  It has been the policy necessarily  for

our  missions  to  have  a small staff,  unlike  larger

nations  with  different  budget  priorities  who   are

willing  to  have  a large set-up.  Every  one  of  our

overseas  officers is expected to pull his  weight  and

work hard as with his counterparts in the civil service

in Singapore. Thus, while it is generally true that the

staff  in  our  missions work hard, it  would  only  be

during  periods of intense activity when  they  may  be

considered to be overworked, and this is also the  case

in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the staffing position is good, as

established  posts are filled even if this  is  at  the

expense of Headquarters. There is a constant review  of

work  of  individual  missions  and  the  staffing   is

increased   where  demand  and  priorities  make   this

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Foreign Service Scheme

proper  with  effect from 1st June, 1972, the  Ministry

has   been  actively  recruiting  its  own  staff   and

returning seconded officers who had not opted  to  join

the  Foreign Service back to their parent services.  In

Division I, because of high standards and requirements,

recruitment  levels  have not  caught  up  with  annual

expansion and the number of officers returning to their

parent  services.  In Division II,  the  percentage  of

vacancies  is  less and recruitment is done  mainly  to

meet annual expansion. Divisions III and IV continue to

be  drawn from the home civil service as these are  not

career grades in the Foreign Service. Therefore, it can

be  generally  said that the majority of  our  overseas

missions  are  not understaffed although  they  may  be

working extra hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the opening of new embassies, I mentioned

earlier  that  we intend to open two or three  in  West

Asia and there might be one or two more elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 4001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I rise merely to seek

information with regard to the number of ASEAN training

awards  given to member-countries. I would be  grateful

if  the  Hon.  Minister or his Parliamentary  Secretary

would  enlighten this House as to the  number  of  such

awards  given in the past year and at what levels,  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1971, Singapore has offered a

total of 166 ASEAN training awards in 55 courses to the

other  ASEAN  countries.  I  regret  to  say  that  the

response  to  our offers of training under  Singapore's

ASEAN Training Awards Scheme during the past four years

has  not  been  phenomenal. Fifty-six of  the  training

awards offered by Singapore were taken up by the  other

ASEAN  countries. However, I am pleased to  inform  the

House  that  as  we increase the number  of  offers  of

training the response has also been better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that by considerably in-creasing the number of

awards  and  by  giving more notice of the  awards  and

greater publicity to the offers, we may achieve  better

results.  For the financial year 1975-76,  we  will  be

offering  more than 100 training awards in 36  courses,

and  again  not  duplicating  the  fields  of  training

offered  by Singapore under the Colombo Plan so  as  to

make available a wider choice of courses.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, the courses we are offering under

Singapore's  ASEAN Training Awards Scheme  for  1975-76

cover  many  subjects  such as  public  health,  public

utilities,   engineering,  industrial  training,   port

management and laboratory techniques. These are  fields

which   Singapore   can  be  said  to   have   acquired

considerable  experience and expertise and  which  will

serve to complement the efforts of our ASEAN neighbours

in these fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also increased the attractiveness of

Singapore's  ASEAN Training Awards Scheme  by  granting

the  participants a living allowance ranging from S$400

to  S$500  a month depending on the type and  level  of

training.  Where fees are payable or books or equipment

required,  these  will  be provided  by  the  Singapore

Government. Medical and dental facilities in accordance

with current regulations will also be made available to

the trainees, if required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the total sum to be allocated for Head M in

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1003 (The  same  amendment also stood in  the  names  of Messrs P. Govindaswamy and Ivan Baptist.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 21st February, 1975, the President made

his policy speech in this House. In the Addendum on the

Ministry of Labour, it is stated that the Ministry will

amend the Employment Act to allow young persons between

14   and   16  years  of  age  to  work  in  industrial

establishments  without  the  prior  approval  of   the

Commissioner for Labour. That means they will  be  free

to    be   employed   in   commercial   or   industrial

establishments. This is a good proposal and will enable

young persons to take on some light jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past few years, we find that more and more

youths  are roaming about in the streets. It is  mainly

because  they  cannot pass the Primary  School  Leaving

Examination and therefore cannot be promoted to  higher

classes.  These  youngsters  are  not  willing  to   be

apprenticed in factories. So they while away their time

in  the streets doing nothing. This situation has given

cause for concern to the parents and has also created a

kind of social burden to our society. If this situation

is  not  remedied  by certain corrective  measures  and

allowed  to deteriorate, then in the end the number  of

delinquent   crimes  will  increase.   Therefore,   the

proposed amendment to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



the Employment Act by the Ministry of Labour will, I am

sure, meet with the general approval of the parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of young persons to enable them to

acquire  a  skill  instead  of  roaming  about  in  the

streets,  so that they can make a contribution  to  the

economic development of our country, is something  that

is  very  good because it will also help them in  their

future  life. But these youngsters are still of  tender

age  and their physique is not strong enough for  heavy

labour.   So   the  department  concerned  should   pay

attention  to  this. I would like to ask  the  Minister

concerned  what  kind of measures the  department  will

take  in  order  to  safeguard the interests  of  these

youngsters,  and  what  are the plans  to  train  these

youngsters   after  which  they  can  be  employed   in

factories  or commercial establishments so  that  their

welfare may be looked after.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the present

threats  of  retrenchment  in  Singapore,  may  I  know

whether  we are still issuing work permits to unskilled

persons  such  as  factory  hands,  domestic  servants,

drivers,  clerks, etc.? What effort is  being  made  to

reduce the number of foreigners working in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir, there is an appropriate subhead, Work Permits, and

if the Member for Anson could raise this question under

Work Permits, I would be happy to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am speaking under the subhead of the Minister for

Labour.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may carry on, Mr Govindaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, far too many companies make no effort to recruit

local  personnel or do not make sufficient  efforts  to

train  local personnel; thus ensuring security of  jobs

for  the  foreigners. What steps  are  being  taken  to

ensure  that  the  commercial  sector  recruits   local

personnel or train Singa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



poreans  sufficiently to take over the  jobs  of  these

foreigners? At a time when foreign countries are facing

periods of recession and economic depression, I do  not

see  any  reason why we should encourage foreigners  to

take the jobs of our local citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present regulation requiring non-citizens earning

less  than $750 to apply for work permits is inadequate

and  totally  out  of  proportion  to  present  working

conditions.  I feel that all non-citizens, irrespective

of  the  quantum of salary should be issued  with  work

permits,  as is being done in most countries.  $750  is

not  a  great amount or a proper gauge to draw  a  line

between  those  persons who require  work  permits  and

those who do not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a wise move to encourage the young to go to

work.  This  move will reduce the number of delinquents

roaming  the streets aimlessly. In fact, if  this  move

had been carried out earlier we would not be faced with

so  many  problems of delinquency as we are  facing  at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the daily-rated workers who have been playing a

very  important part in our development  schemes  since

the  late 40's appear to be dissatisfied with the  quan

tum  of payment due on their retirement. It is a  known

fact  that  when  they  retire, they  will  be  paid  a

gratuity  of  20  days' pay for each  year  of  service

rendered.  This was the agreement reached in  the  late

40's and there has been no change since then. With  the

present  standard of living, surely this mere 20  days'

pay for each year of service rendered is too little for

the  many years of loyal service they have rendered.  I

would suggest that the Minister review this quantum  of

payment and pay these poor workers a reasonable sum  in

order  that they can survive after their retirement.  I

have  to  mention this because I have received numerous

complaints  from daily-rated workers who  have  retired

and  have  found life very difficult.  So  I  hope  the

Minister will look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent

Committee on Crime and Delinquency has found  that  the

requirement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



in  which  young  persons seeking  employment  in

industry must obtain certificates of registration  from

the  Commissioner  for Labour has  contributed  to  the

delinquency of young school dropouts. In the  light  of

this, the Committee has recommended that the Employment

Act be amended to allow children between the ages of 14

and  16  to  seek employment in industrial undertakings

without  having to obtain the approval  of  the  Labour

Ministry.    The    Government   has   accepted    this

recommendation  and my Ministry is consequently  taking

action  to  amend  the Employment Act  to  allow  those

between  the  ages of 14 and 16 to work  in  industrial

undertakings  without  having  to  obtain   the   prior

approval of the Commissioner for Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee believes that this measure will reduce

delinquency among the young and afford opportunity  for

them  to  gain  industrial training which  will  better

equip  them for gainful employment at a later stage.  I

note  that  the Member for Sembawang also  shares  this

view.  As he may be aware, the Ministry of Labour  will

in  addition be amending the Employment Act in order to

allow children between the ages of 12 and 14 to work in

industrial  undertakings if they are  engaged  to  work

under  approved apprenticeship schemes. This  amendment

is  being  made  to enable children who are  unable  to

pursue  academic  education to take  up  apprenticeship

employment,  and  thus prevent them from  falling  into

juvenile delinquency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the Member that the Ministry will not

lose  sight  of  the need to ensure  that  the  safety,

health   and   welfare  of  these  young  workers   are

adequately  protected, when eliminating the requirement

for  young  persons  to  obtain  the  approval  of  the

Commissioner   for   Labour  to  work   in   industrial

undertakings.  The  existing  provisions  relating   to

safety,  health  and  welfare  of  the  employment   of

children and young persons as presently embodied in the

Employment  Act  will  be consolidated  and  re-enacted

under the new regulations relating to the employment of

children  and young persons, which will be  made  under

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



Employment Act.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that employers comply, provisions will be

made  in  the  regulations for heavy  penalties  to  be

imposed  on  employers  employing  children  and  young

persons  contrary to the provisions of the regulations.

It  is not practical for the Ministry of Labour to  run

any  scheme of practical training for any young persons

prior   to   allowing  them  to  work   in   industrial

undertakings.  Nor has it the resources,  manpower  and

expertise   to  undertake  such  massive   and   varied

training.  Rather, the prospective employer  should  in

his  own  interest  introduce such a  practical  scheme

relevant  to his own industrial undertaking.  I  would,

however,  like  to  point out that children  and  young

persons  can  avail themselves of the various  training

programmes and apprenticeship scheme presently  run  by

the  Industrial  Training  Board  and  other  statutory

bodies   before  taking  up  employment  in  industrial

undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has expressed concern over

foreigners  taking  on jobs in the  Republic  which  he

feels  should  be offered to our citizens.  I  wish  to

assure  him  that work permit policies  are  formulated

with  the interests of our citizens in mind and  taking

into  consideration  the manpower requirements  of  our

industries.  The Ministry will continue to  issue  work

permits  to  skilled  workers,  especially  for   those

industries  in  which the local supply is insufficient.

As for the semi-skilled or unskilled jobs, work permits

will  only be granted if the Ministry is satisfied that

these  are  jobs which Singaporeans themselves  do  not

want or if they are unavailable. The Member may wish to

know  that  foreign  workers constitute  only  a  small

proportion of the Republic's total labour force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to further reduce our reliance on foreign

labour, it is necessary for us to attract more capital-intensive  and  higher  technology  industries  and  to

develop  sufficient local skills to meet  the  manpower

requirements of industries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



In  this connection, the Industrial Training Board  has

stepped  up  its  technical courses and  apprenticeship

training scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also feels that the salary limit of $750

per month, by which non-citizens have to apply for work

permits, is inadequate and out of proportion to present

day working conditions. I do not think this ceiling  of

$750 has been overtaken by events, as it cannot be said

that  wages  for  the unskilled and  semi-skilled  have

generally gone beyond this figure. According to Central

Provident  Fund statistics, about 86% of about  622,000

employed  persons  at the end of December,  1974,  earn

less  than  $750 per month, inclusive of  overtime  and

other  allowances.  The ceiling of  $750  is  therefore

still  adequate  for  the  purpose  of  regulating  the

employment of non-citizen workers for the unskilled and

semiskilled categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the reviewing of the quantum of gratuity for

daily-rated  workers, I take it  that  the  Member  for

Anson is referring to daily-rated workers in the public

sector.  These  public  daily-rated  workers  are  well

represented by trade unions which are affiliated to the

NTUC.  Therefore, any proposed revision of the gratuity

scheme   should  be  taken  up  with  the   appropriate

authority  by the respective unions through the  normal

collective bargaining process.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has given a detailed reply, and I am

very satisfied with it. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore boasts of progressive labour laws and an

industrial  relation system that  has,  by  and  large,

brought  benefits  to  our workers.  The  beneficiaries

have, in the main, been organised workers who enjoy the

protection  of the democratic trade union movement  and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



various  benefits that the labour laws confer on  them.

But  there  is  a  large group of unorganised  contract

workers who do not enjoy any benefits. According to the

Labour Force Survey of Singapore 1974 there is a  total

of  about  42,500 persons employed in the  construction

industry alone, of whom some 34,800 or nearly 83%  earn

under  $399 per month. There is also a large number  of

contract   workers  in  the  shipbuilding   and   ship-repairing,  transport  and  other  industries.  In  the

absence  of  any  statistical  information,  the  total

number  of  contract  workers  in  all  industries   in

Singapore is not exactly known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract workers, by the nature of their work, are

termed casual or temporary workers because of the  fact

that their job is either insecure or seasonal. They are

further  not employed by the principal contractors  but

by  sub-contractors, or even sub-sub-contractors.  They

work  in  the  open - particularly in the  construction

industry  -  and  are victims of the  vagaries  of  the

weather. When it rains, for instance, they cannot  work

which means that they are not paid for the period  they

are  unable  to  work, because of circumstances  beyond

their control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, they work extremely long hours and are not

paid overtime rates, nor do they enjoy such benefits as

holidays,  rest days and annual leave. And  above  all,

whilst   other  workers  enjoy  the  benefits  of   CPF

contributions,  the contract workers  are  denied  this

benefit. Why should these workers be left high and  dry

in their old age? And why should the contractors escape

from   the  liability,  as  other  employers   do,   to

contribute  to  the  CPF? There is no  reason  why  the

actual  earnings of these workers for the  period  they

have   worked  should  not  form  the  basis   of   CPF

contributions.   If  it  is  argued  that   there   are

administrative    difficulties    and    problems    in

implementing a system to ensure this, such an  argument

is,  in my view, untenable. Surely it is not beyond our

ingenuity or the capacity of the Ministry of Labour  to

devise a scheme for the registration of all contractors

and  contract  workers  and  to  ensure  that  contract

workers are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



supplied from a registered pool of workers. This  would

facilitate   keeping  track  of  the  distribution   of

contract  workers by employers, their wages  and  their

earnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise, Sir, that contract workers comprise

a  significantly  large group of our workers  and  that

they,   through  hard  and  gruelling  work  in  trying

circumstances, contribute so much to the development of

Singapore, evidence of which can be so clearly seen  in

the modern, high-rise buildings all over Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in addition, some labour contractors, who

have on their rolls, large work forces, who have worked

for them continuously for long periods of two, three or

more  years. And yet they are called temporary  workers

and  denied the opportunities to join trade unions  and

enjoy  the  various benefits prescribed in  our  labour

laws.  And the contractors concerned get away scot-free

from their obligations. I am somewhat surprised at  the

silence of the Ministry of Labour in dealing with  such

labour contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, heartening to note that the Labour

Ministry is reorganising its conciliation machinery  by

setting  up an Industrial Relations Division to provide

conciliation  services as well as preventive  mediation

to  eliminate areas of industrial friction.  Preventive

mediation  is the corner-stone of industrial relations.

This  was  recognised in the past, but in the last  few

years  the  Labour Ministry has not given due attention

to  this  area. Far too often the emphasis has been  on

the letter of the law. I am not suggesting that the law

should  not be observed. There should not, however,  by

any  insistence  that  the legal procedures  should  be

followed  when  immediate and urgent action  should  be

taken  to  prevent  a  dispute  from  blowing  up  into

something  serious.  The NTUC and its  affiliates  have

always   recognised   the  importance   of   preventive

mediation  for industrial peace and stability  and  we,

therefore,  welcome  the Ministry's  policies  in  this

regard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of CPF contributions, I would like to

make  further observations. The Central Provident  Fund

Act  has  been  in existence for a long time,  and  the

contributors to the Fund have always been  workers  and

their employers. The time has now come to consider  the

enlargement of the scope of the Fund which has become a

major  source of savings. The savings generated by  the

scheme have both economic and social connotations which

have  brought benefits to all classes of people in  our

society and not only the workers. This being so,  I  do

not  see  why certain privileged classes of our people,

such as those who derive income from a trade, business,

profession  or  vocation, should not  contribute  their

share in boosting national savings from which they  are

all  already  accruing benefits. The Central  Provident

Fund  Act  provides  powers to  the  Minister  to  make

regulations  in  this  regard  and  I  would  ask  that

consideration    be   given   for   introducing    such

regulations.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, members of the CPF are allowed

permission  to  make use of their contribution  to  buy

Housing Board fiats. This scheme was implemented  about

two years ago. However, such members are not allowed to

make  use  of  their contribution to  purchase  private

housing   units.   Generally  speaking,   this   scheme

generally  benefits the CPF members by permitting  them

to make use in advance of whatever savings they have in

the CPF to buy Housing Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I wish to air certain views. Members

of  the CPF have deposits in the CPF belonging to  them

in  the  same  way that we have deposits in  the  bank.

Whatever  deposits have been credited in the bank,  the

depositors are at liberty to make use of whatever money

they have in the bank. But in the case of contributions

in  the CPF, although the money belongs to the members,

the  Government has imposed certain restrictions on the

use of these contributions. One restriction which has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



been  lifted  is in respect of purchase of Housing  and

Development  Board flats. But they are not  allowed  to

make  use  of  these contributions, which are  actually

their  money, to buy private housing units.  There  is,

therefore,  a  certain  amount of discrimination.  Some

members  of  the CPF may not like to buy HDB  flats  as

they  prefer  to  buy private houses in  localities  of

their own choice. Therefore, I think members of the CPF

should be given the liberty to exercise their right  on

how  to  use their money in the purchase of  houses.  I

would ask the Minister to consider giving permission to

members of the CPF to buy private houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b>

Mr  Deputy Speaker, the hon. Member for Boon  Teck  has

urged  the  Ministry to ensure that in the re-organised

set-up of the Industrial Relations Division, preventive

mediation  should play an effective role in  preventing

trade disputes. I would like to assure him that this is

what  we  intend  to  do. Emphasis will  be  placed  on

preventive   rather   than   conciliation   work.   The

Preventive  Mediation Section will seek to diffuse  and

eliminate nascent areas of friction between labour  and

management before they develop to the stage of dispute,

work stoppages or strikes. It will help both parties to

develop  a  continuing  good relationship  through  the

elimination  of disruptive practices and the  evolution

of sound in-plant policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, contract labour has been in

existence ever since immigrant labour was brought in on

a  large  scale  from China and India in  the  mid-19th

century. The development and growth of Singapore to its

present   eminence  as  the  most  developed   of   the

developing countries in Asia with the highest  GNP  per

capita outside Japan and the fourth largest port in the

world  owe  in  no  small measure  upon  the  backs  of

contract   labour.  Our  industrialisation   programme,

public  housing  and school building programmes,  would

not  have  been so successful had it not been  for  the

valuable contribution of contract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



labour.  Because  of the relatively high  productivity,

mobility  and  flexibility, contract  labour  has  been

found  to  be  invaluable especially  in  such  labour-intensive  industries as the building construction  and

shipbuilding  and  ship, repairing  industries   where

volume of work is subject to severe fluctuation thereby

making  the  maintenance of a large standing  permanent

work force uneconomic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the system of contract labour can be

abolished at our present stage of economic development.

In  fact, I notice that more and more public works  are

let  out on contract. The question is: are our contract

workers  being  ruthlessly exploited today  as  in  the

fifties or the early sixties? I do not deny that  there

may  have  been  certain instances of  exploitation  of

these  contract workers by some unscrupulous employers.

However,  I  suggest  that in  a  tight  labour  market

situation, the recent retrenchment notwithstanding,  it

is  not possible for an employer to continue exploiting

his  workers  ruthlessly and in-humanly without  losing

his  workers  to another. True, some contract  workers,

because of the casual nature of their job, may  not  be

enjoying  certain benefits such as CPF, paid  holidays,

paid  annual  leave, paid sick leave, etc. However,  it

must  also  be admitted that this takes place sometimes

with mutual consent between employer and employee.  The

Central  Provident  Fund Act lays down  explicitly  the

liabilities   of  employers  and  the  entitlement   of

employees.  The contract worker, if he  wants  to,  can

always  complain to the Ministry of non-payment of  CPF

by his employer. Very often he does not because he is a

party to this non-payment, preferring to have more take-home  pay  than  save  for his old age.  Similarly,  in

respect  of paid holidays, annual leave and  paid  sick

leave  which  are provided in the Employment  Act,  the

contract worker can always seek redress from the Labour

Ministry. The fact that this is not done is because  of

the  relatively higher pay for contract workers and the

relative  freedom of working as and when  they  please.

This, of course, does not mean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



that the Labour Ministry will not intervene on the side

of  the  contract worker especially if he is unskilled,

old and immobile and thereby being heavily exploited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last analysis, the consciousness of the workers

of  his  rights and responsibilities is crucial in  the

struggle  against exploitation, and the best  safeguard

against ruthless exploitation lies in trade unionism. I

therefore urge the unions in the NTUC to carry out more

vigorously  its  task  of  educating  the  workers   in

general,   to  heighten  their  political  and   social

consciousness and to recruit them into their  fold  for

the well-being of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Central Provident Fund was set

up  to  provide workers with benefits in their old  age

through the accumulation of compulsory savings based on

a  percentage of their wages. For obvious reasons,  the

self-employed workers and professionals have  not  been

brought within the CPF scheme. Firstly, it is difficult

to  ascertain  the monthly income of the  self-employed

worker.  Secondly, the need for compulsory savings  for

old  age  does  not arise in the case of, for  example,

self-employed  professionals who  by  virtue  of  their

relatively  higher income and education can  well  look

after  themselves.  There  may  be  a  number  of  non-employees who require old age benefits, but due to  the

nature   of  their  undertaking  in  terms  of  earning

capacity  insistence on contributions  can  reduce  the

viability   of   their  ventures,  even   though   such

contributions will be to their long term benefit. It is

therefore  not  proposed  at  present  to  bring  self-employed workers and professionals within the ambit  of

the CPF Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained just now, the Central Provident

Fund was established to provide compulsory savings  for

workers   for  their  old  age  or  when  they   become

permanently  disabled. It would  be  inconsistent  with

this  objective if members are permitted to  use  their

credit in the fund as ready sources of finance for  any

other purpose, such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



acquiring properties for investment or speculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two exceptions have been made in respect of

flats  built by the Government under its public housing

programme. Members with family incomes up to $1,500 per

month  have  been  using their  CPF  credit  under  the

approved housing scheme to acquire flats constructed by

the  Housing  and Development Board or the Jurong  Town

Corporation, while those with family incomes of  up  to

$4,000 per month will be able to utilise part of  their

credit  to  acquire middle-income fiats  built  by  the

Housing  and Urban Development Co. (Pte) Ltd.  In  both

these  instances,  the flats must be  occupied  by  the

members  and their families. The construction of  these

properties  is  not  oriented  towards  profit   on   a

commercial basis.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are provisions in both schemes for

the restoration of the members' CPF accounts should the

ownership  of  the property be changed  so  that  their

protection  against old age or permanent disability  is

still valid. These two housing schemes go a long way to

assist  the  great majority in acquiring  property  for

owner-occupation.  The  Ministry,  therefore,  has   no

intention  of allowing the use of CPF for the  purchase

of private houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the satisfactory

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ammendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> (In Mandarin): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead ACA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two questions under this

amendment.   The   first  question   relates   to   the

registration of applications for work permits.  I  have

received  many  complaints from various quarters  about

the difficulties people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



encounter  in  the  application for work  permits.  The

people  who  apply  for work permits  include  barbers,

clerks, shop assistants, drivers, waiters or waitresses

in  restaurants  and  other  catering  services.  As  I

understand it, the difficulties encountered by  barbers

had  already  been considered by the Singapore  Barbers

Association. The Association has requested the Ministry

to  relax the regulations on the issue of work  permits

in  view  of the shortage of barbers in Singapore.  The

younger  barbers have already changed jobs.  They  have

found greener pastures elsewhere. The older barbers are

dying  out.  So  it is necessary for  barber  shops  to

recruit barbers from outside Singapore, otherwise  they

will have to close shop in no time. Unfortunately,  the

Work  Permits Office does not seem to have  taken  into

account  the  difficulties encountered  by  the  barber

shops.  I  would  like to appeal  to  the  Minister  to

sympathetically  consider  the  applications  for  work

permits from barbers, so that barber shops in Singapore

will be able to solve the present shortage of barbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of applications for marriage

between  non-citizens  and citizens.  In  my  Meet-the-People  sessions,  I  receive many complaints  from  my

constituents  on  this  matter.  For  example,  a  male

citizen  came  to me one day and told me  that  he  had

applied  for  permission to marry  a  non-citizen  from

Malaysia, but  was  rejected on the  ground  that  his

fiancee  had been holding a work permit for only  three

years.  This period is two years short of the  required

period  stipulated by the Government.  I  attempted  to

persuade  him  to  wait  for  two  more  years   before

marrying. I also told him that young people should  not

marry  too  early.  I advised him to  firmly  establish

himself  first before getting married. But  he  replied

that  it  would  be impossible in his  particular  case

because he was already 31 years old and his fiancee was

26  years  old,  and that the parents of  both  parties

desired



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



them  to  marry  early.  He  also  said  he  was  quite

established, earning quite a handsome income and  would

be  able  to raise a family. He told me also  that  his

fiancee was prepared to return the work permit with the

undertaking  that she would not apply for another  work

permit.  It  was  on  this ground  that  he  asked  for

permission  to marry. But my advice to him  was  to  no

avail. I would like to appeal to the Minister to  relax

the  restriction in special cases, or even  in  general

cases, by reducing the five-year period to three years.

In  this way people in love will be able to get married

earlier,  and  our  Minister will  be  a  very  popular

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, another similar case was

brought  to my attention. The same requirement  applies

to  a  blue identity card holder, who is a non-citizen,

wanting  to  marry a citizen. In this particular  case,

although  the person i5 a non-citizen he is a permanent

resident holding a blue identity card, and he is  still

required to apply for permission. I wonder whether this

requirement is really necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not filed

an amendment on this subhead. But having listened to my

colleague,  the  Member  for Sembawang,  asking  for  a

relaxation on the issue of work permits for barbers,  I

must  say that similar complaints have been brought  to

my  attention. I feel that although some  barber  shops

are able to employ male barbers, somehow they prefer to

employ  female barbers. So there is something going  on

in  the  barber  business! I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister to pay special attention to this matter. If at

all  relaxation is to be considered, then it should  be

in  favour of male barbers rather than female  barbers.

This matter should he carefully considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, I feel that

there  is a little bit of male chauvinism in the Member

for Bras Basah.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang

wishes  to  know  whether the Ministry will  relax  its

policy with regard to the issue of work permits to shop

assistants,  clerks  and barbers.  If  the  Member  for

Sembawang is referring to those shop assistants who are

employed  in  provision  shops  and  groceries,  it  is

admitted  that  traders may be facing  difficulties  in

engaging and retaining them. The reasons are not far to

seek.  It is a fact that shop assistants have  to  work

long hours and in poor working conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the present shortage of skilled manpower in our

industries and the emphasis on skill-intensive and high-technology  industries  in our  industrial  development

strategy,  it is of vital importance that the  manpower

requirement  of  our industries should  first  be  met.

Towards this end the Government has been granting  work

permits  liberally  to  workers seeking  employment  in

factories  and  other  industrial undertakings.  Hence,

white-collar jobs and soft jobs in the service sectors,

such   as   clerks,  shop  assistants,   salesmen   and

salesgirls are given low priority. It is expected  that

this position would remain for some time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the Work Permits Office has

granted  work permits, though in a limited  number,  to

shop   assistants  and  other  white-collar   jobs   in

deserving cases. The Ministry is keeping a close  watch

over the employment situation of shop assistants and if

need  be  the  Ministry  is  prepared  to  review   the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the employment of barbers, it is a fact

that  few Singaporeans are interested in taking up such

employment. The Member for Sembawang may wish  to  know

that  my  Ministry has not been unduly  restrictive  in

granting work permits to non-citizen barbers working in

Singapore.  According to our records, there  are  about

676  non-citizen barbers on work permit at the  end  of

December  1974. However, to ensure that the  applicants

have at least the requisite skill in the occupation for

which they have applied for, work permits are only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



granted  to  those barbers who have passed a  practical

test conducted by the Adult Education Board. Since  the

implementation of this testing scheme in November  last

year,  a total of 92 applicants have been referred,  of

which  to-date 81 have passed the test and subsequently

granted work permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may perhaps recall that the

primary  objective of imposing the marriage restriction

scheme  was  to discourage workers on work permit  from

marrying early before they are fully adjusted  to  life

in  our  Republic. With effect from 1st July,  1973,  a

condition  was accordingly imposed requiring  all  work

permit   holders,  having  less  than  five  years   of

continuous employment in Singapore, to seek  the  prior

approval  of the Commissioner for Employment before  he

or  she marries a Singapore citizen. As this scheme has

only  been  implemented one and a half  years  ago,  my

Ministry  deems it a bit too premature at this juncture

to  consider  reducing the five-year qualification  for

such  cases. Perhaps I should take this opportunity  to

clarify  that the five-year work permit requirement  is

not   the   end-all  criteria  for  approving  marriage

applications. This requirement is waived in respect  of

skilled work permit holders who are in possession of an

acceptable diploma or degree or who have passed a skill

evaluation  test  conducted by the industrial  Training

Board.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These skilled work permit holders, in addition to

having  their marriage applications approved, are  also

granted three-year work permits and will be immediately

eligible for permanent residence upon completion of two

or  more  years  of  employment  in  the  Republic.  In

addition,  those  who  have satisfied  the  residential

qualification  of 10 years may be granted  citizenship.

Therefore,  it  is  open  to  those  who  desire  their

marriage  to be approved without waiting for  the  full

five  years to make every effort to improve or  upgrade

their  skills  so as to qualify for a waiving  of  this

requirement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify further. If a

citizen wants to marry a permanent resident who holds a

blue identity card, is it necessary for him to get  the

approval of the Commissioner for Employment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I do not think it is necessary to apply to the

Commissioner for Employment. But if the couple wants to

do so, I cannot help it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it is a very good reply, and I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead ADA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quantum of workmen's compensation will be

increased.  Unfortunately, too many of our workers  are

contract  workers  and many contractors  are  not  good

employers.  By this, I mean that they do not  take  out

proper  insurance policies to cover their workers,  and

in  case  of accident these workers who may be disabled

are left to their own wits and at their own expense  to

survive.  It  is high time we introduced  a  compulsory

insurance  scheme  for  all  workers,  irrespective  of

whether  they  are monthly paid, daily  paid,  contract

workers or permanent workers, so that no worker working

in Singapore will leave his family stranded if he meets

with an accident, or worse still, if he is disabled  or

die in the accident.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Sir, the Member for Anson may recall that in 1971 this

House approved amendments to the Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance,  1955. One of the major amendments  was  the

provision that required every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



employer  to compulsorily take out an insurance  policy

to  cover  all his workers. The penalty for failure  to

insure  is  a fine not exceeding $4,000 or imprisonment

for  a  term not exceeding one year, or both  fine  and

imprisonment.  The  new  Workmen's  Compensation   Bill

already  presented in Parliament retains this provision

for compulsory insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that only two

accident cases of failure of employers to insure  their

workers were reported to the Ministry in 1974, and both

were fatal cases. One of the employers, who is a small-time  sub-contractor, has agreed to pay by  instalments

the   compensation  amounting  to  $14,976.  The  other

employer  has disputed liability and the case has  been

referred  to arbitration. The Ministry is looking  into

the question of prosecution of these two employers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, since it is compulsory for employers to take out

an   insurance  policy  to  cover  their  workers,  the

Ministry of Labour should carry out checks on employers

to  see  that  they have actually taken  out  insurance

cover  for  their employers. However, I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b>

All right, Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b>

Sir,  I  would  like  to  seek clarification  from  the

Minister  concerned. I noticed from the Main  Estimates

that  in the head of expenditure Labour Ministry  there

are  two sections, namely, Industrial Relations Section

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



the Seamen's Industrial Relations Section. As far as  I

am  aware,  all industrial disputes between  management

and  labour are referred to the Ministry of Labour  for

conciliation  if  both  parties  are  unable  to  reach

agreement.  Therefore, I would  like  to  know  whether

these  two industrial relations sections are performing

identical  functions, or are they performing  different

functions?  If  they are doing different functions  why

are the names the same?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, the Member for Bras Basal: may recall that prior

to  1960  there  were  two posts,  a  Seamen's  Welfare

Officer  of  an Executive Officer grade and a  Seamen's

Industrial  Relations Officer of the same grade,  under

the charge of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In

January  1960,  the  two  posts  were  amalgamated  and

upgraded  to  HEO  (Seamen's Welfare).  This  post  was

subsequently transferred to the Ministry of  Labour  in

1961, and it has since appeared in the Estimates of the

Ministry   under  the  Seamen's  Industrial   Relations

Section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Section deals with matters relating to the

welfare  of seamen including resolving disputes between

them and their employers. Because of the different  and

multifarious  nature of the sea career,  employment  of

Singapore seamen is not governed by the Employment Act.

They  are recruited through the National Maritime Board

and  are  bound by the individual contracts of  service

made  between them and the shipping companies or  their

agents.  In  addition,  Singapore  seamen  engaged   on

Singapore-registered vessels are also  partly  governed

by   the  Merchant  Shipping  Act  which  contains  the

provision  for  the  adjudication of  disputes  by  the

Shipping  Master. Whenever there is a  complaint  of  a

breach of contract or an internal dispute, the Seamen's

Welfare  Officer is called upon to effect a settlement,

and this is often done in association with the National

Maritime Board and the Mercantile Marine Office. Apart



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



from  this,  he  assists seamen in their claim  against

their  employers  for wages and other benefits  due  to

them.  A  seaman in doubt can also seek his  advice  on

interpretation and clarification of specific terms  and

conditions of their contract with the ship owners.  The

Seamen's  Welfare Officer works in close  liaison  with

Foreign  Ministry officials to assist Singapore  seamen

in  distress while in foreign countries. If need be, he

also  refers  seamen to the Legal  Aid  Bureau  or  the

Social Welfare Department for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the nomenclature used for

the  Seamen's Industrial Relations Section tends to  be

misleading, and is often confused with the functions of

the  Industrial  Relations Section of the  Ministry  of

Labour.  It  is proposed that a review be made  on  the

role and functions of the Seamen's Industrial Relations

Section  and also its possible transfer to the National

Maritime Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps that would sufficiently answer the Member's

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in view of the satisfactory reply, I beg leave to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so moving, I have in mind the state of industrial

relations  in  the Republic for which the  Ministry  of

Labour is responsible. In my view the administration of

Industrial  Relations  in  Singapore  by  the  Ministry

leaves room for improvement. It is for this reason that

I  was happy to note in the Addendum to the President's

speech  at the opening of Parliament that the  Ministry

intended to reorganise itself and, among other  things,

set up an Industrial Relations Division with more punch

than  the  existing industrial Relations  Section.  But

after  reading  through the Budget  estimates  for  the

Ministry,  I  begin to have doubts about  the  Ministry

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the Ministry has up to now not said one

word  as  to  when  the  proposed Industrial  Relations

Division will be set up. If the Budget estimates are  a

reliable  guide, it would appear that the Ministry  has

no  intention  of  setting Lip  the  proposed  Division

during 1975. The proposed Division was, reportedly,  to

he  staffed  by  more  high  level  officers.  But  the

estimates  show that, during the financial  year  1975,

the  number of Division I posts in the Head  Office  of

the  Ministry is to be reduced from 11 to  7,  and  the

number  of  Division I posts in the existing Industrial

Relations Section remains at 2. It is only natural that

I begin to wonder where the high-level staff, necessary

to  give  added  strength to the Ministry's  Industrial

Relations Division, are to come from.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three probable explanations. One is that the

extra personnel is to

be  found at the expense of the other sections  of  the

Ministry.  The second is that there is no intention  to

set up the proposed Division in 1975. The third is that

the   decision  was  taken  too  late  for  the  Budget

estimates  to  be  revised. I personally  hope  that  a

supplementary budget appropriation later this year will

prove my third explanation to be correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, whatever the true explanation may be,

the  air  of  uncertainty over the Ministry's  proposed

Industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



Relations Division serves to confirm my dissatisfaction

with   the  Ministry  on  its  handling  of  industrial

matters.  Singapore  depends on  its  human  resources,

including labour, for survival and success. Thus  great

importance has been placed on the concept of tripartite

cooperation in Singapore. I would have thought that the

Ministry  would pay chose attention to the  supervision

of   industrial   affairs  and   would   give   careful

consideration  to  the  ways  and  means  of  improving

industrial affairs. If it is so, then it would not have

been   necessary  for  the  belated  decision  on   the

reorganisation of the Industrial Relations Section.  It

would  appear  that either the Ministry does  not  give

sufficient  thought  to  industrial  matters   or   the

officers dealing with industrial matters are lacking in

enthusiasm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House may he aware, the enactment

of   various   employment  legislation  in   1968   had

effectively removed certain industrial matters  out  of

the   scope   of  negotiation  between  employers   and

employees, and then vested these matters wholly  within

the  discretion  of  employers,  the  Minister  or  the

Industrial Arbitration Court. Now, one of these matters

is the retrenchment of employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a constituent complained to me that he was

unfairly  retrenched by a prominent hotel and that  his

trade  union  could not do anything for him  except  to

secure   his  retrenchment  benefit  which  was   quite

substantial.  He  wanted work,  not  money  payment.  I

investigated  into  the  matter  and  found  that   the

management  transferred him to another section  of  the

hotel  and he was working there for a short time  until

his  retrenchment consequent upon the closing  down  of

that section by the management. I have every reason  to

believe the employee's allegation that the transfer was

cynically effected by the management for the purpose of

retrenching him and that the management had at the same

time  engaged  new  employees for the  section  he  was

formerly   working  in.  The  retrenched  employee   in

question is healthy, able and willing to work, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



has a good work record. His only "crime" is that, after

many  years of faithful, loyal service, he has  reached

the top of his wage-scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that under the existing laws retrenchment

is  the absolute prerogative of the management. But all

the  same,  the officers of the Ministry, if they  want

to, can  bring their considerable powers of persuasion

to   bear   on  employers  who  abuse  their  statutory

privileges. This House has presumably enacted the  far-reaching  employment  legislation  in  the  belief  and

expectation  that  the civil servants  responsible  for

administering  the legislation would  see  to  it  that

erring  employers do not take unfair advantage  of  the

situation.  It  would appear now that such  belief  and

expectation  have turned to be mistaken, as  the  civil

servants in question are not able or willing to act  as

referees  and  ensure fair play between  employers  and

employees. If it is not possible for civil servants  to

be  effective  referees, then it may be  time  for  the

Ministry  to consider retransferring its quasi-judicial

function  in  industrial matters to  a  more  effective

third party such as the Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, if you remember, I welcomed

the  announcement of the Ministry of Labour, during the

debate  on  the  President's  policy  speech,  of   the

decision to set up an. Industrial Relations Division. I

then posed a number of questions and made some comments

hoping  there would be some response. As there  was  no

explanation from the Minister for Labour then,  I  have

got  to  pose  similar questions  and  make  some  more

comments hoping for clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Main nor the Development Estimates provide

for the setting up of

an  Industrial Relations Division that the Addendum  to

the President's speech mentioned. It was mentioned then

that   the  Division, would  be  set  up  to  "provide

conciliation  services as well as preventive  mediation

to eliminate areas of industrial friction".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this Division is to be set up, I welcome the

Ministry's  intention to obtain  high  level  staff.  I

would  like  to  caution  the Ministry,  however,  that

recruiting  staff for Industrial Relations Division  is

one  thing, but recruiting the right calibre of  staff,

who must not only gain the confidence of management but

also  of  labour, is necessary for the success  of  the

Division.  Gaining the confidence of one party  at  the

expense of the other is hound to fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the President's speech, I also

made   some   remarks  in  respect   of   the   special

retrenchment Unit of the Ministry of Labour [col.  96].

I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on what

I said then. To refresh his memory, I mentioned that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must in a concerted manner take steps to prevent or

minimise the impact of retrenchment. These measures are

effected  within  the framework of a rational  economic

analysis   of   the   retrenchment   situation   within

tripartite  relationship of active cooperation  between

Government,  trade unions and employers,  with  special

emphasis  placed  on  increasing  productivity  through

adoption  by management of new productivity techniques,

skill  acquisition by workers and preference  given  to

job  deployment and part-time work as against  complete

retrenchments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore employers whose industries are hit by

economic recession should be required, if necessary  by

legislation, to give the Labour Ministry and the  trade

unions  advance  notice  of any impending  retrenchment

exercise.  I  am  aware that the  Labour  Ministry  has

advised  the industries to do so. But I am doubtful  as

to  how many employers are complying with this request.

They should provide the Ministry with a list of workers

to be retrenched and the reasons for their action. This

would   enable   the  Labour  Ministry  officials,   if

necessary  with  the  help of the Economic  Development

Board, to advise them on how best to tackle the various

problems involved. This also will help the Ministry  to

monitor the labour situation.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I wish to express my support for the sentiments

expressed  by  my  colleagues, the  Members  for  Telok

Blangah  and  Aljunied,  on  the  necessity  of  having

experienced  officials  in  the  Industrial   Relations

Division  that  would  be set up  by  the  Ministry  of

Labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about retrenchment exercises, it is common

practice  among many employers to take the  opportunity

to  dispense  with  the so-called trouble  makers,  the

active  trade unionists, and so on. This tends to  sour

up  the  relationship  between the  employers  and  the

employees.  I  would suggest, in support  of  what  the

Member   for  Telok  Blangah  has  said,  that  certain

guidelines be set up for employers to follow, that  is,

whether they should retrench workers in accordance with

priorities  and  not  at  the  whims  and  fancies   of

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruitment of staff for the Industrial Relations

Division is of paramount importance to the trade  union

movement. From experience we find that whenever a trade

union and an employer fail to reach agreement over  the

negotiation  table, they have recourse to the  Ministry

of Labour, at present the Industrial Relations Section,

for  conciliation. If they do not have an officer  with

sufficient  experience and who has  the  confidence  of

employers or the trade unions, then nothing much can be

done.  As  a result, unions are forced to withdraw  the

case and take industrial action. At the same time there

are    several   instances   where   because   of   the

ineffectiveness  of  the  conciliation  officer,   both

parties,   the   employer  and  the   union,   are   so

disillusioned with the role played by the  conciliation

officer that they are reluctant to refer any more  such

cases to the Labour Ministry for conciliation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to touch on is this. As a

trade unionist it would seem to be inappropriate for me

to  speak in support of the unorganised. As we all  are

aware, there is still a large group of workers who, for

some  reason or other, through intimidation or cohesion

are  unable to organise themselves as a trade union and

are   thus   deprived   of  the  benefits   of   labour

conciliation.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to touch on is on medical

benefits   and  treatment.  Many  employers  who   have

employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



who   are  unorganised  have  taken  advantage  of  the

subsidised  medical treatment provided by the  Ministry

of  Health in the various Government outpatient clinics

or  dispensaries.  I would like to  ask  why  must  the

taxpayer subsidise the health service to the benefit of

employers  who  do not maintain a clinic or  dispensary

within  their  organisation. If the employees  of  such

employers   have  to  seek  medical  treatment   in   a

Government outpatient dispensary, they have to wait for

long  hours  before  they get any treatment.  And  upon

their   return  to  their  place  of  work,  they   are

reprimanded  by  their employers for having  taken  too

much  time  for  medical treatment.  This  category  of

workers  who,  as  I mentioned earlier  that  for  some

reason  or  other are unable to organise themselves  in

the trade unions, are at a disadvantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry should use section

118  of the Employment Act to compel such employers  to

maintain  a clinic or dispensary within their  premises

or, if this is not possible, they should employ a panel

of  doctors or medical practitioners to look after  the

health of their employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the hon. Members of Telok Blangah,

Toa  Payoh and Aljunied wish to know more about the new

Industrial  Relations Division set up in the  Ministry,

in  particular,  the recruitment of suitable  officers.

The  new Industrial Relations Division has been  formed

through  the bringing together under one administrative

control  of  three  separate  sections  of  the  Labour

Ministry, namely, the Industrial Relations, the  Labour

Court  and  the  Registry  of  Trade  Unions.  The  new

Division comprises three new key sections, namely,  the

Conciliation Section, the Preventive Mediation Section,

and  the  Registry of Trade Unions. There  is  also  an

office administration unit within the Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conciliation Section comprises two units - one for

disputes involving unionised workers, formerly known as

the Industrial Relations Section, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



other  for  disputes  involving non-unionised  workers,

formerly   known  as  the  Labour  Court.  With   their

functions   properly  streamlined,   the   quality   of

conciliation work rendered by the units should improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preventive Mediation Section is a new section of

the   Division.  It  will  be  involved  in  preventive

mediation  as  well  as  labour  assessment  work.  The

preventive mediation services to he provided will  seek

to assist labour and management to develop a continuing

harmonious   relationship   through   elimination    of

disruptive  practices and through  the  development  of

effective  policies  which foster better  understanding

and  cooperation.  This section will also  monitor  and

assess the state of labour/management relations in  the

Republic  so  that  early corrective  policies  can  be

formulated and industrial grievances resolved promptly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Industrial Relations Division, as has been

stated earlier, will be headed by a Principal Assistant

Secretary   who  will  be  assisted  by  two  Assistant

Secretaries, four Administrative Assistants, two Senior

Executive Officers, four Higher Executive Officers  and

eight Executive Officers. The Establishment Warrant for

the   new  posts  has  been  approved  by  the  Finance

Ministry, which is presently in the process of  posting

suitable staff to this new Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, there is a dearth of

Administrative   and  Executive   Officers   with   the

necessary experience in industrial relations.  However,

my  Ministry  will  do its best to  ensure  that  those

officers  sent by the Finance Ministry will  be  suited

for industrial relations work. If they are found to  be

unsuitable, and should the need arise, I am sure we can

call  on  personnel  in the NTUC  for  assistance.  The

existing  experienced staff in the former Industrial

Relations  Section, the Labour Court and  Trade  Unions

Section  are  being  retained  in  the  new  Industrial

Relations Division to provide continuity. It  is  hoped

that the mix of new Administra-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



tive  Officers and the existing staff will ensure  that

the quality of services rendered will be maintained and

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has also expressed concern

over  the  possible abuse of the right of employers  to

retrench workers. I wish to inform the Member that  the

Ministry  is  monitoring  the  retrenchment  situation.

Labour officers are being deployed to keep a close  tab

on  the  reasons  offered by employers for  retrenching

workers. The services of the Economic Development Board

are  also  called  in  to  assess  the  health  of  the

particular  company  concerned so  as  to  ensure  that

employers  are  retrenching workers  because  they  are

genuinely  affected by the current economic  situation.

Further, the Ministry has made known to employers  that

they  should explore all other means of resolving their

temporary difficulties, such as reduction in the number

of  shifts,  shorter  working week or  shorter  working

hours,  and that a retrenchment exercise would only  be

embarked upon as a last resort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, employers have been cooperating with the

Ministry.  Cases of abuse of the right to retrench  are

an exception rather than the rule. If however, there is

abuse of this right, the worker or his union can always

complain  to  the  Ministry  and  the  matter  will  be

investigated into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member might like to know that the present

employment  situation is not as bad as  in  some  other

countries,  given the present world economic situation.

Our  unemployment rate stands at 4.5% in February 1975.

The  monthly  retrenchment rate has  declined  from  an

average  of  2,927 workers in the last five  months  of

1974 to an average of 1,476 in the first two months  of

1975.  Major  industrial  countries  are  expected   to

experience  an  economic upturn in the second  half  of

this  year.  We  are  expected to feel  the  beneficial

effects in the latter part of 1975 or early 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, the Ministry is of the view that there is no need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



amend the Industrial Relations Act to make retrenchment

issues negotiable again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has just mentioned

that there is a dearth of experienced officers. What  I

would like to clarify is this. It is rather odd that in

the  past  the Ministry of Labour sent several officers

overseas for training iii industrial relations, and  on

their  return  these officers were posted elsewhere.  I

believe the hon. Member for Aljunied is one of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad that the Member for Toa

Payoh  has raised this question. I will certainly  look

into  the possibility of re-posting such officers  back

into the Labour Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, will this new Division,

comprising  an  amalgamation  of  three  old  Sections,

ensure  that  employers do not seek to take  industrial

relations  out  of the field of human  relations?  This

tendency    is    detrimental   to    worker-management

cooperation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I do not think that situation will arise. If there

should  be such a tendency, then we will take steps  to

rectify it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AHA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asbestosis, a form of fibrosis of the lung, is

normally due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres  and,

consequently,  any process which gives  rise  to  large

amounts  of  asbestos  dust  may  constitute  a  health

hazard.  Much  asbestos  is  being  used  in  industry,

especially  in the ship-building, building construction

and  pipe-making  sectors. With the increase  of  these

indus-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



tries in Singapore, much more will be used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why asbestos is used stems from its

relative   cheapness  and  its  properties,   such   as

resistance to abrasion and heat, its fibrous nature and

large  surface  area.  Its high  tensile  strength  and

flexibility, on account of the extremely small ultimate

diameter  of  the fibres, gives it properties  not  yet

achieved  by  any  man-made fibres at comparable  cost.

That  asbestos  is  used in industry because  of  these

reasons  and  that large amounts of asbestos  dust  may

constitute a health hazard are reasons enough  for  the

Industrial   Health  Unit  to  be  ever-vigilant   when

inspecting plants using asbestos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am anxious to know whether the incidence of

asbestosis,  a compensable disease under the  Workmen's

Compensation  Act, is on the increase in Singapore  due

to  its  ever-increasing use in Singapore.  I  am  also

anxious  to know what measures are being taken  by  the

Industrial   Health   Unit  to  ensure   limiting   the

possibility   of  workers  contracting  asbestosis   in

industry.





<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

take  this opportunity to speak on industrial accidents

in  Singapore. Sir, industrialisation in Singapore  has

been   very   successful  over  the  past  few   years,

particularly in the field of shipbuilding and  building

construction. As a result of this, industrial accidents

have been increasing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member wants to speak on industrial

accidents,  perhaps the more appropriate subhead  would

be the next subhead, "Factory Inspectorate".



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think we have just heard a

very succinct account by the Member for Potong Pasir of

the  causes  or  the  ingredients  that  can  lead   to

asbestosis. From what I am going to say I think he  can

be  rest assured that asbestosis is not on the increase

at this stage of our industrial development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will recall that since  asbestosis  was

first  listed as a notifiable industrial disease  under

the Sixth Schedule to the Factories Act, 1973, only two

cases  of  asbestosis were notified and confirmed.  Two

other  suspected  cases  are being  followed  up.  More

recently, from November 1974 to February this  year,  a

medical survey was conducted in the shipyards. Out of a

sample examination of 216 workers exposed to asbestosis

hazards,  only  one  person  was  suspected   to   have

asbestosis. From the medical evidence so far available,

it   can  be  safely  stated  that  the  incidence   of

asbestosis  in Singapore is low. However, this  may  be

due  to  the  fact  that  asbestosis,  like  silicosis,

requires a fairly long period of exposure, say five  to

ten years before definite medical evidence appears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has taken a number of tests to prevent

the  occurrence of such a disease. Factories  known  to

have  a  risk  of  asbestosis  are  required  to  adopt

environmental   control   and   medical    surveillance

measures. In the case of factories with a dust  hazard,

they  are  required to introduce dust control measures.

All  workers exposed to dust are required  to  have  an

annual  X-ray. Proper respirators must be supplied  and

worn  by workers during their work. Checks made by  the

Ministry  revealed  that  the working  environment  has

improved greatly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, from that very reassuring reply by the Hon.

Minister  of State for Labour, I beg leave to  withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AlA 1109*

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ivan Batpist).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we take pride in the fact that we are an

industrialised  nation. However, I am afraid  to  state

that  we  are  quite backward in the implementation  of

safety measures for factories. Our Factory Inspectorate

is  so  small  that  an  industrialist  can  engage  in

malpractices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



in  his premises for years if he wishes, simply because

he  knows that no inspector will bother him. Why can we

not  enlarge  the Factory Inspectorate and introduce  a

service charge, if necessary, for each factory so  that

the cost of the increase in staff will not be borne  by

the taxpayer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Part VII of the

Factories  Act,  1973  (No. 6  of  1973),  section  64,

empowers  the  Minister to make  it  mandatory  for  an

occupier  of a factory to employ a competent person  to

act as a safety officer in a factory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential for some factories to have safety

officers  because  numerous health and  safety  hazards

have  to  be spotted and controlled. In addition,  this

move could most certainly limit the number of accidents

in  industry. I am wondering why the Hon. Minister  has

not  utilised  the proviso in this section  since  this

legislation came into force in 1973? Why has  the  Hon.

Minister  not  considered it  necessary  to  make  this

recruitment  of  safety  officers  mandatory  in   some

accident-prone industries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this section enables the Minister to

stipulate  the qualification and training  requirements

of safety officers. There are many safety officers who,

through  no  fault of their own, arc not qualified  and

trained  enough to be of effective use in the promotion

and  assurance  of safety and health in industry.  This

necessitates the stipulation of their qualification and

training  before  they  are recruited  by  industry  as

safety  officers.  Why has the Hon. Minister,  to-date,

not  stipulated such qualifications and /  or  training

requirements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 65 of the same Act requires safety committees

to be set up in factories employing 50 or more persons.

These committees are to be represented by employees and

management. The functions of such committees  are  also

clearly  spelt out in this section. Records in relation

to  the  work  of such safety committees, like  factory

inspections, for example, are required to be kept in  a

register.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into any details with regard to the

importance of safety committees and their work. Let the

fact   that  it  is  a  requirement  under  legislation

suffice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to know whether the Ministry of

Labour is monitoring the work of such safety committees

to ensure that they exist not only in name. As far as I

am  aware,  no  safety  committee registers  have  been

looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this state of affairs going to continue any longer?

It  will be close to two years soon since the enactment

of the Factories Act, 1973.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, following our success in

industrialisation, particularly the  rapid  development

of   the   shipbuilding   and   building   construction

industries,   there  has  been  a  sharp  increase   in

industrial accidents. As a result many skilled  workers

have lost their lives, thus causing a great loss of our

manpower.  This  has  caused a loss  not  only  to  our

economy but also a hardship to the bereaved families of

the workers concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the problem of industrial

accidents has engaged the attention of many Members  of

this  House.  My colleagues have repeatedly  asked  the

Minister  concerned to take steps to prevent industrial

accidents. But unfortunately, Sir, day after day,  year

after  year, nothing seems to have been done to improve

the  situation.  On the contrary, the  whole  situation

seems  to  have  deteriorated. For example,  last  year

there  was  a  very  serious explosion  at  the  Jurong

Shipyard  resulting in the loss of 13  lives.  This  is

just  one  very  clear example of the  gravity  of  the

situation. I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister

concerned   whether  any  effective  steps  are   being

contemplated  to  prevent industrial accidents  and  to

provide safer working environment for our workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year we heard that because of a shortage of

Factory  Inspectors it was not possible  to  carry  out

more frequent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



inspections in the factories. One year has  elapsed.  I

wonder  whether  the problem of manpower  shortage  has

been  solved,  and whether the Ministry  concerned  has

recruited  more Factory Inspectors. If after the  lapse

of  one year the number of Factory Inspectors is  still

the  same,  then the manpower shortage in  the  Factory

Inspectorate  will  be  even  more  serious  with   the

increasing  number  of  factories.  It  will  then   be

impossible to carry out checks. I have listened to  the

Member for Potong Pasir who raised similar problems. He

has  said that although there are mandatory provisions,

these have not been enforced even up to this day.  This

is rather surprising.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b>

Sir,  the  Member  for  Potong Pasir  has  raised  some

questions  relating  to  safety committees  and  safety

officers. I wish to state that a very comprehensive set

of  regulations governing the duties and appointment of

safety   officers   has   already   been   drafted.   A

notification governing the qualifications and  training

of  safety officers has also been drafted. This set  of

regulations  and notification will be  enacted  in  the

very near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry has been

keeping  a  close watch on the effectiveness of  safety

committees.  This  is done in two  ways.  Firstly, the

Inspectorate requires occupiers of factories that  have

to  form  safety  committees to submit  the  names  and

particulars of the chairman, secretary and  members  of

the   safety  committee.  Secondly,  Inspectors   check

documents  such  as the minutes of meetings  of  safety

committees and the Factory Inspector's reports  of  the

safety   committees  during  their  routine  visit   to

factories. Feedback information on the effectiveness of

the  safety  committees  has been  received.  They  are

largely  obtained during inspection visits to factories

made  by  the  Inspectors. It is hoped  that  when  the

regulations  governing the duties  and  appointment  of

safety  officers  have been enacted, a  greater  effort

will   be  made  in  ensuring  safety  in  the  various

establishments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern of the Member for Anson was that non-compliance with the safety regulations by employers has

been  allowed to remain undetected for long periods  of

time   because  of  the  small  staff  in  the  Factory

Inspectorate.  The  technical  wing  of   the   Factory

Inspectorate has a staff of 39 officers comprising  the

Chief   Inspector  of  Factories,  the   Deputy   Chief

Inspector  of  Factories,  two  Senior  Inspectors   of

Factories,  nine  Inspectors of Factories,  two  Senior

Technical  Officers, eight Technical  Officers  and  16

Technicians. Although the technical staff is small  and

inadequate   to   cope  with  the   volume   of   work,

nevertheless the Factory Inspectorate has made and will

continue  to make every effort to ensure that employers

observe the safety regulations in their factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate carried out a total of 7,597

inspections   and  follow-up  visits   on   the   5,067

registered factories, and 3,063 items on non-compliance

were  notified  to  the occupiers  in  1974.  It  seems

unlikely  that  the  factory occupiers  can  engage  in

malpractice  for any long period of time without  being

discovered, for factories are generally visited once  a

year.  Notwithstanding this, I share the  view  of  the

Members for Anson and Sembawang that there is still  an

urgent  need  to  further increase  the  staff  of  the

Factory  Inspectorate.  The  Ministry  has,  in   fact,

planned to expand the Factory lnspectorate, and it will

take the matter up with the appropriate authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has suggested the introduction of

a  service charge for services performed. I would  like

to  point  out  that the main function of  the  Factory

Inspectorate  is to ensure that employers  comply  with

safety  and health standards laid down in the Factories

Act.  It would therefore not be appropriate to  levy  a

service  charge for this. However, the Member may  like

to  know that the Inspectorate does charge a fee of  up

to $30 for the registration of factories and the annual

renewal of their registration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share with the Member for Sembawang his concern

about   the   high   rate   of  industrial   accidents.

Industrialisation  has  brought  about  a   concomitant

increase  in  the rate of industrial accidents  in  the

Republic. The rate of accidents has been the highest in

the  construction industry and in the shipbuilding  and

ship-repairing industry. My Ministry has already  taken

a  number of measures to bring about a reduction in the

rate of industrial accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the existing legislation will be amended to

provide  for heavier penalties for those who contravene

safety  and health standards. New regulations  will  be

introduced  under the Factories Act providing  for  the

composition  and conduct of safety committees  and  the

qualifications,  registration  and  duties  of   safety

officers,  as  stated  earlier. Secondly,  the  Factory

Inspectorate  has been expanded and training  of  staff

pursued.  The Ministry has also begun the  training  of

safety  officers  for industry. Thirdly,  a  bi-monthly

newsletter called The New Worker was started in  August

1973  to  promote  safety  and health  awareness  among

workers   and  management.  The  publication   is   now

published  monthly.  Another  publication  A  Guide  to

Safety,  Health and Welfare for Factories has  gone  to

print and will be distributed to factories later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry is paying special attention

to  the construction industry and the shipbuilding  and

ship-repairing industry which have the highest rate  of

accidents.  The  Ministry has a special  unit  to  look

after   the   problems  of  safety  in   the   building

construction  industry.  In  addition,  in   1973   the

Ministry  set  up  the  Building  Construction   Safety

Committee  to  advise on measures to curb accidents  in

the   construction  industry.  This   Committee   which

comprises  representatives from Government departments,

statutory   boards,   contractors'   associations   and

professional  bodies  is making  continuous  review  of

safety  problems  in  the  construction  industry.  The

Ministry is taking more stringent action on work  sites

which are found to be unsafe, Work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



sites  which  have serious unsafe conditions  will  be

ordered  to  stop work for rectification of the  unsafe

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may be aware that my Ministry

has  also  published a Code of Practice on  Safety  and

health  at  construction work sites and a pictorial  of

dos  and  don'ts,  a Safety and Health  Guide  booklet.

These  publications are distributed free of  charge  to

all concerned in the construction industry. As a result

of  these  measures,  fatalities  in  the  construction

industry  declined from 41 in 1973 to  35  in  1974,  a

reduction  of 15%, whilst the total number of accidents

declined  from 487 in 1973 to 448 in 1974, a  reduction

of 9%. Amputation cases registered a drop of 75%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special unit was set up within the Factory

Inspectorate  of the Ministry in January this  year  to

specially  look into the safety and health measures  of

the shipbuilding and shiprepairing industry. Soon after

its   formation,  the  unit  immediately  launched   an

intensive  inspection programme covering shipyards.  As

early  as  March 1973, the Ministry appointed  a  study

group  on  accident prevention in the shipbuilding  and

ship-repairing industry to make an in-depth study  into

the causes and nature of accidents in this industry and

to  recommend  preventive and remedial measures.  After

two  years  of  exhaustive study and deliberation,  the

study  group completed its report and presented  it  to

the  Ministry on 15th March, 1975. The Ministry is  now

studying  the recommendations of the study  group.  The

report  of the study group runs into 70() pages and  it

is bound into four volumes. I invite interested Members

to  make  a  study  of the report  and  give  me  their

suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, industrial accident prevention is a

tripartite  affair that calls for the concerted  effort

of   labour,   management  and   the   Government.   If

cooperation is forthcoming from workers and management,

one  can  hope  to  see  a reduction  in  the  rate  of

industrial accidents in our factories.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am most grateful and thankful to the Minister

for  giving  me this very useful information  that  the

regulations  are  nearly ready and will  be  introduced

soon. But what I am interested to know is how soon will

they  be introduced. In addition, I would like to refer

the  Hon.  Minister  to my debate  on  the  President's

Address in which 1 stated that the Ministry should look

into  this  business of greater regulation  or  greater

self-regulation,  and  I quoted  the  examples  of  the

United States of America and the United Kingdom. It  is

important  for  us to realise that we  need  tripartite

cooperation.  It  will also be essential  that  greater

self-regulation be introduced into health and safety at

work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, as I have said, the regulations have been drafted

and,  as  soon  as  vetting is completed,  it  will  be

published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, the Minister has just said that if the

contractors  or  the  industries fail  to  comply  with

certain safety measures, the' will be required to cease

operations. During the period of cessation, I think  an

added penalty should be imposed on these employers, and

the employees should be paid for the duration that they

are asked to stop work, until such time as the Ministry

is satisfied that adequate safety measures are provided

for.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I have noted the point and will

take that into consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has given a very long explanation,

and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AKA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of the current recession many

industries  have to retrench their employees  in  large

numbers. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



fortunate  for us that many of these workers  who  lost

their jobs are not the main breadwinners. Most of  them

arc  girls  or women. In fact, few took the trouble  to

register themselves at the Employment Exchange for  new

jobs.  Even  in my Meet-the-People sessions,  barely  a

handful  come to look for jobs. We should  commend  the

Employment  Service for having performed a  magnificent

job  in  registering and finding alternative employment

for the jobless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during this period of recession more

employers will take the opportunity to get rid  of  the

middle-aged and white collar workers. With the increase

in  road  tax and other disincentives to potential  car

ownership,  two large motor dealer firms  have  already

taken  steps to retrench as much as 25% of their staff,

mainly sales and white collar workers. These categories

of   workers  will  have  more  difficulty  in  finding

alternative employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Employment Service has no mandatory

power to direct employers to recruit workers from  this

Service.  Although  unemployment  has  not  reached   a

serious  level,  we should now take remedial  steps.  I

suggest that the Ministry should put into operation the

provision   of  section  111  of  the  Employment   Act

requiring  all  employers to recruit workers  from  the

Employment Service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, it is precisely for the reasons

enumerated by the Member for Toa Payoh that we  do  not

consider it necessary at present to invoke section  111

(b).  As  mentioned by the Minister for Labour  earlier

on,  the  unemployment rate stands at 4.5% in  February

this  year. The monthly retrenchment rate has  declined

from  an  average  of 2,927 workers in  the  last  five

months of 1974 to an average of 1,476 in the first  two

months  of  this year. Major industrial  countries  are

expected  to  experience an economic up, turn  in  the

second  half of this year. We are expected to feel  the

beneficial effects in the latter part of this  year  or

early



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



next  year.  So the Ministry is, therefore,  continuing

with the present system of generally allowing employees

and  employers to choose their own methods  of  looking

for jobs or workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, surely the Minister of State realises that, as we

all know, there will be more retrenchment exercises.  I

would  say  that  by enforcing this  provision  of  the

Employment  Act, it will at least caution employers  to

be more careful in retrenching workers. In other words,

if  they retrench the workers they may end up later  by

having  to  recruit  the  same workers  back  from  the

Employment Service. This provision will act as  a  sort

of  deterrent  to employers who have any  intention  of

retrenching staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I think the Minister for Labour has earlier on

touched  on this question of retrenchment.  We  do  not

feel that it is necessary to do more than what is being

done  at  this moment, because we do not want  to  rush

into something which is not really necessary. As I have

said, we are expecting the situation to improve as  the

days go by.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I am not at all very happy with the reply, but

anyway I wish to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr J. F.

Conceicao:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) That the sum to be allocated for Head N be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead ABA 2620.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,037,160 for Head N ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,307,000 for Head N ordered to stand part

of the Development Estimates.





<br><br>7.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since it is only a few minutes to the Moment of

Interruption I would suggest that,

with Members' general assent, I invite the Minister

report progress and to move the adjournment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of

the Committee and look the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the Committee of

Supply has made further progress on the Main  and

Development Estimates for the financial year  1st

April, 1975 to 31st March, 1976, and ask leave to

sit again tomorrow.
