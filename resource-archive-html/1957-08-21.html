August,  1957,  states that, in accordance  with  the

provisions of section 62 (2) of the Singapore  Colony

assented to the following Bills:-

him to do so, His Excellency had that day assented to

the   following   Bill  which  was  passed   by   the

Legislative Assembly on 26th April, 1957:

deletion   of   paragraph  30  regarding   subversive

elements  as contained in the Report of the Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London in March and

April 1957 (Sessional Paper No. Misc. 2 of 1957).

Government of the Federation of Malaya concerning-

income tax; and

Singapore after 31st August, 1957;

(a)  (ii),  Yes,  Sir; and (a) (iii),  Yes,  Sir, In

answer to (b), as the matters discussed have not been

finalised and have reached a delicate stage, I do not

consider it in the best interests to make a statement

at  the  present  time. In answer to  (c),  the  hon.

we  are  protecting the interests of the citizens  of

Singapore.

will   make   a   statement  regarding   his   recent

discussions with the Chief Minister of the Federation

of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (The Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my recent

discussions with the Chief Minister of the Federation

of Malaya were of an informal character on matters of

a  pan-Malayan nature. These discussions  enabled  me

and  my  colleagues to have a better appreciation  of

the problems that confront us.

<div align="center"><b>TRAVEL BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND FEDERATION OF MALAYA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>- CONCERN OVER PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  he is aware of the concern among the  public

of  Singapore  over the restrictions proposed  to  be

imposed on travellers between Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>



and the Federation of Malaya after 31st August, 1957;

and whether he will make a statement on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (The Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware of

the  concern and I have received an assurance from the

Chief  Minister of the Federation of Malaya  that  his

Government  will hold discussions with this Government

in  regard  to  the  proposals before  the  Federation

Government takes any step in the matter.

<div align="center"><b>APPOINTMENTS TO SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND RESTRICTION OF PRIVILEGE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary if he

is  aware  that only Federal citizens are eligible  to

apply  for Government or quasi-Government appointments

in  the Federation of Malaya; and whether he will take

steps  to  ensure that only persons born in  Singapore

are   eligible   for  appointment  to  the   Singapore

Government  service, and that this  privilege  is  not

extended to persons born in the Federation of  Malaya,

North Borneo or Brunei.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, the Federation of Malaya

regulations  do not entirely exclude from  appointment

in  the  Federation  applicants who  are  not  Federal

citizens. The position as I understand it is that such

persons  may  be  appointed if there are  no  suitable

Federal  citizens  obtainable and  a  particular  post

cannot be left vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is,

not at present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FILLING OF POST OF SPECIAL GRADE MIDWIFE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Chief Secretary why

the  post  of Special Grade midwife which has appeared

in the Estimates yearly since 1949 has not as yet been

substantively filled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> This post has not been filled, Sir,

because  there  has been no midwife at Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital  with the qualifying experience  required  to

fill the post.

<div align="center"><b>COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE POLICE FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ASSAULT AND DOMINEERING ATTITUDE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether he is aware that complaints have been made  by

some suspects, when taken to the Police Stations, that

they  have  been assaulted by members  of  the  Police

Force  and  that  the conduct and  behaviour  of  some

members  of the Force, particularly the recruits,  are

very  domineering; and what action does he propose  to

take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Yes, Sir, I am aware that such complaints

are  frequently  made, particularly in secret  society

cases.  Although the conduct of individual members  of

the Police force may not always be beyond reproach,  I

do  not  accept any general imputation against members

of the force nor against recruits in particular. Every

such  complaint  is  reported to the  Commissioner  of

Police  and  an  immediate enquiry  is  made  and  the

findings  are  reported  to  the  Commissioner.  I  am

satisfied that adequate steps are taken to investigate

complaints  and  to  take  disciplinary  action  where

justified.

<div align="center"><b>NUMBER OF BUSINESS VISITORS SERVED WITH INCOME TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>NOTICES AND NUMBER WHO PAID TAX</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Financial Secretary



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many business visitors staying a maximum

of seven days in Singapore were served with income

tax assessment notices during the first half of  1957; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) .how many of such persons paid income tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, separate lists are not kept of

assessments raised in respect of business visitors and

the  information  requested  by  the  hon.  Member  is

therefore not available at the present time. In  order

to  obtain it, it will be necessary to examine all the

assessments raised during the first half of 1957. This

can be done, but it will mean that staff will have  to

be taken away from the more important task of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2477</b></font><br><br>



raising assessments and collecting tax. No doubt  the

hon.  Member  will  take this fact  into  account  in

deciding  whether  or not to press  his  request  for

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, having

regard to the powers vested in the Comptroller  under

section  93  of the Ordinance, it is improbable  that

any of the business visitors to whom the hon. Members

refers left the colony without paying tax.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2477</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REASONS FOR SERVING INCOME TAX NOTICES ON BUSINESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>VISITORS, AND GOVERNMENT'S POLICY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Financial Secretary the

reasons why business visitors to Singapore are served

with  income tax assessment notices under section  12

(4)  of  the Income Tax Ordinance (Cap. 166), instead

of  being exempted under section 13 (3) ; whether such

notices  are  served  on members  of  official  trade

missions  to this country; and whether he will  state

the Government policy on this whole matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, business visitors to Singapore who

exercise  their employment in the colony  are  served

with  income tax assessment notices because  the  law

prescribes that this shall be done. Section 10 (1) of

the Ordinance prescribes that tax shall be payable on

income derived from the colony in respect of gains or

profits  from any employment. Section 10 (2)  defines

gains or profits from any employment. Section 12  (4)

prescribes  that gains or profits from any employment

exercised in the colony shall be deemed to be derived

from  the  colony whether the gains or  profits  from

such  employment are received in the colony  or  not.

They cannot be exempted under section 13 (3) for  the

simple reason that this particular section refers  to

income  arising from sources outside the  colony  and

received in the colony by temporary visitors, and not

to the exemption of these visitors from tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of official trade missions a reserved with

notices if the Comptroller is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>



satisfied  on enquiry that they are exercising  their

employment during their visit to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy in this matter has recently been under

review.  It has been noted that other countries  with

which Singapore has trade relations are perhaps  more

liberal  in  their treatment of visiting businessmen.

Some countries allow a period which may in some cases

amount to a month or two to lapse before such persons

become  liable  to  tax on the gains  or  profits  of

employment  exercised  in  these  countries.  It   is

generally    agreed   that,   in    the    particular

circumstances   of   Singapore   as   a   centre   of

communications  and trade, it would be  desirable  to

liberalise  existing policy to a certain  extent.  It

has  therefore been decided to submit the  matter  to

the  Malayan  Board  of Income Tax for  consideration

under  section  3  (5)  of  the  Ordinance.  In   the

meantime, as a temporary measure which will, I  hope,

have  the  approval  of hon. Members,  administrative

instructions  have been given with  effect  from  1st

August  that visiting businessmen who exercise  their

employment  in  Singapore will  not  be  served  with

notices  of assessment until they stay in the  colony

for more than one month.

<div align="center"><b>BILL TO ENABLE FEDERATION CUSTOMS OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO BOARD TRAINS IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Financial Secretary when

the  Bill will be introduced to enable Federation  of

Malaya  customs  officers  to  board  trains  at  the

Singapore   Railway   Station   and   make    customs

examinations en route to Johore Bahru.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, in reply to a question from the hon.

Member  in November of last year, I said that it  had

already  been  agreed  in principle  that  Federation

customs officers should board trains in Singapore and

make  customs examinations en route to Johore  Bahru,

and  that a Bill authorising this to be done  was  in

draft.  The  Bill  in question is a revision  of  the

Federated   Malay  States  Customs  Duty   Collection

Ordinance (Cap. 232 in the old edition of the  laws),

and  deals with other matters besides the examination

of passengers' goods on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2479</b></font><br><br>



trains between Singapore and Johore Bahru. This  Bill

was ready for presentation to the two Legislatures in

January  1957 but it was withdrawn by the  Federation

Government in February so that further amendments  to

the  law could be considered. A redraft was ready  in

mid-April   but  it  had  to  be  examined   by   the

Departments  concerned in Singapore and by  the  Hon.

the  Attorney-General in the light of further changes

suggested.  The  present  position  is  that  we  are

awaiting the comments of the Federation Government on

a  point  raised by the Supervisor of Export  Duties,

Federation  Customs Department, in  Singapore.  I  am

confident,  however, that this point will be  settled

readily  and that the Bill will be presented  in  the

very near future.

Local Government, Lands and Housing



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether any houses or housing units and if so,

how many, were completed by the Singapore Improvement

Trust  during the period from January to  June  1957;

been allotted up to 31st July, 1957.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  answer  to  question (a) is that  no  houses  or

housing  units were completed. I am informed  by  the

Trust the reason why no houses or housing units  were

completed during the first half of 1957 is that there

were  no  available vacant sites during a  period  in

1956 which would have allowed for completion in 1957.

I  am further informed, Sir, that on 31st July, 1957,

over  4,000  units of housing accommodation  were  in

course of construction and contracts had been let out

for a further 1,000 units of accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to question (b) follows from my answer to

(a) - that  as  no  housing units  were  completed,  no

houses were allotted.

six-month periods ending June and December 1955, June

and  December 1956, and June 1957, and the number  of

applicants for accommodation on the waiting  list  at

the end of each period.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

as  follows. For the half year ending June 1955,  the

number  of housing units completed was 1,000 and  the

number  of  applicants on the  waiting  list  of  the

Housing Register was 9,571. For the half year  ending

December  1955, the number of housing units completed

was 1,795 and the number of applicants on the waiting

list  was 7,823. For the half year ending June  1956,

1,025 housing units were completed

were completed and there were 9,836 applicants on the

waiting list. For the half year ending June 1957,  no

housing  units  were  completed  and  the  number  of

applicants  on the waiting list was 11,547.  In  this

connection, Sir, I have stated in my reply earlier to

would  draw  the  hon.  Member's  attention  to   the

provisions  of  the Control of Rent  Ordinance  (Cap.

242),   particularly  section  15  (1)   (g),   which

prohibits a chief tenant from receiving for the whole

of  any  sublet  premises, including the  apportioned

rental  or value of any part of the premises retained

by  him,  more than 110 per cent of the  rent  he  is

paying to the landlord. In other words, where a chief

tenant pays his landlord a rent of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2482</b></font><br><br>



$100 per mensem, he is allowed under the Ordinance to

collect  for  all  the  parts  sublet  and  the  part

retained  by  him a total rent not exceeding  $110  a

month  excluding municipal charges.  If  he  collects

more  than this, a sub-tenant can apply to  the  Rent

Conciliation  Board  set up under  the  Ordinance  to

apportion  the rent amongst themselves or to  recover

any excess paid over the legal rent due.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, perhaps the hon. Member has

failed  to  realise that our imports of rice  do  not

pass through the Suez Canal, and only a minor portion

of our sugar imports pass through the Suez Canal. The

closing  or reopening of the Suez Canal has therefore

had only a negligible direct effect on the prices  of

rice  and  sugar. The prices of these commodities  in

Singapore are governed by world supply and demand. In

these   circumstances,  therefore,   no   action   is

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In further amplification of my reply, Sir, I may

perhaps with profit refer the hon. Member to  a  news

item  appearing  in today's Straits Times  under  the

heading, "Bangkok Clamp May Send Rice Price  Up".  It

states  in  the news item that there is a possibility

of  export restrictions in Bangkok which might  cause

prices to rise in Singapore and the Federation.

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 29 of 1957)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Financial Secretary)</b></div>



<br><br>10.22 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I beg

leave to refer to Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 29 of 1957

which  has been tabled today and to make some remarks

in explanation of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual estimates which form an appendix to the

Appropriation  Ordinance indicate in detail  how  the

funds made available each year should be spent. These

estimates,  however, have been drawn up in  the  year

previous  to  that  to which they refer.  It  is  not

always  possible  to say with complete  accuracy  how

much  will have to be spent in the following year  on

the  services for which provision is made or what new

needs will arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, when the need to provide

for  some new service arises, an application is  made

for  a supplementary vote. Similarly, where there has

been  some  radical  change in a  service  for  which

provision has already been made and additional  funds

are  required, an application for supplementary  vote

is  made.  These  applications  are  incorporated  in

messages  which  are presented to the  Assembly  from

time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a number of occasions when the

need   arises  to  supplement  a  service  for  which

provision  has  already  been  made  but  where   the

additional sum required is small; for example, a rise

in the price of printing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>



machines   due  to  circumstances  in  the  supplying

country  may necessitate a supplement; freight  rates

may  be  increased  as a result of  an  international

crisis and prices may rise generally on goods ordered

from  overseas;  and so on. In no  case  is  any  new

principle  involved, nor has there been any  material

change  in the service for which provision  has  been

made in the estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an established principle in financial

procedure  of  the United Kingdom that the  Executive

should  have power to transfer funds from one service

to  another  provided no new or  novel  principia  is

involved and the sum voted under a particular head of

expenditure is not exceeded. This power of  virement,

as  it  is called, has been incorporated to a limited

degree in the financial procedure of this Colony, and

General  Orders  of  the Government prescribe - General

Order 662(b) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the provision under one sub-head appears to

be  likely  to be exceeded in any year, savings  from

another  sub-head  within the  same  sub-division  of

expenditure  may be transferred with the approval  of

the  Financial  Secretary, except  under  the  Head -

'Public Works, Non-Recurrent'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These transfers approved by the Financial Secretary

under  General  Order  662 (b) are  recorded  in  the

Treasury  and  in  the Vote Books of the  Departments

concerned, and are notified to the Deputy Director of

Audit as they are made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when studying the accounts for 1954, the

Public  Accounts  Committee  of  this  Assembly  drew

attention to the fact that, while they had  a  record

of applications for supplementary provision which had

been  approved, neither they nor the Legislature  had

any  record of transfers approved under General Order

662  (b),  and  that  the  information  required   to

reconcile the sums voted in the annual estimates  and

the  expenditure shown in the accounts  was  to  that

extent incomplete. It was therefore suggested by  the

Committee that a quarterly return of transfers  under

General  Order  662  (b)  should  be  made   to   the

Legislature  for  information. The first  return  was

tabled as Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 16 of 1957 and the

second, for the second quarter of the year, is tabled

today.

Sir, I am pleased to announce that following upon the

organisations which might be established in future.

organisations  which  have all  sought  and  obtained

official recognition by either registering under  the

limited companies under the Companies Ordinance,  and

except  for registration they are not subject to  any

control whatever. In view of the multiplicity of  the

activities of these organisations, and public concern

as  to  the  questionable nature  of  some  of  their

objects,  it  has  been  decided  that  it  would  be

necessary  to  bring these organisations  under  more

effective   control;   hence   the   need   for   the

introduction  of fresh legislation.  The  form,  Sir,

which   such  legislation  will  take  is  now  being

examined by the Hon. the Attorney-General.

<div align="center"><b>LABOUR (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>Motion for Introduction, and First Reading</b></div>

<br><br>10.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leave be given to introduce a Bill to amend

the Labour Ordinance, 1955 (No. 40 of 1955).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this House passed the Labour Ordinance in

1955, it was its intention to give workmen seven full

days'  leave  per year - seven full days not  including

Sunday  or  the  rest  day - and  that  intention   was

expressed  in  section 47 (1) of the Ordinance  which

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every workman shall be entitled to seven days'

paid leave for every twelve months continuous service

with the same employer after the coming into force of

this Ordinance and such leave shall be in addition to

the  holidays to which such workman is entitled under

section 46 of this Ordinance."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the art of draftsmanship is a very esoteric art

and   I  do  not  pretend  to  be  an  expert  in  it.

Unfortunately the draftsman of this Ordinance, who was

supposed to have been an expert, should have expressed

the   intention  of  the  Legislature  accurately  and

precisely.  A matter has now arisen in this  way.  The

Singapore  Chinese  Printing Workers  Union  have  had

considerable correspondence with the employers  as  to

the right of their workmen to have seven days' holiday

not  including  the rest day or Sunday. The  employers

have  sought  legal advice and the  advice  they  have

received  is  that  the Ordinance, as  drafted,  means

seven days including the rest day or Sunday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the argument, very briefly, is this, that

in  section 48, where sick leave is mentioned,  it  is

specifically stated in subsection (2), in the  proviso

thereto, that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"no workman shall be entitled to paid sick leave on

a  rest  day  or on a holiday to which the workman  is

entitled under section 46 of this Ordinance or on  any

day of paid annual leave."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by implication, since rest day is not

mentioned in section 47 (1), but holidays is mentioned

in section 47 (1), rest day is included as part of the

seven days mentioned in section 47 (1).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written to the Ministry of Labour on this

matter and their very unhelpful suggestion is that  we

should take the matter up in the High Court. That will

cost  a  great  deal of money and in  my  opinion  the

interpretation  suggested by  the  managements'  legal

advisers  is  correct. We can obviate  the  difficulty

which  this bit of draftsmanship has created by adding

in section 47 (1) words which will make it quite clear

that  the  seven days are not to include  holidays  or

rest  days,  and  it  is for this purpose  that  I  am

seeking leave to move a Bill to amend section  47  (1)

of the Labour Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will be in such terms-to alter the

words at the end of the subsection so that it reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every workman shall be entitled to seven days' paid

leave for every twelve months continuous service  with

the same employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>



after the coming into force of this Ordinance and such

leave  shall be in addition to rest days and  holidays

to which such workman is entitled under section 41 and

section 46 respectively of this Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those terms, there will not be any doubt whatsoever

as  to  the right of a workman to be entitled to seven

days not including holidays or rest days. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Sir, I rise to

second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Minister for Labour and

Welfare I am in agreement with the amendment which the

hon.  Member  seeks leave to introduce to  the  Labour

Ordinance. In fact this is one of the amendments which

will feature in a consolidated amending Bill now being

prepared  by  my  Ministry,  the  intention   of   the

amendments  being  to remove certain  anomalies  which

have since been discovered in the Labour Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for

Tanjong Pagar, as he has already explained, will  give

seven  days'  paid annual leave. It  has  always  been

Government's intention to give seven days'  leave  all

of  which  is  to  be paid; for these seven  days  the

workman  would be paid the amount which he would  have

received  had  he been at work. This is the  principle

followed  elsewhere  and is the simplest  and  fairest

method  of  calculation. I might add, Sir,  that  this

point was discussed at meetings of the Labour Advisory

Board held in May and July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government does not oppose the application

for  leave to introduce an amending Bill, but  in  the

light  of  what I have mentioned, Sir - that the  Labour

Ministry has already set afoot an amending Bill (which

may  be  introduced  at the October sitting) - I  wonder

whether  the hon. Member would leave his amendment  to

be  incorporated  into a Bill which  could  cover  all

amendments, instead of proceeding with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2491</b></font><br><br>



amending the Labour Ordinance in a piecemeal way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no

objections to having this amendment included with the

other  amendments which the Hon. Minister for  Labour

and Welfare seeks to move, but I am concerned that no

move  will be made until October. As I understand  it

from  the  replies given by the other Hon.  Ministers

when  moving  their Bills, the next  sitting  of  the

Assembly  will  be  on  11th September.  I  therefore

suggest,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that for the purposes  of

my  amendment, I table the Bill for First Reading but

that  it  can be incorporated in the other amendments

and then I shall abandon my Bill at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Who is prepared to introduce the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I, Sir. Mr Speaker, I beg to

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That .Mr Speaker do convey to Mr Speaker of the

Federal Legislative Council the following message  of

greetings  and good wishes to Members of the  Federal

Legislative Council:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the occasion of the attainment of Independence

by  the  Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth

of  Nations  on  Saturday,  31st  August,  1957,  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly,  on  behalf  of  the

people of Singapore, sends to the Federal Legislative

Council  and the people of the Federation  of  Malaya

greetings   and  congratulations  at  this   historic

time - the  emergence  of  a  new  nation,  taking  its

rightful  place among the freedom-loving  nations  of

the  world; and good wishes for the future  in  which

the  peoples  and Governments of both our territories

are  inextricably  bound, a  future  which  therefore

holds  a challenge to good sense and tolerance  which

can   only  be  successfully  met  by  constant   and

unstinted  goodwill,  and  by  the  closest  of   co-operation  in  realising the  ardent  desire  of  the

peoples of both our territories; for it is the  prime

interest  of  both  peoples to merge  into  a  single

political  unit within which as one people  with  one

outlook and purpose, all may share the joy and fruits

of that happy state of Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of Singapore look forward to that day when our

strength  will  be  added to your  strength  and  our

separation  will  be ended; and  we  can  proudly  go

forward  together to make our joint  contribution  in

human  welfare,  economic  prosperity  and  political

strength to the great and distinctive service of Asia

to the modern world.



<div align="center"><h4>MERDEKA."</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must confess that it is with pride and

happiness  that I move this motion. In  a  matter  of

days,  the  Federation of Malaya will  emerge  as  an

independent, sovereign state. In a matter of  days  a

new nation fulfilling its own inevitable destiny will

take its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2494</b></font><br><br>



proud  and rightful place among the great, the small,

yet  the ever-growing freedom-loving nations  of  the

world. In this part of the world, a new flag will fly

and  the  boundaries  of Free Asia  will  be  further

enlarged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not unmindful of the honour and privilege

bestowed on me as the mover of this historic  motion;

nor must I forget to acknowledge in this Assembly the

assurance  of  wholehearted and  spontaneous  support

which  Members of the Opposition were quick to extend

in  this,  a matter not only of moment, but  also  of

deep and abiding significance to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, almost to a day today, this Assembly

agreed, nem. con. as the Official Report has it, to a

message  of greetings being conveyed by you, Sir,  to

Mr  Speaker of the Federal Legislative Council. With

your  permission, Sir, I will read the full  text  of

that message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Mr Speaker do convey to Mr Speaker of the

Federal Legislative Council the following message  of

greetings  and good wishes for the inaugural  meeting

of the Federal Legislative Council:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On this historic occasion, the Singapore

Legislative  Assembly  on behalf  of  the  people  of

Singapore  sends fraternal greetings and good  wishes

to  the Federal Legislative Council and the people of

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dawn of this new era in the political history

of  the separated parts of this Malayan territory  we

of the Singapore Legislative Assembly look forward to

the  closest co-operation and co-ordination with  the

Federal  Legislative Councillors  in  building  up  a

Malayan outlook and loyalty and in the achievement of

our  common  aims for freedom, economic security  and

social welfare of the peoples of this territory,  and

extend  to our brothers across the Straits  our  good

wishes for their success in the way ahead.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that first message was in the main a message of

hope  and  good wishes for the future, at  that  time

still in the balance. That message, too, pledged  our

full   and   unstinting  support,  for   there   were

negotiations  ahead - and as we know  so  well  to  our

cost,  negotiations sometimes have a habit of  taking

an  unexpected turn. But that was two years  ago.  In

the  life  and  the  history of a people,  two  years

represent but a fleeting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>



moment.  Yet within this small compass of  time,  the

Federation of Malaya achieved Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which this was accomplished is worth

recollecting. Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Chief  Minister

of  the  Federation of Malaya, is a close and sincere

friend  of  mine. I have always admired him  for  his

sincerity,  a quality at once apparent  even  at  the

first  meeting.  Members of the  Opposition  in  this

Assembly have also paid tribute to this most valuable

asset  possessed  by the Tunku.  Two  years  ago  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar described the Tunku  as  a

gentleman in every sense of the word - an apt and happy

description.  It  was  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman,   by   a

combination of patience, perseverance and  that  most

important  ingredient - inspiring  leadership - and  with

the  sense  of  dedication,  who  first  created   an

atmosphere of unity in his country and cordiality  in

the  conference  hall, prerequisites of  the  success

rightly  his due. Here was a display of statesmanship

at  once  magnificent and masterly; here  was  a  man

building     success     on     the     surest     of

foundations - sincerity.  It  was  this  quality  which

generated  pond  readily to  goodwill.  It  was  this

quality of the Tunku which made the High Commissioner

of  the Federation his ally, and this fact the  Tunku

himself has admitted a few days ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road the Federation will take is now known. A

nation  assembled  in proud array is  ready  for  its

destiny  and  the greatest adventure of all - to  march

into the Merdeka Highway! - a path which the leader is

pointing  out with pride and confidence.  The  future

the  Federation will make will be glorious. They have

a  just man as leader. They have unity and purpose as

a  driving force. They have friends and allies tested

and true, whose aid they have but to invoke; but most

important  of  all,  Sir,  they  have  themselves - the

people  of  Malaya ardent in their wish to  take  the

difficult uphill road of freedom,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>



and  glory, and nationhood. On this day, with joy and

pride, and yet with humility, we greet the people and

Government of the Federation of Malaya with  but  one

word - Merdeka!  For  other words  are  inadequate  and

empty, inappropriate and meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the last part of my motion. Here

is  our  testament of faith, hope and charity;  faith

that  one day soon Singapore will be united with  the

Federation;  hope that Singapore and the  Federation,

as one unit, one country, one nation, will contribute

jointly  to  the good and the strength of the  whole;

and charity that the tolerance and goodwill, the help

and  support each has given to the other in the past,

will sustain us in the future and remain the basis of

our relations in the new and changed circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reason to look to the future with doubts

or  misgivings.  We, too, shall know  a  change  next

year. We in Singapore shall have self-government and,

with it, the responsibility for the management of our

internal  affairs  and  our trade.  In  the  one,  we

already  have the assurance of Federation assistance;

in  the other, we look forward to the continuance  of

their  co-operation.  To me, the  future  holds  both

promise and challenge, so long as we keep faith  with

ourselves  and  our destiny, which is inevitably  and

inextricably bound up with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I would like to make the following

announcements.  The Government, in  order  to  ensure

that  the  people  of  this island  may  be  able  to

participate  as  they  desire,  and  as   fully   and

spontaneously   as   possible,   in    the    Merdeka

celebrations  commencing in the  Federation  on  30th

August,  has already announced that it has  appointed

Saturday, 31st August, a public holiday, in  addition

to the public holidays appointed for this year. Ships

will  be dressed on Saturday, 31st August. Guns  will

be fired at 10 a.m. on Monday, 2nd September, to mark

the  installation of His Majesty the Yang di  Pertuan

Agong.  The  Government  has offered  the  Federation

Government a gift



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>



which  will  take  the  form of meeting  the  cost  of

furnishing  completely a Committee  Room  in  the  new

Parliament building to be erected in Kuala Lumpur. The

Federation Government has been pleased to signify  its

gracious   acceptance.  Hon.  Members  approved   this

expenditure earlier today. Sir, an interim  gift  from

Singapore,  of  a  grandfather clock,  which  will  be

placed   in   the  Committee  Room  in   the   Federal

Legislative Council, will be sent to Kuala Lumpur this

week.  I have arranged for this clock, which has  been

suitably  engraved, to be put on view in the foyer  to

my  office for the convenience of Members who may wish

to  see  it.  I am sure, Sir, these arrangements  will

receive the wholehearted approval of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to announce that the

Government  of the Federation has extended  to  me  an

invitation  to  attend,  as a  representative  of  the

Singapore  Government,  the  Merdeka  celebrations  in

Kuala  Lumpur  from 30th August to 3rd  September.  My

wife  has  also  been  included in this  invitation.

Ministers -  and I understand you also,  Six - have  been

invited separately. I shall convey to His Majesty  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Agong, and the Prime Minister of  the

Federation of Malaya, on behalf of the people and  the

Government of Singapore, our felicitations and  good

wishes,  and  our assurance of continued  support  and

promise of continued co-operation and goodwill. Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Sir, I rise to

second  the motion. Whenever a nation is free  of  its

shackles  from colonialism, wherever a nation  in  the

world  attains freedom, we, who love freedom,  rejoice

with   them.  In  this  particular  case,   Sir,   the

Federation of Malaya had been a part of the  whole  of

geographical Malaya. We had been together for  a  very

long  time until separated just after the war, so that

when the Federation of Malaya attains independence, it

is  with greater joy that we express our feelings. Our

joy is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>



not   only  limited,  Sir,  to  the  nation  attaining

independence,   but  that  this  nation,   after   its

attainment  of  independence, will remain  within  the

free world as a free and democratic country, a country

that  will follow the wishes of the people, a  country

that   will  observe  parliamentary  democracy.   This

indeed,  Sir, is one of the rejoicings that  we  have.

This is a fact that must be remembered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish the Federation of Malaya all the best in its

future.  We wish that the Government will rule wisely.

And  we wish that the people - all the people - in Malaya,

irrespective of race or creed, will enjoy the  freedom

that is now obtained. We wish that all of them will be

happy  and  be treated equally under the law,  and  we

hope  that the nation will march forward as  one  that

has  co-operation  amongst its people,  and  that  its

people will all be loyal to its Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the Straits, Sir, we in Singapore

look at the Federation of Malaya with admiration,  and

perhaps, too, with a little sense of shame, for having

been in the forefront of this march to Merdeka; we are

now  left behind to follow its footsteps. We wish  we,

too,  will  be independent. We wish we too could  have

been  a free nation. We wish that we could be as proud

as  they  could be on August 31 to proclaim themselves

as free people of a free nation. Yet we are happy that

they have attained freedom. We are happy that our  big

brother is ahead of us. We hope to follow them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more concerned, Sir, that after the

attainment of independence, the Federation  of  Malaya

and  Singapore will carry on as in the days of old  on

the lines of co-operation, on the lines of helping one

another.  People  in  the Federation  as  well  as  in

Singapore  always regard the two territories  as  one.

There  is never an instance when we think of going  to

the  Federation  of Malaya as going abroad  to  a  new

country.  We always regard going to the Federation  of

Malaya  as taking a sort of a holiday in another  part

of  our  own country. We hope that all the  laws  that

will  be made will be for the mutual benefit of  both.

We  hope  that not only will one nation be  benefited,

but the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2499</b></font><br><br>



of  Malaya  and  Singapore  will   both   be

prosperous and happy. With two neighbours so  closely

connected, it is important that both territories must

be  satisfied. The losing of happiness  of  one  will

affect  the other. As a Chinese saying goes, "Without

the  lips the teeth will be cold." If Singapore  were

to  be  placed in an unhappy position, the Federation

of  Malaya will not be as happy as it should be.  But

with  both sections complete, it can be assured  that

there will be prosperity all round. Sir, I have great

pleasure in seconding this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.09 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Sir,

I  associate myself with the remarks made by the Hon.

the  Chief Minister, the mover of the motion, and the

seconder. I wish to echo the rejoicings of  my  Party

on  Malaya's attainment of full nationhood  within  a

matter  of days. With its diverse interests  and  its

riches   in  mineral  resources,  and  its   multiple

society,  Malaya  has shown to the world  during  the

last two short years that it is more than capable  to

harness  those diverse interests and riches  for  the

benefit  of the different peoples that go to make  up

the  population of Malaya. By this I do not mean that

the  people  of  Malaya, whom I  shall  refer  to  as

Malayans, should rest on their laurels, but that they

should  march forward with caution and steadiness  so

that  whatever teething troubles that  are  bound  to

arise  to  face the new nation will be overcome  with

confidence and wisdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rejoicings which the Malayans richly deserve,

I  think  they should also jolt themselves  into  the

realisation   of   three   factors:   firstly,    the

statesmanlike manner in which the Chief  Minister  of

the  Federation  of  Malaya and his  colleagues  have

demonstrated  in  their  struggle  for  independence;

secondly,   the   magnanimity  of  the   British   in

relinquishing their power, influence and interests in

a  manner  which speaks volumes of their good  faith,

sincerity and a genuine desire on their part to grant

independence without the shedding of one single  drop

of  blood; and thirdly, the militant Communist menace

that mars the progress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2500</b></font><br><br>



of the country and its people in the pursuit of their

daily life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the country is to be independent with a

fully  elected Legislature in 1959, I trust  all  the

Malayans will rally round the Government in putting a

stop to this wasteful shooting war in the jungle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these sentiments I salute the new nation - the

Federation of Malaya - and proudly endorse the  message

to the Federal Legislative Council and its Members.



<br><br>11.11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it is with a feeling of joy and happiness that I rise

to support the motion. Never before in the history of

the  world  has a people in so short a time  attained

the  status  of national independence. In  two  years

from  a stage of colonialism the Federation of Malaya

has emerged into one of the leading nations of South-East  Asia.  How was this brought about? First,  Sir,

credit must go to the leaders themselves, men of  the

calibre of Tunku Abdul Rahman and Dato Sir Cheng-lock

Tan who, moved by an intense desire for independence,

were  able to rally the support of the various  races

in  Malaya into one channel, that of Merdeka.  Malaya

is  fortunate in that, at this stage of its  history,

she  has  at the helm of affairs a man of exceptional

foresight  and  understanding, able  and  willing  to

serve  his fellow-men without fear or favour  in  the

interests  of  the country as a whole.  But  for  his

courage and devotion to the cause of Merdeka, and his

non-communal  leadership,  we  might  not  today   be

sending this message of congratulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit must also be given, Sir, to the Malay Rulers

who,  with  dignity and calmness, aligned  themselves

with the people in their struggle for independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, credit must go to the people of the

Federation  of Malaya who, against great  odds,  have

managed  to sink their differences and work  for  the

common good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the greatest but sometimes forgotten factor

which  contributed towards Malaya's  independence  is

the  approach of the political Parties. It  is  true,

Sir,  that political Parties these days have one form

of  ism  or  another. Sometimes it is  Socialism,  at

other  times it is capitalism or even Communism.  But

in  the  Federation it is worthy  of  note  that  the

Parties  in  the  Alliance had  a  totally  different

ideology.  Their  ism - if at all it  could  be  called

that - is  Merdekaism. It was this call to  the  people

which  struck the note. Had it been any other, Malaya

would probably be in chaos today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this small island should take note and perhaps

draw  a leaf out of the Federation's book of success.

If  we are really sincere and honest to the cause  of

Merdeka,  we  should be able to subjugate  everything

else to this greater goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the message which we propose to send to the

Federation,  mention is made of a merger.  I  do  not

propose  to  go  to great lengths over  this.  It  is

admitted  that  a  great majority of  the  people  of

Singapore would like to see a United Malaya.  How  it

will  be brought about is another matter. It  may  be

that the Federation Government will continue refusing

us, as they have consistently done since the days  of

Mr  Marshall; or it may be that they may  accept  us

five, ten or fifteen years hence. But what I do  say,

Sir, to the political Parties of Singapore, including

mine, is the less we talk of a merger the greater the

possibility. We already have much in common.  Let  us

use  these common grounds as a basis for greater  co-operation   and   understanding   between   the   two

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the people of the Federation of Malaya, I say,

"May you progress from strength to strength, and  may

you  be the guiding light to the people of this  part

of  Asia.  Allah  peliharakan kedaulatan  Persekutuan

Tanah Melayu!"



<br><br>11.16 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

heartily  support the message of greetings  and  good

wishes to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2502</b></font><br><br>



Members of the Federal Legislative Council and to all

the   people  of  Malaya  on  the  occasion  of   the

attainment of Independence within the Commonwealth of

Nations on 31st August, 1957. But it would appear  to

be  out  of  turn to continue harping - in vain - on  the

question   of   merger,   at   every   given   slight

opportunity. At the moment, Sir, all the  noise  that

we  can  make regarding the merger is but a voice  in

the  wilderness. It is just like rain water  dripping

off  the  back of a duck. We might as well  save  our

face,  we might as well at least save our breath,  to

cool  our  porridge for the time  being.  Let  us  be

realistic.  Let  us  do first things  first.  Let  us

marshal  our  forces together. Let us pull  ourselves

out   of,   or  solve,  the  many  pressing  problems

confronting  us,  lest  we humiliate  ourselves  much

further   in  the  eyes  of  our  good  neighbour - the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many urgent needs that require immediate

attention. First, the industrial unrest; second,  the

flight  of local capital; the ever-increasing  number

of  unemployed in Singapore and the growing  army  of

idle teenagers whose future is doomed as things stand

today.  If  Beng Kong has chicken-pox, do you  expect

Mohammad  next door to go hand-in-hand with him?  The

reason  is obvious, even though both of them are  the

best of friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore say that this goodwill message

will serve its purpose better if we would delete "the

merger hint" entirely out of it.



<br><br>11.18 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in their coming hour of

glory,  we, the people of Singapore, rejoice together

with   the  people  of  the  Federation  over   their

achievement  of  independence. Sir, there  are  times

when if we see our neighbour getting a big profit  or

advantage  or benefit, we feel a little bit  envious.

Sir, we do not envy the Federation. We are today full

of  joy at their achieving their independence, and we

hope  that  some  day  we,  too,  will  achieve   our

independence.  But our independence  is  inextricably

bound



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2503</b></font><br><br>

up  with  merger with the Federation  because,  as  a

small island, it is futile for anyone to suggest that

we  could stand as an independent sovereign state  on

our own legs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the war, through no fault of our own, we

have  been  artificially separated from the mainland.

Geography   has   been  ignored  and  an   artificial

political separation has been created. We hope,  Sir,

in  time  to  come,  with goodwill  and  co-operation

between  men on both sides of the Causeway, to  erase

this  artificial  separation and to  unite  with  our

brothers  who  are of us. We and the  people  of  the

Federation  are  one and cannot for  long  stand  any

artificial separation; it is against human nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad, Sir, that in a debate in which we should

all  rejoice, we hear a note of discord from the hon.

Member  for  Tiong Bahru. Sir, anyone  in  his  right

senses in Singapore, whether he is a politician or  a

man  in  the  street, will realise that  geographical

affinities demand that we should become one, and that

united we can form a Greater Malaya; divided we might

take  away  each other's strength and  probably  both

territories could not come up to the full strength as

they would if they were united together.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> By humiliating methods?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sometimes it is not humiliation

to  co-operate with a brother. Therefore, Sir, we  on

this  side  of  the  House - and I am  sure  all  other

sensible  men in Singapore - will not only  rejoice  at

the attainment of independence by the Federation, but

also will look forward to the day when we become one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  ten  more days, the world will witness  the

join  this House in congratulating the people of  the

Federation  of  Malaya on the eve  of  this  historic

occasion and on the fulfilment of its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>



political aspirations. I am deeply moved, Sir, by the

rejoicings  and the jubilation of the people  of  the

Federation.  We in Singapore share in the  pride  and

the  honour of this great moment. The people  in  the

Federation have fought well and courageously  in  the

struggle   for   freedom.  They   have   known   many

vicissitudes    and    learn    many    heartbreaking

experiences, but we are proud to say that  the  three

major   races  which  comprise  the  people  in   the

Federation  have, in a common brotherhood,  learn  to

live  together, to fight together and, we  are  sure,

will enjoy the fruits of victory together also and to

take   part   in   the  urgent  tasks   of   national

reconstruction together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuation of the unity of all the races is of

fundamental  importance in building up  a  happy  and

prosperous Malaya we all desire. The Union Jack which

has fluttered on every school flagpole and over every

Government  building for the past hundred  years  and

more,  shall be lowered in the Federation on  Merdeka

Day; 31st August, 1957, shall mark the birth of a new

nation   and  the  political  withdrawal   from   the

Federation of the British colonial masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion before the House. I

support  the  motion before this House, composing  of

representatives of the people of Singapore. I am sure

I  shall  see  in  the very near future  the  elected

representatives of both the Federation and  Singapore

assembling   under  one  House  of  Parliament.   The

separation  of  our  two  territories,  Sir,  is   an

artificial  separation. The day will soon  dawn  when

there  is  a family reunion of eleven elder  brothers

which  comprise  the  present  territory  called  the

Federation   of  Malaya,  and  the  twelfth   younger

brother,  which is Singapore. Singapore is  part  and

parcel  of the Malayan nation. No power on earth  can

maintain  the  artificial  separation  of   the   two

territories  for  long.  The desires  of  the  people

living in the two territories to be together must and

will triumph.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

sorry  I  cannot agree with what the hon. Member  for

Tiong  Bahru has just said against the merger, but  I

can   well  understand  his  feelings  and  the  true

feelings  of the people of this country.  Anyone  who

has  a close eye on the present political development

of  this  country should be deeply impressed  by  the

heavy  responsibility and the hearty feelings implied

in  the  motion. I may not agree with what  was  said

just  now  by the mover of the motion, the  Hon. the

Chief Minister, but I have doubt that he was speaking

with full conscience and sincerity. I can assure  the

House that the Hon, the Chief Minister, just the same

as  I or any other average sensible person in the two

territories,  welcome 31st August, Merdeka  Day -  but

with  mixed feelings. Rejoice? Of course we  rejoice.

As  what  the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis  says,  the

Union Jack will go down on the day. We are very happy

that  our  brothers will then at last  be  free  from

colonial rule. But what will a genuine Malaysian feel

to  call  our brothers a new nation legally separated

from us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still remember a little incident which happened

in London. The present Chief Minister asked me at the

hotel  in  St. James' Court, "Look, Cher  Kheng,  you

signed  your  name in the Record Book of  St.  James'

Court as Malayan?" I said, "Yes." "Oh," he said,  "I,

too, signed as Malayan." The then Minister for Labour

and   I  then  signed  the  record  book  giving  our

nationality  as  Malayan, but in the  light  of  this

motion today, will the mover of the motion be allowed

any  more  to  sign  his  nationality  officially  as

Malayan? Sir, I doubt very much. Although the Straits

Times says that every true Malayan should buy a  copy

of  its Merdeka souvenir, I doubt very much if it  is

in  the  right  sense to term our brothers,  who  are

lucky,  powerful  and  able  to  achieve  such  early

independence, a new nation. Naturally, Sir,  we  have

mixed   feelings  and  I  cannot,   as   a   people's

representative,  tell  lies or  engage  in  political

double-talk. We say, "We are happy, we rejoice"; but,

Sir, the genuine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2506</b></font><br><br>



feelings of the people in the two territories are not

as  what  our politicians say they are - the  happiness

and  rejoicing indeed are mixed with fear and doubt.

I  can  say most of the people of the two territories

are  asking the question, "Quo Vadis, Malayans?"  You

say,  "Malaya  is  only  for Malays."  The  Singapore

Chinese  say,  "Singapore is only for  the  Chinese."

There are racialism, cultural conflict, increases  in

taxation  and  our  dying industrialisation,  all  so

closely   connected  with  livelihood  in   the   two

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot blame anybody here, Sir, but I wish to

place on record that we can blame one person - the  Rt.

Hon.  Mr  Lennox-Boyd, who must be held  responsible

for   the  state  of  affairs  today - this  artificial

separation of the two territories. If he had  allowed

us  to  have a genuine joint Merdeka team,  we  would

have had one united and consolidated constitution. We

could  not  have had the state of affairs today,  and

the fears and doubts of tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot add any more to the words which many

Members  have spoken in praise of Tunku Abdul Rahman.

I  recollect I had the privilege and honour  once  to

have  a lengthy private talk with him. I hold him  as

one  of  the truly idealistic leaders of this country

who  can solve the serious problem of today, and even

of tomorrow, of creating a greater Malaysian nation.

I  told him that almost all the political leaders  in

this  country  were fools because they  were  falling

into the age-old colonial trap of divide and rule.  I

think  I have asked once before in this Assembly  why

if  the  Commissioner-General, Sir Robert  Scott,  is

able  to  have  jurisdiction  and  control  over  the

Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak  and

North  Borneo, why cannot we have a Malaysian  nation

as our cultural and economic interests are identical?

Instead, we are being driven apart. It is a shock  to

me.  I  say  that in the history of the world,  there

have never been two territories so close and yet  are

divided.  The Hon. the Minister for Local Government,

Lands and Housing has just said that the independence

of Malaya, achieved in so short a time, creates world

history. I would add: if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2507</b></font><br><br>



possible create bigger history. Colonial policy seeks

to  divide our people and naturally to cut us  apart.

Who is responsible for it, I ask?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

this debate is developing into one on the merger  not

only of the Federation and Singapore, but also of the

other  territories in this region. I  would  like  to

know how relevant that is to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, it is of course relevant. I

am  not  only supporting the merger of Singapore  and

the  Federation but, as a further step, I would  like

Tunku Abdul Rahman to give us a lead by enlarging the

merger and creating a greater Malaysian nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest that if hon. Members

will  confine  their  speeches  to  emphasising   the

goodwill  part of the message, it will be better  for

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, let me touch on the motion

now. It says in part:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . by the closest of co-operation in realising

the   ardent  desire  of  the  peoples  of  both  our

territories; for it is the primary interest  or  both

peoples to merge into a single political unit  within

which  as  one people with one outlook arid  purpose,

all  may share the joy and fruits of that happy state

of Merdeka."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like particularly to quote this

paragraph and emphasise how closely related  we  are.

In  today's papers there is an item about a statement

made by the Defence Minister of the United Kingdom in

Canberra about atomic bombs for Malaya!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now departing into

nuclear research! Shall we confine ourselves  to  the

motion, which is to send a message of goodwill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am sorry. I close my

speech with a sincere appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot add to the beautiful phrases and the praise

for Tunku Abdul Rahman. I extend my personal greeting

to him and hope that he will fulfil the wishes of the

people of this territory. On my short visit to Brunei

a  few weeks ago it was a surprise to me, Sir, to see

many households displaying pictures of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2508</b></font><br><br>



our Malayan political leaders like Tunku Abdul Rahman

and  even the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. It seems

to  be  so  natural to do so. Therefore, I convey  my

wishes,  not just empty words of praise, but I  hope,

first, that the coordinating administrative bodies in

the two territories will, and must, try their best to

continue  their work; and second, that a  pan-Malayan

economic  policy will be adopted. That is my  sincere

wish.



<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   rise   to   support   this   message    of

congratulations   to  the  new  nation   across   the

Causeway. I support in particular the hope  that  the

separation of Singapore and the Federation  will  one

day be ended. I hope that that day will be very soon.

The  longer  this day is postponed, Sir, the  greater

the  risk  of the two territories drifting apart.  As

you    already   know,   Sir,   there   are   already

groups - factions - in  Singapore  working  actively   to

prevent a merger between the two territories. Only  a

few  days ago there was a newspaper report of  a  new

political  party  with the slogan.  "Merdeka  without

merger!"  This party has the backing of  wealthy  men

who probably would like to run this island as one big

estate.  Parties  like this can do a  great  deal  of

harm.  They  will  exploit  and  magnify  differences

between  the  two territories in order to  strengthen

their  cause.  This must result in communal  tensions

and  suspicions.  Those who cry for  Merdeka  without

merger may not intend such a thing, but there will be

a  rise of communal tension whether they like  it  or

not.  Therefore the longer the two territories remain

divided,  the greater the difficulties of building  a

strong  united  nation.  The  People's  Action  Party

therefore  believes that merger should not  remain  a

pious  hope,  an  objective to be  achieved  in  some

remote  future.  The two Governments  must  get  down

together  now to consider ways and means of  bringing

the  two  territories closer to each  other,  not  to

discuss   ways  and  means  of  how   to   make   the

distinctions between the two greater.

is  now the Federation, working with and for its many

the  message of congratulations and good wishes going

from this Assembly to the Speaker and Assembly of the

the  Federation  and  its  peoples,  share  in  their

rejoicing at getting independence, and extend to them

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

congratulate Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Chief  Minister - and the future, in a very few days, Prime Minister - of

the  Federation of Malaya or Tanah Melayu, in getting

a  place  for  his  country  within  the  independent

nations  of  the  world. I have  said  Sir,  in  this

Assembly before, that a man who could win 99 per cent

of  the  seats in the Legislature can do  everything,

and  nothing  or no one can prevent him from  getting

independence. We are very happy that he has  achieved

his object.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, we should follow his example and the

example  of the people of Malaya, here - that  is,  co-operation between the various races, Malays, Chinese,

Indians, and others, and their unity, that have  made

possible the achievement of this independence. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>



I  join  in  congratulating the  Federation  and  its

people for achieving independence.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise to support this motion. On 31st August, a new

phase  begins in the history of Malaya. Earlier  this

morning I met the Hon. Deputy Chief Minister  and  he

made  a  special  request  that  on  this  happy  and

auspicious   occasion   I  should   not   make   dire

predictions of impending doom and disaster.  I  would

like  to accede to that request but I think we  would

be  deceiving ourselves if we do not realise the deep

significance of the change that will be taking  place

after 31st August. At the moment those of us who read

only  the  English  Press are  preoccupied  with  new

official  dress, palace for the new Paramount  Ruler,

and embassies being opened abroad. These are the more

extravagant  manifestations of an independent  state.

But  those who are preoccupied with what is going  on

not  in  these high places but in the hearts and  the

minds  of  the  people, are more concerned  with  the

reactions  of  the various groups in  Malaya  and  in

Singapore to these changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to 31st August, it was a straightforward anti-colonial fight. We all gang up and beat the brains

out  of  the British, which was a very good thing  to

have done. If, Mr Speaker, Sir, people like the Hon.

the  Chief  Secretary, apart from  enjoying  all  the

beautiful places, the beautiful rest houses in  which

he must have stayed, and the spacious bungalows which

the State Governments must have provided for him, had

spent  some time wondering what would happen  to  all

the   immigrant  children  for  whose  education  the

Government  did  not provide, if  they  had  wondered

about  the change in the whole complex of the Malayan

situation - which  their action in  allowing  wholesale

immigration, without providing for the absorption and

assimilation of the people would bring about - we would

not be faced with this situation today. No doubt when

he  thinks  of  the good old days he  thinks  of  the

languid, languorous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2511</b></font><br><br>



Dorothy Lamour type of situation, where he, the white

boss,  watched  the  spectacle of  beautiful  natives

floating across the panoramic scene. But we  have  to

face  the reality now because of their stupidity  and

their mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever may be said, I think the people of Malaya

have  no  regrets in the passing of the British  raj.

But  I  give this one compliment to the British  raj.

They, of all the colonial powers, know how to bow out

gracefully. Unlike the French and the Dutch  who  got

their  brains  beaten  into the  dust  of  Hanoi  and

Jogjakarta, the British are past masters at this art.

They bow out gracefully when the time comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what we want to know after 31st August is:

What happens next, because-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether we

do  really want to know what happens next in relation

to  the  motion.  The motion is  just  a  message  of

goodwill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, we can give no better

manifestation  of our goodwill than our  concern  and

anxiety  over what follows after Merdeka. We are  all

involved  in  this, Mr Speaker, Sir; very  much  so,

because if the battle is lost in the Federation, then

the battle is lost in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to be intervening in

this debate so frequently but it seems to me that all

we  are debating now is whether or not we should send

a goodwill message to the Federation, and the message

has  been couched as appears on the Order Paper.  And

if  hon.  Members  do  not like the  wording  of  the

message, they are at liberty to make amendments.  But

I  think  the  emphasis should be whether  or  not  a

goodwill message should be sent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I would not be so ungracious as to

criticise  the fluency of the language. In fact,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the short adjournment which  I  took

for  myself  this morning, I came across  the  former

Chief  Minister and it struck me that if he  were  in

charge of this motion we would really have an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2512</b></font><br><br>



honorific motion to send across the Causeway.  And  I

have been wondering for some time how it is that such

a  mundane and modest Chief Minister has got  himself

involved in such a long and flowery motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the colonial officials find it tedious

to  be  reminded  of  their  past  misdeeds  but  Mr

Speaker.  Sir, you will forgive me if I say  that  we

can  give  no  greater evidence of  our  desire,  our

genuine  goodwill, for the people of  the  Federation

than by showing our concern not only for what happens

on  Merdeka  Day but what happens after. Before  31st

August,  every  policeman, every Home Guard  officer,

every  member of the Federation Regiment who is  shot

in  the armed revolution is shot as a running-dog, or

it  can be said he was a running-dog, of the British.

But after 31st August - and this I think is in the mind

of everybody - every soldier, every Home Guard shot, is

a  shot against a guardian of the newly-found freedom

of  the  people of Malaya, and therefore the  $64,000

question:  What is the Malayan Communist Party  going

to  do? If it goes on shooting, then the consequences

will be catastrophic for them and for the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new phase and if there are leaders who

have  the interests of other than just their  parties

at  heart,  we should be able to make the  democratic

system work, for this simple reason if nothing  else,

that the people of Malaya have not lost faith in  the

democratic system. It is the democratic system - or the

democratic constitutional Parties taking advantage of

the   overall  three-cornered  fight  in  Malaya - that

brought  freedom to Malaya. That is  the  first  fact

that  must  be acknowledged. Secondly, the people  of

Malaya  are not at the moment in favour of any  armed

totalitarian revolt. We have had enough of it  and  I

am  sure  that  31st  August will see  some  dramatic

changes in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking to a friend of mine, a colleague of

mine  who  is  now  enjoying the hospitality  of  the

British  Government  in one of the  prison  camps  in

Changi.  He said - and I think he said it with absolute

sincerity - "After 31st August let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>



them  pack  up this armed revolution before  they  do

great  damage  to  the country."  And  we  say  this:

Whoever  does not declare where he stands after  31st

August   is  a  fool.  Up  to  31st  August  in   the

Federation,   the  question  is:  Do   we   have   an

independent  Malaya? After the 31st the question  is:

What kind of independent Malaya do we make of it? And

we  say categorically - I say it for myself and for  my

Party - we believe in an independent, democratic,  non-Communist Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Speaker do convey to Mr Speaker of the

Federal Legislative Council the following message  of

greetings  and good wishes to Members of the  Federal

Legislative Council :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the occasion of the attainment of Independence

by  the  Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth

of  Nations  on  Saturday,  31st  August,  1957,  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly,  on  behalf  of  the

people of Singapore, sends to the Federal Legislative

Council  and the people of the Federation  of  Malaya

greetings   and  congratulations  at  this   historic

time - the  emergence  of  a  new  nation,  taking  its

rightful  place among the freedom-loving  nations  of

the  world; and good wishes for the future  in  which

the  peoples  and Governments of both our territories

are  inextricably  bound, a  future  which  therefore

holds  a challenge to good sense and tolerance  which

can   only  be  successfully  met  by  constant   and

unstinted  goodwill,  and  by  the  closest  of   co-operation  in  realising the  ardent  desire  of  the

in  the imposition of speed limits :the imposition

of a speed limit alone cannot ensure the safety of

accidents.   The   problem  of  limits   must   be

considered separately for each housing estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A speed limit of 20 m.p.h. has already been in

force  for  over two years (i.e., since 10th  May, 1955) over the roads of Serangoon Garden Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sennett Estate a speed limit of 20 m.p.h. has

been imposed since 4th May, 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Commissioner of Police and the highway authority have not yet considered it necessary to

impose  a  similar speed limit on the roads  of  any

other housing estate or residential areas, but  will

no   doubt   consider  any  suggestions  which   the  Honourable Member will wish to make to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) His question No. (ii)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some doubt as to which 'island' is

referred  to.  But  if  the Honourable  Member  will

clarify  whether he means the pedestrian  refuge  at

Yio  Chu  Kang  Road  or  the Serangoon  Garden  Way

roundabout, the suggestion will be referred  to  the

Rural  Board  as  the  highway authority  for  their

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) His question No. (iii)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggestion is being referred to the Rural Board.
