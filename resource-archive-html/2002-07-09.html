<div align="center"><b>CIGARETTE SMOKING BY PERSONS BELOW 18 YEARS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Effectiveness of control measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Health

since the Smoking (Control of Advertisements and Sale  of

Tobacco)  Act  came into force (a) how many persons  have

been  prosecuted for selling or providing  cigarettes  to

persons  below  the  age of 18 years  and  what  was  the

punishment  meted  out; and (b) what preventive  measures

have  the  Health  Promotion Board  taken  to  discourage

cigarette  smoking among those below  18  years  and  how

effective have been these measures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, a total of 131 retailers have been caught selling or

providing  tobacco products to those  aged  18  years  or

under since the Act came into force in 1993.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First time offenders pay a compounded fine of

$1,000.   Repeat  offenders  are  prosecuted  in   court.

Sentences  include fines of up to $1,500  and  a  3-month

suspension of the tobacco licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second part of the question, since 1984,

the Ministry of Health has been working with the Ministry

of  Education  to  reduce smoking rates  among  students.

After  the formation of the Health Promotion Board  (HPB)

in 2001, HPB has taken over the responsibility of driving

and  managing  the  programmes which are  implemented  in

schools to encourage students to stay smoke free  and  to

assist  those  who  smoke  to quit  smoking.   Programmes

include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Incorporating smoking as a topic in the school

curriculum from Primary 3 to Secondary 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use of student peer leaders to spread the smoke

free message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Training teachers to conduct smoking cessation

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Providing schools with a grant for students to

implement smoking control programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Promoting soccer and rugby as healthy alternatives

to smoking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Commissioning theatre companies to perform skits

to  teach  students about the harmful effects of  smoking

and ways to refuse offers of cigarettes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's National Smoking Control Campaign is

targeted  at  youths,  particularly those  between  13-18

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures taken over the years have been

effective.  A survey conducted among 13,111 secondary one

to   four  students  in  2000  showed  that,  among   the

respondents, about 96% know that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



smoking  is  harmful to their health and  94%  know  that

secondhand smoke is harmful to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those aged 18-19 years for which longitudinal

data  is  available, the smoking prevalence has  declined

from 15% in 1992 to 11% in 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPB will persist in its efforts to counter the

influences on youths to smoke.  It will look into new and

innovative  ways to promote the anti-smoking  message  to

the youths in schools and also to out-of-school youths.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, in the same survey

cited by the Minister of State, it is also mentioned that

one out of every four students managed to sneak a puff at

least  once,  and  also  the 11% who  are  considered  as

smokers because they light up at least once a month.   To

me,  this is alarming.  There are two aspects to it:  one

is  deterrent  and  the  other  is  preventive.   We  are

concentrating  on the preventive part.  On the  deterrent

part,  121 convictions for a period of nine years,  which

is  12  convictions per year, to me, this number is  very

small.   Because,  in a report in the  Straits  Times  in

February, an 18-year old said that one could actually get

cigarettes from any void deck shop, because they  do  not

ask for the age, identification papers, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether there

is  a  mismatch,  in  terms of the  actual  incidence  of

smoking by persons below the age of 18 years and the rate

of  conviction, and whether there is a need  for  greater

enforcement on the part of the Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I think both need to be

done.   We  will  work  with the Police  with  regard  to

enforcement  of the law.  If there is any information  as

to  where these cigarettes are sold, we will pass on  the

information to the Police who will enforce the  law.   We

are  also targeting on prevention.  In fact, this  year's

mass   media  campaign  will  be  on  television,  radio,

newspapers  and  magazines, and we are targeting  youths,

especially those between 13-18 years of age.  And we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



using international celebrities, like Christy Turlington,

a  supermodel,  Moby, a singer and DJ, as well  as  local

sports  celebrities, like Mark Cheng and U. K.  Shyam  to

reach  out to the youths to encourage them to stay smoke-free.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, what specific programmes

are   being   put  in  place  to  make  sure   that   the

neighbourhood   provision  shops  do  not   really   sell

cigarettes to persons under 18 years of age without  even

asking  for  identification papers,  or  whatever?   What

specific  programmes does the Ministry have in  place  to

check this?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> My Ministry does not enforce

the  law  with regard to smoking.  This is  done  by  the

Police which is under the Ministry of Home Affairs.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, if the Ministry does not do

enforcement, will the Ministry work with the Ministry  of

Home Affairs and the Police to ensure that a mechanism is

put in place for this purpose?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Yes, we will work with them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister

of  State whether his Ministry will further facilitate by

helping  people  to stop smoking by subsidising  a  drug,

which can help people stop smoking?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> In general, our current

subsidy rules will apply to all medication.  But if there

is any specific drug that we should subsidise, and if the

proposal is sent to us, we will consider it.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, can the Minister

of  State  consider working with the Ministry of National

Development, in terms of letting out void deck  shops  to

vendors, who could be restricted from selling cigarettes,

because  a  lot of void deck shops are very near  to  the

secondary schools?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, we will be happy to work

with other Ministries on this issue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Will the Minister of State then

endorse  Nicorette patch, Nicorette stick  and  Nicorette

sweet?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I will not endorse any

particular  product.  If there are any  specific  schemes

that Members of the House have which can help people stop

smoking,  they may send their ideas to the  Ministry.   I

will study them in detail.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN JUNIOR DOCTORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number employed in public hospitals)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if he

will  give the number of foreign junior doctors recruited

over the past 3 years from neighbouring countries for our

public  hospitals with breakdown figures  by  nationality

and university attended.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our public hospitals have recruited an

average of 33 Malaysian and two Indonesian junior doctors

annually over the past three years.  Among these doctors,

62%  of  the  doctors  graduated  from  universities   in

Australia and 21% from universities in UK.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I have asked for the breakdown on

the  nationality and the university attended.  Could  the

Minister of State be more specific, please?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> As for the breakdown of

universities, there are about 20 universities, and if  Mr

Speaker will give me the time, I will run through them as

quickly as I can.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister of State has just

mentioned   a  few  universities  from  the  neighbouring

countries which were never recognised before.  Will  this

not diminish the standard of our medical healthcare here?

Will it not affect the excellent reputation which we have

built up over the years?  Is it right to take short  cuts

like this in easing the shortage of doctors in the public

hospitals?   May I ask the Minister of State whether  now

is  the time to revisit and review the policy implemented

in  1993  of  not  recognising 150 previously  recognised

foreign  universities?  Surely, it is better  to  recruit

from such reputable previously recognised universities.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, Dr Lily Neo refers to the

MRA  Schedule that came into force in 1993.  The Ministry

has  received  many requests for the MRA Schedule  to  be

revised,  in particular, to restore medical schools  that

were  recognised  prior to 1993  to  the  Schedule.   Our

position at this time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



is  that  there is no need to amend the schedule for  the

following reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current shortage of doctors in the public sector

is  due to two main factors.  Firstly, there was a marked

reduction in the NUS medical school intake from  1991  to

1996.  NUS has already increased its intake progressively

from  1997  onwards.  But the increase of junior  doctors

will  only begin to enter the medical workforce from 2007

onwards.     Secondly,    there    is    a    significant

maldistribution of doctors between the public and private

sectors.   For  example, while there  is  a  shortage  of

junior  doctors in the public sector institutions,  there

is a surplus of GPs.  In addition, there are shortages in

some  specialties,  due either to  the  rapid  growth  in

demand   or   unpopularity  of  that  specialty   amongst

trainees.   The situation is compounded by the very  long

time  -  generally,  six  years -  required  to  train  a

specialist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assessment is that an annual intake of 230-250

students   into   the  Faculty  of   Medicine   at   NUS,

supplemented by an annual intake of 50-80 foreign-trained

doctors - many of whom would be returning Singaporeans  - would  be sufficient to meet our overall clinical service

needs.   Expanding  the Schedule to address  the  present

shortage will create more problems in the longer term  by

allowing  a greater influx of foreign doctors that  would

continue after the manpower situation has eased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current registration system already allows

foreign-trained specialists from medical schools, both on

and  off  the  Schedule,  to  work  in  Singapore,  under

conditional  registration, to support  the  delivery  and

development of our clinical services.  The Schedule  does

not  prevent  or  hinder  the entry  of  foreign  medical

talent, especially in disciplines where local specialists

are  in short supply.  In this regard, the Schedule  does

not   impede  or  conflict  with  the  plans  to  develop

Singapore  into a biomedical research hub, as well  as  a

regional medical service hub.  Both of these developments

would  require the inputs of fully-qualified specialists,

rather than doctors with only basic medical degrees.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the Schedule will increase the number of

options  that  Singaporeans will have to  study  medicine

abroad,  if  they  are  unable to enter  the  Faculty  of

Medicine at NUS.  Given the popularity of medicine  as  a

career  and  the  calibre of students seeking  admission,

such  an increase would have significant implications  on

our national talent spread.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State

did  not  answer my question on whether it will  diminish

our  reputation  and our standards by  employing  doctors

from the neighbouring unrecognised universities.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the list

of   universities,  there  are  seven  doctors  from  the

University  of  Malaya and the University  of  Indonesia.

When  our  hospitals went to recruit these doctors,  they

recruited  the best from Malaysia and in Indonesia.   The

number  is small, and they are working under supervision.

I  do  not  think  our  reputation will  be  in  any  way

diminished.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, we are talking about the

principle  of  the  issue here, and it  does  not  matter

whether  it is one, seven or 15.  May I ask the  Minister

of State whether it is right to take risks on the care of

our patients in the public hospitals?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  assure  Dr Lily Neo that these doctors are  excellent

doctors,   and  there  are  excellent  doctors   in   our

neighbouring  countries.  If some of them are  recruited,

these  are  worthwhile  foreign talent  to  have  in  our

country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Neo, I think the assurance has been

given, unless you want to pursue another question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I would like to pursue on what

the  Minister of State said earlier.  He said that  these

doctors  are  allowed  to  practise  here  under   strict

supervision.  Can I seek a clarification on what  he  has

said earlier?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State

whether  the senior doctors have enough time to supervise

these junior doctors all the time?  Are we not addressing

the  shortage  of doctors?  By having the senior  doctors

looking after the junior doctors, is it not defeating the

purpose?   Are we not talking about people's lives  here?

Why  are we taking risks with the patients in our  public

hospitals?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, junior doctors must

always be supervised by senior doctors, whether they  are

local,  UK, Australian or Malaysian graduates.  We expect

our senior doctors to supervise junior doctors.  In time,

our   junior  doctors  will  become  senior  doctors  and

supervise  those  who are junior to them.   This  is  the

normal practice in medicine.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I disagree with the Minister of

State   on   that,  because  there  are  many  types   of

registration.  Is he saying that the local graduates  are

exactly  the  same?   Surely, they  are  under  different

medical registrations.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a good doctor

remains  a  good  doctor, regardless of the  registration

category, the country they graduate from or their country

of origin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State has said that

there is a shortage of junior doctors.  The question  is:

are  the  junior  doctors being forced to  work  extended

shift  hours of up to 120 hours per work week,  and  will

such  punishing work schedules possibly endanger  patient

care?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> We have taken steps in our

hospitals  to  reduce and monitor the  working  hours  of

doctors.  The recruitment of some of the foreign  doctors

will  help to ease the workload of junior doctors in  the

hospitals.   But by the year 2007, we expect  the  higher

intake  of  medical  students  into  the  university   to

increase  the  supply  in  the  hospitals,  and  a   more

permanent solution would be found at that time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister of State said

earlier  that the junior doctors are also recruited  from

universities not scheduled in the 1993 policy.   Why  can

the Ministry not just acknowledge this in the open and be

transparent, and say that this policy is void since it is

not implemented?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our Ministry

is transparent and the policy is in effect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

a  shortfall of junior doctors until 2007.  What  is  the

Ministry going to do during this interim period to  cover

this shortfall of doctors?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to cover this

shortfall,  we  have  recruited  doctors  from  the   UK,

Australia, New Zealand and the neighbouring countries.  I

had  earlier  given  the House a  list  of  doctors  from

Malaysia and Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Why did the Minister of State

contradict himself?  Earlier, he said that the policy was

implemented  and yet, in the next breath,  he  said  that

they   had   been   recruiting  doctors  from   Malaysia,

Indonesia, Australia.  These are not the universities  in

the Schedule at all.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

contradiction.   We recruit foreign doctors  during  this

period  because  there  is  a shortage.   But  corrective

measures  have been taken.  The intake in the  university

has  been increased, and it takes a long time to train  a

doctor.   So these medical students will become  doctors,

and they will enter and work in the hospitals in 2007.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Schedule is to ensure that there

is   an   even  distribution  of  talent  amongst   young

Singaporeans in the various careers.  If the Schedule  is

removed,  then a greater number of Singaporeans would  go

abroad  and  study medicine if they cannot get  into  the

medical  school in Singapore.  However, even if a  doctor

is  from a university that is not in the Schedule, he can

come back to Singapore and, under certain conditions, get

himself registered.  Basically, it would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



be  under a conditional registration and he would have to

sit   for  an  examination.   So,  this  has  served   to

discourage   too  many  Singaporeans  from   going   into

medicine.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister of State just mentioned

about conditional registration.  Could he explain to  the

House the meaning of "conditional registration"?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> It means he is registered

under certain conditions.  I have the list of conditions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Neo, I think we have spent enough

time on this.  I shall only allow you one last question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has said

that  the shortage of doctors here is temporary.  Can  he

assure  the  House that this assessment is  correct  this

time,  or  is it going to be skewed again?  How would  he

respond  to  the  visiting  Harvard  don  who  said  that

Singapore  needs  another medical school  to  train  more

doctors,  in  view  of the long-term needs  of  the  life

sciences?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I can assure the House

that in 2007, we will have far more doctors entering  the

hospitals  than we have today.  As for the Harvard  don's

recommendation  that  we should  have  a  second  medical

school, the Ministry of Education is studying this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I hope that assurance will bring the

Question to a close.

<div align="center"><b>KEY TELEVISION PROGRAMMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Signing and captioning)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Information, Communications and the Arts whether  he

will consider requiring local television broadcasters  to

provide  signing  or captioning of important  programmes,

such  as  the  news or the Prime Minister's National  Day

Rally speech, for the benefit of the hearing-impaired  as

signing  is  provided, for instance, in  television  news

programme in Malaysia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, it is important

that   key  programmes,  such  as  the  Prime  Minister's

National Day Rally speech, reach as many Singaporeans  as

possible.  For the hearing-impaired, the full text of the

English  speech  and translations of key  points  of  the

Mandarin  and  Malay  speeches are  available  on  MITA's

website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are practical difficulties in

implementing  Dr  Khor's  suggestion  for   signing   and

captioning.   Broadcasters have considered such  requests

in  the past, but felt it was not feasible due to lack of

a   regular  pool  of  "sign"  interpreters  for   `live'

translations.   Close captioning, an  alternative  system

used  in  the  US, UK and Australia, works  by  means  of

captions  hidden in the video signal, to be  recalled  by

viewers  when needed.  However, this concept  has  to  be

further studied, as it requires substantial high costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, broadcasters do, during `live' telecast

of  important speeches, provide summaries of main  points

made during the speech.  CNA also provides news headlines

in  the form of "crawlers" throughout the day on its news

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA, therefore, does not make it mandatory for

broadcasters  to  provide signing  or  captioning  of  TV

programmes.   However,  SBA  will  further  explore  with

broadcasters  the possibility of providing  the  hearing-impaired with subtitles during major Government speeches.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

the  Minister  mentioned about cost.  Is it  possible  to

know  how  costly this service would be?   On  the  point

about  the lack of resources, there are a lot of  signing

classes  that  go on, especially through  the  YMCA,  and

people  are  certified.  How does the Minister  see  this

problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the costs, at best,

are  estimates  at  this point in  time.   MediaCorp  had

estimated previously that the cost of setting up a  close

caption system is about $250,000.  But, more importantly,

they also estimated that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



annual operating cost of a close caption system could  be

close to $300,000.  It is a fairly substantial cost,  and

it is a question then of costs and benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the shortage of signing

personnel,  the problem actually is a little bit  deeper,

and that is because there is not just one signing method.

In  the schools in Singapore, they teach something  which

is called "signing exact English", and that is a word for

word  signing.  This is a fairly slow process because  if

everybody speaks at the rate I do now, one could keep  up

with word for word signing.  But not everybody speaks  at

a  very  slow rate.  So, this could present a difficulty.

Many hearing-impaired people also adopt more of their own

simplified signing, which captures the gist of the ideas.

So,   when  we  talk  about  a  pool  of  people  to   do

simultaneous translations, so to speak, into sign, we  do

not  just require a person who can do exact word signing,

but  we  also  need somebody who understands the  subject

matter,  is  able to think on the spot, and  can  quickly

capture  the  essence of the message  and  translate  it.

That  is difficult.  We do not have a lot of people  that

we can call on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, knowing the

difficulties   of   providing   signing   for   important

programmes  for  the hearing-impaired, has  the  Ministry

asked the broadcasters for the cost of providing at least

sub-titling,  if not close captioning for such  important

programmes?   I  would also like to ask the  Minister  to

comment  on the fact that as the Government does  provide

funds  for  public service broadcasts - in  the  case  of

MediaCorp, to the tune of some $80 million a year - is it

not possible for the broadcasters to provide at least sub-titling for some programmes?  The Ministry could consider

providing some funds to the broadcasters to provide  such

services  for  important  programmes  like  daily   news,

documentaries and educational programmes.   Many  of  the

hearing-impaired  have  equal  intellectual  capacity  as

their hearing peers, and they would be able to understand

the  full  extent  of  the  programmes,  and  watch  such

programmes with their families.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Amy Khor, no speeches. Ask your

questions, please.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I am sorry. I would like to

inform  the  Minister that it was unfortunate that  there

was  no  sub-titling in the programme,  "Changing  Lives"

that  was shown on Channel NewsAsia in April 2002,  which

featured  Ms Erica Levi.  She is a well-known role  model

for the hearing-impaired community.  The hearing-impaired

could  actually  not get the full flow of  the  programme

because there was not even subtitling for that programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Dr Khor's question is whether we

could  consider sub-titling.  We have said that we  would

explore this.  But sub-titling means that it is no longer

signing.   It  is put into a form that is  in  a  regular

language,  so  to speak.  If you are then  talking  about

reading it off the television screen, you might also want

to  consider, in terms of the cost-effectiveness, whether

it is not more practical to read it off the newspapers or

the   Internet.   But  notwithstanding  that,  we   would

consider whether for important speeches, we can have more

sub-titling.  Sub-titling  can  sometimes  disturb  other

viewers.   Also, we can only sub-title, at most,  in  one

language,  and  we have got to decide which  language  we

want to sub-title in.  If we want to be able to reach  to

all  the  hearing-impaired, and we have got four official

languages that we want to sub-title in, then we would see

nothing else on the screen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, as most of the

important programmes are broadcast in English,  like  the

Prime  Minister's National Day Rally speech, would it  be

all right to provide sub-titling in English?  That is the

feedback  I have got from the hearing-impaired community.

In  addition, I would also like him to comment on what he

said in Parliament yesterday that images and pictures  on

the  television  screen conjure very  powerful  messages.

Together with the sub-titling, the hearing-impaired would

have  the  full  impact and implication of  the  speeches

made.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I am very gratified that

somebody listened to me yesterday. We said that we  would

consider.  I would take up her suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, coming back to the

hearing-impaired  and  signing,  I  appreciate  what  the

Minister  has  said about the signing  differences.   How

would  the  Minister account for Malaysia having  signing

over their news?  Is there something to be learnt there?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I am not familiar with which

particular  method  of signing the  Malaysians  use  over

their news.  But I am sure that there is something to  be

learnt there.

whether   his   Ministry  plans  to   approve   Singapore

Telecommunications' application to raise local  telephone

rates.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, SingTel has submitted a

proposal  to IDA to raise its local telephone rates.   In

assessing the case for an increase, the key consideration

is  whether  SingTel is incurring a deficit in  providing

fixed line local call services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA is currently auditing the data and information

supplied  by  SingTel.  The audit  will  take  some  time

because  there  is  a need for IDA to  clarify  the  cost

modelling and data with SingTel.  IDA expects to complete

its assessment, and reach a decision by the third quarter

of this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, in view of the

difficult times that we are facing now and the many other

increases from the various Ministries, would the Minister

consider  delaying this increase until  the  economy  has

recovered?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not yet

determined that there will be an

see whether or not there will be one.

willing to set up two community children's libraries, one

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam is asking for two

community children's libraries (CCLs) in Potong Pasir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated the criteria for the National Library

Board   to   consider  setting  up  community  children's

libraries  in  this House on 14th May this  year.   These

criteria  are  that  there must  be  demand  for  such  a

facility  and  sustainable  support  from  a  broad-based

community organisation to share the building and  running

costs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I expected

the  answer. Again, it is a refusal. The refusal has been

so  consistent that I am beginning to wonder  whether  or

not Opposition constituencies are discriminated against.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, do you want to reply to that?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> He did not ask a question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My question is whether or not

Opposition constituencies are discriminated, as libraries

are not allowed to be built there.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I mistook Mr

Chiam's  wondering for just thinking aloud.  The criteria

are  objective and apply as much to PAP wards as they  do

to  Opposition wards.  The PAP wards have  been  able  to

meet  these  criteria,  and I  would  urge  Mr  Chiam  to

consider.   I have not said "no".  I have just said  that

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL DAY FUNCTION AT THE ISTANA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether he will allow opposition Members of Parliament to

invite  their  grassroots leaders to attend the  National

Day  function hosted by the President of Singapore at the

Istana.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, the

National  Day  Reception at the Istana is hosted  by  the

President   to   celebrate   our   National   Day    with

representatives of key institutions in the public sector.

Invitations  are  also extended to those  who  have  made

significant  contributions to Singapore's development  in

the  various fields, including from the arts, sports, the

media,  social/voluntary  groups,  the  labour  movement,

professional  bodies  and business  sector,  as  well  as

official grassroots organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of Parliament, Mr Chiam See Tong is a

representative  of  a  key institution  of  our  society.

Hence, he and his wife are invited to the Reception.  The

key   leaders  from  official  grassroots  organisations,

including those from Potong Pasir, are also invited.  The

Reception is however not for political parties and  their

activists.    Hence,   those  who   help   him   in   his

constituency's political work are not invited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current guideline for invitation to the National

Day  Reception is rational and we feel that there  is  no

need to change it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, in fact, I attended one of

these  National Day functions and was asked by a PAP  MP.

He  said, "Chiam, what happened to your grassroots?   Why

aren't  they here?" I want to ask the Minister  of  State

whether or not PAP grassroots leaders are invited,  other

than the ones that he has mentioned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

provided  answers to whatever questions the  PAP  MP  has

asked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



Mr Chiam.  The answer is "no".  I think as far as the PAP

political party's activists are concerned, they would not

be  invited  if they are only helping the  PAP  in  their

political   work.   I  referred  to  official  grassroots

organisations.    These   are  the   grassroots   leaders

appointed by the People's Association under the  People's

Association  Act. That is what I referred to as  official

grassroots organisations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, may I ask the

invited to the function?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Civil society activists are

invited  but not all, because there are so many  of  them

and  the  Istana  ground is limited in space.   They  are

invited  from  time  to time.  For  different  years,  we

invite different groups.  I do not think the Think Centre

has been invited yet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Would they be considered

the grassroots leaders invited, not through the MPs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> How does the

from  Members of Parliament.  For the official grassroots

leaders,  they accept recommendations from  the  People's

Association.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify with the Minister

of  State that for these functions, MPs have got no  role

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



1st  August  2001.  The cover under the  Home  Protection

Scheme  was  premised on the condition that the  purchase

transaction would be subsequently completed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, Mr Yee passed away before he

completed  the  purchase transaction.  In  the  light  of

this, the CPF Board took the position that a housing loan

had not been taken, as Mr Yee was not the legal owner  of

the  flat  at the time of his sudden demise.   Therefore,

while  we  sympathised with Mdm Koh and her  family,  the

Ministry  was not able to accede to her appeals  and  had

the  CPF  Board discharge his loan liability to HDB  when

there was no outstanding housing loan to discharge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her subsequent appeals were rejected as the Board

explained that the Home Protection Scheme (HPS)  did  not

apply  to  Mr Yee since he had not withdrawn  any  monies

from  his CPF account to repay the HDB housing loan. This

was  premised on the interpretation of section  29(2)  of

the  CPF  Act  which provides that the HPS applies  to  a

member  of the CPF Fund who had withdrawn monies standing

to  his credit in the CPF Fund to repay any instalment of

housing  loan.   Prior  to this  case,  the  CPF  Board's

interpretation  and  procedures  had  worked   well   for

practically all the Home Protection Scheme cases.   In  a

way,  Mdm  Koh's case is exceptional as it  involved  the

question of whether there is insurance coverage before  a

person becomes a legal owner of his flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, my Ministry conducted

another  review  of  the  case and,  in  particular,  the

legislative  framework  which  governed  the  scope   and

application  of  the  Home  Protection  Scheme  was   re-examined.   I  thought  this  was  necessary  as  I   was

concerned that there may be pre-existing ambiguity in the

interpretation of the provisions governing the  scope  of

the  HPS.   In this regard, guidance was sought from  the

Attorney-General's Chambers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General's Chambers has

advised that the legislative scope of the Home Protection

Scheme is provided under section 29(1) of the CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



Act  and  that  this section did not require  Mr  Yee  to

complete  the purchase transaction or to withdraw  monies

from  his CPF account to repay the loan in order for  the

Scheme to apply to him.  It was sufficient if there was a

valid  housing  loan  discharge and the  Home  Protection

Scheme  premiums  had  been deducted.   Therefore,  since

there  was  in  place an agreement for HDB  to  extend  a

housing loan to Mdm Koh and her late husband jointly, and

the  Home  Protection Scheme premiums had  been  deducted

from the CPF accounts of Mdm Koh and her husband, the CPF

Board  could  discharge Mr Yee's liability to  repay  the

housing  loan  to HDB.  This review has brought  about  a

favourable outcome for Mdm Koh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of the review, the Board has also

looked  at past claims, rejection cases, in order to  see

if  there were similar cases that require a re-look.  The

Board  told  me  that there is only one case  that  might

require  re-consideration.  This case is  being  reviewed

now.   Similar  incidents are unlikely to  occur  in  the

future  as we have now clarified the legal interpretation

as to when the Home Protection Scheme coverage would take

effect  for cases of this nature. The CPF Board has  also

introduced new procedures to ensure that such cases  will

not be repeated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, in order to avoid any ambiguity in the

interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act,  my

Ministry  will  consider  amending  the  legislation.  We

intend  to  rephrase the legislation such that  the  Home

Protection Scheme coverage for a member would begin  once

there  is a valid housing loan agreement with the HDB  or

any  other  approved mortgagee and the HPS  premiums  are

deducted by the CPF Board.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> I thank the Minister for

his    long   and   very   extensive   explanation    and

clarification.    The  Minister  has  not   answered   my

question.  Has the Ministry and the CPF made a mistake in

the  interpretation of the law and, in this case, has  an

apology been made to Mdm Jenny Koh?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I have

explained to him the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



decision  to  reject  the appeal was  made  on  the  best

interpretation of the provisions in the CPF Act  at  that

time.   There  is  no question of a mistake.   It  was  a

question of how the interpretation, and subsequent review

of the legislative intent, was made.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Complaints on unsatisfactory workmanship)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for  National  Development (a) how many  complaints  have

been  received  by  HDB from residents of  unsatisfactory

workmanship in the design and build of flats in New Towns

such  as  Woodlands and (b) what is HDB doing  to  ensure

better  quality  control to overcome such  unsatisfactory

workmanship.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

under  the Construction Quality Assessment System,  known

as  CONQUAS  in  the  trade, run by BCA,  assessments  of

public and private residential projects have shown  that,

generally, the workmanship in HDB flats is comparable  to

the workmanship in private residential estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of complaints that HDB receives

concerning unsatisfactory workmanship in HDB flats varies

across towns and design types.  In the case of Woodlands,

for  every  1,000 flats completed in recent years,  about

200 instances of unsatisfactory workmanship were reported

within the defects liability period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of HDB's quality improvement system, regular

reviews  and analyses of public feedback are carried  out

so  that  continuous improvements to building design  and

finishes  can  be  made.  Over the years,  Sir,  HDB  has

pushed  for  the use of more pre-cast components  in  the

construction  of its flats to improve flat quality.   HDB

has also introduced several

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



measures to further improve certain aspects of its flats,

such  as  the tiles, doors, partition walls and  sanitary

fixtures.   For  example, HDB implemented an  improvement

programme for tiling works this year.  Training workshops

were  held for contractors' supervisors and handbooks  on

tiling    techniques   were   produced,   to    encourage

implementation of good practices.  Tilers,  Sir,  working

in  HDB  contracts are also now pre-screened and approved

to ensure that they are sufficiently skilled to carry out

such works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, Mr Speaker, Sir, if Dr Maliki knows of

any  defects  in  his estate within the defect  liability

period,  please  inform us so that we  can  look  at  the

nature of the problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> I wonder

whether  the  20%  complaint rate is acceptable  to  HDB,

because   200   out  of  every  1,000  new   flats   with

unsatisfactory workmanship is quite high.  Secondly, what

has the Ministry to say about the kind of quality control

mechanism  that  is  in  place?   Because  it  is  rather

disturbing  to  note that when HDB new flat  owners  come

into   their   flat,   they   realise   that   there   is

unsatisfactory  work done, and 20 out of every  100  flat

owners  would be facing the same problem.  Can the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary  please  clarify   the   quality

control  mechanism that is in place, and why is  it  that

the problem still occurs?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr

Maliki might have misread the statistics I quoted.  There

were 200 instances of unsatisfactory workmanship reported

within  the  defects  liability period  for  every  1,000

flats.   In one flat, there may be two or three instances

of  defects, eg, the flat owner may say these  tiles  are

not  polished, those tiles are not polished, so there are

two  instances.   So, it is not 200 flats  out  of  1,000

flats.   It  is  200  instances.  Some  flats  have  more

complaints, some flats have less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the number acceptable? It is in the nature of

construction that some defects do occur after  completion

of  the flats.  That is why, in all contracts, whether it

is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



private  condominiums, landed estates, or HDB  flats,  we

provide  a  one-year defects liability  period,  for  the

contractors to move in to remedy the defects.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, in my question, I

asked  specifically about design-and-build flats.  Can  I

clarify  with the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  whether

the  statistics  he quoted refer to all  design-and-build

flats  or to all flats?  Because the problem with design-and-build  flats is that the flat owners will go  in  and

expect  everything has already been done, and  they  feel

very  disappointed  when they find a lot  of  defects  in

their flats.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

most of the flats in Woodlands that Dr Maliki referred to

are of the premium type.  So, they are either design-and-build,  or  design  plus.  These  flats  come  with  full

finishings.   They  have completed kitchen,  as  well  as

tiles.  Because the flats have more fixtures, there tends

to  be a little bit more defects.  Compared, for example,

to  a  plain  vanilla 4-room flat, there are  no  kitchen

fixtures,  the  floors  are not tiled,  so  there  is  no

question  of tile complaints because there are no  tiles.

So,  there  are  slightly  more defects  than  the  plain

vanilla  standard type of flats.  In fact,  instances  of

defects  in Woodlands new town are lower than the  global

average across all towns.

<div align="center"><b>GAS PIPE TESTING IN BUKIT MERAH AREA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</b> asked the Minister for

Trade and Industry (a) why was combustible works such  as

gas pipe testing in the Bukit Merah area carried out from

6  to  7 pm, when human traffic could be high and (b)  in

the  Bukit Merah case, where work was carried out near  a

library  and  a  petrol station, why  was  the  area  not

cordoned off.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Chong for his

question.  I share his concerns and it gives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



us an opportunity to give some perspective on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it done in the first place? The reason is

that  parts  of the existing network of gas pipelines  in

Singapore  are  ageing.   It is more  cost  effective  to

rehabilitate  the pipelines rather than to  replace  them

with  new ones. This will also avoid public inconvenience

as our pipelines are laid under public roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now pipeline rehabilitation is an established

practice  in the gas industry world-wide since  the  mid-1970s,  and  the  technology has been  refined  over  the

years.  This technology is used in Japan, Europe and  the

USA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it done when human traffic could be high?

PowerGas  had  carried  out  high-pressure  tests   using

compressed air on parts of the rehabilitated pipeline  at

Jalan  Bukit  Merah  to check for their  integrity.   The

international  code of practice is for this  test  to  be

done  over a duration of 32 hours.  Pressure is gradually

increased  over 8 hours and then held at the  final  test

pressure   for   24  hours  before  being  brought   down

gradually.   As the test had to be done over an  extended

period,  PowerGas was not able to avoid having  the  test

done  during the 6.00 pm  to 7.00 pm period when  traffic

was high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what next? PowerGas had submitted its

investigation  report  to the  EMA.   EMA  has  formed  a

committee  of  experts from the LTA and MOM  to  consider

PowerGas'  report  and  recommend  measures  to   prevent

similar  occurrences in the future.  The  Committee  will

also review the adequacy of current safety measures, such

as  advance  notification to the public,  the  extent  of

public cordon area, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although PowerGas had cordoned off the most

vulnerable  parts  of  the  rehabilitated  pipeline,  the

Committee  will  be investigating why  PowerGas  had  not

cordoned off the entire area where the tests were carried

out.  The Committee targets its findings to be ready  end

July.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pipeline was not connected to the gas

distribution system.  So it was not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



combustible as the question suggested.  Hence, there  was

no   combustible  gas  in  the  pipeline  and  there  was

therefore  no danger of any gas leakage, or any  risk  of

fire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, PowerGas will stop all high

pressure testing until we know what went wrong,  and  how

to prevent recurrences and enhance safety.

<div align="center"><b>SELECTIVE EN-BLOC REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

National Development, in view of the glut in the property

market  whether (i) he will consider having a  moratorium

on the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme and, if so,

(ii) for how many years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Selective En-bloc

Redevelopment  Scheme (SERS) is part of the  Government's

estate  renewal  plans for old HDB estates.   It  enables

optimisation of land use, while enabling Singaporeans  to

upgrade  to  new and better housing.  Existing  community

ties  are  also  preserved.  Through  redevelopment,  old

estates  are rejuvenated.  Thus, SERS benefits  both  the

nation and the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of suitable precincts for SERS is an

on-going process.  It takes into account several factors,

including  the  potential  for  redevelopment   and   the

Government's  budgetary position.   The  Government  will

continue to progressively announce precincts for SERS  if

suitable  ones  can  be identified.  It  generally  takes

about 4-5 years after announcement for a SERS site to  be

ready  for new development.  Thus, the selection  of  new

SERS sites now should not have an immediate impact on the

property market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I understand that 4-storey

walk-up  flats are also involved in this SERS  programme.

If these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



walk-up   flats  are  pulled  down,  naturally  high-rise

buildings would be put up in their place.  Would that not

add  to  the  glut  in the property market  if  high-rise

buildings are built in place of the walk-up flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> In the first place, as I said, I

think  the  glut in the property market is not  something

that  is  permanent.   There is a cycle  in  the  market.

Eventually, the glut will be taken up, and there will  be

a  new status quo in the market.  So, it is not something

that  is permanent.  If there is a permanent glut in  the

market, then I think we would all be in serious trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SERS programme is a very long-term programme.

What  we  have  announced for SERS now, the redevelopment

would  only take place, say, five years at the  earliest.

By  that  time,  hopefully,  the  glut  would  have  been

removed.  I do not think the Member should have any cause

for  concern over that aspect.  Yes, it is true that when

we  do  SERS, we are going to increase the potential  for

redevelopment, ie, we tear down a 4-storey block, or even

a  11-storey block for that matter, and we are  going  to

build  something which will be much more intensive.   And

that  is one of the rationales for SERS.  That is  indeed

what  we  are  hoping to do.  Because, in the  long  run,

Singapore is short of land and we have to make sure  that

we maximise every piece of land that we have.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, in view of the many

properties in the market that are left unsold,  would  it

be  more  rational  not to add more new  flats  into  the

market?  Probably, the Government can make sure that SERS

programmes  are carried out rationally so as not  to  add

more property into the market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think there are two matters. One

is  the fluctuation in the property market.  There  is  a

glut  at  the  moment.   A few years  ago,  there  was  a

shortage.   So  this  is  a natural  fluctuation  of  the

property market.  Then there is the other matter which is

SERS, which is a very long-term programme.  We will do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



SERS   as   and   when  we  find  suitable  redevelopment

opportunities.   These sites will either  be  redeveloped

immediately,  and the effects of this redevelopment  will

be  felt, say, five years down the road, or we may decide

to  hold the sites as part of the land bank.  So, whether

we decide to build or not is a separate matter from SERS.

But   the   idea  of  SERS  is  to  free  up   land   for

redevelopment.

students.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my apologies for having arrived a little

late this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Steve Chia's question with regard to foreign

students,  out  of the 220,000 students in our  secondary

schools and Junior Colleges, 11,500 are foreign students.

That  is  about 5%.  Of these, about 2,200  (or  1%)  are

foreign  scholars.  For SAP schools, there are about  900

foreign  students,  or  6%, of  which  420  students  are

scholars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the university level, about 7,100 or 20% of the

undergraduates are foreign students.  Of these, 2,600 are

scholars.  There is no school or Junior College

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



where  foreign students outnumber local students or  come

anywhere  close  to  doing so.  Local  students  are  not

displaced by foreign students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scholarship for a foreign student comprises

school  fees or tuition fees, accommodation and a monthly

allowance  of  $200  for  a secondary  school  or  Junior

College student, or $500 for a university student.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talented foreign students add value to our schools

and  our  students.  Through their interaction  with  our

students, they provide a spur for our students and  allow

for  a more diverse school community.  When they stay  on

to contribute in Singapore after their studies, they help

to  contribute  to  our economy so that all  Singaporeans

benefit.   Even if they decide to return home eventually,

we  would  have  a network of Singapore-educated  friends

abroad.  This fraternity is a useful asset.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, have any local

students been edged out by these foreign students?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the short answer is

no.   If  we  look at the schools, we have  expanded  the

number  of  places.  We have provided for more autonomous

schools, besides the independent schools, over time.  All

our  schools are good schools, of course.  But if we take

those at the top end of the academic spectrum, there  are

now  many  more schools providing an excellent  education

and places for local students.  So, there is no trade-off

between the number of foreign students we take in and the

number  of  local  students able to  get  into  the  best

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, if we look at the universities and

polytechnics,  we have greatly increased  the  number  of

places  over the years for local students.  So, there  is

no trade-off.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  are  there  sufficient  numbers  of   pastoral

counsellors  in  the schools, the polytechnics,  and  the

universities  to  cope with the increase  in  counselling

case-loads  and what are the qualifications  required  of

these counsellors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir, our schools run a tiered counselling

system to meet students' counselling needs.  All teachers

are  in the first tier in dealing with students who  need

counselling  and advice.  They are all given training  in

Basic Counselling Skills.  Pupils who need a higher level

of  help are referred to Teacher Counsellors.  There  are

two  in  each  school.   These  Teacher  Counsellors  are

trained   in   more  advanced  counselling   and   crisis

intervention skills.  Pupils requiring further assistance

are  referred  to educational psychologists and  guidance

specialists  at  the  MOE,  ie,  the  Psychological   and

Guidance  Services Branch of the MOE.  We have  about  40

such  specialists,  all  with post-graduate  training  in

either education psychology or guidance and counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also provided with funds to engage part-time counselling services, and indeed this is quite

prevalent.  To further augment the counselling  resources

of  schools  and  school clusters, the School  Counsellor

Scheme   was  introduced  last  year.   We  have  trained

suitable retired education officers under the scheme,  so

that  schools  can tap on them as additional  counselling

support.   By July this year, 30 school counsellors  will

be  deployed to our schools or school clusters to provide

further  counselling support.  MOE is prepared  to  train

more  of such counsellors if schools need their services.

More  broadly, schools work with Family Service  Centres,

VWOs  and  the  self-help groups.  Taken in totality,  we

have a comprehensive network of support, and the Ministry

and  schools will be quite happy to work with the various

agencies to improve our use of this network of support.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities, polytechnics and ITE run their own

counselling services to meet the needs of their students.

Qualified   professional   counsellors   offer   personal

guidance and counselling supported by a network of  para-counsellors  drawn from among the academic  staff.   They

provide   a   range  of  services,  not  just  one-to-one

counselling  but  also  regular workshops  and  talks  on

topics  like emotional health, building of relationships,

and   stress  and  time  management.   The  universities,

polytechnics  and ITE have the autonomy to  deploy  their

resources   in  ways  that  best  serve  their  students,

including  providing more counselling  services  if  they

feel that this is necessary.

[*The  motion  also stood in the names of  Dr  Tan  Cheng

Bock,  Mr  Leong Horn Kee, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Chay  Wai

Chuen and Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 11th June 2002, the Public Transport Council

announced increases in the fares of public bus and  train

operations.  These increases, already operative since 1st

July,  are as follows: adult bus fares and adult  MRT/LRT

fares  by  3 cents and 4 cents respectively for commuters

using ez-link cards.  For those using magnetic fare cards

and  those paying cash, the increases went up by 5  cents

and   10  cents  respectively.   There  were  also  other

increases affecting students, NSmen and senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of the increases, there has

been a huge public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



outcry  over  these increases.  Many have questioned  the

explanations  put  forward  by  the  PTC  and   the   two

operators,  SBS  Transit and SMRT Corporation,  and  many

more question the timing of these increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members had submitted Questions for

Oral Answers on this issue, but I felt that merely asking

questions  would  not do justice to  the  groundswell  of

discontentment, and we would just get a  reply  from  the

Minister  for  Transport.   We  will  probably  ask  some

supplementary questions, get some answers, but  with  the

limited time available for questions, at the end  of  it,

we  will  all go home less than satisfied.  And we  would

have  failed  to articulate many of the concerns  on  the

ground, and the House would not have been able to take  a

position  on the issues.  I, therefore, decided to  table

this motion and got the support of five of my colleagues,

the  maximum allowed under Standing Orders, but I am glad

to  see  that  we  have a long list of  Members  who  are

waiting to speak on this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the issues that face us in debating

this  motion?   Let me start by explaining the  different

parts of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the midst of the worst recession since

independence  37 years ago.  There are no  signs  on  the

horizon that there is going to be an economic recovery in

the near future.  Yes, we may get promising statistics in

one  month  for our manufacturing sector or for  exports.

But  in  another month, these figures can come down.   So

there  is no definite trend that the outlook will improve

very   soon.   It  is  still  early  days  to  draw   any

conclusion.  Unemployment has exceeded 100,000  and  most

who have lost their jobs cannot find any work at all.  In

some cases, there are many who want to work for less  pay

but  the  jobs  are just not there.  Even  the  gainfully

employed  have difficulties making ends meet,  what  more

the unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement by the PTC of the fare increases

therefore came as a rude shock to Singaporeans,  as  they

felt that it could not have come at a worse time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



The  Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister had  told

the  House in May, when making his Budget statement, that

the  PTC had decided that there would be no need to raise

fares  next  year  as a result of the  increase  in  GST.

Little  did  we  know  that what the  PTC  meant  was  no

increase next year did not mean no increase this year!  I

do  not  know if you would call this twisted or  sardonic

humour, but I think it is, almost for sure, not funny  at

all to Singaporeans.  How sure are we that, next year, we

will  not  be told again by the PTC that never  mind  the

increase in GST, but operating and maintenance costs have

gone  up  again  and therefore we have  to  have  another

increase in fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has come out to question the

timing of the increases.  On 17th June, he was quoted  in

the  press as having said that this is not the best  time

to  put  up  the increases, and I think the House  should

endorse what he had said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House must therefore solicit some definitive

response  from the Government at the end of this  debate.

I  have asked that the PTC review its decision and I will

elaborate further on this later.  We need to know how the

PTC  arrives  at  its decision, whether the  reasons  put

forth  by  the transport companies for the increases  are

justifiable, and we need to know how the PTC  intends  to

act  with  regard to future requests for fare  increases.

We  need to know if the PTC will not just respond to  the

requests  of  the  transport companies,  but  whether  it

intends   to   respond   also  to   prevailing   economic

circumstances and to the needs of the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is not just about bus and MRT fares. It

also  has to do with the slew of increases in charges  of

other public services that have taken place, or are about

to  take  place.  Sir, I believe that this  is  the  main

cause  of discontent on the ground.  Consider this:   GST

up,  ERP  up,  petrol up, car park charges up,  telephone

charges  soon  to be up, and, of course, unemployment  is

up, retrenchment is up.  Morale is upside down, and so is

our  pay,  it is down.  People are not only fed up,  they

are  frightened about their future.  As a  cartoon  in  a

local newspaper puts it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



graphically,  all these price increases,  to  parody  the

title of a movie that was just shown, add up to "The  Sum

of  All  Fears"  for Singaporeans.  The public  transport

fare increase has become the single issue on which to peg

all  other frustrations, and some of these may  not  even

have to do with price increases.  This issue has become a

lightning rod.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was therefore appalled by the response of the

Minister  for  Transport when he was asked by  the  press

what  he thought of the price increases.  He said, "While

unemployment has gone up, 95% of Singaporeans  are  still

working."  Well, really!  Sir, he is telling us  what  is

the big deal, only 5% are not working, so what is all the

fuss about.  Well, let me tell him that 5% unemployed  is

just  5% too much.  Will we next be telling these  5%  of

the  population that if they cannot have  food  on  their

table,  it  is  all right because the other  95%  of  the

population can feed themselves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans have already lost their jobs, and

many  more  have  taken pay cuts.  So, let  us  not  make

callous remarks to dampen morale even further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also refuted the allegation that

the  transport companies are profiteering from the  price

increases.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They must have a rate of return that is reasonable

and  which is not excessive.  You cannot control them  to

the extent that they lose money."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both transport operators have cited increased

costs,  such  as wages, the increases in CPF contribution

from  12% to 16% since January last year, and investments

in  service improvements, as reasons for asking  for  the

increases in fares.  The PTC has said that it wants  them

to remain financially viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there was a time when CPF contributions

were  reduced  from 20% to 12%, but I do not  recall  the

transport companies reducing their fares.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of wage increases, which they have

used as a reason, perplexes me.  Today, in Singapore, the

Government,  the trade unions and the employers  are  all

calling  for wage restraint.  Wages are frozen.   Bonuses

are  lowered.  You are lucky if your wages have not  been

cut.   So,  what  is  this  wage increase  that  the  two

companies are talking about?  Is it to get more staff  to

provide for new operations and new routes?  Would the new

revenue from new routes not cover the wages of additional

staff?   Or  are  they  telling us  that  the  staff  has

actually got wage increases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a report in today's Straits Times

headlined  "Slashing of staff and fuel  costs  helps  SIA

stay in the black."  It says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The national carrier cut staff costs by some 14.5%

or $188 million to a total figure of $1.13 billion [a cut

of 14.5%].  This was despite a larger staff strength with

the company employing 3.9% or 539 more staff ."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how is it that SIA can rein in its staff costs

and  enjoy savings in its wage bill even though it had  a

larger  staff  strength?   It  too  had  to  face  larger

contribution  to  the  employees'  CPF.   The  answer  is

simple.   Singapore  Airlines is in a  business  that  is

highly  competitive.   Not  only  that,  last  year,   as

everyone  knows  was  the  most difficult  year  for  the

airlines  business,  especially after  the  September  11

attacks.  SIA was confronted with the first possible loss

in  its history.  It did what many sensible businesses in

such  times do to stay alive.  It imposed wage cuts  from

2.5%  to 15%.   When passenger load factors fell, did  it

increase  ticket  prices  to make  up  for  the  loss  in

revenue?   As  many Singaporeans happily found  out,  SIA

slashed prices so that it could keep its planes flying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there we have it. Three companies are operating

in the broader transport sector.  One proves itself to be

highly  cost-efficient, overcoming all odds  to  turn  in

another profitable year in a highly competitive industry.

Two  other  companies in a highly protective environment,

perpetually  grousing about higher  costs  and  demanding

more from its customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS Transit also says that its ridership fell by 3%

last year and in the first four

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



months  of this year, it fell another 2.8%.  I  now  have

one  question to ask.  According to the Chairman  of  SBS

Transit in his year 2001 Annual Report, TIBS took over 17

SBS services and this transfer of the 17 services to TIBS

had  an impact of $13.9 million on the bottom line of SBS

Transit.   It  was SBS who chose to lose this  source  of

income  by  giving  up  the routes.   It  therefore  lost

ridership   because  it  gave  up  the  routes   to   its

competitor.  Is it justifiable to use this as  an  excuse

to make up for its loss in revenue and make the customers

pay more?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they tell me that this is not the reason but

that there are just simply less people taking their buses

these  days,  then let me say that what SBS is  doing  to

overcome  the  situation  is  certainly  very  unorthodox

business practice.  Any businessman will tell you that if

you  find your customers running away, the last thing you

do  is  to  increase  the  prices  of  your  products  or

services.   What you do is to hold on to your prices,  or

you   reduce   prices,  you  give  discounts,   you   run

promotions,  take  a  cut in your margins  and  keep  the

goodwill of your customers during the bad times, and  not

frighten  them away with even higher prices so that  they

will run into the arms of your competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our two transport operators can do this because

there  is  no competitive environment in their  business.

The  two companies do not compete with one another on the

same  routes,  so that is why, even during  a  recession,

they  can  put  up prices with such impunity.   There  is

simply  no  incentive for them to find ways to do  things

better and more economically to keep the loyalty of their

customers.  It is a question of take it or leave it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me illustrate this point further. I have

here  a news report from the South China Morning Post  of

Hong  Kong  dated Friday, 5th July.  The  headline  reads

"MTR  [that  is  the mass transit rail]  extension  fares

undercut buses".  It says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hong Kong MTR announced that its fares will be up

to  23% cheaper than travelling by bus when a new service

starts on 18th August.  Fares on the rail will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



also  fall  between 2.9% and 22% lower than on comparable

bus  routes  operated by three other bus  companies.   In

addition  to  the  lower fares, MTR  will  also  grant  a

promotional  discount  of  $2  for  Octopus  card   users

[Octopus  card is their equivalent of our fare card]  for

two weeks after the new service commences."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report then goes on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The announcement prompted some bus operators to

consider  cutting fares to remain competitive.   A  First

Bus   Company   [this  is  one  of  the  bus   companies]

spokeswoman said the company welcomed competition."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Kowloon Motor Bus Company added it may review

routes and fares. ."



This  report  adds that the bus companies would  consider

rearranging their routes and reduce the number  of  stops

to  cut  their fares.  An MTR official then responded  by

saying  that  the MTR fares "were set in accordance  with

affordability,    market   competition    and    economic

conditions.  We don't take into account bus company fares

but we would like to pledge value for money ."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they did take into account the bus fares.

That  is why the MTR lowered their fares.  But note  what

the  MTR  spokesman said, he used the words,  "value  for

money."  That is the basis of competition.  You add value

to every dollar your customer pays so that you can retain

their loyalty.  In the Hong Kong MTR, they have just, not

too  long ago, added glass doors at their stations,  like

what we have in our MRT system, and these doors open only

when  the  trains arrive.  It is a safety feature.   They

have  also  added, not too long ago, display  signs  that

tell  you  when such and such a train will  arrive.   But

they  did not pass on all these costs to commuters.  That

is value for money.  That is part of the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in Singapore, any slightest service improvement

becomes a frill, or is a frill that no one asked for, and

they  will  ram the costs down your throats:  TV  Mobile,

plasma  information screens, piped-in  radio  programmes,

etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMRT has justified the higher operating costs by

pointing to examples, such as its new information  system

and even things like adding more benches for us to sit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



down  at station platforms.  Another reason it has  given

is  that  it will incur another $4 million in expenditure

to  run the new service to Changi Airport.  Well, are you

not  supposed to collect revenue from a new service  that

will  cover your operating costs?  I remember  that,  for

years  in  this House, Members were clamouring  for  this

service  to Changi Airport, and we were always told  that

it  could  not be done because there was just not  enough

passenger  traffic.   But we were finally  told  that  we

could have it as the service was found to be viable.   So

what  is  this passing of an additional cost to  run  the

line to Changi to commuters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what they do in Hong Kong. They run a new

line, but they do not tell commuters that it is going  to

cost them more money to run the service, and so they have

got  to  raise  fares throughout the whole island.   They

reduce prices for the new line in order to compete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard that the buses are also to be linked to

a  Global Positioning System so that fare stages will  be

automatically updated instead of being done  manually  as

they  are  being  done  now, and costly  panels  will  be

provided  at bus stops and LRT stations to provide  real-time  information.   How much will  these  cost?   Do  we

really  need  them?  Do these add value to customers?   I

think  the  management of these companies should  realise

that  all  commuters want is to get  from  one  point  to

another  without all these frills that they will have  to

pay for ultimately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not everybody wants to travel first class. For

the  majority, all they want is a no-frills economy class

trip.   What is the point of spending all that  money  on

things that your customers do not seem to appreciate  and

you tell them that they have to pay for it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about retaining customer loyalty? Not too long

ago,  Hong Kong MTR gave a rebate to its passengers.   If

they  used  their farecard 10 times within a  week,  they

gave  the commuters a rebate.  Until last week, they  ran

another promotion.  Use their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



farecards  10 times in a week and they get a  free  lunch

voucher  with  Tai Ka Lok, a fast-food chain,  and,  this

week,  it is even better: use the same card for 10  times

within a week and they get a voucher for dinner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how is that for competition? Hong Kong MTR

does  not  need to hide behind the skirts of  any  public

transport authority to tell them how to stay alive.  They

know  what to do.  Many of us who have been to Hong  Kong

and travelled on their buses and their MTR know that they

do not boast of a world-class transport system - not that

ours  is  anyway  -  but  they  have  a  system  that  is

efficient, reliable and at reasonable prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the situation here? If we recall, last

July, SBS and TIBS feeder fares went up by 10 cents.  The

Singapore  School and Private Hire Bus Owners Association

sought  the  PTC's permission to run feeder services,  as

the  Association felt that it could provide  lower  fares

than  SBS  and TIBS.  What was the response of  the  PTC?

Instead  of  allowing the competition, which  would  have

meant  lower  prices for everyone, the PTC  rejected  the

application  on  the grounds that the  private  operators

would  not  be  able  to provide "a seamless,  integrated

transport  system  that  gives  maximum  convenience   to

commuters."  These are the PTC's own words, "a  seamless,

integrated   transport   system   that   gives    maximum

convenience to commuters."  In other words, in  order  to

compete  with SBS and TIBS, the private bus owners  would

have  to provide for a fare card system which, of course,

is  a  non-starter for them, considering the large amount

of  investments in technology for a fare card system.   I

understand  that  such  an  investment  would  cost  them

millions of dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the PTC, the word "seamless" means only a fare

card  payment  system  when you travel  by  the  two  bus

companies and by rail.  But, to the customers, "seamless"

means  getting to point A and point B, and maybe to point

C,  and he does not care if it is an SBS or TIBS bus that

comes  along,  as long as the bus gets him  to  where  he

wants on time and at a low price.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  would  have  gained,  but  competition  was

nipped in the bud by the PTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC said further that the private bus operators

could  not pick only the profitable routes, as this  went

against the principle of balanced coverage which SBS  and

TIBS had to observe.  In other words, they cannot cherry-pick  their  routes.  It claimed that it wanted  a  level

playing field.  Yet, it forgot that the playing field was

already  not level when it allowed SBS and TIBS to  offer

charter bus services, which had all along been the domain

of  the private bus operators.  The private bus operators

were  also  trying  to make up for under-provided  feeder

routes  at  that time in the new towns like  Punggol  and

Sengkang,  which  were just not well served  by  the  big

boys.   But,  I  suppose, this did not  figure  in  PTC's

reasoning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the PTC calls it levelling the playing field. I

think it was just plain keeping out the competition  and,

in the end, it was the common man who lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the viability of the two big companies?

The  Minister also says let us not wait till they go bust

before  we increase prices, and that they have to make  a

certain  amount of profits on their assets to  make  them

viable.   He  says  that if they do not  get  their  fare

increases,  they are going to make losses and they  would

not be viable.  Sir, does he not know that in a recession

almost every business is just making less today?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at how profitable or unprofitable

SBS  Transit  and  SMRT are.  SBS Transit  made  profits,

after  tax, of $21 million in 1997, $35 million in  1998,

$42 million in 1999, $51 million in 2000, and $39 million

in 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, profit figures do not tell the whole picture,

but  let us look at their return on equity, which is  the

paid-up  capital and reserves combined.  For SBS Transit,

return on equity: 24.4% in 1997, 30.6% in 1998, 28.3%  in

1999, 24.7% in 2000, and 17.9% in 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the shareholders of SBS Transit, it must be a

good investment.  Each SBS

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



share   has  a  par  value  of  25  cents.   Last   year,

shareholders were rewarded with a dividend return of 34%,

in  spite of the dip in profits.  In the previous  years,

they  got  between  12%  and  49%.   In  fact,  in  1997,

shareholders received a very nice 36 cents for  each  25-cent share that they owned.  Total payout to shareholders

in   the  last  two  years:  $27  million  was  given  to

shareholders in 2000 and, in 2001, shareholders  received

a total of $19 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at SMRT. SMRT is a little

complicated.   It  was Singapore MRT  Ltd,  and  then  it

became  SMRT Corporation when it was listed as  a  public

company in July 2000.  So, I will just take it from  that

year.  In the reporting period before it was listed, SMRT

Corporation  made  a  profit of $180  million.   For  the

financial  year  ending 31st March 2001, it  earned  $102

million  and,  for the year ending 31st March  2002,  ie,

just  ended not too long ago, it earned $56 million,  all

at  the group level.  Return on equity:  26% in 2001 and,

for last year, 14%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at SMRT Corporation's dividend

payout.   Each  SMRT share has a par value of  10  cents.

For  the  year  ended 31st March 2001, it declared  three

dividend  payments amounting in total to a dividend  rate

of  46%.   For  its  latest reported year,  the  dividend

payout  rate was 28%.  Total amount of money paid out  to

shareholders:  $52 million in 2001, and  $32  million  in

2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation have policies

of   paying   half   their  yearly   profits   to   their

shareholders.   Members might recall that in  1978,  when

SBS   was  listed,  the  Government  actually  guaranteed

shareholders a dividend rate of 71/2%, because it was the

first  time  the Government was allowing the use  of  CPF

funds to members of the public to buy shares of companies

listed  on  the Stock Exchange, and it wanted to  provide

this  form of assurance and to encourage members  of  the

public  to  invest in SBS.  In 1993, this  guarantee  was

withdrawn as SBS had in fact been paying more than  71/2%

and, as we have seen, with the type of dividends that  it

has  been  paying  in the past few years,  the  guarantee

would have been superfluous.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return on equity of both SBS Transit and SMRT

Corporation  exceeds the ROEs of many other companies  in

the  broad  transport sector of companies listed  on  the

Stock Exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there you have it, two highly profitable

companies   making   very   good   returns   for    their

shareholders.  And do not forget that from next year  on,

they will pay less corporate tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing against shareholders

receiving   what  is  rightly  due  to  them  for   their

investments.   Do not get me wrong.  And the shareholders

must  be  happy  if we look at the share prices  of  both

companies today.  They have always been quite consistent.

Based  on their share prices, SBS Transit and SMRT  offer

respectable dividend yields of 5% and 4% respectively  to

their shareholders.  And the market cannot be wrong about

the  profitability of these companies.  That is  why  the

share prices of these companies have remained strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish I had bought shares in SBS Transit and

SMRT instead of in SingTel, but that is another story for

another  day.  Maybe the Government should have given  us

loyalty  shares  in these two companies  instead  and  we

would  not  be complaining so much, and we would  all  be

shareholders of two very profitable companies and then we

do  not  mind paying 3 cents more because, at the end  of

the year, we will get such nice dividends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to tell us that these two companies are going to

run  into great financial straits if they do not increase

their  fares now?  These are companies tottering  on  the

edge  of  bankruptcy?  It is more like the case of  Money

Not  Enough  for these two companies.  And to  use  scare

tactics - if you do not give us this increase we would be

in  trouble  -  and  try  to  wring  the  necks  of  poor

commuters,  I say each and every Singaporean should  rise

and  tell  them,  "Give us a better line  because  I  Not

Stupid."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It, therefore, brings me to the question of what is

the role of the PTC in all this.  How does it come to the

conclusion  that  if  fares are not increased,  then  the

operations would not be viable?  Is it, in fact, the duty

of  the  PTC to ensure the profitability of the transport

operators, or are they supposed to ensure that everyone - the bus companies, you and I - get a fair shake?  I think

the  PTC  must  remember that it should  not  become  the

apologist for the transport operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chief executives of SBS Transit, SMRT

and  TIBS  doing on the PTC?  They would be  there  armed

with  facts and figures to support their arguments.   But

should  they  not be asked to appear before  the  PTC  to

state their case, instead of being part of the PTC?   How

can  the players in the game be the referees at the  same

time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in my Motion, I have asked that the PTC

review these fare increases.  I could have used the words

"reverse  its  decision", but I do not want to  undermine

the  work of the PTC because, in a lot of other areas,  I

can  say that the PTC does good work.  So, I do not  want

to  adopt  a confrontational approach.  And I  chose  the

word "review" to give it more leeway and allow it to come

up   with  other  options.   Perhaps  it  could  be  some

ingenious  way, as the Hong Kong MTR has  gone  about  to

keep its commuters happy, or maybe the two companies, SBS

and  SMRT, can think of something and consider  making  a

gesture  to  Singaporeans in order to sweeten the  ground

which  is, certainly, in a very sour mood now.   Why  can

the  two companies not show some compassion for those who

have  been  very badly hit by the economic  downturn?   I

think a reasonable gesture on the part of SBS Transit and

SMRT  will go some way to alleviate some of the pain that

Singaporeans are going through.

Ultimately,    the   Government   has    an    overriding

responsibility  in  easing the pain of  its  citizens  in

times  like  this.   It  is, after all,  through  Temasek

Holdings,  the  main shareholder of SMRT and,  therefore,

the largest beneficiary of the profits made by SMRT.  SBS

Transit's  largest  shareholder  is  Delgro  Corporation,

which owns

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



75%  of  shares in SBS Transit.  I do not know  who  owns

Delgro.  All the large shareholdings are in the hands  of

nominee  companies and investment funds. But I hope  that

the shareholders of Delgro will understand that when they

are  in  a  privileged position to run  a  country's  bus

service  on  what is practically an exclusive basis  and,

on  top of that, they are going to get to run a rail line

soon, they have to realise that apart from ensuring  that

they  get  a fair return on their investments, they  also

have  a  social  obligation to ensure that  the  services

their company provides remain affordable and that it does

not  cause undue burden to the people, and that in  times

of great difficulty, that obligation becomes even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, the greatest obligation is on the

part  of the Government which must ensure that all public

services  remain affordable.  If the Prime Minister  says

that  this  is  not  the  best time  to  increase  public

transport  fares, then it is also not the  best  time  to

increase  the prices of many other public services.   The

Ministry   of  National  Development  wants  to  increase

carpark  charges very soon, on the grounds that it  needs

to  cover  the cost of building their carparks,  ie,  the

cost  of building carparks has increased.  Sir, I pointed

out  in the Committee of Supply that the cost of building

carparks  today,  as given by the Minister,  is  in  fact

cheaper than the cost of building the carparks years ago.

The  Minister could not give me a satisfactory reply  and

he is now just proceeding ahead to raise carpark charges.

This  is  just one example of the Government going  ahead

with  a  price  increase, even though its  arguments  for

doing  so have been shown to be unsound.  There are  many

other  examples, but I will leave these to my  colleagues

to elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, people are once again asking: is the

Government  listening  or not?  People  are  angry  today

because  they feel that there are just too many increases

in  such a short space of time and, not only that, during

the  worst  of time.  There never will be a correct  time

for  any price increase, but they are asking why  it  has

got to be now, when they are out of jobs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



or  when those with jobs are earning less, or are  unsure

of whether they will still have their jobs tomorrow.  The

Government asks us to tighten our belts, even earn  less,

do not be fussy if we earn less.  But how can they if the

Government is putting up the prices of things  which  are

essential to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say, let us keep everything in check. We are

not   asking  for  hand-outs.  We  are  not  even  asking

Government to subsidise the bus services.  But  when  you

are  providing  essential public services,  do  strike  a

balance  between  making money and  making  the  services

affordable.   When people are already suffering,  do  not

add more pain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has asked: should we be doing

the  right thing or should we be doing the popular thing?

Let  me  answer by saying this.  Recently, private school

bus  operators have been slapped with an increase in  the

insurance premiums on their vehicles of between 140-500%.

The  Singapore School Transport Association  has  advised

its  members  not to raise fares for school children,  at

least  for  now.   The Association's  Chairman  has  been

reported  as saying that raising fares now would  not  be

desirable.  I quote, "The economy is bad, how to increase

fares?"  These are words from the small guys.  Does  this

not say it all?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the anger on the ground. Let me put it

squarely to the Government by relating an encounter  that

I  had  with a perfect stranger just a few days ago.   He

expressed  his  anger and frustration at  all  the  price

increases to me in a very cool way.  He was not saying it

very loudly, but in a very calm way.  He told me that  he

observed  that  every  time after an  election,  the  PAP

increased prices and by the time the next election  came,

people would have forgotten and they would just vote  for

the  PAP again.  He then smiled at me and said, "Mr  Tan,

just  tell  your leaders, next time round, we  would  not

forget."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support the motion standing in the name  of  my

Parliamentary colleague, Mr Tan Soo Khoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two parts to this motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, I would like to raise a point of clarification based

on  what  Mr Tan Soo Khoon had said just now.  He  quoted

DPM's  speech during the recent Budget debate,  and  gave

the  impression that PTC would not be approving  any  bus

fare  increase this year.  Sir, far from it. DPM was,  in

fact, very clear about this.  Let me quote what DPM said.

He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently

evaluating  proposals  from the  transport  operators  to

revise fares.  PTC is only considering revisions to catch

up with operating and maintenance cost increases over the

past year."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The public transport operators have raised with the

PTC  the  issue  of  the GST increase  next  year.  After

considering their views, with the likely increase in  GST

to  5% and the proposed cut in the corporate income  tax,

the  PTC has decided that there is no need to raise fares

next  year as a result of the GST increase. The transport

operators have accepted this decision."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Mr Tan would get his quotes

correct.  I would reply to his other points later on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in the Budget Statement, I

think the Deputy Prime Minister did say that the PTC  has

decided  that there would be no need to raise fares  next

year as a result of the increase in GST.  That was what I

said.   I  did say that if that was what was stated,  the

PTC meant no increase next year, but what we did not know

was that there would be increases this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> This is precisely what I have

just said. The DPM did not give any impression at all  to

the  House that there would be no increase this year.   I

think   Mr   Tan,   in   delivering  his   remarks,   has

inadvertently or deliberately created the impression that

the  DPM had, in fact, misled the House. There is no such

thing.  The record is very clear.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in my speech, if you could

look  at the verbatim reports, I do not think that I have

given  the  impression that DPM was deliberately  setting

out to mislead the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Anyone who has been in this

House  and  who has heard him cannot be under  any  other

different impression.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two

parts to this motion.  I shall respond to the second part

first, because it is a call on the Government to go  slow

on increases in the cost of services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the motion, Mr Tan Soo Khoon outlined his

reasons  why he thinks that the rise in public  transport

fares  and  other  fares  should be  avoided  during  the

current  recession.  He has made a thorough  analysis  of

the  transport companies to show why he thinks that  this

rise in bus fares is not justified.  I do not want to  go

over the grounds he covered and probably, I would not  be

able  to  do it so well.  He has done a good job.  But  I

will  reinforce some of the salient points  that  he  has

made.   He  reflected the sentiments and frustrations  of

Singaporeans  very adequately, and I share  his  concerns

and hope our leaders are listening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rising to support him, I am drawn back to a

session  I had with some Singaporeans on current  issues,

including the rise in bus fares, electricity tariffs, MRT

fares,  HDB parking fees, ERP charges and so on.  In  the

course  of the discussions, I was reminded by one of  the

members  of  the  public that we have  been  testing  the

limits  of  tolerance of Singaporeans with each increase.

He  said  that  we  are over-confident  and,  in  a  way,

arrogant,  because  we have just  won  the  GE  with  75%

majority.   He  reminded me that they gave us  this  high

mandate,  because they had hoped that the  PAP  can  help

better  improve their lives in these times of need.   And

also,  as  promised  in  our  manifesto,  he  said   that

Singaporeans truly believe that the PAP is the only party

that  can help them out of this recession.  But  now,  it

seems  that  we are making life more and more  tough  for

them.  Within six months

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



of  GE,  a  rash  of price increases - how  not  to  feel

betrayed, they complained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Singaporeans are asked to tighten

their  belts  through  various  measures,  such  as  wage

restraint,  no  bonuses  and more  and  more  job  losses

through   restructuring.  They  now  face  a  series   of

increasing  costs in their daily lives. He said  that  he

and  his  friends  are  dead water.   Those  of  you  who

understand  Hokkien - I am a Hokkien  speaker   -   "dead

water"  literally translated means "si chui", as  opposed

to "wa chui", which means alive, flowing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> "Chou chui"!

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Not "chou chui", please. It is

different.  "Chou chui" means smelly water.  He said that

in  a flowing stream, "wa chui", there is hope, something

would  come by to keep them alive.  They are hoping  that

after  GE,  Government would do something to create  more

jobs,  hold  prices  and give them  a  better  chance  of

survival.   Now,  he  feels that he is  "si  chui",  dead

water,  and  dead water gets evaporated every  day.   The

various  increases  evaporate whatever  savings  he  has,

slowly   but  surely.   He  said  the  Government  always

justifies by saying that there is no such thing as  wrong

timing.    The  Government's  action  in  this   economic

downturn is not bad timing.  Sir, if you had listened  to

what  my  colleague has just said about  the  person  who

complained to him about this poor economic condition, you

will  understand  why.   Of course,  Singaporeans  cannot

understand.  Unemployment is now almost 5%, and  if  this

is not bad, then what is bad?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if in spite of the poor state of the economy we

allow  the fare increases, are we not ignoring the plight

of  the  people?   We  seem  to  be  concerned,  like  my

colleague said, about the return of equity for companies,

even   though  these  companies  are  still  making  good

profits.   We  talk  about high cost  structures  in  our

economy, yet we do not try to delay the increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person, who is usually very quiet, got up to

tell me and he said "You",

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



meaning the PAP, "are so powerful that you cannot see the

wrong in yourself."  This statement got me thinking, very

profound.   But it tells something.  Are we  so  powerful

that  we can go along with all these increases?  We allow

bus  operators  to sit in PTC, as Mr Tan  Soo  Khoon  has

said,  and  we see no wrong.  We cannot see their  vested

interest and conflict of interest in such an arrangement.

And no wonder writers in the forum page have always asked

for  an  independent  PTC  panel.   Perhaps,  after  this

debate,  there  should be a review on the composition  of

the PTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also saying that we "see no wrong in

ourselves" by quoting PSA.  Yes, look at PSA - a hardened

stand,  defended  almost to death, even when  faced  with

fierce  competition on our doorsteps.  They were probably

thinking  of  protecting their profits, their  return  on

equity   -   too  cocksure  of  their  so-called   "other

advantages".    They  were  unable  to  see   the   wider

implications  until  they  lost  two  of  their   largest

customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Motion before the House which calls for the

PTC  to  review  its decision on the increase  in  public

transport  fares, I think Mr Tan Soo Khoon has elaborated

on  this, and he did a marvellous job.  But I would still

like  to  add a few points to what he has said.   It  may

seem  odd that we should be asking for a review when  the

fare  hike is already in place but, like what he said  in

the  press, we had no opportune time.  Parliament  sat  a

few  days  after  the  fare increases  were  implemented.

Singaporeans must try to understand how the  decision  to

raise  fares came about.  I think what they want is  more

transparency.   Even I, like them, cannot understand  why

the  PTC turned down an earlier request, in 2001, for  an

increase   in  fares  because  of  unfavourable  economic

situation.  Then, suddenly, it changed its mind this year

and  opted  for  an  increase,  when  the  poor  economic

situation  has  not changed.  Has the economic  situation

improved  in  2002  to warrant this change  in  decision?

Yet,  this House was told by the Finance Minister in  the

last  Budget debate that 88,000 Singaporeans were out  of

work, and now my colleague has told me that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



it  is 100,000.  Unemployment has reached 4.5% by the end

of last year, and the figure is still going up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason cited for the increases is ERP and

road  taxes  added  to  the cost.  I  checked  with  LTA,

because  I  am on the LTA Board.  For the year 2002,  the

projected increase in ERP cost alone, according  to  SBS,

is  $0.7 million.  But this House must know that when ERP

was  implemented in 1998, it was decided that ERP charges

should  apply to all vehicles which use roads,  and  that

includes public buses.  Just like other road users,  they

also  contribute to road congestion.  However, to  offset

the cost implication of introducing ERP, the road tax  of

public buses was reduced by $3,900 for each single-decked

bus,  and $3,500 for each double-decked bus.  The overall

road  tax savings for the public bus operators, TIBS  and

SBS included, amounted to $13 million annually.  Now this

more than offset the ERP charges of about $4 million paid

by  the  public bus operators today.  The ERP charges  on

public   buses  therefore  do  not  contribute  to   cost

increases  for  the operators.  My other colleagues  must

have  more  to  say  and I would not want  to  dwell  any

further on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, if the current recession has been thrown out

as  a  consideration  for  the increase,  then  the  more

compelling  reasons must have prevailed, and  given  more

weightage by PTC, to protect the profitability of the bus

companies.   Now, is there a formula or magic  number  to

this?  While I support the Motion, I can quite understand

the  bus fare increase is but one issue, like what Mr Tan

Soo Khoon has said, and it so happened that the level  of

tolerance has reached a high level.  And, again like what

my  colleague, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has said,  the  bus  fare

increase is probably the lightning rod, receiving all the

flak.   This  debate should be seen as an eye-opener  for

the  Government not to take the people for granted.   For

such public services, where there are no true competitive

forces, Government should not allow any increases without

acceptable reasons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am heartened to hear the

two  Tans  who spoke before me.  I would like to  commend

them.  At least, now I know that there are PAP Members in

the  PAP Backbench who do care for the common man in  the

street.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion. I

say it is very unfair for the Public Transport Council to

allow the bus and MRT fares to be increased at this point

of  time when times are hard.  The worse effects  of  the

recession  are  still not over.  Workers  who  have  been

retrenched are still suffering, the majority of whom have

not  been re-employed.  They are still floundering in the

wilderness  of unemployment.  The Government, instead  of

helping   them  ease  their  suffering,  is  making   the

situation worse for the unemployed.  With this  bus  fare

hike,  they  have to pay more for one of their  essential

needs - transportation.  With the fare hike of between  3

cents  and  10  cents, the average worker shall  probably

have  to pay about 10-20% more for bus rides, taking into

account the over-payment they shall have to make with the

introduction  of the ez-link cards due to  the  fault  in

their  cards, and also their forgetfulness.  Why  squeeze

the  poor workers at this point of very difficult  times?

I  would like to call on the Government to get the PTC to

revoke  forthwith  the decision to  increase  bus  fares,

which  have  been increased with effect  from  July  this

year,  and  to freeze the bus fare hike for at least  one

year,  or  until  the  economic  situation  significantly

improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, the Government shall also be the

beneficiary  when  there  is  a  bus  fare   hike.    The

Government  shall be assured of payments of the  proposed

increase  in  GST and the ERP charges.  As  for  the  ERP

charges,  it  was  reported  that  the  Government  shall

collect something like $4.2 million a year from buses  in

Singapore.   Buses may have to pay more ERP charges  when

the   night  ERP  charges  come  into  effect.   The  bus

companies  are, in a way, a means for the  Government  to

transfer  the commuters' money into its own pocket.   The

bus  companies'  excuse for fare hikes is  the  increased

cost,  especially of staff salary.  They  say  that  they

have to pay more CPF to their workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



when  the employer's CPF component was restored a further

4%  in  January  2000.   However, the  CPF  paid  by  bus

companies to their workers are still lower than the  pre-1998  level, when the cost cutting measures were put into

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMRT Corporation reported in the Straits Times

of  24th  June  2002  that "the cost of  operation,  both

systems,  train  and  bus,  has  increased  3.1%  despite

efforts  made by the company to contain costs and improve

productivity.  The SMRT Manpower Productivity in terms of

train-kilometre operated per staff member has improved by

4.8%  from  FY  2001 to FY 2002 through skills  training,

automation and reviewed processes."  It would appear then

that  the  staff salary increases have been mitigated  by

the improved productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains that the two major bus companies in

Singapore,  namely,  the Singapore Bus  Services  Transit

(SBS  Transit)  and the Trans Island Bus  Service  (TIBS)

enjoy  all  the bus business in Singapore.  They  form  a

duopoly.   They share all the well-designated  routes  in

Singapore,  and  they  annually  make  good  returns   or

profits.  SBS Transit reported last year, despite  a  dip

in profits of 22%, it still made $39.6 million.  This was

reported by Mr Tan Soo Khoon just now.  When SBS  Transit

was  formed out of a large number of small bus  companies

in  the  1970s,  the Senior Minister, who was  the  Prime

Minister  then, was so confident of its success  that  he

could  promise shareholders of at least, or a guaranteed,

minimum of 5% annual return.  I believe, that promise has

very  much been exceeded.  I believe that the SBS Transit

is  now paying shareholders something like 17% dividends.

So  the  major bus companies in Singapore are  definitely

making good profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government has no qualms about

treating public bus companies as purely profit-orientated

companies, and are not too concerned about their role  as

providers of public service.  I personally feel  that  in

our  present  Singapore context where the two  major  bus

companies are so protected, they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



should  show  an  interest in providing  public  service.

They  must have the public responsibility because  for  a

large number of Singaporeans that is their only means  of

transportation.   Therefore, they cannot  increase  their

fares  on a regular basis to ensure that every year  they

make  hefty profits.  If bus companies want to be treated

as   purely  commercial  entities,  then  they  must   be

subjected to the open market competition.  The Government

should not protect just two bus companies but allow  free

open market competition.  Allow as many bus companies  to

operate  as  the market can take.  With free open  market

competition,  bus  fares  shall  surely  drop,  and   not

steadily  increase as in the present case.  See what  has

happened  in  the  case  of  telephone  companies.   With

competition,  SingTel  rates  have  dropped  drastically,

which the paying public benefit greatly.  The public  not

only  save  on their telephone bills but also get  better

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue with the bus service is the recent

introduction  of  the  ez-link  cards  to   replace   the

TransitLink farecards.  I have been told that in the case

of  the  ez-link cards, there are possibilities of  over-payment  on  the  part of commuters.  Commuters  nowadays

board a bus and, if a commuter is using the ez-link card,

on  entering  the bus, the maximum fare is  automatically

deducted  from his ez-link card after tapping it  on  the

card  reader.  When the commuter reaches his destination,

he taps his card at the exit card reader.  Any balance of

the  maximum fare is credited back to the commuter's  ez-link  card.  Should there be a malfunction of the ez-link

card  before  he alights from the bus, nothing  shall  be

credited back to the ez-link card of the commuter,  which

means that he has to pay the maximum fare; currently,  up

to  $1.53  for air-conditioned trunk services and  up  to

$2.13/$2.28  for  SBS/TIBS express  services.   Commuters

know that if they forget to tap their ez-link cards, they

shall  be  charged the maximum fare.  However,  how  many

know  that if the ez-link system malfunctions in any way,

they  shall  also  be  charged  the  maximum  fare?    In

addition, a transfer will be classed as a new "ride",

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



and  they  will lose the transfer rebate of 25 cents  for

trunk services and MRT rides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One commuter complained to me that he experienced

out of 10 bus and MRT journeys, including transfers, when

using   the   ez-link   card,  he   encountered   ez-link

malfunction twice, ie, about 20% error rate, after  which

he immediately stopped using his ez-link card for several

weeks.  The commuter has requested me to ask the Minister

what is the error rate of the ez-link card on buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, a 20% error for 10 bus rides is

unacceptable.   I  understand that the ez-link  card  has

been  introduced  only  recently.  Perhaps  the  Minister

should request the bus companies to have a longer testing

period of the ez-link card until September this year,  as

originally announced, before the bus operators be allowed

to use the ez-link card again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, it is difficult to collect a refund for

over-payment.  This prompted one, Mr J Seow, to write  to

the  tabloid, Streats, on Monday, 17th June  2002  issue,

advising other readers:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not bother to claim your refund should you

forget to tap your ez-link card when you alight from  the

bus.  . It is not worth the hassle."



If  that  were truly the case, then I wonder why the  PTC

should allow bus companies to use the ez-link card system

to  collect  fares at all, if the error rate  remains  at

20%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate  on

the  motion concerning public transport fares.   I  would

like,  first, to express my appreciation to  Mr  Tan  Soo

Khoon  for taking the effort to raise this Motion and  to

make  a  very thorough and eloquent speech, and  also  my

other  colleague, Dr Tan Cheng Bock  -  both  of  whom  I

call  them  the  two "big guns" or "big Tans",  from  our

Backbenchers  group   -   for  supporting  this   Motion.

Particularly,  I would now like to commend  Mr  Chiam  as

well for coming up to speak in support of this Motion and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



join us on our side, the PAP Backbenchers.  Thank you, Mr

Chiam.  He is looking more and more like a PAP MP!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree to support Mr Tan Soo Khoon in moving

this Motion, because the subject concerns practically all

Singaporeans.   I  wish  to  highlight  that  the  Motion

actually contains two important limbs.  The first limb is

to  urge  the  Public  Transport Council  to  review  its

decision on the increase in public transport fares.   The

second, and perhaps a more important limb, is to urge the

Government  to  take steps to ensure that the  prices  of

public  services  are not unreasonably  increased  during

these difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on public transport fare increases. The

increase  in public transport fares has caused  residents

to  be  greatly concerned.  This is evident by the  large

number  of  letters to the press.  For us as MPs,  it  is

evident  by  the  frequency and  the  ferocity  in  which

residents raise these questions and issues with us,  when

they meet us on the ground.  I recently conducted a house-to-house  visit  to  an  HDB block  in  my  constituency,

followed by a typical dialogue session with my residents.

Unlike  the  past, when the usual complaints  were  about

local and estate issues, I was most taken aback that  the

difference  this  time round, the most  common  complaint

lately was regarding public transport fare increases  and

other price increases.   During a recent dialogue session

with  a small group of residents, they pleaded and argued

most  furiously and emotionally against all these  unfair

fare increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some residents even took the trouble to pen down

their  thoughts and submit petition letters to me.  Allow

me  to read a quotation from one petition that I received

from  a  resident, a Mdm Lee.  She actually wrote  a  two

full-page,  well-typed out petition.  Let  me  read  some

sections of it.  She said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, my sons and I are grateful to the ruling

party for the good life we had in the past.  However, the

recent economic crisis has dampened our spirits somewhat.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very anxious in regard to the never-ending news of steady increases in necessities such as

transport,  food, utilities, telephone  bills,  etc,  and

with rumours of more to come."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, she even said `with rumours of more to

come.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An old lady was overheard complaining loudly in the

market that whatever monies the Government had given  out

(CPF  and  New  Singapore Shares) are now being  recouped

back  and with interest too!  She was very bitter  and  I

don't  blame  her  as many people also agreed  with  her.

Many  are saying that the carrots given out were  because

of  the elections and now after the elections, prices  of

everything have gone up."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this letter actually reflects very truly and

accurately the sentiments on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine the PTC approved fare increases

to see whether it is fair or unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Tan Soo Khoon has put forth and analysed very

closely the accounts of SBS and SMRT, he finds it hard to

justify  fare  increases, based on  the  fact  that  they

actually achieved good operating performances in the last

few  years.   I  wish to reiterate and support  Mr  Tan's

point.  In fact, I have a one-page summary here.  One can

actually get a copy quite easily from the SGX website  on

SBS  Transit.   I have attached it to my speech  for  the

reporters  to  take  a  look.  This one-page  summary  is

produced by the company itself, not prepared by  me.   It

actually  tells a very interesting picture of the  health

of  SBS  Transit.  It shows the performance in  the  last

five  years.   From  1997 to 2000, SBS Transit  has  been

consistently  achieving revenues of  above  $500  million

because people take buses, whether it is in good  or  bad

times.  Its after tax profit has actually been increasing

since  1997.  As Mr Tan has quoted, from $21  million  in

1997  all the way up to $50.9 million in 2000.  In  these

four years, its profit went up 2 1/2 times.  Last year, in

2001,  the  profit went down to $40 million,  versus  $50

million  in the year before in 2000, just a drop  of  $10

million.  And now we see that it is coming to the PTC  to

ask for fare increases so soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at its capital reserves, it actually has

very  good capital reserves.  It has been growing from  a

smallish  $88  million  in 1997  by  nearly  three  times

increase to $222 million in 2001.  Its equity and capital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



reserves  have  increased to $222 million  in  2001.   On

return  of capital, as Mr Tan has stated, it has  a  very

high  return  on equity, ranging from 30% in  good  times

down  to  18%  last year.  But 18% is still a  very  good

return  on equity for any company, especially during  bad

times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the accounts for year 2001, the company

actually  has achieved, in the last five years,  a  total

after tax profit of $190 million.  On the $40 million  of

returns, based on the $555 million revenue last year,  it

actually has a 7% return on revenue, which, again,  is  a

very respectable and a very good figure during bad times.

In  fact, if we look at this one-page chart [indicating],

we  cannot  see  a single red mark in this  report  card,

which indicates it is indeed a very healthy company.  Why

are  we  saying  that this company now  needs  more  fare

increases?  The same can be said of other operators, like

SMRT as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to support Mr Tan's

contention  that  the price increase is difficult  to  be

supportable,   based  on  the  argument  that   transport

companies are not making enough money.  In fact,  on  the

contrary, they have high reserves, high revenues and high

earnings.    Therefore,  people  can  accept  that   fare

increases are unavoidable, but they cannot accept  unfair

fare increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, unfortunate that the Public

Transport  Council  (PTC)  has decided  to  allow  public

transport   fares  to  increase  during  this   uncertain

economic period.  Although the fare increases are already

implemented  from 1st July, that means, from  early  this

week,  and  this debate can only be held after  the  fare

increases  were  implemented, I would  like  to  join  my

colleagues,  Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Dr Tan Cheng  Bock,  to

urge,  in  our  Motion,  that the  PTC  review  its  fare

increases.   If  the PTC is open-minded  and  enlightened

enough  to  perhaps  even consider  postponing  the  fare

increases,  so  that,  at  least,  there  is  a  stay  or

suspension of the fare increases.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, especially the political leaders, may

say  that  it is not good to set a precedent that  public

pressure  can cause the PTC to revise its decisions,  and

that  we  cannot govern the country by just listening  to

the  wishes of the people.  However, I contend that there

are  indeed  occasions when it is correct and prudent  to

listen  to  the people.  This is one such  occasion.   If

this  is  done,  the  people  and  the  Government  would

appreciate each other better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to state that, contrary to

the  constant refrain that we cannot govern by giving  in

to  the wishes of the people, I wish to say that the PTC,

as  well as the Government, would be viewed positively if

it   would  reconsider  the  fare  increases.   It  would

demonstrate  that we have public bodies and a  Government

that  could be attuned to the ground and concerns of  the

people,   and   be  prepared  to  review   policies   and

regulations when circumstances show the need  to  do  so.

Such a bold Government, in fact, would be well liked  and

well praised by the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a few

additional suggestions with regard to the PTC.  First,  I

support Mr Tan and Mr Tan  -  as I have said,  the double

"Tans"   -  that to demonstrate that the PTC consists  of

members that are independent, I would, therefore, like to

suggest    that   the   Council   should   not    include

representatives from the public transport operators.   If

need  be,  transport operators can be  enlisted  to  give

technical  or  professional input on  specific  subjects.

But they do not need to be represented on the Council.  I

understand that the transport operators are excluded from

the  Council's  deliberations on  fare  increases.   But,

nevertheless, the public could still be mistaken that the

transport operators could be unduly influencing the other

Council members, because they sit in the same Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest that a wider

representation  of  members  from  grassroots  bodies  be

included in the Council.  Perhaps, even to include people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



who  actually  take public transport regularly,  and  not

people who do not normally take public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Council may wish to conduct more public

forums and talks to better place and explain their  work,

especially pertaining to reviewing of fare increases.

Sir,  I  go  on to the future increases in the prices  of

other  public services.  I would like to move on to  this

point  which concerns and worries the people  even  more,

which  is with regard to future increases in other public

services,  as  expressed by my resident, Mdm  Lee.   This

concern  is  prompted  by  the  recent  decision  of  the

Government  to increase GST from 3% to 5%.   Though  this

GST increase is only to be introduced from next year,  in

fact,  we  could notice that many retailers have  already

increased  their charges.  Common examples are the  price

of  a  cup of coffee from 60 cents to 70 cents (more than

2%  of  GST), and a bowl of noodles from about  $2.50  to

$3.00  by some hawkers.  Less fishballs, maybe even  less

noodles as well.  Then, there have been indications  that

there may well be other increases by the public bodies on

the  cards,  like Singapore Power and SingTel.   We  know

that HDB is already going to increase the carpark charges

from 1st September this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to stress that it is very important for

the  Government to retain the trust and confidence of the

people.  The Government has recently won a renewed 5-year

mandate  with  resounding support of 75% of the  people's

votes.  With this strong endorsement, the Government  can

go  about managing the country with confidence.  However,

I  wish  to warn that this trust of the people is like  a

contract.  The people's mandate is given on a contractual

obligation  of  the Government that the people's  welfare

and well-being is taken care of.  If there is a spate  of

unreasonable,  unfair fare increases during  this  period

when  people are facing a severe economic difficulty  and

higher unemployment, this trust can be fragile and easily

broken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to earnestly and

sincerely urge the Government to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



very  mindful about the difficulties faced by the people.

There is a large segment of the population who have great

faith  in  the Government, but they are facing  difficult

times.   Future fare increases should be deferred as  far

as possible so that the negative impact can be mitigated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the break

now.  I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, while the economy is still gloomy, and  the

people have yet to recover from the shock of an impending

GST increase, the Public Transport Council just could not

wait to rub salt into the wound of the people. It claimed

that  this  pinch of salt ought to be rubbed in  earlier,

and  that it is better to do so early than having to pour

sulphuric acid  later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, business is business. As a public listed

company,  the  investors' concern is  on  the  return  on

investment  of the public transport companies.   However,

return  on  investment is linked to the investment  risk.

This  is  a common knowledge to the investment community.

Under  the  Government's regulation,  the  two  companies

monopolise the public transport market and do not have to

face  competition.  It is a low-risk business with steady

revenue. How can one ask for a high return on such a  low

risk  investment? This cannot be so if we compare it with

high-risk  businesses, such as the  disk  drive  industry

where  losses  can amount to a few tens  of  millions  of

dollars just within a few months. In this difficult time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



where  companies  are slashing prices for  survival,  the

basic  principle of low risk low return could  be  easily

appreciated by the investors, let alone that  the  public

transport companies are still enjoying handsome profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temasek Holdings, under the Government, is the

major  shareholder of SMRT with 62% of the  total  shares

issued. I am sure they have a say in deciding whether  to

ask for a rise in the MRT fares to increase profit.  SMRT

initiated  a  fare hike.  Is the Government  saying  that

they are not happy with the present return on investment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee said that if we do not increase GST,

Singapore would run into a "chronic" structural  deficit.

Therefore,  the people must share the burden.   PTC  said

that  if  the  bus and MRT fares are not increased,   the

public transport companies will not be able to offset the

rise  in operational cost and their profits will go down.

Therefore, the people would have to share the burden.  It

seems  that Singaporeans have a lot of burdens  to  share

in.   Of  course, when we do business, we  want  to  have

profits.   But  the crux  is that when the infrastructure

used  by  the MRT and the bus companies to operate  their

businesses, such as the MRT stations, the rails, the  bus

interchanges and the bus stops, are built with funds from

taxpayers' money, public transport cannot be an  ordinary

business.   It  is  a public service,  a  business  which

concerns  the interest of the general public.  Especially

in  Singapore,  where  car ownership  and  car  usage  is

extremely  expensive,  public transport is  an  essential

service that is required by the people on a daily  basis.

It  is  an  important part of composition in  the  public

service,  and  any  increase in  fares  would  inevitably

create  an  impact  on the people, particularly  in  this

difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the thrust of the matter is not whether

this  is the best time to increase bus and MRT fares,  or

for  the  PTC  to review its decision on the increase  in

public  transport fares, as stated in this Motion  before

the  House, or a question of what is a reasonable  profit

and return .  The fundamental question is:  should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



public transport service be run as a business? To further

extend  this question, is the philosophy of profit-making

in  providing  public  services as  adopted  by  the  PAP

Government  the real issue that needs to be  scrutinised?

DPM  Lee  has just said recently that Singapore is  in  a

stage  of  economic transition where  the  days  of  high

growth  and  high employment rate have passed.   At  this

time,  when  our economy is going into a transition,  the

ordinary people are affected the most.  Although  we  are

not  a  welfare state, the Government should not  neglect

the  welfare of the  people.  The Government must try  to

help them to alleviate their burden, and public transport

policy  is  one  of the items that the Government  should

look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should question the PAP Government on its profit-driven policy through privatisation in providing public

services.  We are pursuing a market economy, but when the

environment  changes, when the gap between the  rich  and

the  poor has widened, when the poor get poorer  and  the

rich  get  richer,  the contradictions surrounding  these

changes would become more and more acute.  This round  of

fare  hike  has  generated  a strong  dissent  among  the

people,  and  this is not just a momentary  reflex.   The

policy  of  allowing the public transport service  to  be

operated by private companies whose objective is to  make

profits needs to be re-examined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As taxpayers, Singaporeans are paying for the

building   of  the  infrastructure  necessary   for   the

operations of the bus and MRT services.  Why should we be

also  asked  to  bear the burden of ensuring  that  these

companies meet their projected or desired profits?  If we

analyse  the present model, the Government has  increased

its taxes - GST, COE, ERP to control car ownership - and,

therefore, collects a lot of revenue from these  sources.

With  this taxpayers' money, it builds the infrastructure

for the MRT and buses, and then  leave the operations  of

public  transport  to the private companies  for  profit-making.   The major shareholders of these companies  are,

more often than not, holding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



companies  under the Government.  At the same  time,  the

Government  imposes  limits on the  life-span  of  buses,

increases  their  ERP charges, builds airconditioned  bus

interchanges, thereby building up what it calls a "world-class"  public transport system to show off to the world.

By  doing  so, it has increased the operational costs  of

these companies.  It seems that the Government is doing a

good  job  in protecting the interest of the  people  and

balancing  the  demand of the public transport  operator.

Indeed  it  is not the case.  Through the PTC's guideline

of  so  called balancing the interest between the  public

and the operators, the Government allows the companies to

increase  their fares from time to time, in the  name  of

recovering the increase in operational cost, and  thereby

the people are the ones who have to bear the burden .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tax collector and also the major shareholder

of  the public transport companies, the Government stands

to  gain  by higher tax revenues and dividends  when  the

fares go up and the companies' profits escalate. So it is

a  win-win  situation for the Government, but the  people

end up paying higher fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party has all along held the view that

public  services should not be profit-oriented.  We  also

proposed  that the Government set up a national transport

enterprise to take over the operation of buses and MRT so

that  we can  have a better integrated service and,  most

importantly,  this national transport enterprise  is  not

profit-oriented  but  run on a cost-recovery  basis.   Of

course,  with  the  Workers' Party's recommendation,  the

Government will say, "This is like restarting state-owned

enterprises and it would not be in line with  the  global

trend."   But  to  us, it is more important  whether  the

interests  of  the people can be better  protected.   The

Government can say that this has been proven  to  be  not

feasible  in  the  other  countries.   But  has  the  PAP

Government  been emphasising, again and again,  that  the

situation in our country is  different from others?  What

cannot   be  done  in  other  countries  can  be   easily

implemented  here, eg, GST, ERP, etc, and the  Government

is always proud

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



of its achievements in this respect.  In the same breath,

why  can the Government not differentiate itself from the

rest of the world and take back the function of running a

state-owned  public  transport  company,  whose  business

objective  is to provide public service and not  to  make

profit? The Government may respond that competition  will

be  removed and service quality will deteriorate  if  our

proposal  is  implemented, but where is  the  competition

when  the  current  service  routes  between  these   two

companies  are  not overlapping, and these companies  can

even join effort in pushing for a fare hike?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may also claim that without the pot

of  gold at the end of business operation, there will  be

no  incentive  for  the  public  transport  operators  to

improve themselves, as such efficiency will go down.  But

let  us  take  a look at our armed forces and educational

institutions.  They  are  all  public  services  with  no

element of profit; is the Government saying that they are

not efficient?  The HDB has persistently claimed that  it

has  been  subsidising public housing.  Every year,  they

run  into losses; yet, its achievement and efficiency  is

something that the Government is so proud of.   So,  what

is  motivating them? Why can we not adopt the  HDB  model

and  let  a   state  enterprise operate public  transport

without having profits as their aim? Moreover, we are not

asking  for additional subsidies besides continuing  with

the   current   funding   in   building   infrastructure.

Comparing  to the current model, what is removed  is  the

source   of  conflict,  ie,  profits,   as  the  proposed

enterprise  is operating on a cost recovery  basis.  They

could  try  to break even with a prudent fare  structure,

while  striving  to  provide  quality  service  with  the

objective of maximising benefit to our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with this economic transition, all

our  people should put up a concerted effort to tide over

the  difficult times.  The Government should also respond

to  the sacrifices made by the people by lightening their

burden.   One aspect  is to temper its current policy  on

providing  public services with more rational and  humane

measures, so that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



can come out from the crisis as a more cohesive nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to

begin with, I would like to declare the fact that I am  a

Board  Member  of  the Comfort Group, a company  that  is

engaged  in  land transportation business,  primarily  in

taxis,  but  has a small subsidiary in the chartered  bus

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon and the PAP

Members who spoke before me have already touched  on  the

public   sentiments  regarding  this  round   of   public

transportation  fare  increases.   Such  fare   increases

affect  the majority of the commuters, with the  greatest

impact  on the lower income.  So, not surprisingly,  this

is  always  a  topic  that would  arouse  public  outcry,

whether such increases are made during boom times or in a

recession.   Although the quantum of the  increases  this

round is small, people feel helpless and frustrated  that

there is no viable alternative available to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, this time round, the matter is

made  even  much worse simply because the timing  was  so

bad.   Our  economy  is just turning the  corner  in  the

recession.   Unlike Mr Tan, I think there is  actually  a

clear  trend  that  the economy is turning  around.   The

benefit  of  the  turnaround, though, has not  percolated

down  to the masses yet, and many of us are still feeling

the impact one way or another.  Thus, even though the PTC

had disclosed in detail the factors it had considered and

had explained the reasons for its decisions, the majority

of commuters are still unhappy with the rulings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has received numerous similar

public comments regarding this, and I would like to thank

Mr  Tan  for moving this Motion to allow Members of  like

mind  to speak on this topic.  I, too, would like to call

upon  the PTC to review, not so much the quantum  of  the

increases  but,  perhaps,  take  into  consideration  the

timing of the increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel, however, that since the PTC

is  getting so much negative vibes that, in the  interest

of  a  more balanced and less emotional debate,  I  would

like  to  put  our public transportation  system  in  its

proper  context.   We  should  realise  that  the  public

transportation  sector in Singapore, including  the  rail

and  the scheduled bus services, is a regulated industry.

I  would like the House to think about what is meant by a

"regulated  industry".  It is not a free  market,  freely

competitive  industry.  It is a regulated industry.   So,

for  instance, when Mr Tan, in his speech,  talked  about

SIA  being  very responsive to market forces,  he  should

realise that SIA, in the international marketplace, is in

a   freely  competitive  marketplace  with  many  players

whereas,  in Singapore, in the public sector,  especially

in  public transportation, we have designed it  to  be  a

regulated industry.  So, if we want to complain about how

the  system is being regulated, we should indeed go  back

to  square one and ask whether we should have a regulated

industry or a free market industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are on the subject of SIA, let me also say

that  many  of  us have in the past complained  that  SIA

fares  have been very high, that it is a cartel  and,  in

fact,  Singaporeans  pay  more buying  their  tickets  in

Singapore, compared to those bought in Hong Kong  or  KL.

So,  we  cannot  mix  the  SIA example  with  the  public

transportation example in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all regulated industries, it is the job of the

regulator to ensure a prescribed level of service in  the

industry  in  exchange for a guaranteed  return  for  the

operators.  I think we must all accept this.   If  we  do

not, then we are not talking like for like.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



return  for the operators would be typically measured  in

terms  of  percentage returns based on a  certain  basis,

such  as  return  on  investment  or  return  on  equity,

whichever  is appropriate.  In other words, in  regulated

industries,  the operators are given a guaranteed  return

and  are  rewarded, in most cases, on a cost-plus  basis.

For  the  regulatory  environment to  operate  well,  the

regulator should be an independent body that is  fair  to

the commuters and operators, and it is not influenced  by

the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, as well as this House, should

desist  from  interfering  with  the  work  of  the  PTC.

Otherwise,  we might as well perform this role ourselves.

Maybe  the House should sit as PTC and decide what  is  a

fair adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I believe that the choice of members of the

PTC  is  important.  I agree that it is  not  appropriate

that  the  operators sit as members of the  PTC,  but  as

resource  members.   Despite all the criticisms,  I  must

also  say that the PTC has so far done a reasonable  job,

balancing  the interests of all parties involved.   This,

Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  himself has also conceded.   It  has

resisted  requests for fare increases from the  operators

for  several years before granting this current round  of

increases.   I  really  do not envy  the  men  and  women

serving on the PTC.  Theirs is a thankless task,  and  we

should not make their job any more difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once we have established the regulatory regime,

with  the  PTC  as a fare approving body, then  we  would

expect to see the following sequence of events.  This  is

already  a  given.   So,  from time  to  time,  when  the

transport operators come to PTC with their hats in  their

hands and reams of data to show that the costs have  gone

up,  returns on investments have declined, what would the

regulator  or  PTC  do?   It is their  job  to  determine

whether  the  operators have met the various  performance

standards.   And,  if they do, then the  regulator  would

determine  whether  the return on investment  has  indeed

fallen  below the target.  If all these factors are  met,

then  the  regulator really has not much  option  but  to

approve fare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



increases.  If we accept that this is the way the  system

is supposed to work, then we should ask ourselves whether

this  was  what  happened in this recent  round  of  fare

adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can tell, the PTC has acted quite

independently, using its best judgment.   So,  I  believe

that  Mr  Low is mistaken to point the finger at the  PAP

Government, claiming that, because of ownership, we  have

allowed  the Government-owned company to raise  fares  to

squeeze  the people.  In fact, if Mr Low is unhappy  with

the  way the PTC was set up, he could suggest a different

way  to regulate the public transportation sector.   But,

given  this is how the PTC is supposed to work, I believe

he is off the mark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case involving IDA and SingTel that was in

court recently, any time a regulator interferes with  the

market,  causing  the operator to have a  lower  rate  of

return,  I  believe  the operator  has  a  case  to  seek

compensation from the Government.  I also believe that it

is not a matter whether the company is still making money

or  not.  This is a matter whether the company is  making

the  appropriate  rate  of return than  existing  at  the

outset  of  the regulatory regime.  Of course,  we  could

debate  whether  the PTC has been too generous  with  the

operators and accepted too readily SBS Transit and SMRT's

request that they should continue to earn a high rate  of

return based on historical norm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a point here that we can debate.

Based  on  the  rate of return on equity,  SBS'  rate  of

return seems rather high, with ROE at 24.7% in year 2000,

and  17.8% in year 2001.  Thus, it is not surprising that

people  get  angry when the companies raise  fares  in  a

recession  where almost all other companies  are  showing

lower profits or outright losses.  So the argument should

be:  why is it that SBS Transit and SMRT are not prepared

to earn a lower rate of return, like everybody else in  a

recession?  Perhaps the PTC should disclose to the public

what is the ROE that transport companies are permitted to

achieve  in a non-competitive environment.  Perhaps  they

can also disclose what is the target rate of the ROE

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



that companies are allowed to achieve. If the PTC can  do

this, I believe that it will be easier for it to win over

the support of the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so long as we have two bus

operators  running  our  public  transport  sector,  this

scenario  that I have painted out earlier would play  out

again  and again.  I suggest that we take a leaf  out  of

how  IDA  regulates the mobile phone industry.   In  that

case,  as  Mr  Chiam  has  pointed  out,  IDA  terminated

SingTel's  monopoly  and allowed new  entrants  into  the

market.   With  StarHub,  M1 and  Virgin  Mobile  in  the

market,  the consumers now get better service  and  value

for  money. In fact, so much so that one of the companies

declared  recently  that  it  is  pulling  out  from  the

marketplace.   I  suggest  that  the  Minister  seriously

consider introducing greater competition in the scheduled

bus  service by perhaps splitting up SBS Transit into two

or more companies, or allow other companies to enter into

the  market.  I am sure that the Minister could  see  the

merit   of   greater   competition,   not   free   market

competition, but greater competition, as IDA was part  of

his portfolio not so long ago.  Opening up the market for

greater   competition   has  also   been   advocated   by

Christopher  Tan in Business Times and Yeoh Kok  Seng  in

the Today newspaper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to Mr Low Thia Khiang, I

am reminded almost like standing at a street corner rally

during  the  1960s.   He uses 1960s'  leftist  jargon  to

appeal  to  the segments of society that would  find  his

pitch  attractive.  He tried to paint the PAP  Government

as  incentive-technocrat, out to squeeze  the  last  drop

from the poor to fatten the coffers of the bus companies.

I  think  his suggestion for a non-profit corporation  is

seductive.     However,   as   we   all   know,    public

transportation has a consumption element in  it.   If  we

price  the  service  below cost,  we  would  distort  the

allocation   of   resources  and  encourage   unnecessary

consumption.   We  would also encourage  dependency  that

would  be  difficult to unwind in future. So by  thinking

through   the  consequence  of  subsidies,  I   am   sure

Singaporeans would see through the fallacy of his logic.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think some of the models which have been

advocated,  eg, running public transportation  along  the

line  that  he  has proposed, is already in operation  in

China.   If he has visited China, he would know  that  in

some  Chinese cities, where bus transportation  companies

are still state-owned, the buses are rickety, and many of

them have no lights in them.  If you travel in such buses

at  night, it is pitch dark inside.  To improve their bus

system,   the   Chinese   have  been   inviting   foreign

participation in their bus operation, as they  know  that

these  state-funded  operations  are  being  run  to  the

ground.   Does he know that SBS Transit has  invested  in

the   public  bus  operation  in  Shanghai?    And   with

competition,  the  bus service in Shanghai  has  improved

dramatically.   So  the very same  company  that  we  are

berating this afternoon is earning accolades for its  bus

operation in Shanghai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the process of

arriving at this round of fare increases could have  been

done better.  We could have taken into consideration  the

number  of  unemployed  workers  in  Singapore  and   the

sentiments  of  Singaporeans in general.   On  the  other

hand,  I would submit that the basic philosophy of a  bus

transport  system  is  correct and  that  the  regulatory

framework  is  a sound one.  Thus, Mr Low's criticism  of

Government  is unjustified.  His suggestion of increasing

subsidies  for  commuters is based on unsound  principles

that have proven not to work elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would urge the Minister to

consider my suggestion of introducing greater competition

into public transportation, especially the bus sector.

<br>3.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to speak on this motion in the name  of  Mr

Tan Soo Khoon on the public transport fare hikes.  I want

to thank him for this opportunity to ventilate my views.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the discussion on the latest PTC's decisions

on   public   transport  fare  hikes  have  been   rather

emotional.   I  can understand the sentiment,  given  the

state  of  the  economy, unemployment, difficulties  that

people  are facing and the likely statutory charges  that

would come up in the months to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to look at the rationale given by the PTC

on  its  decision, I would classify them into  four  main

groups.  The reasons given are, firstly, on the viability

of  public  transport  companies if  the  fares  are  not

increased;   secondly,  the  CPI  +  X  formula,   giving

justification  for small increases versus big  increases;

thirdly,  the  issue of wages and operation  costs;  and,

lastly,  the issue of productivity and quality of service

and  equipment  necessary to sustain the quality  in  our

public transport service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reasons to doubt the statement of the PTC

in   saying   that  it  has  improved  "the  process   of

scrutinising  operators' bus and train accounts  and  its

financial  performance.  Operators have been  prudent  in

containing cost and not been profiteering at the  expense

of the commuters."  However, the public would like to ask

questions on how the decisions on this latest fare  hikes

are  arrived  at.  Hence, I believe transparency  in  its

decision-making process is vitally important, and perhaps

is  lacking in this respect.  In this instance,  I  think

this opportunity is given to the Minister to explain  and

to  justify  the  PTC's  decision with  respect  to  this

monitoring of key performance indicators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first reason that the viability of public

transport companies is at stake, I think this is only one

part  of  the  issue.  Companies which  exist  by  public

charter  must perform certain social roles and  undertake

some  measure of social responsibility.  Of course,  they

must  run  their  business  efficiently  for  shareholder

value.   Because they exist on public charter, they  have

to  fulfill certain public objectives.  And in times like

this,  I  think  there can be merit for considering  some

factors  in  delaying the decision or  in  modifying  the

rates  of  increase.   I think it  is  not  something  so

contradictory that it cannot be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



managed.  Running such a business, of course, is  not  so

easy,  but balancing this role is necessary. That is  why

we  have  to  hire  the  best  management  for  the  job.

Otherwise, we will be having a family of clerks to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the rationale on the viability of the bus

transport companies valid?  Some figures have been  given

just  now.  I believe that the public transport companies

concerned here are not about to go under.  What has their

performance been up to now?  If we look at the  financial

figures,  and  some have been given just now,  I  do  not

think  the figures justify the decision.  If we  look  at

the  return  on assets for SBS Transit for the  financial

year  ending 31st December 2001, it is 13.5%;  return  on

equity  for  the same period, 17.8%; the gearing  of  the

company, that of debt to equity, nil; net earnings, 7.3%.

If  we look at these figures, one would generally come to

the  conclusion  that SBS is reasonably sound  and  quite

profitable.    Perhaps   the  Minister   can   use   this

opportunity to explain how the PTC came to the conclusion

that  viability of the public transport companies was  at

stake.  If we look at the SMRT, again the return on asset

(ROA) is slightly smaller, 4.6%; its return on equity  is

8.3%; net earnings, $56.8 million, which is about 11%  of

sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the ROE, in the case of the SMRT, cannot

be  so  high  because  it has such a big  infrastructural

asset   to  maintain.   I  would  say  that  perhaps   in

considering   the  financial  figures   for   these   two

companies, it is of some merit to the Minister to explain

to  us  how the PTC came to the conclusion that  the  two

companies'  viability  are  at  stake.   Of  course,   we

understand that SBS Transit is taking over the North-East

line. And for this current year, there may be some start-up operational expenses for the first 10-11 months before

the  North-East line starts running by the  end  of  this

year.  So there could be expenses that it has to incur in

this  instance.   But  this is really  start-up  cost  of

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of factors that we have to look at

is  the  justification given by the PCT on the  CPI  +  X

formula.  I believe there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



are  many ways to interpret this CPI + X formula, and  it

is not exactly quite clear which is a plus and which is a

minus.   What  do  I  mean?  X can be a  dummy  for  cost

increases   or   productivity  increases.    Of   course,

management would have to manage this part of it.  But  as

presently constituted in the formula, that formula  is  a

justification for the PCT to arrive at 2.2% increase.   I

think  we  have  to  differentiate  between  productivity

increase in the X and operational cost increases  in  the

X.   What  do I mean?  If productivity increases  in  the

transport  companies, naturally, this increase suppresses

X,  that  means  X  would have a  lower  value  to  rise.

Operational costs, in terms of equipment, TV monitors  on

the  buses,  fanciful  bus-stops, air-conditioned  halls,

these  could  add to increases in the X.   So,  when  the

public  transport companies go to the PTC to justify  for

the  increase in X, is there some anomaly in the CPI +  X

formula that we have to look at?  Otherwise, productivity

increase  has no incentive to gain from CPI + X,  because

it  suppresses X, whereas other cost increases in putting

up  equipment, fanciful features, frills that Mr Tan  Soo

Khoon talked about add to the X factor, and justification

for fare adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not arguing that public transport

companies  should  not  be allowed  to  raise  fares,  as

allowed by the PTC.  The question is whether this is  the

right time.  I can understand that there is never a right

time for raising fares, but in times like this, when  the

economy  is  suffering from a recession, when  there  are

difficulties faced by our people, I think there has to be

some cause for concern for the public transport companies

to raise fares at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times are bad. We are told there is no sacred cows

that  will be left unexamined.  The GST is going up  next

year.  While we ask our people to tighten their belts,  I

think  we  should also be sensitive to the  threshold  of

pain   they  can  bear  in  these  uncertain  times.    I

understand  that  the Government will  not  allow  public

transport companies to raise fares next year when the GST

goes  up.   Would  it not have been better  had  the  PTC

delayed the fare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



hikes  till  January  next year, together  with  the  GST

implementation, so that it is manifestly evident  to  the

public that such an increase at that time, as opposed  to

now,  would  include  the GST increases,  which  will  be

absorbed in this current fare adjustment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the Government to bear

in  mind  the views expressed by Members and to  consider

this in reviewing the work done by the PTC.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the

Motion.   Let me start by saying that I acknowledge  that

we  have  an  efficient public transport system  that  is

comparable to the best in the world.  And I wish  to  pay

tribute  to  our  public  transport  workers  for   their

dedication and hard work.  I think we owe it to these men

and women who are in the public transport service for the

excellent  work that they have done.  From a rickety  bus

system,  we now have one of the most efficient  transport

systems in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand the plight of public transport

workers  who are by no means highly-paid income  earners.

Productivity of bus companies has increased, and in  line

with  our  wage  guidelines, I  think  they  should  look

forward  to  some  reasonable  wage  increases.   It   is

therefore unfortunate that wage increases have been cited

as  one  of  the key reasons for the increase  in  public

transport  fares.  Let me now define what I  see  as  the

issue before the House today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the current debate, in my view, is

the  question  of what should be the role of  our  public

transport  companies.  The companies  see  themselves  as

business  entities, but Singaporeans obviously  disagree.

Singaporeans  see public transport companies  as  serving

public  interest, and therefore having  a  strong  social

responsibility  towards  the  public.   This  element  of

public interest and social responsibility is particularly

important  considering  that public  transport  companies

here operate in an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



environment, as my other colleagues have mentioned, where

there  are virtually no competitors.  This does not  mean

that  public  transport companies cannot make  money,  or

should  be operated at a loss.  The issue here is whether

making  profits  should be the over-riding  consideration

for  public transport companies, as we have heard several

speakers  mentioning.   In other words,  the  profit  and

shareholder   value  motivations  of   public   transport

companies must be balanced against the public need for an

affordable   and   efficient  public  transport   system.

Obviously, Sir, the public is not convinced that there is

a  balance in this case.  They know that last year, as we

have already heard, SBS Transit made a healthy profit  of

almost  $40  million, and a healthy return on  equity  of

17.9%.  Hence, there is no danger of an imminent collapse

if fares are not increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the recent announcements on corporate tax

reductions will benefit transport companies in  terms  of

higher profits.  So the public finds it bewildering  that

bus companies should cite loss of revenue as a reason for

its  increase  in  fares.  Sir,  as  mentioned  by  other

colleagues  as well, contrast this with the  response  of

two  other transport operators.  When asked whether  they

would   increase  their  fares,  both  the  1,000  strong

Singapore  School Transport Association and  the  CityCab

and  Tibs  taxis, have said publicly that they  will  not

increase  their  fares despite their  higher  operational

costs  because of the poor economic situation.  In  fact,

the  President of the Comfort Taxi Operators  Association

said  in  a public interview that increasing fares  would

mean  that passengers will run away, particularly in this

situation of economic hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Sir, there is an issue of public

accountability   here,   and   the   clarifications   and

explanations  to-date  have not  been  able  to  convince

people.   I  really hope that the Minister can give  this

House  clearer and more incisive explanations  and  allay

the   fears   of  the  public.   I  have  the   following

suggestions to make and also some questions which I  hope

the Minister could address.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approving fare increases, I would like to ask

whether  the  PTC  had  taken into account  the  economic

situation,  the  unemployment  rate,  and  the  increased

hardship  that such a fare increase would  cause  to  the

people.   There  are  strong  sentiments  against   these

increases because many Singaporeans have lost their jobs,

do  not enjoy pay increases in many cases, and those  who

are  still employed live in constant fear of losing their

jobs.  We may argue that only 5% are unemployed, but this

figure  is  actually  much higher  compared  to  previous

years,  and  those who are unemployed now take  a  longer

time  to  find a job.  To me, a reasonable fare  increase

cannot  refer to the amount of the increase or  the  need

for  companies to earn revenue alone, but must take these

factors into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether in approving the

fare increase, the PTC had factored in the 2.5% reduction

in  corporate  tax  which the transport  companies  would

enjoy  on this year's income.  Has that been factored  in

when the bus companies talked about loss of revenue as  a

reason  for increasing fares?  The Government's objective

in reducing corporate tax by 2.5% is to help companies to

reduce  operational costs.  Instead of  passing  on  this

benefit   to  commuters,  it  is  unfortunate  that   the

transport companies have decided to further increase cost

for commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the formula of CPI+X, which

my   Parliamentary  colleague  Mr  Chay  Wai  Chuen   had

mentioned just now, and to ask whether there is a need to

revisit  this formula.  I note that this formula was  set

many  years ago, but the economic environment  today  has

changed.   If companies are already making good  profits,

this  formula seems to allow companies to increase  fares

so  long as there is an increase in the operating  costs.

It  gives the impression that transport companies do  not

have  to contain costs and, secondly, it guarantees  them

good profits all the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1996, the Cost Review Committee, in its

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion, said the following:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An affordable and highly convenient public

transport system would have to be provided to offer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  an attractive alternative to  having  their

own  cars,  as  cars are likely to be very  costly  given

Singapore's shortage of land."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all agree that private ownership of cars

will  become more expensive.  We also agree that too many

private cars would clog up our roads.  So, we agree  that

a  better alternative will be to develop an efficient and

affordable public transport system.  Public buses are  by

far the most efficient means of road transportation for a

large numbers of commuters, particularly during the  rush

hour.   If this is the case, then should not the policies

that  are in place reflect this thinking?  In particular,

Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to explain what  is

the rationale for imposing the ERP on public buses, which

the  bus companies have cited as being one of the reasons

for the increase in their costs.  Lest I be misconstrued,

I  am  not arguing for a subsidy or subsidisation of  our

public  transport  system.   But  I  think  a  policy  is

developed  on  the ERP for a particular  objective  -  to

prevent  clogging  of the roads; people  are  discouraged

from  using  private cars; they have to  rely  on  public

transport unless we expect them to walk.  So I would like

to  know,  and  I  am sure Singaporeans are  asking  this

question as well, what is the rationale then for imposing

the ERP?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the transport companies have just introduced

cost saving methods, such as the ez-link card, which will

reduce underpayments and other forms of fare abuses.  The

strategy  of differentiating payments for those  who  use

the  ez-link  card and the normal fare card,  as  against

those  who pay cash, would also mean that there  will  be

further  manpower savings as it will need less staff  for

cash  handling.   Hence, the transport companies,  in  my

view, should have waited and assessed the impact of  such

measures  before asking for fare increases.  In fact,  it

would  have been better if the ez-link card had  been  in

place  for a number of months or even one year,  so  that

people  could switch, and therefore have some  additional

savings  by  using  the  ez-link  card,  where  the  fare

increase is much lesser.  Unfortunately, the ez-link card

has  just been introduced, I think it is less than a  few

months,  but  immediately we now have the  fare  increase

without

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



enabling people to benefit more and assessing its impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the ez-link card requires a $3

deposit,  which  is  $1 more than the normal  fare  card.

This  by itself, in my view, will generate a fair  amount

of  income  for  transport companies.  And  therefore  it

makes  it quite unbelievable that they could cite revenue

loss as a basis for the increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, transport companies have been

constantly  upgrading in various areas.  The  question  I

would like to ask is: are these upgradings necessary, are

they  useful, are they needed by commuters, and  are  the

costs of these upgradings passed on to the commuters?  It

does not really help when shortly after the bus companies

announced   about  the  setting  up  of  the  Toa   Payoh

airconditioned  interchange,  fares  went  up.   In   the

public's  mind,  such costs are borne by  the  commuters,

although  not  everyone  wants  an  air-conditioned   bus

interchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a special appeal for

feeder bus users who are usually the HDB heartlanders.  I

think  there  is a strong argument to moderate  the  fare

increase  for feeder service as this is heavily  used  by

housewives,  retirees and students.  The  feeder  service

used  to be 15 cents but now it is 80 cents.  I recall  a

recent conversation with my daughter who is in Primary 6.

She  said  that some of her friends hate  me.   And  they

hated  me  because they said that "your mother  increased

the  bus  fare from 70 cents to 80 cents",  and  I  said,

"Please,  I  am not the bus company.  Please  explain  to

your  friends."   She said, "Ya, it is very  unfair"  but

that  is what they said.  "You have increased the  feeder

bus  service to 80 cents, by 10 cents."  Now that is  the

sentiment  of  the people, the young, their  mothers  who

were using it, talking to them, and this is what is being

reflected in the conversations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if our argument is that support and assistance

to  the people must be focused and directed to those  who

really need them, then, in my view, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



appropriate  that we look into feeder service differently

as  the  bulk of the users are HDB heartlanders from  the

lower income group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finallly, Sir, I would like to ask whether there is

any  coordination  in the increase in  fees  amongst  the

various  Ministries  and public  service  providers.   Is

anyone  monitoring and actually assessing the  cumulative

impact  of all these increases on the public?  Would  the

Government   consider   setting  up   an   inter-Ministry

Committee to monitor and assess the cumulative impact  of

cost  increases?   I fear, Sir, that  as  more  and  more

public  services are corporatised or privatised, everyone

will  decide on their own pricing policy, without  taking

into   consideration   what  impact   this   would   have

collectively on people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my earlier

point  that  public  transport  companies  are  not  just

commercial entities, but have a social responsibility and

they  must,  and will be, subject to public  scrutiny  if

they  raise their fares.  I would also like to call  upon

the Government to consider carefully before approving any

further increases of public services or Government  rates

of  charges.  Please consider the anxieties and  concerns

of  people.  When I ask people nowadays how is your work.

The  answer  is invariably, "Okay, but for now."   During

good  times,  when jobs are secure, people's  ability  to

absorb  shocks is better.  But when times are  bad,  with

every  price  change,  no matter how  small,  instead  of

creating a ripple, will result in a whirlpool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Motion, Sir.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for letting me join in

this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me say that I am glad that we are

having  this debate in this House, at this time.  It  has

already been raging in the media, in the coffee-shops, on

the buses and trains, for quite a while now.  So, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



good  that  we now move this debate into this  House,  to

give  MPs the chance to give voice to their feelings  and

their concerns, the frustrations and the fears, anxieties

of  their  constituents.  For this,  we  must  thank  the

movers of the Motion, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, Dr Tan Cheng Bock

and  others.  This does not mean, however, that  I  agree

with the Motion, but I will come to that later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is also important because it provides an

opportunity for the Minister to explain, once again,  the

rationale   for   its  policies  and   to   clarify   any

misunderstandings and to provide the facts.  And,  it  is

important,  because this is what Members  of  this  House

have been elected to do.  To reflect sentiments from  the

ground,  yes,  but also to listen carefully  to  all  the

arguments, so as to arrive at decisions which are what we

believe to be in the best interest of the country and our

constituents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is taking place amidst high public

interest  and high expectations.  Some Members feel  that

the  issues  go beyond bus fares - issues like Government

not   listening  to  the  people,  Government  not  being

sympathetic,  and so on.  I would touch on  these  points

later.   But I urge Members, if we are going  to  have  a

rational  and a considered debate, to remember ultimately

what  this  debate is all about.  It is  about  our  land

transport   policy,  specifically  our  public  transport

policy.   It is about the role that it plays in improving

our  quality of life and our standard of living.   It  is

about how we finance it, how we regulate it, and what are

the    role   and   responsibilities   of   the   various

stakeholders.   By this, I mean not just  the  commuters,

the people, but also the service providers and the State.

In the most immediate, it is about whether fees should be

increased, fares should be increased; if so, when and  by

how much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first of all, state my position. I support

the  necessity  for increases in public  transport  fares

provided,  of  course, that they are properly  justified.

The  harsh  reality is this: there is no free  lunch.   I

would  elaborate  on  this  point  later.   Where  it  is

justified, I further support the principle

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



that  it is better to have small regular increases which,

in  fact,  means  increases even when the  companies  are

profitable,   as   opposed  to  large  increases   coming

infrequently, for example, when the companies are  losing

money.   To the extent that the recent fare hikes  adhere

to this principle, I support them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure Members of this House,

including Mr Chiam, that this does not mean that I am not

speaking up for the common man.  Indeed, if I may  remind

Members,  if  the  PAP Government had not  acted  in  the

interest  of the common man, if we had let them down,  if

we  had  not  been able to demonstrate clearly  that  our

policies, sometimes not very popular, have brought them a

better life, then we would not be in Government today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed any further, let me say that it is

not  my  intention  to  justify the  increase  in  public

transport  fares.   That  is  for  the  public  transport

companies  to do.  That is for the PTC to assess  and  to

recommend and, finally, for the Ministry of Transport  to

endorse.   Neither realistically do I hope to change  the

minds  of Members of this House who oppose the fare hikes

or  the many commuters who are affected by this increase.

But  what I do hope to do is to shed some light  on  this

issue and help to bring about a more informed debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me say that this is not the first

time  that  public transport fares have gone up.   It  is

also,  I dare say, not going to be the last time.  I  was

with  the  Ministry of Communications for 11  years  from

1988  to  1999, three years as a Minister  of  State  and

eight years as the Minister with responsibility for  land

transport.   One  of  the most difficult  and  unpleasant

things  I  had  to  do was to allow the public  transport

operators to raise their fares.  Let me assure Members of

this  House  that  no Minister for Transport,  indeed  no

Minister, wants to allow any fares, fees or rates  to  go

up if he can help it.  Indeed, life would be so much more

pleasant  and so much simpler if we did not  have  to  do

unpleasant things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as Minister for National Development, I have

not escaped having to do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



unpleasant  things.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon in his speech  just

now  mentioned one of these things.  He said that HDB  is

raising  carpark charges in spite of public feedback.   I

have explained in this House why HDB has to raise carpark

charges.   It  is  because HDB's mandate  is  to  provide

subsidised   public  housing.   It  is  not  to   provide

subsidised  carparks.   Any  subsidy  for  carparks  will

eventually, sooner or later, flow through and have to  be

borne by all HDB residents, whether or not they own cars.

That  is the reason why carpark charges have to be raised

in  order  to reduce the subsidy and, hopefully,  we  can

close the gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also explained in this House, in answer to

questions  from Mr Tan, why HDB is doing so in September.

This  is  because,  in  September,  road  taxes  will  be

reduced, and so we feel that it would be better  to  wait

until  September so that HDB residents will not feel  the

pinch.  So, I wonder which part of my explanation was not

clear  to  Mr  Tan.   He may disagree  with  the  policy,

although  he  knows that this is not a  new  policy.   In

fact, this policy was enunciated in the House when he was

in  the Chair, by the former Minister, Mr Dhanabalan,  as

early as 1989.  He may also disagree with the timing, but

if  not  at  the  time  when the  car  owner  is  getting

something back from the Government, then when?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come back to the question about fare

increases.   The  first question  then  we  have  to  ask

ourselves is: can we avoid having to increase fares?   Is

there  another  option?  Is there another  way  of  doing

this?   Some  Members  of  this  House  have  made   some

suggestions.   Some people argued that one way  to  avoid

increasing  public transport fares is for the  Government

to  step in and subsidise public transport.  This is  the

subsidy argument.  I think this argument was made  by  Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang and others.  There are others who  feel

that we can bring fares down by opening up the market  to

more  competition.  Again, I think this is something that

has  been brought up by quite a few Members.  Others feel

that the public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



transport  operators  should improve  their  productivity

rather  than raising fares.  And, finally, a  few  argued

that  they  should  cut  cost by  providing  a  no-frills

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us consider each of these suggestions one

by one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take subsidy first. The Government has

explained   many,  many  times  why  subsidising   public

transport  is  subsidising consumption  which,  in  turn,

creates  distortions  in demand  and  supply.   In  other

words, if you subsidise consumption, people are going  to

want  more and more, because they do not have to pay  for

it.   If we start with public transport, what about other

equally   essential   items,   like   water,   food   and

electricity?    Should  we  not  also   subsidise   food,

electricity  and water?  I am sure Members  are  familiar

with  the  arguments.   But,  to  me,  perhaps  the  most

powerful  reason  why we should dismiss  this  option  is

that,  ultimately,  we all end up  paying  for  it.   The

experience of many countries which have gone this  route,

with  the best of intentions, mind you, end up having  to

provide for a bigger and bigger subsidy, which eventually

means  higher taxes.  So, remember that there is no  such

thing as a free lunch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the second proposal - competition. This

is  a  common  belief that if only we had more  transport

operators,  competition would bring  fares  down.   These

sentiments are understandable.  After all, look  at  what

happened  in  the  telecommunications industry.   Let  me

caution,  however,  that it does not  necessarily  follow

that  the  same  will  happen  in  the  public  transport

industry,  because the nature of both industries  is  not

the  same.  In the 60s and the early 70s, we had a  total

of  11 bus companies in Singapore.  Older Members of this

House,  especially  those  over  50,  which  incidentally

include   myself,  will  remember  the  situation   then.

Services   were   unreliable;  buses  broke   down   very

frequently;  they  were  packed like  sardines;  and  the

competition for passengers resulted in dangerous  driving

behaviour.   Unpopular routes were poorly served,  if  at

all.   They all wanted to serve the best routes, the most

popular routes.  The situation improved when the 11

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



companies  were amalgamated, first, into three companies,

and  then  into one, which was called SBS in 1973.   Even

then,  the Government had to take the unprecedented  step

of  seconding  a  team  of civil  servants  from  various

Ministries  to  help manage SBS and to  ensure  that  the

public  transport system, which was an essential part  of

the system, of the whole infrastructure of Singapore, did

not  collapse.   I was one of those who was  seconded  to

SBS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the merger, we were able to rationalise bus

routes,  decentralise  repairs and  maintenance,  and  to

achieve economies of scale for the purchase of new  buses

and  spare  parts.   Service conditions  of  bus  workers

improved  significantly.  New productivity measures  such

as  double deckers and one-man operation were introduced.

As  a result of this, service quality went up, fares were

held  steady  for  many years while SBS  was  financially

viable.   The  final stage in this transformation  was  a

successful  listing of the company.  As  a  result,  many

Singaporeans   who   were  bus  commuters   also   became

shareholders of SBS.  In a sense, SBS became some sort of

a  cooperative  with widespread shareholdings  among  bus

workers as well as commuters.  Over time, the shares went

up  in  value; so, many commuters decided to take profit.

It was a win-win situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, competition was reintroduced in some

form  when  licences  were  given  to  Trans-Island   Bus

Services  (TIBS) to operate bus services in the  northern

part of Singapore.  With this move, there was now a basis

for  comparison  of  performance  and  some  competition,

although not direct.  Supplementary bus services provided

by  school  buses  were  also  introduced  to  complement

certain routes at peak hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation today? Has the bus service

improved today, compared to the yesteryears?  Based on my

own experience then and now, I can say without hesitation

that  it  has improved by leaps and bounds.  You look  at

the  buses that are running on the roads today.  I  still

remember the bone-shakers we had in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



70s.  They were hot and stuffy.  They were very difficult

to  drive and for the drivers, it was not a very pleasant

thing  to drive SBS buses.  I know because I did take  my

Class  4  licence  on one of those old bone-shakers.   At

that  time,  I wondered whether we could ever afford  the

lovely buses that we saw in Europe and in other developed

cities.  Today, our commuters are able to enjoy the  same

standard  of  buses as the ones we see  running  in  most

cities  in  developed  countries  -  airconditioned,  low

steps, sturdy, automatic transmission power steering, and

so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting that public transport

operators  today have no more room for improvement.   Far

from  it.   There  are still too many lapses  of  service

which  we cannot and should not condone.  They should  be

more  responsive to commuters' request for new  services.

Service  attitude of some drivers can be improved.   More

buses  on  some routes would be welcomed.  But  like  all

things, let us see their performance in perspective.  Let

us give credit where credit is due.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I relate this to illustrate the point that

competition  and  having more bus companies  is  not  the

magic solution, the panacea to our problem.  Indeed,  the

opposite  can be true that a well-regulated monopoly,  or

duopoly, with some competition at the fringes can be  the

better solution.  This has been borne out not only by our

own  experience but that of places, like Hong Kong, where

bus services are also not subsidised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about productivity? Can transport operators

increase their productivity further and not have to raise

bus fares?  The answer must surely be yes.  But I believe

that the huge productivity gains of the past, such as the

ones  through the use of high capacity buses, like double

deckers  and articulated buses, like the introduction  of

one-man operation (OMO), are no longer repeatable,  which

means that the fare increases can no longer be held  down

for as long as it had in the past.  Nevertheless, the PTC

should  continue  to insist that productivity  is  a  key

determinant of any request to raise fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what about cutting down on the frills, a so-called no-frill service. The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



assumption  here  is that by removing the  frills  -  the

airconditioned interchanges and TV on buses - cost can be

reduced so that fares do not have to go up.  Sir, I  know

for a fact that the airconditioned interchange that is co-located with the HDB hub at Toa Payoh Town Centre is paid

for  by LTA, and not by SBS.  I am also told that the  TV

sets  on  buses are paid for by advertisers, and  not  by

SBS.   So,  this way of cutting costs is out since  costs

are not incurred by the bus operator in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about other cost-cutting measures? The surest

way  to  cut  costs is to lower the level of service,  in

other words, to reduce the number of routes or the number

of  buses  plying certain routes.  Are commuters prepared

to  wait  10 minutes when they are now waiting 5 minutes?

Or  are they prepared to wait 30 minutes, instead  of  15

minutes,  during off-peak?  Are they prepared  to  endure

more  crowded trains?  I doubt that commuters will accept

this.  And I do not blame them.  We have come to enjoy  a

high   standard  of  living  which  must  not  be   going

backwards.  But at the same time, we must be prepared  to

pay  a  reasonable price for a reasonable service because

there is no such thing as a free lunch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue boils down then to what is a reasonable

service.   Is  10  minutes reasonable?   Is  walking  200

metres to the nearest bus stop reasonable?  Is having  to

change  buses to arrive at one's designation  reasonable,

and  so  on  and so forth?  If you ask people, they  will

give  you various answers.  So who decides?  And we  have

placed this responsibility on the PTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, what is a reasonable fare? Should we peg

fares to affordability, like we do for HDB flats?  Again,

if  you ask different people, opinions will differ.   And

again, we have given this unenviable task to the PTC.  We

said  to  them, do a performance audit of the  operators,

check   the   accounts,  make  sure  they  are  operating

efficiently,  let them earn reasonable profits,  so  that

they  can  reinvest in the business, expand, improve  the

level of service.  Like Dr Wang,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



I do not envy the Chairman of PTC and its members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have attempted to establish that,

like  many  issues  facing Singapore as  a  country  with

limited  resources,  there  are  no  easy  solutions,  no

painless   options.   In  this  case,  we  cannot   avoid

increases  in bus and MRT fares from time to  time.   But

what  we can and must do is to look for the least painful

solution if there is such a thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we have the framework in place. The

PTC  is  the  body that is entrusted to regulate  service

levels and fares.  I believe that the principle of  small

increases  is  the  better way to go, rather  than  large

increases.   But within this framework, I  think  we  can

still  make further improvements.  And one that  I  would

support  is  the  call  by some  Members  to  expand  the

representation  of the PTC to include  members  from  all

walks  of life.  And I see no reason why this should  not

include some Members of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for fare increases can then be subject

to  greater  scrutiny and, if it is passed,  it  can  get

better  acceptance.  Now, I realise that this  suggestion

does  not mean that future fare increases will not  be  a

problem.   It  will still be so.  People  will  still  be

unhappy.   Questions must still be asked but,  hopefully,

we  can  shed more light rather than heat in  the  public

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this fare hike, as I said at the

outset, I am not in favour of reviewing the decision.  It

has been made, we should abide by it.  But we should also

recognise that there are people who will be hard  hit  by

it, especially those who have just been retrenched or are

still  jobless,  who  have suffered pay  cuts,  who  have

school-going children who depend on public transport.  We

should provide help to this group of people.  And indeed,

we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case Members have forgotten, we still have the

Economic  Downturn Relief Scheme (EDRS).  Every month  in

my  constituency, my CCC considers and approves  hundreds

of  applications for the EDRS, amounting to a few hundred

thousand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



dollars.  And the same, I am sure, is happening in  every

other  constituency.   We  also  have  various  financial

assistance schemes within each of our constituency.  This

is  in  addition to the many support programmes, such  as

the Rental and Utilities Assistance Scheme, introduced in

the  off-Budget  package  last year,  sharing  of  Budget

surpluses  through the New Singapore Shares, and  so  on.

So,  it is quite wrong to suggest that the Government  is

not  aware  of the problems faced by those who have  been

hard hit by this fare increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if nothing else, this debate can serve to

highlight that such schemes are available, and if  anyone

wishes  to avail himself of these schemes, he can do  so.

If  he  is not familiar, he can go and see his MP and  he

will be able to advise him where to get help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that we have

appointed  the  PTC  to  regulate  the  public  transport

industry, its level of fares and its services.   We  have

set   the  framework  for  it  to  deliberate  on   these

applications.   These  are men and  women  whom  we  have

appointed,  and I believe that they have exercised  their

responsibilities  to the best of their abilities.   Their

recommendation  has been endorsed by the Ministry,  I  am

sure, after much deliberation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not support the

motion  standing  in the name of Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  and

others,  as it calls for a review of the PTC's  decision.

However, I do support the suggestion by Members  of  this

House that we should review the composition of the PTC in

order to improve the decision-making process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank you for your indulgence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have

your  permission to clarify some of the points raised  by

the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clarification, yes. But you cannot

speak any more.  You have spoken once.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes. He said that I am asking

for subsidy for public transport.  Indeed, I am not.   In

my speech, I said that we are not asking for subsidy, but

merely   questioning  why  should  public  transportation

companies  make  money  by  providing  public  transport.

Should  the  Government  not look  at  another  model  of

providing  public transport?  At least, it could  have  a

federation of transportation companies to run the  public

transport  services on a cost recovery basis,  and  treat

public transport as a public service.  I am not saying to

subsidise,  but  to recover cost.  Why should  they  make

money,  and  should it be profit-oriented  for  providing

such a service?  Where is the justification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of

subsidy  has  indeed been raised as one of  the  ways  of

avoiding a fare increase, and the arguments that  I  made

are  against this idea of subsidy.  Mr Low's point  about

having  the  public bus transport service as  a  not-for-profit  service is an option.  But then, again,  when  it

comes  to  not for profit, there is still the element  of

having  to  provide for the cost, and there is still  the

need  for the fares to be increased from time to time  to

take  care of increases in cost.  So, even if there is  a

not-for-profit model, as Mr Low suggested, that does  not

mean that the fares will never go up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Another clarification, Sir.

Does the Minister agree that the moment the profit factor

is removed, there will be less controversy, even if there

is a need for the fares to be increased?  It is justified

based on why there is a need to increase, rather than  on

return  on equity or return on capital investment.   Will

it be better?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a clarification, Mr Low. It

is a question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the speakers before me have  done  a  good

job,  reflecting the public's unhappiness.   But  I  must

still  go on and have my say because more voice will  add

to  the  strength and support for this Motion.   Minister

Mah has disagreed with certain issues, one of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



which  is  subsidy.  I disagree and  I  do  not  buy  his

argument for not subsidising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an active society. This Parliament House is

not static.  We argue and debate over an issue to come to

a conclusion and, for every case, we decide whether it is

worth  the  subsidy.   So,  it is  not  that  because  we

subsidise public transport, we are going to subsidise for

many  other  issues that come along the way.   I  do  not

think that is the case.  Every case has its own merit  to

be debated in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not too long ago when this

Government boasted about more good years, more jobs, more

investments,  more  wealth-creation  and  more   economic

prosperity  for Singaporeans.  This Government  has  gone

further to boast about reaching to the Swiss standard  of

living  and about a world-class transport system.   These

days, we can only hear the Ministers telling Singaporeans

to  lower their expectations, not to be too fussy and  to

accept   lower  paying  jobs.   More  retrenchments   are

expected to be on the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what happened to those promises? What happened

to  the  PAP's "More Good Years"?  Where are all the  new

jobs  that  this  Government  promised  during  the  last

election?  The Government claims that we have reached the

Swiss standard of living.  I do not see it at all.   What

I,  and many other Singaporeans see, are rising costs and

charges.  The economy is in recession.  Yet, the cost  of

living  is  going up.  The biggest culprit creating  this

rising  cost  is  the  Government  and  Government-linked

public  service providers.  If this is the notion of  the

Government's  Swiss standard of living,  then  I  believe

many   Singaporeans  would  rather  not  have  it.    Are

Singaporeans being conned?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government boasts that we have a world-class

transport  system.  Again, like many Singaporeans,  I  do

not  see it.  The newspaper reports that the LRT in  Choa

Chu  Kang constantly breaks down.  Many commuters staying

in outlying areas have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



to change a few buses or trains just to get to work every

morning.   During peak hours, the buses  and  trains  are

constantly packed like sardines.  Sometimes you  have  to

skip  and  miss  a  few  buses or trains  before  finally

boarding one.  Is this the Government's idea of  a  world

class  transport  system?  I wonder.  Has  the  Transport

Minister ever squeezed in with the crowd during peak hour

traffic?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything in a class of its own about our

transport system, it is what Singaporeans pay  to  own  a

car.   The  Government discourages car use, and wants  to

encourage  Singaporeans to take  public  transport.   But

what  could  be  worse than being forced to  take  public

transport?  It is being told that the public needs to pay

more  money to these public transport operators  so  that

they  can  maintain their profit margins.  Otherwise,  we

are  told, these monopolies will lose money and commuters

will be worse off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators are the only two

listed   companies  in  Singapore,  whose   profits   and

shareholders the Government indirectly protects, and  the

Government happens to be the biggest shareholder of  one.

By  listing  these  transport operators,  the  Government

cannot  be allowed to evade its social responsibility  to

provide  efficient and affordable public transport.  Just

like security, education and healthcare, public transport

is  one  of  the  key  services that  the  Government  is

required to provide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is not willing to subsidise the

cost  of  providing  this  essential  service,  then  the

Government  should seriously look into liberalising  this

transport   sector   and  allow  for  more   competition.

Citizens pay taxes so that the Government can provide for

these  essential services.  It is not to give higher  pay

and  higher  bonuses.   The  Government  cannot  regulate

public  services, demand high profits for the  operators,

continue   to   collect  taxes  and  shirk   its   social

responsibilities, all at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this and consistent future fare hikes may not

mean  much  to the well-rewarded high income-earners  and

civil

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



servants, the bulk of aged low income families will  have

more difficulties in trying to make ends meet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question on the kind of profit

margins  these operators want, is earning more  than  $50

million every year not good enough?  When times are good,

and everyone is making a lot of money, nobody would be so

pissed  off  with a fare hike.  Commuters can accept  and

tolerate it.  But now ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia, I suggest you not use the

words "pissed off".

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the economy is so bad. So many people are

being retrenched, and many more are having their pay  cut

or  frozen.   Many  businesses are  suffering.  Transport

operators  are not the only ones.  So, why  should  their

profit  margins  be  protected at all?   These  transport

monopolies cannot simply go to the public ATM - which  is

all  the  transport commuters - and press them  for  more

monies  when their profits drop.  Nobody will  dispute  a

fare  hike  if there is a genuine need.  But this  latest

increase is clearly just aimed at boosting their  already

fat  profit  margins.   At such a  difficult  time,  wide

margins are unrealistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the public's many protests and unhappiness,

the  Government went on to support this hike.  Why is the

Government so insensitive and uncaring?  Is it taking the

public's  overwhelming support at the last  election  for

granted?  This current fare hike is so revolting, because

the operators have yet to explain specifically why it  is

needed satisfactorily.  Let us not talk about previous or

future  hikes.   Given  current circumstances,  with  SBS

Transit and SMRT still highly profitable, why should this

hike  be  allowed  to  take  place  at  all?   What   we,

Singaporeans, really need and want to know are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How has this profit margin been worked out?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Is this a reasonable margin in these recession

times when everybody is feeling squeezed?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What are the specific investments these

operators have actually made to justify the fee hike?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Are these investments what the commuters really

need?   If not, why should they be made to pay for  these

unnecessary extras like expensive plasma screen TVs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. More importantly, have the operators improved

the  connectivity and frequency of buses and trains to  a

satisfactory level?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Finally, what will happen if they do not raise

the fares this time round? Will they really go bankrupt?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, show us how these operators do their sums.

Let  us  see where the major expenditures go.  The nation

is  certainly  not  short of accountants  and  interested

individuals  to  scrutinise  their  numbers.   This  hike

should  not take place just because the Public  Transport

Council,  whose  members have a vested  interest,  thinks

that it is all right to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support the call to review and reject

this  latest fare hike. Why must the public pay more when

there  is  a recession?  The PTC needs to re-examine  its

formula on how it approves fare increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to urge the

Government  to ensure that the prices of public  services

are  not  unreasonably increased during  these  difficult

times.   Just  eight  months after the  November  General

Election,  Singaporeans have been  informed  of  so  many

increases in fees and charges for public services.  Since

May,  refuse  collection fees have gone  up.   Just  last

week, transport fares and utility fees have also gone up.

Come  September, it will be carpark charges.  Then, maybe

telephone  charges.  Soon, more ERP.   Then,  night  ERP.

Next January, we will have GST.  What else?  And what  is

next?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that many Government-related agencies and

companies  are upping their fees and charges to  increase

their profits in this difficult time, before the GST

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



increase  sets  in.  It was recently announced  that  the

Government wants Singapore to be a broadcasting hub.  The

Media  21  Report sought additional funding  for  various

initiatives to make this a reality.  These are additional

public  investments.  The question is:  are  we  then  to

expect  higher TV and radio licence fees soon  to  recoup

these  additional investments?  On Sunday, we  read  that

the  CEO  of the zoo had resigned.  One reason  cited  is

that he is not good in financial matters.  A new CEO with

good  business figures will be selected to  replace  him.

The  question is: are we going to see a hike in  the  zoo

entrance fees soon?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Government and Government-linked companies

leading  the way to price increases, it is quite  certain

that  private  businesses will follow  soon  to  jack  up

prices to maintain their profit margins.  Their reasoning

is  simple:  if the Government can do it, why  not  they?

Already,  a  number  of private car-park  operators  have

announced  that  they  are  raising  their  charges  too.

Parking  charges at various shopping centres  and  office

buildings are likely to go up by as much as 20 cents  per

hour.   Soon,  to  cover  their rising  operating  costs,

hawkers and small business operators are going to jack up

prices  too.   Thanks, but no thanks to  the  Government,

prices will spiral up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, Singaporeans have a Committee to Combat

Profiteering.  It is headed by the hon. Member  from  Joo

Chiat.  This Committee can check hawkers and retailers if

they  increase prices unreasonably.  However, it  has  no

power  to  challenge  the  Government  and  these  public

service providers if they profiteer.  The Government  and

the  GLCs are clearly the biggest culprit in this  series

of  price hikes, not the small hawkers and retailers  who

are suffering from price increases themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to quote a recent Straits

Times forum page writer:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While we may not have much choice about who sells

us (the) services, we can choose which countries

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



to live in..  Given Singapore's relatively short history,

we  should  not be surprised if people choose  pragmatism

over patriotism, (and vote with their feet.)"

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope that the Government is not driving

our    citizens   to   despair   and   leave   Singapore.

Singaporeans are not asking for much.  They just  want  a

place  where  they can work hard, make  enough  money  to

start  and  build  a family, and retire without  worrying

about "money no enough".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can try to be a lot nicer and more

caring  by  not  being  too greedy  and  sucking  up  the

people's  money  too  much.  This is  all  we  ask.   The

people's  welfare is paramount for, without  them,  there

can be no nation.  Can the Ministers please take heed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in.  Frankly, I was a bit confused at

the   direction  the  NCMP  was  going  as  I  could  not

understand  some  of  the  things  he  was  saying.   For

example,  I  am  surprised that the NCMP feels  that  the

transport system is not world-class.  I am sure  that  he

does  not  really  mean  it, as  we  do  indeed  have  an

excellent  transport  system not matched  by  many.   The

issue at hand that we are debating today is - and this is

a  question  he should really ask - at what cost  are  we

having such a world-class transport system?  This is  the

issue that he should have focused on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the NCMP added to the Motion - which

again  confused  me - was that he wanted  to  reject  the

latest fare increases in addition to the review question.

While  I  can understand the NCMP's desire to  have  more

power  than  what  he already has - as an  MP  without  a

constituency - it is equally important to understand  the

mechanics of the whole process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PTC, as I understand it, does not report to

Parliament  and we should, therefore, not be  unrealistic

about  what  we can or cannot do.  In the  case  of  this

Motion,  we  really  have  to  urge  the  PTC,  and   the

Government  for that matter, to initiate the  process  to

review,  if we carry through the Motion - and we are  not

in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



position to reject the increases or the decisions of  the

PTC  -  instead  of  having  a disruptive  process  where

Parliament  gets in the way of the Government  and  other

agencies,  I  feel that the current process  works  well.

Furthermore,  there is a lot more value for  our  Members

today  in  this debate to address the root cause  of  the

issue  of what caused the fare increases this time round.

Hopefully, by understanding the root causes, we  can  put

in  place systematic changes and new processes which will

be  acceptable  to all of us, and I hope  to  talk  about

these during my speech today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion in the name of Mr Tan Soo

Khoon.   I  have  a few issues with the  way  the  Public

Transport  Council operates, and the operating  principle

it  uses  to  determine and approve fare  increases  when

requested by the transport operators.  I believe that the

issue  with the recent fare increases lies not  with  the

PTC  alone, but also with the Government, which sets  the

agenda and the charter of the PTC.  Until and unless  the

Government steps in and changes the charter of the PTC, I

am  afraid  that  we  will continue  to  see  problematic

decisions, as we have experienced this time round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Dr Wang that the PTC was just

doing  its  job,  and  a  job that  is  designed  by  the

Government.   I  feel  that it  is  about  time  that  we

reviewed  the charter, which was established in 1987  and

modified  about 10 years later.  Similarly, I would  like

to  see  changes in the composition of the PTC,  as  have

been  suggested  by many Members, to better  reflect  the

views   of  consumers  and  the  public  who  use  public

transport  daily, and also to have members who understand

the mechanics of business a lot better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, on the charter. I would like to urge

the   Government,  and  particularly  the  Minister   for

Transport,  to  take the opportunity to  learn  from  the

mistake  this  time round and to put in place  a  revised

charter  and set out new objectives and guidelines  which

can  better  serve  the purpose of the commuting  public.

The view many people have right now is that the PTC seems

to be a body which watches over the interest of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



the  transport  companies more than the public.   Why  is

this  so?  I believe this is because of the charter,  the

roles  and  the guidelines which the Ministry  has  given

them.   So,  in a way, it is not fair to put  the  entire

blame  on  the  PTC.   They were  basically  designed  to

fulfill  certain objectives, as they have been doing  all

along.   Times  have changed and we have to  change  with

times.   We  have to therefore change the  objectives  to

better  achieve the results that we want to  achieve  for

all  the stakeholders.  The stakeholders in this case are

the  public, the Government and the transport  companies.

Such  a  revised charter needs to be better  balanced  to

place  a heavier weightage on the impact on the commuting

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the things which need to be reviewed include

the  process  through  which  decisions  are  made.   For

example,  can I ask what are the benchmarks the  PTC  and

the    Government   use   to   determine   the   required

profitability  level  for  the transport  companies?   We

cannot use internal data alone, because we have an almost

monopoly  situation  for  all  our  transport  companies,

especially if we look at the way routes are allocated  to

each  operator.   It  is not even a  duopoly.   It  is  a

monopoly,  especially  if  we consider  the  Government's

unwillingness  to  open  up  the  transport   sector   to

competition.  Frankly, I wonder why the Government is  so

reluctant to allow more competitors, as many Members have

asked.

Sir,  I  also  disagree  with the Minister  for  National

Development's argument that competition will not work  in

this   case.    Just   like  transport   companies,   the

telecommunication   industry   too    has    had    heavy

infrastructural  costs.   If  competition  works  in  the

telecommunication industry, why can it not  work  in  the

transport  companies?  About 15-20 years  ago,  we  would

never have believed that competition would have been good

for  telecommunications, and the results have shown  that

it  has  worked for all of us.  The Minister also  quoted

two  extreme examples.  One was of the rickety  buses  of

the  1960s,  which I also rode on.  It was  a  completely

chaotic environment - no proper rules and regulations, no

regulators, or perhaps no good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



regulators.   Then,  we  have  the  other  extreme  of  a

monopoly situation today, which seems to have worked.  It

is arguable whether competition will or will not work.  I

think we should experiment with this, by introducing  one

more  transport company and see the results.   We  should

not, just because it has worked in the past, believe that

changes are not going to be good for us in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to see benchmarks being used with

operators  from other countries in the way the PTC  makes

its  decision on setting new prices.  In this respect,  I

would  like  to  ask  the Minister:   what  is  the  pre-determined profit level that we have to set for transport

companies, before which they are allowed to ask for  fare

increases?  In fact, I would like to ask if there  should

even be a profit criterion in determining fare increases,

perhaps  in  determining other  things.   Frankly,  I  am

amazed  that  we  are giving so much  of  protection  for

publicly listed companies.  It is precisely this type  of

involvement that creates an uneven playing field for many

more  private  sector  players.   How  I  wish  that  the

Government  also provides the industry I am operating  in

that  type of protection, so that I do not have to  worry

about  profitability  and I do not have  to  worry  about

downturns.  My point is that sometimes, companies have to

face  the real situation of profitability, and losses  at

some  other  time.  We would probably  have  a  lot  more

stronger companies and in that process, create a lot more

efficiency in the whole system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is related to the charter which I

am  not convinced that the PTC has done a thorough job in

reviewing   the  cost  reduction  efforts  of   transport

companies  before allowing them to increase fare  prices.

The excuse that the companies use is that they are seeing

increases  in cost and want to be compensated  for  these

increases.   My argument is that in the last  two  years,

companies  in Singapore should have seen a reduction  and

not  an increase in cost. Given the recession, wage costs

should have come down. The Government allowed rentals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



to come down, property tax is down and many other charges

came  down, as a result of the recession that we saw  two

years  ago.  So where are the cost increases coming from?

I  therefore  repeat  that I am not  convinced  that  the

review  was  thorough  enough.  Such  a  situation  would

create  inefficient  and unproductive  companies  and  we

should  not accept these things.  Even if costs may  have

increased, the PTC should have convinced itself that  the

transport companies did do their best in putting in place

serious   cost  reduction  and  productivity  improvement

measures before agreeing to allow any fare increases.  In

examples  in  my industry, in a recession like  this,  we

have  to talk about cost reduction, in the range  of  20-30%,  and even 40% sometimes just to survive.  I  do  not

see  the transport companies having shown they have tried

to do that.  In the review of the charter, we must insist

on  a  better methodology to review cost increases,  cost

reduction, productivity improvement, and set a  benchmark

of  performance  before  any  transport  company  becomes

eligible for fare increases.  The fact that all transport

companies  are allowed to increase fares in  tandem  this

time  round  also  puts  to question  the  assessment  of

operating cost impact for each of the companies, the fact

that  we allow all of them to increase at the same  time.

I cannot believe that both companies have similar rate of

cost increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is one of composition of the PTC.

I  feel  that we should have more people from the private

sector  involved,  particularly  industry  captains  from

different  industries, especially those  who  face  stiff

competition in their industry. Such people would be  able

to  ask better questions related to cost increases,  cost

reduction  efforts and productivity improvements,  return

on  investments and other financial measures to determine

the  true  efficiency of the transport  companies  before

agreeing to any fare increases.  In my opinion, with  the

heavy Government representation and the representation of

the  transport companies, this important role  cannot  be

well-performed.  So, I call on the Government  to  review

the  composition of the Council as soon  as  possible  so

that this would give confidence to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans that their interest would be taken  care  of

in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue I have is on how this round of

increases took place.  It is my impression that the  fare

increases, which the PTC just approved, seem to have been

a  result of a set piece of standard operating procedures

(SOPs)  which  the Government seems to have adopted  many

years  ago.   The  people responsible in executing  these

SOPs just went on to implement this set piece without due

consideration  of what is really happening  in  the  real

world.   What probably went wrong this time is  that  the

SOP  did  not  consider  the economic  condition  of  the

country  and  the financial position of Singaporeans.   I

feel  that the people responsible for initiating the  PTC

review should have been more sensitive to the real  world

problems  and not just implement the SOPs which may  have

been  set many years ago.  In this respect, Sir,  I  feel

that  the Government and the civil service need  to  come

out  with  more  convincing answers to the  questions  on

issues  like price increases.  The attitude reflected  in

the  replies,  especially those given in the  newspapers'

Forum  pages  are  no  longer acceptable  and  reflect  a

certain level of arrogance in the replies.  I think  this

is   something   that  is  not  convincing   enough   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I feel that the real issue at hand is

that we have been using a PTC system and a charter, which

is now out-dated, and there is an urgent need for this to

be  reviewed.  It is understandable why the PTC ended  up

allowing a fare increase this time round because the  PTC

and  its  charter  have been designed to  allow  this  to

happen.  Had the guidelines been different, I am sure the

decision would have been different.  For example, at this

point  of  time, many Singaporeans actually shifted  from

using  their private cars or taxis to buses and the  MRT.

I  can almost predict that the public transport companies

would  have  seen  an increase, and  not  a  decrease  of

revenue  this  time round.  How then could the  PTC  have

approved the fare increases this time?  We therefore need

a  new formula that would determine a new balance for the

future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, even as I

rise  to  comment  on the Motion, I  am  mindful  of  the

financial  challenges that Singaporeans face  which  this

economic downturn has presented, and that many have  been

unemployed for a prolonged period of time.  Sir, I accept

that  the  Public Transport Council can be  requested  or

urged  to  broaden their considerations and  to  be  more

exhaustive in their deliberations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot support the motion that the PTC be

asked  to  review  their decision,  let  alone  have  the

Government stay, revoke or reject the PTC's decision,  as

suggested by Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Steve Chia.   Doing

so  would question the very existence of and the  purpose

for  constituting  the PTC.  It would threaten  the  very

independence that was crafted into the Bill back in 1987.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time, one of the main functions was to

consider  applications for fare adjustments, taking  into

account two frequently divergent objectives: firstly, for

transport operators to remain financially viable  whilst,

secondly,  safeguarding public interest.   The  basis  is

that  if  transport operators are not viable and have  to

offer  poorer quality of service, then commuters at large

would suffer.  Yet, Sir, commuters' interests and ability

to  afford  the  proposed fare hikes must weigh  heavily,

especially   in  difficult  times.  Hence,   the   Public

Transport   Council,  understandably,  has  a   difficult

balance  to  strike and on an on-going  basis.   I  would

agree  with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that perhaps there could  be

more  disclosure  on  the  criteria  for  evaluation   of

proposals,  whether it is for new services  or  for  fare

adjustments, and to have more transparency on the process

itself.   Or  perhaps,  the  composition  of  the  Public

Transport Council should be re-looked at to ensure  that,

firstly,  there is a wider representation  of  views  and

interest  and, secondly, there is a clear management  and

separation of conflicts of interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on competition, although Mr Mah Bow Tan has

explained  why free market competition is not necessarily

desirable, I would like to echo the call to the Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



for  Transport  to review the competitive and  regulatory

framework   for  transport  services.   I   believe   the

circumstances  are different and should justify  a  fresh

review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of any changes to the transport services

sector, or to the composition of the PTC, the PTC's  very

independence of the Minister and Ministry officials  that

was conceived at the outset, must be preserved.  Sir,  to

make a villain of the PTC, as alluded to by Mr Steve Chia

and  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang,  is  unwise.   Any  hint   of

moderating or influencing the decision of the PTC  cannot

be allowed, without a debate on the very existence of the

PTC  itself,  its  integrity, its  very  institution,  an

existence that this very House had created back in  1987.

Hence,  while I am in total sympathy with the  plight  of

families   in   need,   I  caution  against   unwittingly

destroying  the  very integrity of the  Public  Transport

Council.

<br>5.10 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to

join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the MPs who have spoken earlier, I know many

Singaporeans   are  unhappy  over  the   transport   fare

increases.  There is a general sense of unhappiness,  and

not  just  from bus commuters.  They are frustrated  that

the  Government seems to be hearing-impaired, or deaf  to

their  pleas, at a time when we are still not yet out  of

the  recession.  I face this unhappiness too when I  walk

around my constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sentiments have been well expressed by the MPs

before  me.  I would not repeat them.  We need to respond

to  these  concerns.   As  a responsible  Government,  we

cannot  govern  in a vacuum.  To govern  effectively,  we

need the understanding of the people.

Rising Aspirations

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent many years running public hospitals. I

acquired a habit of walking the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



hospital  wards, talking to patients and their relatives.

They  came from all walks of life, from the middle  class

to the lower income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But regardless of their background, they all have

aspirations for a better life.  This is as it should  be.

As  Singapore graduates from third world to  first  world

status, Singaporeans naturally expect to live like  their

counterparts in the first world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have high expectations of our public

transport  service.  We demand continuous improvement   - more  choices,  greater  frequency,  strict  punctuality,

greater comfort, no breakdowns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I grew up in the kampong, I was used to

waiting, without any shelter, often for an hour, before a

dirty, hot and noisy bus would finally turn up.  It was a

different  lifestyle  then.  People  were  more  patient.

Nowadays, my daughters would give me an earful if the MRT

service was disrupted, even for a few minutes.

Fare Increases are Inevitable

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to meeting the rising

aspirations of Singaporeans.  We are committed to  making

continuous   improvements.   And  over  the  years,   our

transport operators have, by and large, been able to meet

these  higher demands.  But it is not realistic to expect

such  improvements to come with no adjustments in  fares.

It is just not possible to deliver better services at the

same price over a long period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that if only public transport could be

like  the  mobile telephones where you see prices  coming

down    with    more    and   more    competition.     In

telecommunication, it is possible, thanks  to  technology

breakthroughs.    Prices,   in   fact,   have    dropped.

Unfortunately,    in   most   other   industries,    such

opportunities are not easily available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because public transport is labour-intensive, cost

increases due to wage increases are hard to avoid.   Like

other workers, transport workers deserve pay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



rise  too.   Let  us  be fair to the many  honest,  hard-working  bus  drivers,  train operators,  who  work  long

hours, often past midnight, so that the rest of Singapore

can work all day, and play all night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that there is no scope for

productivity  gain.   There  is.   And  it  is  precisely

productivity gains which have largely allowed the PTC  to

moderate transport fare increases over the years.  First,

two-men-operated  buses  became one-man-operated.   Next,

single-deck  buses became double-deck  buses.   Then,  we

joined two buses into one, to save one driver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is not just productivity gain through

hardware.  The quality of bus drivers and train operators

today is quite different from the old days.  They are now

better trained and better skilled.  And they also need to

be  IT-literate, given the penetration of IT and Internet

into  public  transport.  In a few years, with  3G,  with

wireless  Internet, I expect buses and trains  to  become

mobile offices where commuters continue to work and  play

while moving from one place to another.  So the demand on

our  transport operators to be more sophisticated in  its

service  offering is bound to rise further.  And we  will

push  the transport operators to seek productivity gains.

But let us be honest, we cannot avoid some fare increases

once in a while.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the heat of the debate, both in

the media and in the coffee shops, some misunderstandings

have  cropped  up,  and  we need to  first  correct  such

misinformation,  before  we can choose  the  best  course

forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 1 - fare increases are due to

frills  -  air-conditioned  interchanges,  fanciful   bus

shelters, TV in buses.  Many said "Commuters do not  need

them, remove them and fare increases can be avoided."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether these are frills, we can debate about it.

But the key point is that the transport companies did not

pay   for  any  of  these.   They  got  them  for   free.

Government  pays for air-conditioned interchanges.   Why?

Government decided on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



air-conditioned  interchanges  because  integrating   the

interchanges  into high-rise commercial  buildings  makes

much   better  use  of  land,  instead  of  keeping   bus

interchanges  as  stand-alone  buildings.    But   having

integrated  them  into  buildings, air-conditioning  them

becomes  necessary.  Likewise, fanciful bus shelters  and

TV   Mobile,  are  services  provided  by  other  private

companies  because  they expect  to  make  money  through

advertisements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the transport companies did not pay for any of

these  services, they did not, and would  not  have  been

allowed to use these to ask for fare increases.  In other

words, commuters are not made to pay for these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 2 - fare increases are to

fatten  the  profits of bus and train operators.   Is  it

really?   This can be easily verified.  You  cannot  hide

fat profits.  In any case, management has no incentive to

hide  fat  profits, as otherwise their bonuses would  get

affected.  The big problem in Wall Street today  is  that

some  management has been tempted to produce fat  profits

through  creative  accounting.   The  fact  is  that  our

transport operators are not making fat profits.   Yes,  I

have  heard  Mr Tan Soo Khoon quoting various figures  to

show the point that they are making fat profits.  But  if

I  were the bus and train operators, and I notice quite a

few  of  them  in the public gallery, I will  immediately

push  out  data  to  show to the rest of  Singapore  that

indeed this is not the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 3 - fare increases are due to

losses    by   transport   operators   in   non-transport

activities.  Some people have speculated that huge losses

by   transport  operators  in  properties  and  newspaper

venture  have  caused the fares to be increased.   Again,

this  is  simply not true.  We require all  non-transport

activities  of  the  operators  to  be  run  by  separate

companies.   They are fully ring-fenced  from  the  basic

public transport activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 4 - fare increases are not

opposed by an uncaring PTC.  Some people feel that PTC is

on  the  side of the operators and is only interested  in

ensuring their profitability.  They complain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



that   PTC   is  not  diligent  in  protecting   consumer

interests, and this criticism is most unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us check the record. PTC, as Mrs Lim Hwee Hua

pointed  out, was set up 15 years ago, 1987.   Over  this

period,  average  wages  in  Singapore  have  more   than

doubled.  To be precise, 136%.  The general price  level,

CPI,  has gone up much less, by 29%.  On the other  hand,

transport fares have lagged behind wage growth by a  very

big  margin,  and  have largely kept  pace  with  general

inflation.  In fact, depending on which criteria you use,

one  can argue that the average bus fares have been below

the  CPI increase over this period.  So the fact is  that

PTC   has  actively  protected  the  interests   of   the

commuters.   PTC members are serious, caring individuals,

doing  a  national service, and doing a good job  to  the

best of their ability.  They certainly do not deserve the

abuse  which  has been thrown on them over the  last  few

weeks.   The  Chairman  of  PTC incidentally  is  in  the

gallery up there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forming the PTC, we have deliberately included

members  from  all  walks of life,  to  give  it  a  wide

representation.  In the current composition, it  includes

an  accountant,  an industrialist, a labour  unionist,  a

media  editor,  an economist.  While transport  operators

are  also  members  of  PTC, they  cannot  take  part  in

decisions  in which they have an interest, such  as  fare

revisions.   They  are there so that the  PTC  will  have

first-hand   knowledge  of  the  industry  that   it   is

regulating.    Nevertheless,  we  need  to  address   the

widespread concern of Singaporeans and respond  to  their

grievances.  But in so doing, we should not inadvertently

undermine the foundation which has delivered the  present

state of our public transport system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, our public transport system is not perfect.

The  MRT and LRT can go with less breakdowns.  Buses  can

still  be more punctual, and commuters would like to  see

many more bus services added even when the loading is not

great.   And,  we will certainly work with the  PTC,  the

operators,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



with  the commuters, to make our public transport  system

better.   But if we take a pause, and think back on  what

we  had  10  years  ago,  20 years  ago,  it  is  a  vast

improvement.   And  for  those  who  have   used   public

transport in other cities, whether in the first world  or

in  the third world, they know that we have not done  too

badly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, someone e-mailed me to relate the

experience  of  one  Singaporean now working  in  London.

According to him, it has now become common for people  to

expect to come in late to office because the trains there

frequently break down at peak periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be amused by the picture of the old

rickety  Indian  bus, overflowing with  commuters.   Some

have  to  climb  onto the roof where, in fact,  the  best

"seats"  are.   The next best "seats" are for  those  who

recklessly  hang themselves outside the bus by  clutching

onto doors and windows.  Those with seats inside the  bus

turn  out  to  be the most uncomfortable -  hot,  steamy,

sweaty and suffocating!  But you have to see it with your

own eyes to appreciate this experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the fact is that over the years, we have evolved

a  good public transport system, and it rests on four key

pillars:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No.1 - Responsive to Rising Expectations.

The operators know that they have to be responsive to the

rising  expectations of Singaporeans.  As  education  and

income  level  rises, our service level has  to  rise  to

match it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No. 2 - Leveraging on Private Enterprise. We

let  private enterprise operate the service.  This is  to

take advantage of the financial discipline of the market,

and  their  greater  capacity for innovation  and  speedy

execution.   There were some suggestions from Steve  Chia

just  now, or is it Low Thia Khiang, "Forget about profit

motive.   Move to cost plus".  Yes, we can do that.   But

then it would immediately lose the incentives.  Profit is

not a dirty word.  It is precisely because of profit that

drives innovations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the discussion this afternoon, I gather there

is not a good appreciation of the CPI + X framework.  But

time  does  not  allow me to go into the nitty-gritty  of

this  system.   But the CPI + X system was  precisely  to

allow us to incentivise operators to innovate and to seek

out and benefit as much productivity gains as they could,

subject  to the framework within which they are  entitled

to  certain price increases.  Then, it is the job of  the

PTC  to decide what is a reasonable rate of increase, and

that  is  the  CPI  +  X framework.   So,  if  you  fully

understood  what  the CPI + X framework  is  supposed  to

achieve, all this discussion about profitability  and  so

on   is   irrelevant.   It  has  nothing   to   do   with

profitability.  Within this CPI + X framework, we  decide

what  is  a  reasonable rate of fare increases  which  is

commensurate   with  the  affordability  level   of   the

population, then it is the job of the operators to go all

out to make profit out of this approved system.  That  is

the  only way to drive innovation.  That is the only  way

to drive productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No. 3 - Targeting Government Subsidy on

Infrastructure.   We  provide a huge Government  subsidy,

but  we  have been careful to target it at infrastructure

and capital investment.  We cannot leave public transport

purely  to  the  market, because then  many  Singaporeans

would  not  be  able to afford the full  fare  of  public

transport.

So there is a role for Government in funding, but we have

deliberately  not  subsidised  the  operational  cost  of

public  transport.  The operators will have to  make  the

operation viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was delighted to read the Streats' article last

week, July 2, in which it quoted a Madam Soh Lay Hoon who

stays  in  Jurong but works in Ang Mo Kio.  Her house  is

about  a 10-minute walk from the Jurong East MRT station.

She  can  either  walk there or take a feeder  bus.   She

chooses  to get up just a little bit earlier so that  she

can walk to the station in time.  That way, she saves  on

shuttle fares every day.  This is a very sensible,  down-to-earth  approach.   Now, do we  want  to  distort  such

sensible  decisions  by, for example, subsidising  feeder

fares?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No. 4 - Preserving the Independence of the

Regulator.   We  set  up  an  independent  regulator   to

regulate the transport operators.  When PTC was set up 15

years ago, there was a full debate in this House.  I  was

then  a  young civil servant and I remember  the  debate.

This  House gave birth to the PTC.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon  and

several  veteran MPs in this House could claim  paternity

to  the PTC.  We know that public transport fares had  to

be  adjusted  periodically if we are to enjoy  continuous

service improvements.  But fare adjustments are unpopular

and  we  should  try  to  de-politicise  it  as  much  as

possible,  if  at  all possible.  In fact,  a  point  was

brought up during the debate in 1987 on whether some  MPs

should  sit  in  the  PTC.  It was  quickly  rejected  as

unwise.  Instead, the independence and professionalism of

the  PTC  was  stressed by several MPs, both during  that

debate, as well as this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can argue over the composition of the PTC,

whether we could widen its representation to include, eg,

grassroots  leaders, as suggested  by  some  MPs,  or  to

exclude  the transport operators.  We can debate  whether

the  PTC could have better explained its recent decisions

to  the people.  We can discuss whether PTC should revise

its  modus  operandi, eg, to make its deliberations  more

transparent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong in criticising the decision

of  the PTC.  They have a difficult job of balancing, not

profitability, but the long-term interests  of  commuters

and the short-term effects on them.  Inevitably, judgment

has  to  be  made.  We can certainly disagree with  PTC's

judgment,  as honest people would.   But we cannot  fault

them  for  not  being diligent.  They are  certainly  not

apologists for operators, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon put it this

afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we certainly should not inadvertently weaken the

PTC  by  undermining the independence of  this  important

public institution.  To weaken the PTC will, in fact,  be

to  go  against commuters because PTC is there to protect

them.  We should strengthen PTC; we should not weaken it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, have grave misgiving about the Motion

as currently worded.  The first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



part on urging the PTC to review its decision must surely

undermine it.  If we over-ride the PTC, by getting it  to

reverse its decision, or even if by getting them to delay

the  hike,  as suggested by, I think, Mr Leong Horn  Kee,

then what is the point of appointing the PTC?

Fare Increases During Recession

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But MPs are correct to say that the timing of the

fare increase is bad, as we are still recovering from the

recession.   PTC  is,  of  course,  fully  aware  of  the

economic backdrop, but it operates on the principle  that

regular  small  fare  increases  are  better  than  large

infrequent  increases.   It is  to  make  it  easier  for

commuters to adjust.  I support this principle.  But  PTC

may  want  to revisit this principle, to see if there  is

scope  to  apply it with greater sensitivity at times  of

recession.   Certainly,  fare  increases  can  be  better

explained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, urge Mr Tan Soo Khoon and others

to relook the Motion to see how it can be amended to make

it  clearer  on the follow-up action of the  PTC  without

undermining its authority or independence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the face of globalisation of the economy

and jobs are under threat, we are treated with   waves of

increases in prices and charges. Accordingly, this  round

of  bus  and  MRT  fare hikes gives rise to  worries  and

concerns  to  the  people. We should have  no  difficulty

understanding  why the people have so  much  grouses  and

unhappiness,  despite the fact that  the  Consumer  Price

Index  (CPI) has been dropping over the last six  months.

So, to a certain degree, the total cost of living has not

been as bad as what many people have perceived it to  be.

But  the more important thing is that the Government must

assure  the people that when times are bad, and when  the

people  are pressurised with a rising cost of living,  it

remains  pro-people and cares for the  people.   In  this

round of public transport fare increase, we can see  that

a lot of people are very unhappy.  But the fare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



increases  have already come into effect from  1st  July.

Any amount of argument and deliberation will not able  to

turn  back the clock. It is a done deal. Or is it  really

so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there are four lessons that we should

learn from this round of public transport fares increase.

They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Implement only when all systems are ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Balance between profitability and public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The timing is everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The need for greater transparency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say the systems are not in place? I say no

because of two reasons.

First,  the  implementation of the ez-link  card  is  not

fully on track. Senior citizens who have applied for  the

card  have  not  yet  received  them.   TransitLink  only

decided  last  week  to  issue interim  cards  to  senior

citizens.  I  am  glad it has done so, as  otherwise  the

senior  citizens would have no choice but to  pay  higher

fares  using  the  existing magnetic farecards.  But  the

problem  does  not  appear  to  be  confined  to   senior

citizens.  Students are also waiting  for  their  ez-link

cards to be issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the teething problems of the ez-link card

have  not  been  fully  resolved.  Judging  from  various

feedback,  the problems with the ez-link cards  faced  by

commuters  are  very  real.  My residents  told  me  that

adjusting  the  fares at this moment  is  unfair  to  the

senior citizens, because many of them have yet to receive

their ez-link cards they had applied for.  This is to say

that  we are forcing the senior citizens to pay more when

they use the public transport system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, it was announced that provisional ez-link

cards  would be issued to the senior citizens.  I am  not

sure  whether this can effectively solve the  problem  of

these senior citizens.  Moreover,  the students are still

waiting   for   their   ez-link   cards.    Under    such

circumstances, many citizens are not able to use the  ez-link card, and when they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



continue  to use the TransitLink card, they have  to  pay

higher fares.  To them, the increase is not 3 cents but 5

cents.   To  those  who  are not used  to  the  automatic

system,  they have to pay cash and, hence, to  them,  the

increase  is 10 cents.  If we can wait until the  ez-link

card   is  completely  in  place,  then  make  the   fare

adjustments,   the inconvenience to the  people  will  be

reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must balance between the transport

companies'  profits  and  public  interest.   People,  in

general,  are  unhappy  with the  fact  that  the  public

transport companies are asking for fare increase  despite

the  fact that they are making huge profits and  thus  no

urgency  to increase fares.  There is an article  in  the

Straits Times suggesting that public transport should  be

a  service to  the people and not for profit.  Therefore,

there is no need to rush into fare increases at this time

of  recession. The article commented that the thing  that

hurt  the commuters most was the Government's failure  to

see  beyond  rational  argument  and  its  inability   or

unwillingness  to empathise with the people.   These  are

strong words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another newspaper, Streats, a similar view was

also  reflected.  It was felt that in recent  years,  the

public  transport system seemed to have lost its original

direction.  The writer said that fare prices and services

should  not  be entirely determined by cost  and  profits

alone.   Should  public transport operators  be  entirely

profit-oriented?   The  writer claimed  that  our  public

transport  policy has lost its direction, and this  is  a

question that many people have raised and, I think, it is

necessary for us to study the issues closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, our public transport operators are

listed  companies.   According to the  public,  they  are

making  money,  especially,  recently,  when  the   whole

economic  environment is bad, they are  still  profitable

companies.  Sir, let us look at the past records.   There

were  no changes to the fares from 1982 to 1990.  Between

1990  and  1996, the average fare went up  by  1.3%.   In

1996,  however, it was reported that SBS  and  TIBS  lost

$9.6 million and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



$5.6  million  respectively.  Thus, in 1997,  PTC  agreed

with  the bus companies to increase the fares by 5  cents

across the board. But in order to reduce the impact,  the

1997   adjustment   was  only  confined   to   the   non-airconditioned   buses  only.    For   those   who   took

airconditioned buses and paid with their fare-cards, they

did  not have to suffer the fare hike. As for MRT,   only

those who travelled with single journey ticket needed  to

pay  10  cents more.  In the next three years, 1997-2000,

the  fare was not adjusted.  I was particularly impressed

that  in 1999, the bus operators gave a 5% rebate to  all

commuters.  Then, in 2000 and 2001, new fare stages  were

added,  and commuters on feeder services had  to  pay  10

cents   more   respectively.   Fortunately,  with   these

moderated  adjustments, the operators  are  still  making

money.   The  question is thus: why  increase  when  they

continue to make such high profits? I think this  is  one

question that many people are asking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that many people are not happy with the

work  of  the  PTC.  But, of course, we must also  calmly

look  at  the contributions by the PTC over the past  few

years.   We must look at the facts objectively.  Look  at

these facts:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For those who use farecards, there has been no

increase   in  fares  for  passengers  travelling   short

distances  below 14 fare stages, in airconditioned  buses

since  1990,  the  fares remained between  60  cents  and

$1.20.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Over the past decade, fares have gone up

primarily  for  long distances, so as to  better  reflect

costs   and  cut  down  the  indirect  subsidy  of  short

distances over longer ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- When fares go up in the past, those who use

farecards  continue  to  enjoy  transfer  rebates,   thus

minimising the impact of fare increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In this round of adjustments, senior citizens

travelling longer distances in the MRT actually pay less,

from 70 cents to 64 cents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the PTC has done a reasonable job

drawing the line between

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



profitability  of  transport  operators  and  maintaining

public  interest,  and allowing the operators  to  remain

profitable without profiteering. But this begs a  further

question    -   last  year,  the  PTC  turned  down   the

applications  to  increase fares due  to  the  prevailing

economic conditions then, why can it not do so again this

year?  After all, the economic situation has  not  really

improved  that  much.   Why can  they  not  postpone  the

increase?  Many people feel that the timing is wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing is everything, especially when we have many

bad  news.   The Ministry of Manpower has  also  told  us

about  the  highest record of unemployment in the  second

half  of the year.  The unemployment rate will be  raised

from  5%  to 5.5%.  To Singapore, which has been enjoying

full employment for many years, this is a hard reality to

accept.  At this time, the announcement of fare increases

will  give rise to more concern and worry on the part  of

the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another angle, I feel that PTC has not done

very  well to a certain extent this time round.   In  the

past,  whenever the fares were increased,  some  form  of

rebates  for those who have to transfer from one  service

to  another  was  given to compensate for  the  increased

fares.   But this time, they have not given any discount.

I  do  not know why they cannot do it this time.  To  the

ordinary workers, if they have to take a shuttle  bus  to

the MRT and then hop on to another shuttle service to get

to  the  final destination, the effect on them is  not  3

cents,  but   3  cents plus 4 cents plus 3 cents,  ie,  a

total  of 10 cents.  So, to those who do not know how  to

use  the ez-link card, such as the senior citizens,  then

it is 10 cents plus 10 cents plus 10 cents.  So two ways,

it  is  60  cents.   I do not understand  why  we  cannot

arrange  for  some  rebates for  commuters  who  have  to

transfer from one service to another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, CASE has always been advocating strongly and

consistently  that  there must  be  transparency  in  our

commercial  organisations.  The PTC  announced  the  fare

increases on 11th June.  So far, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



have  not  heard  further from them.  No explanation  has

been  given.   So from 11th June until now,  the  various

views have been expressed and reflected very strongly  in

the  media.   But the PTC and their operators  have  been

keeping  quiet  all  this time.   Until  two  weeks  ago,

suddenly,   they  issued  a  long  reply.   My  residents

commented, "Such a long reply, how to read?".  So, nobody

knows  what  is  actually  happening.   This  is  a  very

disappointing situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often say, what goes up must come down. By the

same  logic,  what  goes down, must  come  up.   However,

people  hope that this applies only on the share  market.

When  we talk about bus fares and public service charges,

it  can only go up but never come down.  People find this

hard  to  accept.  We must let our people understand  why

this  is the case. I think some sort of clarification  or

explanation   is   necessary.    Transparency   is   very

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the film, "I Not Stupid", we must not be

treated  as  though  we  are  all  ignorant  people.   If

necessary, the authority  must explain to the  people  so

that  they  can understand.  Let me give Members  another

example.   On 2nd of July, there was a report in  Streats

where  one commuter was quoted as saying, "If our  people

want  to  enjoy  a world-class transport system  and  not

willing to pay more, then it is a joke.  Because  we  all

know that there is no free lunch."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that when prices are increased, if it

is  explained  properly, our people will  understand  the

situation  better, and thereby be more amicable  to  such

additional burden. We must not ignore the feelings of the

people.   We must explain to the people the circumstances

why  it  is  necessary to take certain action.   The  bus

operators must also tell the people clearly, whether they

have  done  their  best to improve productivity  to  save

cost.   Mr  Tan Soo Khoon had made a comparison with  the

Hong  Kong  situation - why Hong Kong could do  it  while

Singapore  could not.    More importantly, if we  do  not

explain clearly to our people, then more people will fail

to understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



and  they would feel more painful, more disappointed  and

more worried.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, overall, I endorse the principle that small

increases  from time to time  are better than  one  large

increase  all of a sudden.  But to most people,  I  think

the  adjustments here and there - a little  bit  here,  a

little bit there, a little bit everywhere - and if we add

up  all the little bits, it is one big deal.  Many people

find this hard to swallow. This is a very important issue

that   we   must  rectify  and  find  a  solution.   Most

importantly,  I hope that the lessons learnt  this  round

can  be  registered beyond this round of  fare  increase.

They  too  are  pertinent  for other  service  providers,

especially for those who are reported to be contemplating

fee  increases, such as school bus operators and SingTel.

I  hope that they can learn the lesson and increase their

transparency,  and  they should explain  clearly  to  the

people the rationale for their intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would like to ask the

Government  a  few questions. First, on statutory  costs.

From  the  public debate and public transport  operators'

reply,  it appears that statutory cost is one of the  key

factors that drives up fares. My question to SMRT and SBS

is:  what  is the extent of statutory costs in  operating

their   businesses?  Further,  I  understand   that   the

Government  has allowed public buses to enjoy concessions

in  road  taxes  and  exemption from  COE,  why  can  the

Government  not  exempt public buses  from  ERP  charges?

Surely,  this will further cut down statutory  costs  and

give one less reason for bus operators to increase fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the airconditioned bus interchange. SBS

has   clarified   that   the   cost   of   building   the

airconditioned interchange at Toa Payoh was borne by  the

Government.   I   am  concerned  that   operational   and

maintenance  cost that operators have to bear  in  future

can  be  very high, and it will become a key  factor  for

future  fare  increase.  My  question  is:  what  is  the

estimated  operational cost of running an  airconditioned

interchange compared to a non-airconditioned one?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS also said that it does not get any rental

income from tenants at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



interchanges  and  neither do the tenants  help  pay  for

upkeep  of common areas. I have several questions to  the

Government: did the Government allow SMRT to  get  rental

income from the tenants at the MRT stations? If so, would

this  arrangement be extended to public bus operators  to

offset cost of maintaining the interchange?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its letter published in the newspapers on 24th

June, the SBS said that "If we are able to work with  the

authorities to share some of the cost of maintaining  the

interchange  for instance, it will also not be  a  factor

when  considering future fare increases." I was surprised

by SBS' statement. If the Government can defray the costs

of  maintaining interchanges, SBS' operational costs will

surely  go down, and this must certainly be a factor  for

SBS to consider in future fare increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the SBS, LTA and the Minister for

Transport  can  address  the various  questions  that  we

raised  in this House and those raised by the members  of

the public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, while there are early signs of our economy bottoming

out, it is still some time yet for a broad based recovery

to materialise.  The employment situation, in particular,

is  likely  to worsen before it improves.  The Government

has  repeatedly  called on the people to be  patient  and

flexible.   We are asked to tighten our belts and  accept

lower  pay so as to stay employed.  We are urged to  make

sacrifices so that we could bring in new investments  and

restart the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people having been convinced, we took the bitter

medicine,  albeit  with a bit of  sugar.   However,  such

sacrifices should be borne by all in an equitable manner.

It  therefore should not surprise the Government when our

people  reacted  strongly  when  the  various  Government

agencies and the public transport operators raised  their

charges one after another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, feedback from our residents showed that the

decision of the Public Transport

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



Council  to  allow bus and MRT to raise their  fares  has

probably  pushed  our people over their tolerance  limit.

They  came  to  me and said, "Towkay, tong mui  teow  loh

ler."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they raised three issues with me. Firstly,

they  questioned  the basis for the increase.   Secondly,

they wanted to know whether the timing of the increase is

appropriate.   Lastly,  they were worried  and  uncertain

about future increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, the basis for the increase. The

Public Transport Council claimed that the increase is  in

accordance with an agreed formula, the famous  CPI  +  X.

Questions were raised on the basis of this formula.   Why

should  the PTC adopt a formula that allows the operators

to  increase their fares according to CPI increases,  let

alone  the  plus  X  factor?  The Government  has  stated

clearly that it is not its intention, nor its policy,  to

subsidise  public transport and that the public transport

companies should operate on a commercial basis.  However,

by  adopting a formula that is pegged to CPI + X  factor,

is  the  Government not endorsing a form of subsidy,  and

yet  this  subsidy does not come from the Government,  or

from the commuters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly hard to justify since both SBS

as well as MRTC have been profitable.  The fare increases

will add a significant amount to their bottom line.  Yes,

we  must allow our companies to make profit, even if they

are   providing  essential  services.   These  are   what

companies are for.  Their shareholders must see a return.

But  their return must be taken in context.  The  reality

is that many companies have suffered lower income, if not

losses, over the last two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the listed companies, for example. On average,

listed companies in the year 2001 saw a reduction of over

40%, on average, in their profits.  Many of them have  to

adopt   aggressive  restructuring  and   cost   reduction

programmes just to stay alive.  Some have to accept short-term  losses  to ensure long-term viability.   These  are

inevitable outcomes in time of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



severe   economic  downturn.   If  the  public  transport

operators  are truly commercially run, they will  not  be

able  to escape similar challenges.  However, let us take

SBS, for example.  They suffered only a 20% drop in their

profits  in  the  year 2001.  They have performed  better

than  the  market,  in  general.   The  public  transport

operators  made proposals to the PTC for rate  increases.

But  do the commuters have a chance to make proposals  to

the PTC, or representation to the PTC, to object to these

increases, or to propose a reduction instead?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to argue that a more equitable

basis  to  determine bus and MRT fare adjustments  should

take  into account the performance of the overall economy

as well.  Even if CPI goes up, which may be possible even

in   a  recession,  fare  increases  may  still  not   be

justifiable  if  the overall economy  and  companies,  in

general,  are  not  doing well.  This is,  in  fact,  the

situation  we are in right now.  Indeed, if the  economic

performance  had been taken into account, the  PTC  might

have  taken a different view and its decision might  have

been different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should consider introducing some

competition.  Singapore Airlines reacted very quickly  to

the  changes  in  industry  by initiating  fare  cuts  to

maintain its market share.  They need to do this  because

of   international   competition.    PSA   also   finally

acknowledged the threat from competition and  decided  to

reduce  its  fares.  But there is no competition  in  bus

transport or MRT.  When we raised the ERP, commuters  can

choose  not to drive and take the bus instead.  But  when

we  raised bus and MRT fares, our commuters do  not  have

the alternatives.  I would like to urge the Government to

consider allowing some form of competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is regarding the timing of the

increase.  The absolute dollar amount of the increase may

not  be  as  much an issue as the timing of the increase.

PTC should be applauded for its efforts in deferring fare

increases  in  previous years in view  of  the  difficult

economic  environment then.  The economy  has  not  fully

recovered.  In fact, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



has  somewhat  worsened,  especially  in  the  employment

situation.  Many people have lost their jobs.  More  have

taken a pay cut to save their jobs.  With reduced income,

our   people  would  be  very  wary  of  cost  increases,

especially in the essential services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are like sailing through a storm in a boat,

faced with economic difficulties.  Yet, in the middle  of

the  storm,  the passengers were asked to  top  up  their

fares.  So, the question is:  is it the right time to ask

them  to  top  up  their fares?  As a result,  many  have

wondered why the PTC could not have deferred the increase

for,  say,  another six to nine months, when the  outlook

will  be a little bit clearer.  Alternatively, PTC  could

approve the increase but defer the implementation to next

year.   This way, commuters would also have more time  to

prepare for the increases and they would probably  accept

PTC's  decision more readily, knowing that PTC has  taken

the   current  economic  and  employment  situation  into

account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, our people are fearful of what else is

there to come.  First, the Government increased the  ERP,

citing  its  objective and intention  to  curb  usage  of

private   cars  and  to  encourage  the  use  of   public

transport.   Then,  we  increased  the  public  transport

fares,  apparently in contradiction to  the  Government's

policy.   In between, there were increases in HDB carpark

charges, electricity rates and others.  I understand that

SingTel  has  also submitted application to increase  its

fixed line charges.  With almost monthly announcements of

rate  hikes in one form or another, residents have become

very wary of more such increases to come.  They come away

with  a  strong  sense of frustration.   Over  time,  the

frustration  will turn into desperation, and  desperation

will turn into anger and disappointment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to assure the

people   that   it  will  critically  scrutinise   future

increases in Government-related rates and fees and  that,

unless  absolutely  necessary, fee adjustments  would  be

deferred  until the economy recovers strongly.   I  would

also like to urge the Government to disclose early

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



impending fee hikes, if any, and to give more time before

implementation, so that our people would have  sufficient

time to make their own plans or adjustments.  It does not

help to keep proposed fee hikes under wraps and spring  a

surprise on our own residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand that the PTC has a

tough  and thankless job.  But its decisions will  affect

the  entire population, some more than others.  In  fact,

the  lower  income  families will be affected  more  than

those who own cars.  It is, therefore, important for  the

PTC  to  take  into  account not just  the  CPI  but  all

relevant  factors, such as the economy and the employment

situation, before arriving at its decisions.   It  should

also  be more transparent in its decision making process,

so  that  our people can be assured that their  interests

are being taken into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been fearful of bending to public

pressure and of adopting populist policies.  But this  is

probably  not an issue of whether the fare increases  are

popular  or  not.  The issue is obvious: we are  debating

whether the approach is appropriate and the increases are

timely.  We are all talking about remaking Singapore now.

So,  let us acknowledge that perhaps the process  of  the

fare  hikes  could have been better handled, and  let  us

work  together  to improve the process.  I believe  that,

this  way, we will then be able to continue to enjoy  the

confidence,  the  endorsement and the commitment  of  our

people.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me

state  at  the  outset that, like many of  my  colleagues

before me, I believe, on the whole, Singapore operates  a

fairly  efficient  and  effective transport  system.   In

general,  despite  occasional hitches  and  some  desired

service  improvements, such as in the case  of  the  LRT,

buses and the mass rapid transit are comfortable, on time

and  carry  commuters to their destinations without  much

fuss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the widespread unhappiness over the fare hikes - grudgingly accepted by many commuters from 1st July

onwards,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



for lack of other options - cannot be dismissed as simply

the   grumblings   of  a  complaining  and   self-serving

electorate.   The outcry has taken place  amidst  a  very

difficult  and uncertain economic situation,  a  slew  of

pronouncements  on fee increases and fears  -  repeatedly

acknowledged by the Government - of mounting job  losses.

Even  analysts, who are normally guided by  hard  numbers

and cold rationale, were puzzled over the fare hikes,  as

both SBS and SMRT have registered decent profits for last

year when the economy was in recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, this has also come at a time when civil

servants  are  reminded by their chief  of  the  need  to

formulate  policies that are reasoned, ie,  appealing  to

the mind and reasonable, ie, appealing to the heart.  Or,

to  quote a Chinese phrase, he qing he li which,  loosely

translated,   means   "in   accordance   with   emotional

sensibility  and logical reason".  It is  interesting  to

note  that  in the Chinese phrase "emotional sensibility"

actually precedes "logical reasoning".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without unjustly elevating the importance of this

issue, I would venture to say that, in effect, there is a

real  danger that all the recent rhetoric of a more open,

consultative and responsive government will fall on  deaf

ears,  if we do not take heed of the emotional undertones

surrounding this issue and squarely address them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although my colleagues before me have already

eloquently  highlighted and debated on the  many  reasons

for  the  public disquiet over the recent fare  hikes,  I

feel  that  as this matter affects the purse  strings  of

some  seven  out  of  10 Singaporeans  and  tugs  at  the

emotional heartstrings and logical reasoning of even non-commuters,  I  am  duty bound to give  my  take  on  this

matter,  based  on  feedback  I  have  received  from  my

residents as well as other Singaporeans who have  written

or spoken to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to particularly reiterate three nagging

issues which, I hope, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



Minister   can   address  in  order   to   allay   public

consternation over these hikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the timing of the fare hikes. Quite apart

from  any  reasoned, logical argument,  the  fare  hikes,

although  small,  should not have been approved  in  such

times,   when  economic  conditions  remain  harsh,   the

unemployment rate is growing and there is, to  quote  DPM

Lee   himself,   "breakneck   disquieting   change".    A

deflationary  environment generally gives rise  to  price

falls,  and so the combination of higher parking charges,

higher  electricity tariffs, higher GST and higher public

transport   fares  is  particularly  hard   to   swallow.

Furthermore,  rising  costs in  many  industries  do  not

naturally translate into higher prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, in a competitive environment, prices are

set  in  the  user  market by the forces  of  demand  and

supply.  For instance, as quoted by my colleague, Mr  Tan

Soo  Khoon,  the  25th June issue of Streats  quoted  the

Chairman of the Singapore School Transport Association as

saying,  "The  economy is so bad, how to increase  fares?

If  parents cannot afford it, they might decide  to  send

their children to school by other methods, and that  will

make  it worse for us.  Even if an increase is necessary,

it  would  be  better to wait until next year."   Indeed,

following  this,  the 2nd July issue of  Streats  further

reported  that  the  school bus fees will  be  raised  by

between  $10-$40 per month, but probably from next  year,

when  the  economic storm would have most  likely  passed

over.   This  begs  the  question:  why  can  the  public

transport  operators not do likewise?  Granted there  is,

of course, never a good or right time to raise fares but,

surely,  the transport operators and PTC could  not  have

picked a worse time.  Indeed, many would agree that there

could definitely be a better time to do so.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>6.10 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on communication of the fare hikes. Sir,

I am also somewhat concerned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



about the manner in which the PTC's decision on the  fare

hikes  has been communicated, or perhaps not communicated

to   the  commuting  public.   This,  in  my  view,   has

exacerbated  the problem and deepened the  bitterness  of

the  citizens.  As one Singaporean wrote to me, it is not

so  much  the  issue of affordability that  has  got  the

normally passive "boh chap" public infuriated, but rather

that  it  was  uncompassionate and weakly justified.   It

went against the spirit of "he qing he li".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC was reported as saying that annual reviews

of fare proposals are the norm so that there should be no

surprises from now on, implying that the public should be

prepared for annual fare increases, thus giving  ex  ante

justification to future hikes, even before  they  happen.

Coming  at  a  time when the Government is earnestly  re-looking at every nook and cranny on how to reduce  costs,

this   is   an  especially  difficult  pill  to  swallow.

Furthermore, the rationale cited for the increase is that

the  higher  fares  are meant to cover  public  transport

service improvements and wage increases.  The public, and

I  myself, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, confess that  we  have

great  difficulty  coming  to grips  with  this  line  of

reasoning  at a time when many Ministers are urging  wage

restraint and belt tightening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been said that the bus and public

transport  companies need to earn a  reasonable  rate  of

return  for  their shareholders.  What is a  "reasonable"

rate  of  return that is acceptable for public  transport

companies?  It must be noted that the transport operators

are  much like monopolies for the routes they cover  and,

as  one  of  the  PTC's term of reference  is  to  review

applications for fare hikes taking into account the  need

for  operators  to  remain financially viable,  it  would

appear  that the financial viability of the operators  is

virtually guaranteed.  This being the case, the  risk  to

the  operators  is  low and, thus, the expected  rate  of

return  to  the  operators  should  also  correspondingly

reflect   this   low  risk.   Minister  Yeo   cited   the

practically default risk-free Government bond  rate,  and

concluded  that the 6% return that SMRT was  expected  to

earn

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



after the fare hike was "reasonable".  Accepting the fact

that  listed companies need to show a reasonable rate  of

return  and profit figures, it is conceivable that,  like

all  business entities, these profit figures  and,  thus,

the  rate of return, would fluctuate over time.  In fact,

many  private companies are losing money or just breaking

even, under current adverse economic conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in such times, it is only reasonable that

transport operators should not expect their desired  rate

of  return  or  the  level of profit  to  be  maintained.

Therein  lies  the public's alarm over the  justification

that  has  been  given - that public transport  operators

need  to  make  a  reasonable  rate  of  return,  as   if

maintaining their rate of return or level of profit is  a

birthright.   It  can, of course, be argued  that  public

interest is not safeguarded if listed transport companies

operate  at a loss, since service standards will  plummet

and  these companies, to protect their shareholders, will

cut corners.  While this may be true in the long term, it

is  hard  to  accept  this in the  short  term  when  the

transport companies are still showing healthy profits and

when  the  rest  of Singapore Inc. are reeling  from  the

effects of recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if the public

transport companies have proven to the PTC that they will

be  in the red in the next six to 12 months, if fares are

not  increased?   If so, what are the compelling  reasons

and information that had been offered in support of their

claim?   Even accepting the rationale that small  regular

hikes  are  better  than big jumps,  have  the  transport

operators  shown the PTC that if the hikes were  deferred

for,  say,  a  year, there would be a need for  increases

that   would   be  so  astronomical  as  to  be   clearly

unpalatable  to commuters?  If so, what is the  magnitude

of increases they are forecasting?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to highlight the issue on the

role  of the PTC.  Like many of my colleagues before  me,

we  feel that central to this whole debate about the fare

hikes  is  the role of the PTC, which has come under  the

spotlight.  In the present

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



scheme of things, the PTC is the watchdog to ensure  that

the  increases  in fares are not excessive.   The  recent

episode,  however, does raise some questions as  to  what

exactly  PTC does in discharging its duties  as  a  final

arbiter in the pricing of public transport fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is the PTC's role? The Public

Transport  Council  Act  states  that  the  PTC  fulfills

several  functions,  one  of  which  is  to  review   any

application  by  public  transport  companies  to  revise

fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24 of the Act specifically states that in

carrying  out  this review role, the PTC must  take  into

account  two factors, namely, the need for the  applicant

to  remain  financially viable and the  need  for  public

interest  to be safeguarded.  The Act does not spell  out

in  what manner these two somewhat conflicting objectives

are   to  be  balanced.   Presumably,  that  becomes   an

administrative choice for the PTC to make, having  regard

to the circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently quite a widespread public

perception that the scales have tilted in favour  of  the

former, perhaps at the expense of the latter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the PTC's role, which has come

under  scrutiny,  is  the formula  employed  to  cap  any

approved increases in transport fare, CPI + X%.   We  are

told  that  they rely on the formula of CPI  +  x%  as  a

capping  for the fare hike in any one year.   X,  we  are

also told, takes into account service improvements and is

pegged at 1.5% per annum from 2001 to 2005.  How is  this

1.5% determined?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the formula, how does the PTC evaluate the

case for fare hikes and how does it finally decide on the

actual quantum of increases?  What factors does it really

consider?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this in the interest of the shareholders or the

interest  of  the  commuting public?  How  does  the  PTC

ensure that all relevant factors, including the state  of

the economy and the employment situation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



are adequately and appropriately taken into account?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, what is the nature of X? How does it

account  for service improvements?  And by what  measures

are  these  service improvements determined?   And  whose

measure  is it, the transport companies or the  commuting

public?   These  are  some questions that  arise  as  one

looks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, another aspect is the composition of the PTC.

An  examination of the present composition  reveals  that

the  majority  of  the  members  comprise  professionals,

academics  and  Government officials, many  of  whom,  it

would be fair to say, do not take public transport.   The

composition could thus be changed or widened  to  include

more  union members and grassroots leaders who  are  more

attuned  to the needs of the public transport  users  and

thus  can give better feedback regarding public transport

service, reliability and ground sentiments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Public

Transport  Council  should  be  public  enough  for   its

deliberations and decisions to be made more  transparent.

After  all, the PTC Act states that every member, officer

and  employee of the Council shall be deemed to be public

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore not be too much to ask the PTC to

solicit  as  much  feedback as possible, especially  from

commuters and those that can appropriately represent them

before any decision on fare hikes is made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the PTC must list and explain in

greater detail the factors it considers when deciding  on

such  changes.  In order for the decision to go down well

with  the  public,  it must be reasoned  and  reasonable.

Surely, the public interest is served by doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, because our system is a monopoly, the

real answer must lie in the controlled introduction of  a

competitive element that acts as check and balance  price

increases and the degree to which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



the  so-called  service improvements are truly  what  the

consumers desire.  A watchdog can only do so much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the Minister for Transport has

already  indicated  that the Government  is  prepared  to

allow  additional players to operate feeder  services  in

HDB  towns on a trial basis.  Sir, I would like  to  urge

the  Government to implement this as soon as possible  to

inject  more  competition, provide commuters some  choice

and also establish additional pricing benchmarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge this

Government to re-look at our public transport policy  and

make changes, such as to the mechanism for fare increases

so  that equity, as much as efficiency, will characterise

our approach to the electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this current unfortunate increase in

public  transport  fares, I appeal to the  Government  to

prove  the cynics wrong by taking concrete steps to  show

that  it  has  listened to the people and taken  heed  of

their  concerns  and  frustrations.   I  would  urge  the

Government,  at the minimum, to look at ways to  mitigate

the  impact  of  the recent fare hikes,  particularly  on

Singaporeans  who cannot afford the fare increases,  such

as the unemployed and the poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion

standing  in the name of Mr Tan Soo Khoon.  Our recession

has  not  fully  recovered.  Many ordinary  citizens  are

faced  with  the predicament of wage-cut or  retrenchment

and,  all  of  a  sudden,  the Public  Transport  Council

announced  that  it had agreed with the public  transport

operators'  request to increase the bus  and  MRT  fares.

The  reason  given for the fare hike was that the  profit

was not enough for the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time of difficulty, increasing the fares of

the  bus and MRT is adding more problems to our citizens.

On  top  of  that,  there  were  various  increases,  for

example,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



refuse  charges,  electricity tariffs,  etc.  So,  people

cannot help but ask why has the Government not taken into

consideration  the  problems in this time  of  recession.

The  Government should be more sensitive in dealing  with

all future price increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this recent increase in bus and MRT fares, on

the  surface, it is just an increase of three  cents  per

trip.  But, taking a conservative number of three million

passenger-trips  per  day,  there is  an  additional  $24

million  of profit after tax for the operators.  What  is

the  implication  of  this?  Now,  the  public  transport

company's  net profit is about $100 million. This  three-cent  adjustment would have generated an  additional  24%

increase    in  the  after-tax  profit  for  the   public

transport  operators.  As  it is,  the  public  transport

operators  are already making profits, the  24%  increase

would  push  the profits to an unbelievable high  figure.

Why do I say that?  From the annual report of the SBS bus

company,  we could see the net tangible asset  per  share

has  increased by 10 cents every year, from 30  cents  in

1997 to 60 cents in 2000.  It meant an average growth  of

25% in the NTA every year. The same was also reflected in

the  annual  net  profit after tax from  1998,  1999  and

2000.  The after-tax profit is more than 20% of  its  net

assets.   These  public transport operators  have  earned

more  than 20% in profit from our commuters, and yet they

feel  that  this  was not enough. They want  to  increase

another  24% in their profit through this fare  increase.

If  they  do  this now, it is very insensitive  and  many

people  are  already saying that these  public  transport

companies  are too greedy. The bus companies are  earning

more than 20% of profit.  Is it reasonable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very interesting question. As we all know,

in  all  investments if the risk is greater,  the  return

must  be higher; otherwise, the investors would have lost

everything  if  anything  goes  wrong.   But  for   those

investments with little or no risk, should the return  on

investment be as good as those with a high risk?  This is

something that the PTC should look into. As we all  know,

if  we want to invest conservatively in a safe and secure

environment, we can always put our money in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



fixed  deposits or buy some securities or bonds.  We  can

only earn about 5-6% in returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look at the public transport operators'

investments. There are a few characteristics.  First,  in

Singapore,  there  are  two monopolised  territories  for

these  two companies to operate.  Sir, the citizens  have

no choice. They have to take the bus services provided by

these  two operators.  There is definitely no competition

in  the  market  and through TransitLink, Government  had

restructured all those unprofitable routes  to  cut  loss

and, of course, their profits would go up. For those  bus

routes  which are not so profitable, they can  use  other

means.  For example, they would ask the PTC to make  some

fare adjustments so that their profits could be secured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sure-win investment for the public

transport companies.  The risk is almost zero.  In a risk-free investment, yet they are making profits of more than

20%.  In my personal view, their profit is much too high.

I  hope that the Government could look squarely into this

matter.   Do  not allow these public transport  operators

which  are operating on a monopoly and with no  risk  any

more  protection  to  secure hefty  profits.   We  should

alleviate the burden of the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This present round of price hike is wrong, in timing

and  in  magnitude. I think the PTC should look seriously

into this matter.  They should not side the operators  at

the  expense of our commuters.  I think they should  look

after  the interest of the commuters first, the  ordinary

citizens of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  a  member  of  the  Cost   Review

Committee.   It was convened twice in 1993 and  1996.  At

that  time,  people were very unhappy about the  cost  of

living.   In 1996, people were concerned about  transport

cost.   At the same time, they were concerned about other

costs - medical treatment, housing, education.  The  Cost

Review Committee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



also  looked  at the plight of the poor and the  elderly.

It  also studied household debts and warned against over-consumption  in  housing.  The impact  of  GST  was  also

examined.   The reports of the Cost Review Committee  are

still worth reading.  Perhaps the relevant Ministries can

update the information.  This would tell us whether costs

have  gone up unreasonably and whether anything needs  to

be  done.  A study of the old reports would also tell  us

the  basic  components in the cost of different services.

I  think  it  would  be  good  for  all  Singaporeans  to

understand these bread and butter issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people are unhappy today because they are

worried.   Business in the HDB heartlands is still  poor.

Workers are worried about jobs.  Wages have been trimmed.

So,  of  course, they worry when prices go up. And public

transport  cost is a big item of expenditure.  They  have

to  spend on transport every day. So, when fares  go  up,

they  get very upset.  They worry more about whether they

can cope. Worse still, what if they lose their jobs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback I got is not that they object to fare

increase.   They  know  that  fellow  workers  in  public

transport  also have to earn a living.  What  people  are

unhappy  about  is  the  timing.  Is  the  fare  increase

reasonable?   Sir, the Cost Review Committee  recommended

that fare increases be made in small steps so that people

can cope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for those who paid cash, feeder bus

fares,  ie, airconditioned buses, went up by a big  jump,

from  60  cents to 70 cents.  That rankles, and it  still

rankles.  Now, it goes up another 10 cents, together with

other  fare adjustments.  The story is the same for  non-airconditioned  buses.  It went up from 50  cents  to  60

cents,  and  now to 70 cents.  Those who use the  ez-link

card  can now pay 58 cents for non-air-conditioned  buses

and  63 cents for airconditioned buses.  After one  week,

most  commuters  find the change not so significant,  but

there  are others who do.  The feeder bus fare  is  still

high  in  their view, especially for short distances.   I

think  the  problem is not whether the fare  increase  is

large or small.  It is how it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



implemented.   Why  the  hefty  jump  in  feeder   fares?

Hardest  hit  are the housewives and retirees.   Why  not

small  steps?  I cannot understand why the old fare  card

cannot  allow increases of less than 5 cents.   If  there

was  a software or hardware problem, why was it not fixed

earlier?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is the ez-link card. It is new. Surely,

the  public  transport  operators  must  expect  teething

problems in implementation.  If so, was it wise to  raise

fares  at the same time?  Do they know that those who  do

not  use cards are the poorest Singaporeans?  They cannot

afford  it.   They do odd jobs, and so they do  not  have

enough money to store in the card, or they are afraid  to

use  it, especially the old.  So they use cash.  The fare

increase is highest for those who pay cash.  So those who

cannot  afford it are the ones who pay most.  Should  not

the  public  transport operators do something  for  them?

The basic issue seems to be not so much whether fares can

go  up,  but  the  timing.  How it is done,  and  whether

public  transport  operators understand their  customers?

Maybe  it  will  help  if the public transport  operators

appoint  one  or  two laymen, people who  can  understand

their  customers,  on the Board of Directors.   Maybe  it

will also help if there is more than just one unionist on

the  Public Transport Council to provide a stronger voice

for the working class.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  when someone mentions 9-11, we know he is referring

to the tragedy that happened to the World Trade Centre in

New York, an event that shocked the whole world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, an announcement by the Public

Transport Council (PTC)  on 11th June created a storm  in

Singapore,  and the general public here responded  almost

immediately with unhappiness, to a magnitude rarely heard

of in the past. I shall call it the "6-11" event.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people, in general, commented that what should

not  have  gone up, have gone up, but those  that  should

have  gone  up,  do  not go up. In  a  time  of  economic

downturn, the various charges - tariffs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



fees,  prices, bus fares, parking, ERP etc,  -  ought  to

have gone down to alleviate the burden of the people, but

they  have  gone up instead! Other things such as  wages,

share  market, etc, should have gone up, but they tumbled

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "6-11" event has brought about a big debate in

the  media  and  at the coffee shops.  As  to  the  media

debate,  generally, we see all sorts of topics  discussed

and debated in the various language newspapers. But since

6-11,  we  read  nothing  but  complaints  and  arguments

against  the  bus and MRT fare hikes.  We have  read  the

reply  of  the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport

and  other  leaders.   As mentioned by  some  Members  of

Parliament  who  have spoken before me,  members  of  the

public  were  asked whether they had read and  understood

these explanations. More often than not, they would reply

that  they  had not because the speeches were complicated

or  too  lengthy. Those who had the time  to  read  these

speeches  did  not  understand  them.  Those  who   could

understand  them  did not read them.  This  is  what  the

Hokkiens  would say, khua bo (see no), and  bo  khua  (no

see).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general feeling, as reflected in the media, is

that the Government has its reasons but it cannot explain

it  clearly to the people.  In the coffee shops, we  hear

people complaining that the Government has not been  fair

to them. They said, "The Government says business cost is

high.   To save the companies and our jobs, they cut  our

wages.  They compare our wages to those in China.   Then,

when  Government  says  our  bus  fares  are  cheap   and

affordable,  they  compare them to those  in  the  United

States  and  Europe. Why does the Government not  compare

our bus fares with  China and Vietnam, and our wages with

Europe  and  USA instead? You cannot compare  our  durian

with  the  lychee  in China, and our pineapple  with  the

grapes  in the USA.  Let us compare apple with apple,  or

orange with orange."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "6-11", whether it is in the public media or

in  the coffee shops, the general feeling is unfavourable

to the Government.  While the Government has the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



reasons  but cannot explain them, the people  have  their

grievances and who is going to listen to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have so many Members taking part in this debate

on the Motion.  I am joining in not just to add a number.

I  also have something to say.  I had taken public  buses

during my school days. To get home from school, I had  to

take  two buses. Very often, in order to save 5 cents,  I

would  walk  all  the way from Tuan Mong School  in  Tank

Road,  took a short-cut and cut across Fort Canning  Hill

to  take a bus along Dhoby Ghaut to get home. This was to

save one bus-trip from Tank Road to Dhoby Ghaut.  On  one

occasion,  I  was  robbed of my wrist-watch  when  I  was

walking  across King George V Park. My father  bought  me

another watch. It was subsequently that I learnt that  he

had  to  borrow money to buy me the watch, as he realised

the importance of keeping time.  So, I empathise with the

poor people. I know and could appreciate that to the poor

people,  5  cents is not a small matter.  To them,  every

cent counts. Of course, time has changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a Director of SBS for three years. I

subsequently  resigned to avoid a conflict  of  interest.

During those three years, I had the opportunity to  learn

and  understand the operation of the SBS.  At one of  the

shareholders' meetings, a shareholder asked, "I have been

buying  your shares, why are your share prices not  going

up?  What  have you people been doing?  I am an old  man.

Why  is  it that you never give concessions to the senior

citizens?  Why is your dividend so little?"   These three

questions are easy to answer.  You want your share prices

to  go  up, you must make more money. When you make  more

money, you can then give more dividends. When you want to

make  more  money,  you cannot afford to give concessions

to the senior citizens or even the shareholders. You have

the  answer, but it hurts the feelings of people. I  know

the difficulties of the bus operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, I occasionally travel by public buses.

People  have  asked me, "You are  a Member of Parliament,

why are you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



taking public buses?"  I do so to have a first-hand  feel

of  the  bus commuters. I have a better understanding  of

the behaviour of the commuters and their expectations.  I

realise that our bus services have changed, but there are

certain aspects which remain unchanged.  Mr Khaw Boon Wan

said  that   there  were  some  misconceptions  over  the

grounds  for this round of fare hike, and he    mentioned

the  four  pillars of the public bus services.   I  agree

with his views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this debate on the Motion

before the House, there is no question of who wins or who

loses.  At  the end of the day, all of us in this  House,

and  the  people outside this House, will have  a  better

understanding  of  the rationale and  background  of  the

decision-making process.  I say after the debate, we will

be  clearer about the reasons and Singapore can progress.

To complement SMS Khaw Boon Wan's four misconceptions and

four pillars, let me present my four views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government must know the background of

the  people  they  talk  to.  The feedback  is  that  the

Ministers'  speeches are long, and the Ministries'  press

releases  too  technical  and too  academic  -  too  many

statistics,  too many figures.  People do not understand.

When   they   do   not   understand,   there   will    be

misunderstanding.   Ministers and senior  civil  servants

must  know who are the people they are talking to.  Speak

the  language  they  understand, so to  speak.   We  must

tailor our text to suit the audience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, check the timing whenever you want to

increase  fees.   We are not against fare  increases  but

please, pick the right time to implement them.  This time

round,  we  see  and  hear  price  increases,  one  after

another,  and sometimes everyone is rushing  to  increase

the fees, and at this time of recession too!  So, when we

want to up the  prices, we must look at the timing.   The

timing must be good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must see long term. Both the people and

the  Government  must always bear in mind  the  long-term

implications of all changes.  Just now, former

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



Speaker  Mr Tan Soo Khoon said that people were remarking

that  all  these  price increases were carried  out  only

after  the General Election.  If we are not careful,  one

of these days, the PAP may just disappear, and it will be

a very sad day indeed.  So, do we want the PAP Government

to  disappear  just because of this fare  increase?   One

must look at the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the enterprises, the Government

and  the people will look at the big picture.  Our region

is  in  trouble.   We are in for uncertainty.   Everybody

must look at the big picture.  This is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, my four views are, first, the Ministers

and senior civil servants must know their target audience

when  they speak.  Secondly, when we increase prices,  we

must  watch the timing.  Thirdly, when we do things,  all

must  look  at the long-term implications; and, fourthly,

everybody must look at the big picture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMS Khaw Boon Wan talked about a woman who chose to

walk  instead  of taking a feeder bus.   Let  me  tell  a

little  joke to conclude my speech.  When the  fares  for

feeder bus went up last year, some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



people  remarked that instead of taking the  feeder  bus,

why  do you not chase after them instead of riding in it.

This way, you keep fit and, at the same time, save on the

bus  fares.   That being the case, why chase  the  feeder

bus?   Why do you not chase the taxis instead?  This way,

you save more!
