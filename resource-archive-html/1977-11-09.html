  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry's objective is to demolish vacated premises speedily; however, it is not always possible to achieve this. Occupants of affected premises usually do not all move out at the same time. Since piecemeal demolition is not practical and poses safety hazards to remaining occupants in a block of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> partially vacated premises, it is often not possible to proceed with the immediate removal of these empty structures. Even after premises have been totally vacated, it is often necessary to await the disconnection of overhead cables for utilities before the structures could be demolished.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expedite clearance, demolition of simple timber structures is presently done by the PWD using departmental labour. Where specialist demolition contractors have to be employed to remove concrete structures, tenders are timed to proceed as soon as buildings are ready for demolition. Where vacated structures cannot be immediately demolished, the Police are requested to provide more frequent patrols.

The ruling was introduced recently to check the frequent light-hearted rejections of completed flats in the new estates by applicants on the waiting list. The proposed payment of a service charge to retain their priorities would not help in achieving these objectives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new ruling does not apply to rental applicants because most of them are in the lower income group and the percentage of rejections for rental flats is very low.

  <b>Mr P.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the pricing of religious sites in Toa Payoh and other estates is based on public tender. There is no uniform rate for all the religious communities as under the tender system the sites are usually allocated to the highest tenderers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where religious buildings are required to be cleared for development purpose, a single site is made available to accommodate several resettlement cases combined together, for example, temples or
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications, since 1st January, 1977, (a) how many Singapore Bus Service buses were involved in accidents; (b) what steps are being considered to improve the performance of SBS bus drivers for the better safety of other road users and bus passengers; and (c) how many SBS drivers have been reprimanded or dismissed for careless driving.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Culture and Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Culture and Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from January to September this year, SBS was involved in a total of 3,648 accidents. These accidents included minor accidents such as falls or injuries sustained by commuters while boarding or alighting buses. This worked out to an average of 412 accidents per month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of available detailed statistics for the months of June to August this year showed that 78% of the accidents were minor, 22% were major and 0.4% were fatal. 56% of the accidents were due to the fault of SBS drivers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have been taken to cut down the accident rate. A Training Department was set up in SBS in 1976 to improve the driving standards of bus drivers. Newly recruited drivers must undergo a minimum two-week practical-cum-theoretical familiarisation course which offers instruction in accident prevention, defensive driving and good driving habits. Intensive refresher courses are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> also conducted for drivers with poor driving records. To-date, 334 drivers have attended these courses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Accident Investigation Unit was also set up in SBS in April this year to investigate the causes of accidents involving SBS buses. The Unit co-ordinates with the Training Department in identifying the training requirements of drivers. The performances of bus crews are constantly being checked by field supervisors, ticket inspectors and timekeepers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary measures are taken against erring drivers. These measures could be in the form of warnings, suspension from duties or dismissals, depending on the gravity of the accidents involved. On the more constructive side, SBS implements a productivity incentive scheme whereby good drivers are rewarded $1.50 per day whilst bad drivers are singled out for re-training with loss of incentive allowance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To emphasize the need for safety consciousness, safety driving seminars are occasionally c0nducted in conjunction with SILO.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS is also imposing stricter standards of repair and preventive maintenance to ensure that accidents caused by mechanical faults are prevented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS has plans to extend its present two-week familiarisation course to provide a further week of on-the-job training under the close supervision of good and experienced drivers. A special campaign to apprehend speeding drivers is also being planned. The Vehicle Inspection Unit will be further strengthened to ensure that minimum safety standards are complied with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, disciplinary action has been taken against 698 drivers for careless driving, from January to September this year. Of these, 592 were reprimanded, 102 suspended and four dismissed. In general, first offenders, in cases involving minor accidents, are given written warnings. Stiffer penalties are imposed for repeated offences. followed by dismissals.

  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications (a) if he will throw some light on the recently reported incident of certain, taxi drivers refusing to pick up passengers and of stopping other taxi drivers from picking up passengers at the Singapore Airport; and (b) what steps his Ministry will take to ensure that passengers at the Airport will not encounter any transportation problems resulting from similar incidents in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the incident mentioned by the hon. Member for Delta happened at about 11.45 p.m. on Monday, 24th October this year when some taxi drivers at the Airport ceased plying for hire and persuaded their colleagues not to go into the Airport. This incident arose when a team of detectives from Joo Chiat Police Station picked up seven drivers of Datsun taxis at Paya Lebar Airport. These drivers were taken to Joo Chiat Police Station for questioning regarding an incident involving a taxi driver who was alleged to have driven off his taxi with baggage belonging to a passenger. Unfortunately, the other taxi drivers at the Airport that night were not informed of the reason for picking up the seven taxi drivers in question. Due to the confusion and uncertainty created, some of the taxi drivers decided to stop work. Other taxis, particularly radio taxis, continued to pick up passengers. The number of passengers affected was small, numbering less than 40. All the taxi drivers resumed normal operations at about 1.30 a.m. on Tuesday morning when the seven drivers returned to the Airport. By then, nearly all the passengers had left the Airport.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Registrar of Vehicles takes a very serious view of taxi drivers who refuse to ply for hire during their working hours. Taxi drivers involved in unlawful work-stoppages will be dealt with by the Registrar
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of Vehicles. The Police have been requested to explain the reasons to taxi drivers at the Airport, should they wish to call up taxi drivers for questioning in the future. It is hoped that similar incidents will not occur again.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should be noted that alternative transportation at the Airport is also available in the form of shuttle bus and coach services. It is anticipated that the airport bus service will be improved next year, when an additional bus company starts operation.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan</b> asked the Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology when steps will be taken to clean up the heavily-polluted Sungei Whampoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, pollution in Sungei Whampoa comes from its catchment and mainly from indiscriminate dumping of refuse and discharge of sullage water into the drains from premises, in particular from squatter colonies. The present efforts to keep the river clean by desilting and removal of the refuse are only palliative measures. Until the sources of pollution on land have been eliminated, Sungei Whampoa will continue to be polluted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sungei Whampoa is one of the five rivers or canals which flow into Kallang Basin. The other four water courses are Rochore Canal, Kallang River, Pelton Canal and Geylang River. The catchment itself covers seven constituencies, namely, Kolam Ayer, Kallang, Tanglin, Whampoa, Moulmein, Toa Payoh and Kuo Chuan. The catchment is less polluted than the other four catchments of the rivers which drain into Kallang Basin. However, during high tides, the polluted water from the Kallang Basin is carried into the upper reaches of the Whampoa River, thereby adding to the problems of pollution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment is drawing up a programme to clean up the whole Kallang Basin. This will involve resettlement of squatters and the redevelopment of squatter areas and rundown parts of the city, the resiting of hawkers and farmers and the extension of sewerage facilities. This will take many years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, how often is the silt and refuse removed from Sungei Whampoa, especially the stretch along Balestier Estate?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I would say as often as needed, depending on how dirty the canal is - usually about once a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, the Hon. Minister mentioned the number of squatters involved in the cleaning up process. I would like to know how many squatters will be affected in the cleaning up process?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have details of these squatter premises. Going by constituencies, Kallang has 53 such premises. Whampoa has only eight. Toa Payoh has 63. Kuo Chuan has 35. Moulmein has 114. Tanglin has 274.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, the Hon. Minister said that it would take many years to do the cleaning up. May I know how many years will it be?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister has directed my Ministry to do this job within 10 years. But Members will realise that all these rivers have been polluted for more than 150 years. I would say that our target would be about the mid-1980s.

All I can say to the Member is that the present efforts to keep the canal clean by desilting and removal of refuse, which as I have stated are palliative measures, will continue to be carried out until the whole Kallang Basin is cleaned up. In fact, my Ministry spends about $3,000 per month on the desilting of this canal.

  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 9,642 licensed street hawkers who need to be resited into markets and hawker centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plans to resite 5,370 street hawkers into new markets and hawker centres by 1981. The street hawkers will have to take up stalls in markets/hawker centres which will be mostly built in new housing estates. The remaining street hawkers will be resited later depending on the availability of sites and funds.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 528 licensed itinerant hawkers in Singapore comprising 400 ice-cream vendors, 106 bread hawkers and 23 pre-cooked food and sundry goods hawkers. It is already the policy of the Government to consider requests favourably from licensed itinerant hawkers for stalls in markets/hawker centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1976, out of 531 resettlement cases, 19 were bona fide farmers and were given stalls in markets/hawker centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing hawker licensing policy has already been relaxed to issue licences to hardship cases. Since 1976, new hawker licences have been issued to 521 hardship cases. It will not be practical or advisable to liberalise the hawker licensing policy further until most of the 9,642 licensed street hawkers are resited into premises. Otherwise we will find it impossible to tackle the present hawker problem.

The Metrication Board has since then embarked on an intensive campaign to educate the public by way of inter-school metric competitions, quizzes and even telemetric shows. Weekly "Metrication and You" exhibitions have so far been held in nine community centres and will be carried out finally in all constituencies.

  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education what measures are being taken to improve the compulsory aftercare service to drug addicts in view of the large number of addicts who are released from the Drug Rehabilitation Centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the first seven months of Operation Ferret launched on 1st April, 1977, a total of 5,108 addicts were sent to the drug rehabilitation centres for treatment and rehabilitation. Of these cases, 897 have been released and placed under compulsory aftercare in addition to those cases arrested and placed under supervision, before 1st April, 1977. As more drug addicts are released, the pressure for aftercare service will increase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this increased demand for aftercare service and further reduce the relapse rate, compulsory aftercare will be provided in two ways. First, supervision officers will see to it that the supervisees strictly observe the conditions of the Supervision Order. One of the conditions which supervisees have to comply with is to present themselves for weekly urine tests at police stations. This will be supplemented by surprise urine tests. These checks will enable those who have relapsed to be detected quickly so that they can be straightaway sent back to the drug rehabilitation centres or prosecuted in court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill now before the House provides for a mandatory sentence of three years' jail for those who were previously convicted for consumption of drugs if they were found to have gone back to drugs while under supervision. For those supervisees with no previous conviction for consumption of drugs but who have relapsed will be re-admitted to the drug rehabilitation centres for a longer period of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals for additional staff for the Probation and Aftercare Service and the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font>

  <br> Central Narcotics Bureau to carry out this supervision function have already been submitted to the Ministry of Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the voluntary counsellors of the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) will provide counselling to the supervisees. SANA has to-date 600 volunteers trained or being trained. I am informed that many more from religious and social organisations are coming forward to volunteer their services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervision officers will work closely with the voluntary counsellors from SANA. In this way we should be able to monitor adequately the progress of the large number of supervisees.

No other details were then available, either about the aircraft, hijackers or how it all arose.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 1624 hours the hijacked aircraft established radio contact with our Joint Air Traffic Control Centre (JATCC) and identified itself as belonging to Air Vietnam. Its position was then reported as 40 miles north of Mersing. The pilot requested for permission to land at Singapore Airport. When JATCC refused their request to land, the pilot pleaded that he must land at Singapore Airport because the aircraft was short of fuel.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 1657 hours the pilot reported that he had only 35 minutes of fuel left and repeated his request to land in Singapore. At this point the pilot also informed our JATCC that there were four hijackers armed with knives and pistols, two dead bodies and 34 passengers on board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the aircraft was observed on radar to be still heading towards Paya Lebar, it was directed towards Seletar Airport. The aircraft landed at Seletar Airport at 1730 hours after landing instructions and weather information were given to the pilot. It was directed to park on the northern- most taxiway facing west. Immediately after the aircraft was parked, Police Reserve Unit troops who had arrived earlier at 1706 hours at Seletar Airport took up position surrounding the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the aircraft landed, several government officers, members of a committee to handle such emergencies, arrived and proceeded to the Seletar Airport Control Tower and were in communication with the pilot. At 1758 hours the pilot of the hijacked aircraft relayed a message seeking contact with government authorities. He confirmed that there were 34 passengers on board and two crew members were dead. Following exchanges between the pilot and the Control Tower, two persons from the aircraft and two government representatives met on the tarmac.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Secretary (Home Affairs) had as Chairman of this group of officers taken decisions on the courses of action to be taken, in the light of the facts then available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations continued until the hijackers agreed to surrender their arms. They surrendered their arms at 1945 hours. Immediately after that the injured person was brought down for treatment. After initial medical attention at the tarmac and the Base Sick Bay the injured person was taken away and admitted to Toa Payoh Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers who had in the meanwhile come down were then moved to the Airport Terminal Building where they were given refreshments before being transported to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> dining hall of a SAF Unit in Seletar Airport to be fed and subsequently bedded in the barracks for the night. The four hijackers were placed under guard and subsequently taken away by officers of the CID Special Investigation Section for questioning. The aircraft was thereafter cleared by the Bomb Disposal Unit. At 0130 hours on 30th October 1977 the pilot and co-pilot were offered to the press for an interview on the hijack incident.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Civil Aviation officials with the help of the staff of several companies engaged in refuelling, servicing and ground handling of aircrafts in Seletar Airport, worked through the night to prepare the aircraft for take-off. A post-mortem on the two dead bodies was also arranged and conducted during this time and completed by daybreak. Opportunity was also taken during the night to take statements from eye witnesses, the pilot and co-pilot on what actually took place in the aircraft when it was hijacked.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 0814 hours after breakfast, the passengers were taken to the aircraft for boarding. At 0937 hours the aircraft departed for Ho Chi Minh City and arrived there at 1346 hours Singapore time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police were there at the Aerodrome when the hijacked plane landed.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education (a) what was the number of pedestrian offenders under the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, 1977, up to 31st October, 1977; (b) what is the extent of discretion and courtesy training given to the uniformed personnel who are enforcing the aforementioned Rules; and (c) whether he is aware that the many road markings and signs at the junction of Maxwell Road, Wallich Street and Anson Road are causing confusion to pedestrians, and if the matter will be looked into.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the enforcement of the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, 1977, took effect on la September, 1977, there were a total of 16,239 pedestrian offenders booked up to 31st October, 1977.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Traffic Police requires its enforcement officers to be firm in enforcing the law, it also expects them to use their discretion. It requires the officer to enforce the law with commonsense, judgment and understanding. This policy applies equally to enforcement action against pedestrian offenders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for the enforcement of the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, in-service training sessions were held to impart the various complexities of the law to those who were to enforce the rules. The training also emphasised the need to exercise discretion and commonsense in enforcement as well as to be courteous at all times. From then on, further in-service training sessions for enforcement officers were held periodically to review and acquaint them with the various problems that were learnt from hindsight.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most intersections, the junction at Maxwell Road/Wallich Street/Anson Road is boxed by pedestrian crossings on all sides. However, the roads do not intersect at right angles and it is, therefore, necessary to put up additional signs. Apart from these there is no unusual marking that is likely to be a source of confusion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, complaints from motorists that. Vehicles approaching Wallich Street from Anson Road would have to stop twice to give way to pedestrians. In situations such as the junction in question a trade-off is often unavoidable. In this case, the convenience of motorists has to be partly sacrificed to ensure the safety of pedestrians. Nonetheless, the Traffic Police will keep the matter under review, to see how this inconvenience on the part of the motorists can be kept to the minimum without sacrificing the safety of pedestrians.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the junction at Maxwell
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Road/Wallich Street/Anson Road is causing confusion to pedestrians. Will the Hon. Minister instruct the Traffic Police to alter the situation so as to make it easier for pedestrians to cross there? Even Police constables do not know the rules, and innocent pedestrians are being booked. When pedestrians cross with green light, they suddenly have to stop at the red light. I suggest that the Minister visit this junction one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think confusion is caused by the way the pedestrian crossings were drawn up. I think the confusion may be partly caused by the fact that there are too many intersections at that road junction. But as far as the Traffic Police is concerned, they have drawn these signs in the best way possible to minimise the confusion. They have done so. But, as I have said, they will review the situation and if they find that there is a better way of doing it, they will make the necessary alteration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be glad if the Member for Anson would take me there one day to view the intersection.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I want to know whether the Minister will consider altering it in a way that is proper for pedestrians to cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already said that the existing way is the best way. I do not think we should alter for the sake of altering because there may be more trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that possibly as a result of pedestrians taking their own sweet time to cross that traffic congestion is caused by motorists wanting to turn left or right?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question. In fact, the only solution to the problem of getting pedestrians to brisk up when crossing is to install red-and-green man signals at these junctions. Once these red-and-green man signals are installed, we can regulate the time for crossing. When we want the pedestrians to cross briskly, we introduce the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> blinking sign, and when it blinks the pedestrian will have to cross briskly. At the present time, with resources permitting, every week and through every month we are installing more and more of these red-and-green man signals at the various road junctions.

   <b>ANNUAL JOB CREATION</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Finance how many jobs need to be created annually for the next five years and how many of these will be in the Civil Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the next five years, it is expected that there will be an average of about 53,000 persons joining the labour force each year. With retirements, deaths and other withdrawals from the labour force are deducted, the net annual increase will be about 26,000 persons per year. To create enough new jobs for this annual increment in the labour force, our GDP will have to grow at between 6-8% annually. While for this year we are likely to achieve this, the prospects for doing so will be uncertain in future. Our economic fortunes are tied to those of the industrialised countries on whom we depend for export markets. Recovery in the world economy has been slow as major industrialised countries fear the resurgence of inflation, if economic recovery is too rapid. In addition, there are growing tendencies in the world towards protectionism which will affect our exports. Our status as a developing country is also being questioned. In the light of those problems, our workers and especially the new entrants to the labour force, must be more productive, more flexible, less choosy, and less inclined towards job-hopping if we are to be able to compete effectively in international markets and therefore achieve our growth targets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of new jobs in the next five years will have to be created in the private sector - in manufacturing, transport, storage and communications, as well as in the other services sector. For the Civil Service over the next five years, the emphasis will be towards
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> increasing the efficiency of existing staff through better supervision, redeployment, and mechanisation of systems and procedures. Increases in the Government wage bill must be matched by increases in productivity. With an existing establishment vacancy of more than 9,000 persons at present, it is not envisaged that many more new posts will be created in the next five years. There will be stringent control on increases in manpower. New posts will only be created if they are fully justified on the basis of new functions in connection with new development projects, new legislation or reorganisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> A supplementary question, Sir. If it is true, as the Hon. Senior Minister of State puts it, that there will be increasing protectionism and a slow-down in the growth of the advanced countries, how would he propose to increase manufacturing, presumably for export, to provide the jobs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is one of the problems to be faced by our economy. We would have to identify industries with higher technological content. We would have to promote such industries to come into Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the economic growth rate of Singapore goes down, below 6-8%, the job market for university graduates will be limited. Has the Senior Minister of State for Finance considered raising the educational qualifications for jobs which now require lower educational qualifications?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the problem is finding jobs for graduates with higher qualifications, then obviously we have to look for jobs that would be suitable for people with the right level of education. It may not be necessary for us to raise qualifications in order to solve the problem.

  <br> Singapore Airlines (a) the rationale of Singapore Airlines entering into agreement with British Airways to operate the Concorde service between London and Singapore; (b) how this agreement will benefit Singapore Airlines; (c) if it will enhance the prestige, competitiveness and profitability of Singapore Airlines in international civil aviation; and (d) whether Singapore Airlines have fully studied and realised the controversies concerning the Concorde supersonic aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the reasons for Singapore Airlines signing an agreement with British Airways to operate the Concorde between Singapore and London are financial, commercial and technical. While SIA does not expect the service to be a great money-spinner in its own right, it is satisfied that the Concorde will at least break even.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercially, the service will position SIA firmly in the forefront of the airlines of the world. The agreement with British Airways underscores the esteem of travellers for SIA from 13th place in 1970 to first place in triennial surveys in 1973 and 1976. SIA's partnership in a supersonic service will increase its aviation competence and business potential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA will have the opportunity to acquire experience, over a period of time, of a now and advanced technology.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry of the Concorde into Singapore will consolidate Singapore's position as the communications crossroads of the Asia/Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by "controversies" the Member is referring to the long and eventually unsuccessful struggle by the Port of New York Authority to keep the Concorde out of Kennedy International Airport, the answer is, yes. Singapore has to examine the impact of Concorde on the environment in the light of its own circumstances. The Department of Civil Aviation is satisfied that a thrice-weekly service by the Concorde will not damage the environment, certainly no more than it does in London or Paris, Washington or New York.

Apart from crime statistics compiled by the Police Department, there may be few other departmental statistics which, if compiled according to constituency boundaries, would reflect the problems prevailing in each constituency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be feasible to compile all statistics according to constituency boundaries either for statistical reasons or for the benefits that may be derived because they may not be commensurate with the additional costs involved.

  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Geylang Serai wants to know the number of Muslims who had contracted marriage at the Registry of Marriages instead of the Shariah Court. I believe he is referring to the Registry of Muslim Marriages and not the Shariah Court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statistics Department does not keep separate statistics of marriages contracted by Muslims under the civil law. This is because the number of Muslims who contract marriage under the Women's Charter is extremely small. However, statistics of Malays who contract marriages under the civil law each year show that only a small number are involved. There were:
  <pre>

   41 out of 15,556 marriages in 1972

   67 out of 22,576 marriages in 1973

   66 out of 23,775 marriages in 1974

   74 out of 20,175 marriages in 1975 and

   86 out of 18,551 marriages in 1976.

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Marriages is not empowered by law to inquire whether either party to a mixed religious marriage involving Muslims has renounced his or her religion. So long as the couple complies with the requirements under the Charter, the Registrar is obliged to solemnize and register their marriage. This legal provision is in accord with the Government's policy for freedom of worship in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Haji Rahmat bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Haji Rahmat bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, from the figures given by the Minister, it seems that the number of such marriages is increasing. If such marriages continue to be contracted, I would like to point out that, firstly, in the eyes of Muslim law these marriages are not valid. The status of "husband and wife" is illegal according to Islamic law, and therefore their children are illegitimate. Secondly, there is the question of division of property. If the husband dies and since the wife is not a Muslim, problems of distribution of property can arise. Therefore, can the Minister introduce legislation to control the marriages of Muslims?

  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, in line with the Government's policy of religious freedom for all, it is not advisable to force a Muslim to renounce his or her religion before marrying a non- Muslim. It would be better for the parties to such mixed religious marriages to be persuaded to register their marriage under the Muslim law. It is definitely unwise to either force a Muslim party to renounce his or her faith or to deny the couple the right to be legally married in the eyes of the law.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever it is known that the activities of any Governmental or other bodies have contributed directly or indirectly to the cause of a fire, it is the practice of the Fire Brigade to notify the department or body concerned. If it is established that the lack of attention or care by any organisation on certain aspects of its activities has contributed to the cause of a fire, the Fire Brigade will also inform the relevant body accordingly.

   <b>REVISION OF HAWKER LICENCE FEES</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology)</b>
  </div>
  <br>3.40 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Speech at the Opening of the Fourth Parliament, Honourable Members were informed that the licence fees for markets, food centres and street hawkers would be revised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These licence fees were last revised in 1970 but were and are still less than the economic rental. Since then, the cost of maintaining and building new markets and food centres has increased. It is felt that hawkers should pay their share of these higher costs. Government has therefore decided to revise the licence fees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed revision is set out in three Schedules (Cols. 191 - 196) which have been circulated to Members and should be lying on their seats. The revision will rationalise some of the fees for markets and food centres eliminating the discrepancy in the fees paid by stallholders to the Ministry of the Environment and to the Housing and Development Board.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1977/19771109/19771109-HA-0370191.htm">Schedules - EXISTING AND PROPOSED MONTHLY FEES FOR MARKETS/HAWKER CENTRES, EXISTING AND PROPOSED FEES FOR STREET HAWKERS, MISCELLANEOUS FEES (Cols. 191 - 196)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases will be introduced in three phases, in January 1978. January 1979 and January 1980. The licensees will thus be able to absorb the increases without suffering undue hardship. Care has been taken to relate the proposed fees to the sale and profit margins of different goods. For example, retail vegetable licensees whose commodities are perishable and less profitable will pay less than the cooked food, fruit and piece and sundry goods hawkers. The licence fees for poultry hawkers will be higher because their business occupies more space, poses greater pollution and maintenance problems and their profit margins are higher.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooked food, fruit and piece and sundry goods hawkers in the Ministry of the Environment's markets and food centres pay licence fees for two sessions. However, these hawkers in H D B markets and food centres, at present, pay rental equivalent to the licence fee for one session only. It is proposed to do away with this discrepancy. Henceforth, all such hawkers in HDB markets and food centres will pay the same fees as those in the Ministry's markets and food centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for street hawkers, fees will continue to be charged on a per session basis, because for a number of these sites, the hours of hawking have to be stipulated and restricted as the sites are required for other uses such as car parks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first phase of the revision, about 13,000 or 50% of the total number of our hawkers will pay an additional $5 per month, about 5,300 or 23% roughly, will pay an additional $10 per month, and the remainder an additional $15 to $60 per month. Vegetable, egg, bean cake and noodle, assorted ground spices and sea food hawkers will only pay a small increase of $5 per month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These modest increases are spread over three years and should not justify any increase in the prices of hawkers' goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister be able to inform this House
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whether this measure to increase hawker licence fees is being introduced just because the hawkers have not been paying income tax? Or whether the Government has plans to introduce measures to make the hawkers pay income tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have set out the reasons for the increase plainly and clearly. It has got nothing to do with income tax. Some feel that those few hawkers who make a lot of money rightly should pay income tax. My own view is that the majority should not pay income tax. But this is not for me to decide. A proper question directed to the proper quarters will get a correct answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice from the Schedule of the proposed revision that the Ministry of the Environment hawker centres and markets have got two classes, namely, Class A and Class B, whereas the HDB hawker centres and markets have only one class, not specified. In the proposed revision, there are again two categories, Class A and Class B. May I ask the Hon. Minister how will the HDB hawker centres and markets be classified? That is my first question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: would the Minister consider classifying the hawker centres and markets in Whampoa under Class B?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Ministry's hawker centres have been divided into Class A and Class B because some hawkers make more money than others. They are, in fact, classified according to districts. For instance, in the central area the hawkers are classified as Class A whereas the hawkers in the rural areas make less money and therefore are classified as Class B.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the HDB ones, I do not know the details. The fees are set out in the Schedule. For instance, Retail Vegetable, HDB, the existing fee is $15; for the Ministry of the Environment, the existing fee for Class A is $15 and for Class B it is $10. With the revision, it will be $20 for Class A and $15 for Class B in the first phase. I presume that the HDB ones will be in Class A.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the hawker centres in Whampoa, I am afraid I do not have the details. Perhaps some are in Class B and some are in Class A. But I could look into their cases and tell the Member concerned whether his centres are classified under Class A or Class B.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since most of my markets and hawker centres (in fact, three out of four) are under HDB's jurisdiction, they would naturally be classified under Class A. But, as you know, Sir, Whampoa is a very poor constituency. Would the Hon. Minister then have compassion on the poor hawkers there and classify them under Class B?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish I could. But I am not the Minister in charge of the Housing and Development Board. I used to be. Since then I have moved to the Environment Ministry. Once again, I am not passing the buck. But the decision is not mine. Perhaps the Minister for National Development will consider kindly the request of the Member for Whampoa.

  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy and procedural changes adopted in the past few years have necessitated amendments to be made to the present Road Traffic Act. The objective of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill therefore is to streamline and update the present Act for the purposes of clarity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sections 7A to 7O in clause 9 have been introduced to give the authorities more
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> power to tighten up the law in respect of collection of taxes. Section 7F seeks to impose a penalty of three times the amount of tax payable on a vehicle if any person is found guilty of intentionally evading tax payable on his vehicle. At present, there is no provision for the Court to recover unpaid vehicle licence fees or taxes due to the Registrar of Vehicles. Penalties in the form of fines imposed by the Court very often are less than the amounts due. Unrecovered fees and taxes amounted to $2.4 million as at 1st January 1977 despite the efforts made to collect them. Another $93,000 have been written off by Government since September 1975. The proposed amendment will, therefore, discourage persons from evading payment of vehicle licence fees or taxes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision in the Road Traffic Act for a person who has been disqualified from driving to require him to surrender his driving licence to the Court or to the Registrar of Vehicles. Consequently, such persons who have been disqualified from driving continue to drive although it is an offence for them to do so. As there is no endorsement on the driving licence to indicate that they have been disqualified from driving, very often such persons manage to escape detection whenever they are spot-checked by Police Enforcement Officers. The amendment proposed by clause 16 of the Bill makes it mandatory for motorists who have been disqualified from driving to surrender their driving licences. This will ensure that only qualified drivers are allowed on our roads.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Road Traffic Act, a person being carried on a goods vehicle is not guilty of an offence if he disregards the advice of the driver or the owner of the vehicle concerning his own safety while being so carried. In cases of this nature, under the present Road Traffic Act, the driver is held guilty of an offence for carrying a passenger in a dangerous manner and in addition to punishment under section 77 of the Act, he is also penalised under the Road
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Traffic (Demerit Points) Rule. As this may not be fair to the driver of the owner, an amendment is proposed whereby the passenger or the person carried on the vehicle is also liable for the commission of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April this year. Government announced that the use of seat belts in motor vehicles will be made compulsory. New sections have been provided in the Bill to empower the Minister to make rules in readiness for this event. This is found in clause 20. The Registrar of Vehicles will also be empowered to penalise any person who sells seat belts which are not of the approved type.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 of the Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact section 72 of the principal Act to enable the Minister to make rules for the safety of pedestrians. The existing fine of up to $100 for such offenders is insufficient deterrent to motorists who do not give way at pedestrian crossings. Stiffer penalties will, therefore, have to be imposed on errant motorists who do not observe the rules. A fine of up to a maximum of $1,000 or a jail term up to three months will be imposed on first conviction. For a second and subsequent conviction, a fine of up to $2,000 or jail for a term not exceeding six months will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the driver ownership of taxis, a provision has been made in the Bill to empower the Registrar of Vehicles to revoke taxi licences which are held by persons who are not licensed taxi drivers or taxi owners who have been found not to be driving their taxis regularly. A taxi driver who holds more than one taxi licence will have all but one of his licences revoked.

  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Professional Engineers Act, 1970, University of Singapore graduates must have two years' practical experience for registration as professional engineers. However, corporate members of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore, and other professional bodies approved by the Professional Engineers Board are automatically entitled to registration. The Bill removes the discriminatory provisions and provides that the following persons will be entitled to registration as professional engineers:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any person holding the Degree of Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Singapore or the Professional Diploma in Engineering from the Singapore Polytechnic;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any person holding any other degree, diploma or qualification which the Minister may, after consultation with the Board, approve for registration;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) any person who satisfies the Board that he is otherwise qualified by having proper and recognised training in engineering and who passes such examinations as the Minister may, in consultation with the Board, require.
  <br>
  <br>To maintain high standards, all persons must have had at least two years' practical experience in engineering work at professional level after qualifying and must pass a professional practice examination. However, the Minister may, after consultation with the Board, exempt any person from these requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that a person is entitled to registration as a professional engineer if, immediately before the date of commencement of the Professional

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act empowers the Professional Engineers Board to cancel the registration of a professional engineer or suspend him from practice under certain circumstances. The Bill seeks to give the Board additional powers to impose a penalty not exceeding $1,000 on a professional engineer or censure him where the Board is of the opinion that no cause of sufficient gravity exists to impose the penalty of cancellation or suspension.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 3(c), it is proposed to provide the imposition of a fine not exceeding $1,000. Why is the ceiling set at $1,0007 In view of the fact that engineers engaged in building projects take a fee of 2 1/2% of the total cost, that is, they seem to make a lot of money, would the Minister consider increasing this ceiling of $1,000 to something more worthy of engineers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I really do not know how the level of $1,000 is arrived at. But as the existing Act does not provide for such penalty, I think the existing Board have felt the need and have recommended that the penalty of a maximum fine of $1,000 would be sufficient deterrent to an engineer. I really do not know whether the Member's comment that $1,000 is too lenient will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> acceptable to the Professional Engineers Board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Sir, I think the fact that he has been fined matters more to the engineer than the quantum of his fine. Being penalised for breaking professional practice and/or etiquette will be a deterrent and the engineer will certainly exercise more care in the future in carrying out his responsibility. To an erring professional the fact of having been fined is more detrimental to his career than the quantum of the fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, for offences like littering, we fine people $500, for offences like traffic violation, at least $50; for a motorist violating the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, $1,000 or thereabouts. For professionals, therefore, I am sure we need to impose a fine more worthy of them, i.e. more than $1,000 because professionals should have a higher sense of duty and responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Quite correct. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think what motivates the legislature to limit it to $1,000 is that the mere fact that he has been fined as a professional puts a stigma on him. This will cost him more in monetary loss than it would have been for a layman. I think this is the rationale behind it.

  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the last few years that drug abuse and addiction has developed into a serious problem in Singapore. In 1972 there were only a few cases of heroin addiction. Today it is estimated that there are as many as 13,000 heroin addicts and abusers. For the seven months since Operation Ferret was launched on 1st April this year, a total of 6,540 addicts and abusers were arrested and most of them were on heroin. 5,108 of them have been sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) for treatment and rehabilitation. We are now embarked on an all-out effort to tackle the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are attacking the drug problem on two main fronts, namely, the supply and the demand. On the supply side deterrent penalties, including the death sentence, have already been introduced under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A number of drug traffickers have already been convicted and sentenced to death. The enforcement agencies will continue to intensify their enforcement action against drug traffickers, pushers and pedlars. We have just introduced the use of dogs to detect and sniff out drugs. More dogs are now being trained and will be deployed. A Steering Committee has also been formed by the Ministry of Home Affairs which is working out concerted counter-measures against the problem. There will be no let-up in the efforts to eradicate the illegal supply of controlled drugs in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, equally important in this war against the drug problem is the need to curb the demand for the drugs. As long as there is high demand, there will be some people who will continue to risk the heavy penalties. to meet the demand. It was to curb and cut down this demand that Operation Ferret was launched on 1st April 1977. The Operation has been highly successful, as reflected in the large number of addicts and abusers being arrested and sent to the DRCs. While in the DRCs, the addicts and abusers are given cold turkey treatment, and then physical exercise to tone up their bodies. They are then given work to inculcate in them work discipline and then counselled on the evils of drug abuse. On their release, they are put under
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> compulsory supervision and aftercare to reduce their chances of relapse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that these measures could be carried out more effectively, the Misuse of Drugs Act was reviewed to make it more comprehensive. Hence we have this Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill before the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide for the appointment of Advisory Committees for the purpose of assisting in the administration of the Act. The drug problem is multi-faceted and its solution requires the contributions and actions by various Government departments and bodies as well as voluntary organisations outside. The Advisory Committees will help in coordinating the various departmental functions and also in identifying new measures in tackling the problem, particularly those relating to treatment and rehabilitation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 5 and 6 are amendments required to bring about more effective and efficient operation by enforcement agencies in detecting and arresting persons who have committed offences under the Act. Since the drug problem has spread to every sector of the population, officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau have to be assisted by the regular and special Police Officers (SCs) and members of the Vigilante Corps to saturate areas and haunts where drug addicts and abusers congregate. The power of arrest has, therefore, to be extended to members of the Special Constabulary and the Vigilante Corps. Clause 6 seeks to extend the power to require a person to provide his urine specimen to a Police Officer not below the rank of Sergeant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the amendment Bill seeks to provide for a deterrent sentence of a minimum of three years' imprisonment on any person who has a previous conviction for consuming a controlled drug and who again commits such an offence while under supervision. A previous conviction for drug consumption includes that imposed by a Military Court constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act, 1972. This deterrent sentence is necessary to bring the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> message to recalcitrant drug addicts that the Government does not intend to see that time, money and efforts spent in rehabilitating them should go down the drain. Further, it would also put these recalcitrant drug addicts out of circulation for a longer period, thereby reducing the demand for drugs as well as preventing them from contaminating and influencing others into drug addiction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the large number of drug addicts and abusers who have to be sent to DRCs for treatment and rehabilitation, it is necessary that the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau has the power to delegate part of his responsibility to his Deputy Director. Clause 8 gives him that power.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 also provides for a person who has been ordered by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau to be admitted to a DRC to be detained in the DRC for a period of six months for treatment and rehabilitation. This period is normally considered the minimum period required to treat and rehabilitate a drug abuser so that chances of relapse will be minimised. But for relapse cases and hardcore addicts, the period of treatment and rehabilitation may have to be extended beyond six months up to a maximum of two years for any one admission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the appointment, by the Minister, of a Review Committee headed by a medical doctor for each DRC to review the progress of treatment and rehabilitation of each drug addict or abuser. In exceptional cases the Committee can direct releases earlier than six months. It has also powers to extend the period of detention after six months and up to two years. The functions and the manner of working of a Review Committee are spelt out in clause 9. While under detention, drug addicts and abusers can be transferred from one DRC to another to undergo the treatment and rehabilitation programme in stages. The authority to transfer is also provided for under this clause.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seeks to provide for the making of regulations relating to the management, maintenance and inspection of the DRCs; the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> control, discipline and occupation of inmates of DRCs, and the supervision and aftercare of those who have been discharged from DRCs or who have been convicted for an offence of consuming drugs. Compulsory supervision and aftercare will be extended to those who are convicted in court for consuming drugs and have been sent to the prison or have been fined.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the tabling of the Bill for First Reading, a further study of the Bill was made with a view to providing safeguards for any possible abuse or errors by enforcement and other officers in the taking and handling of urine samples and in their analysis. As a result, further amendments have been proposed to build in these safeguards. These amendments are contained in the Notice of Amendments which I shall move at the Committee Stage of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to give a brief explanation on the amendments now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The further amendment to clause 6 of the Bill will enable any person whose urine specimen is found to contain a controlled drug and who is dissatisfied with the result the right to apply for a second test of the specimen which will be stored for the purpose. This is to give the person a recourse if there is a mix-up of his urine specimen in the course of its taking, transportation and testing. Detailed procedures for the taking, collection, delivery and storage of urine specimens from suspected drug addicts will be promulgated in the form of regulations after the Bill has been passed. It also provides for the immediate release of such a person if the second test of his urine specimen is found to be negative.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendment to clause 9 seeks to provide yet another safeguard against wrongful detention of a person in an approved institution for treatment and rehabilitation. An aggrieved person may lodge a complaint to a Magistrate that he is improperly detained by mason of misconduct or breach of duty on the part of any officer in the discharge of his functions under the Act
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> or the regulations made thereunder. The Magistrate acting on such a complaint may himself inquire or direct a Police Officer to inquire into the complaint. On the basis of the inquiry, the Magistrate may order that the aggrieved person be discharged from the approved institution if he is satisfied that the person should not be detained. The Magistrate's decision shall be final.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>4.25 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs Bill on 16th February, 1973, the Hon. Minister for Health and Home Affairs said, amongst other things, and I quote: [Hansard, Vol. 32, cols. 415-6]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Though we may not have drug-trafficking and drug addiction to the same degree as, for instance, in the United States, we have here some quite big-time traffickers and their pedlars moving around the Republic selling their evil goods and corrupting the lives of all those who succumb to them.'
  <br>
  <br>Hence, Sir, heavy penalties were in-corporated in the Second Schedule to the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on 20th November, 1975, the Hon. Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, admitted that: [Hansard Vol. 34, col. 1381]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... existing penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, have not been a sufficient deterrence to traffickers.'
  <br>
  <br>Sir, the death penalty was then introduced. It is now barely two years and the Minister has brought in another amendment Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, the Minister gave a horrifying account of the problem of drug addiction that exists in our society today. In other words, the death penalty has not been a sufficient deterrence to drug traffickers and pushers. To thus enable the House to understand better why this is the case, could the Hon. Minister enumerate the number of drug traffickers who have been given the death penalty? He has pointed out that only a few have been given the death sentence. I wonder how
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> many executions have been carried out. If not, what are the reasons?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with the problem of tracking down the traffickers, the Minister mentioned: [Hansard Vol. 34, col. 1381]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Central Narcotics Bureau has intelligence information that much of the heroin brought into Singapore has been manufactured in illicit laboratories clandestinely established in a neighbouring country.'
  <br>
  <br>Sir, in this case, may I ask what steps or measures have been taken to obtain the necessary cooperation of the neighbouring country concerned, and whether any information relating to this has been passed on to the neighbouring country for action to be taken? In other words, what has been achieved so far in this respect. Surely the existence of such illegal manufacture of heroin is detrimental both to Singapore and the neighbouring country concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the Minister's statement on the two-prong attack against drug traffickers and addicts to counter this menace. Whilst I support the spirit and intention of this Bill, I would like to seek the Minister's assurance that the Central Narcotics Bureau will be relentless in its efforts to track down the traffickers. I would also like to know whether there have been bilateral or multilateral arrangements in tracking down these drug traffickers, and what are the results, bearing in mind the spirit of ASEAN. I am sure that this is also one of the major problems facing these countries. May I add that we should not just be satisfied with our catch of ikan bilis and let the big fish slip away.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Bill deals more with the rehabilitation of drug addicts, at the same time it gives wide powers to the law enforcement officers. It is, therefore, more than clear that drug addiction has reached a critical stage in Singapore. I congratulate the Hon. Minister for introducing this amendment Bill to tackle the menace, and I believe that every citizen has an important role to play in helping to combat this menace.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I wish to deal with the other details in the Bill. First is this question of cold turkey treatment. The House would appreciate if the Minister could
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enlighten Members as to the number of cases of such treatment, and what measure of success has been achieved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the question of powers of arrest. These powers have now been extended to members of the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary. In introducing further amendments to the amendment Bill, the Minister pointed out that the fear of abuse of powers of arrest by law enforcement officers has been taken into account, and that this fear need not arise. I am glad that he has introduced this amendment. But surely in the act of arresting persons, there is the question of the suspect or the drug addict being handcuffed. Would the Minister consider this point sympathetically - if our intention is to rehabilitate drug addicts, then all the more should care and caution be exercised in the act of arrest. In other words, do we really need to handcuff the suspects?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, would the Hon. Minister indicate to this House the number of drug addicts we have got today, quite apart from his answer in the early pan of the afternoon, and how many of them are hardcore addicts? I appreciate the point that the Minister's department has got a very difficult job to play in combating the drug menace on two fronts, the supply and the demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rehabilitating the drug addicts, I wonder whether the personnel concerned are sufficiently trained in drug rehabilitation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has my support.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me that the introduction of this Bill is a sad commentary on our efforts to educate our young people on the dangers of drug abuse. Whilst I sympathise very much with the enforcement agencies, we should realise that very substantial powers are being conferred by this Bill on the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the urine test which is required of a suspect can be taken by any officer of the Bureau, any immigration officer or any police officer not below the rank of sergeant. Sir,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there may be instances where a group of youngsters are apprehended and their urine requested or demanded by the officer in question. What, Sir, if there should be a mix-up in the urine specimens and the wrong person is put under detention? As this is a matter of actual implementation, I am just wondering whether the Minister has considered the safeguards and procedures to prevent any such mix-ups from occurring, otherwise the poor suspect would simply be detained for six months, and if he does not have the money to pay for a lawyer he will not have recourse to a Magistrate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may reply to the Member for Whampoa first. He has mentioned about the wide powers of arrest, the taking of a urine test by a Police officer not below the rank of sergeant, and the possibility of a mix-up, and what would happen if there had been a genuine case of mix-up. Sir, I have dealt with this point generally in my speech. We have studied this matter very carefully and, as a result, we are putting in safeguards to ensure that, first of all, there will not be any mix-up. But should there ever be a mix-up, there is a remedy, a recourse to a Magistrate for the aggrieved person.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that we have provided that the officer taking the urine for a test should not be any officer but an officer not below the rank of sergeant indicates that we are aware of the possibility of an abuse or a mix-up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the amendments to the Bill, which are being proposed, we are providing for the possibility of an application for a second urine test. In other words, if there has been an error or a mix-up in the first urine test, then a second urine test will be done to prove it one way or the other. As I have said in my speech, what we are proposing to do, as soon as the Bill is passed, is to promulgate detailed regulations to enable such a procedure to be implemented. In other words, instead of taking one urine specimen, we are proposing to take two urine specimens. The first urine specimen will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sent for analysis by the Department of Scientific Services, while the second specimen will be stored under lock and key. If there is claim of a mix-up in the first specimen, then we can fall back on the second specimen. In that way, we can ensure that any possibility of a mix-up is reduced to the minimum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building in the safeguard against a mix-up or abuse of power on the part of enforcement officers. The aggrieved person can go to a Magistrate and swear in a complaint, whereupon the Magistrate shall inquire into the allegations. However, Sir, this is not a court of law where the aggrieved person may need lawyers to represent him. It is just an inquiry. So my reply to the Member for Whampoa is that he does not need a lawyer for the inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Punggol, his first point is that I had found it necessary to move amendments to the Bill in 1975 to introduce the death penalty for trafficking more than a stated amount of heroin or morphine. He asked whether this has got any deterrent effect. Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot give the exact number, but round about eight or nine persons have already been sentenced to death to-date. As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, in accordance with our judicial system, the trial takes place in the High Court, and if the person who is found guilty of this offence is sentenced to death, there is a recourse for appeal. From the High Court the case goes to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That takes some time. From the Court of Criminal Appeal, if it is a case involving the death penalty, the appeal will go to the Privy Council, which is in London, and that also takes time. So the period between the actual death sentence and the appeal being disposed of in the Privy Council may be from 18 months to two years. As the House knows, since this death penalty was introduced in 1975, only one case for appeal went to the Privy Council and the Privy Council had turned it down. And even if the Privy Council should turn down an appeal, there is yet another avenue - the aggrieved person can appeal to the President. That is the reason why to-date there has not been any execution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other cases still awaiting trial. They number about more than 10 to 15 persons and their cases involve the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although it is too early to say whether it has a deterrent effect, we can safely say that without the death penalty drug trafficking would have been more rife.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to close cooperation between Singapore and its neighbouring countries in connection with the drug trafficking menace, I can say that the enforcement agency in Singapore is in close cooperation with the enforcement agencies in our neighbouring countries. In fact, some joint operations have been conducted and there has been some success in the detection and arrest of some quite big-time traffickers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ASEAN, sometime last year we had a conference of drug enforcement officers from ASEAN countries. I think it was held in Hyatt Hotel here in Singapore. So there is close cooperation and exchange of intelligence between the enforcement agencies in Singapore and the neighbouring countries, particularly between ASEAN countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the number of cases under "cold turkey" treatment. May I just explain what "cold turkey" treatment is? Everybody who is a drug abuser or addict would have to undergo cold turkey. Cold turkey simply means that the drug abuser or addict is put in a room. He is not given any drugs, and he begins to suffer from withdrawal symptoms. That is all. There is no medicine. There is no treatment. He is just denied drugs. This is a very good way to try to wean a person from drug addiction. Of course, the withdrawal symptoms will depend on the particular individual, and how hardened he has been on drugs. If he is deep on drugs, then he will suffer acute withdrawal symptoms. If he is just an experimenter or has just started taking drugs, then the withdrawal symptoms will be quite mild.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has brought up the question of suspects being handcuffed. Well, Mr Speaker, Sir,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there is no alternative. When an officer makes an arrest, he has to handcuff the suspect, who will otherwise run away. There have been cases where Customs officers, who had no handcuffs had been given the slip by their suspects who scooted off. In fact, some of the suspects were not only drug addicts but pushers as well. So these pushers had escaped arrest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of drug addicts in Singapore, I have stated that we estimate it to be around 13,000 of which we have arrested 6,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: what is the percentage of hardcore addicts? Sir, from our statistics and from our experience of those 6,000 who have been arrested and have undergone "cold turkey", I am glad to say that most of them are not hardcore addicts. In other words, they had only mild withdrawal symptoms. Only a small percentage are hardcore addicts. Many of them have just started on drugs. This means, Sir, that it is incumbent upon us to go all out at this moment to prevent others from getting hooked on drugs, and to prevent known addicts becoming hardcores. If we move now and move effectively, I believe that we have a chance in controlling the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason why, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have come to this House to seek all the powers necessary for these effective measures that we are going to implement. And I can assure this House, the Member for Punggol in particular, that we are very conscious of the fact that there could be abuse of power or a mistake made at the lower level of enforcement officers, and that is the very reason why we have taken the trouble to have these built-in safeguards. If ever there is such an abuse there is recourse, a remedy, and the persons responsible for the abuse will be brought to book.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek a number of clarifications from the Minister on the answers he gave just now. Whilst I am in support of the Bill and want to ensure that drug addiction does not become an almost
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> uncontrollable menace in Singapore,( believe that the powers given under this Act are so tremendous that possible abuse is very clearly seen. From the answers the Minister gave just now, he failed to satisfy me in regard to the second urine specimen. As I understand it, a specimen of urine is taken within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed and a second test of the same specimen is made if there is an application by the person aggrieved. From what the Minister said just now, two urine specimens are taken. Are they taken in two separate containers? Are they taken in the same place for that matter? Because if there was a mix-up before this amendment and if now the specimens are taken in the same place and two containers are used at the same time, the possibility of a mix-up will surely still exist. I have had a number of cases of my constituents approaching me in regard to this mix-up, and invariably their applications were turned down when I wrote to the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, there is this business of detaining a person, who is aggrieved, just by a urine specimen test or an observation by the Director, CNB, or his officers. Most certainly, this can lead to quite a lot of abuse. No lawyer is required at the inquiry as the Minister has stated, and that means the person cannot defend himself. He is accused of something that he has done which would mean his detention; in other words, imprisonment and then, of course, "cold turkey" and all the rigmarole. I know we do not want our Singaporeans, especially our young Singaporeans, to be involved in drug-taking. But do we want them to be unfairly treated? Can we not give them some opportunity of defending themselves in court after the urine specimens are taken? And when we talk about 13,000 people, the number itself will mean greater abuses. If we have just a few, the chances of abuse are limited. Here we must consider not only the drug-takers, most of them young, but also the trauma that their parents will undergo. I would like some clarification on these points, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like a clarification on the second urine test. It is not unknown that even in medical laboratories and hospitals where the staff are specially trained to conduct tests that there are cases of mix-up. Here we have cases of people who are not specialised to take such samples, and I think we would appreciate the Minister's assurance that very detailed methods of taking test samples would be laid down. Of course, it is not possible to have a foolproof system but I think a detailed system of taking test samples which would minimise the incidence of mix-up would be appreciated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, in the proposed amendment where a complaint on oath of wrongful detention can be brought before a magistrate, the Minister's remarks seem to imply that the complaint must be made by the person detained. My reading of the amendment does not indicate so, and I would appreciate if the Minister could clarify whether the parents or relatives of the detained person could make such a complaint.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, it is also proposed that evidence taken at such hearings before the magistrate are not admissible in a civil or criminal proceeding if improper conduct has been proved. May I know what is the purpose of affording the officers such protection?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just clarify the points raised by the Member for Kallang? I shall also reply to the Member for Potong Pasir as regards the second urine test. The Member says that because we realise that there is a possibility of a mix-up, that is why we are taking two urine specimens. The two specimens will be taken at the same time. We have already worked out the full procedure but it cannot be incorporated in this Bill. It will be incorporated in regulations which will be promulgated after the Bill has been passed. I will give Members an idea of what we are proposing to do. When a urine specimen of a suspect is going to be taken, he will be given two containers. He himself will put his urine in the two containers. The two containers will be sealed by him and they will be put into
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> two boxes which will be locked. The suspect will put one urine sample in a plastic bottle in one box and the other sample in another box.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> The boxes are not marked!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, maybe in Potong Pasir the ballot boxes are not marked! But the boxes for the urine samples will be marked. One box will be marked "For Storage". The other will be marked "To be delivered to the Department of Scientific Services."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to explain to the Member for Kallang, these tests are not done by medical officers. They are done by scientists. We have scientists in the Department of Scientific Services to do these tests. The Department is the proper authority for doing these tests. Members can be assured that these tests are carried out properly and they can depend on the tests to be accurate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a "mix-up" on the part of the Member for Potong Pasir about the recourse to a Magistrate if a person is aggrieved vis-a-vis that there has been some abuse of power or there have been some mix-up. The person can swear a complaint either by himself or through his relatives and the Magistrate, when faced with a sworn complaint, will have to conduct an inquiry. If the aggrieved person wants to have any number of lawyers to act on his behalf, he can do so. But as I said, it is not necessary because the inquiry will be conducted by the Magistrate himself who is an independent person. He is a member of the Judiciary and he will see that the truth of the matter will be arrived at through fair means.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question that proceedings of such an inquiry should not be used as evidence in any court of law, that is the normal practice with regard to any court of law, not necessarily this inquiry presided by a Magistrate. Otherwise people will not want to give evidence freely if, as a result of what he or she says in evidence, there can be a suit against him or her.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered the questions.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just like to seek clarification in respect of the Minister's reply in regard to the appeals board. I would like to know what is the interval between filing an appeal and for the board to meet? If the board takes six months to convene, then the aggrieved person would have already been in detention for six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the complaint will be speedily dealt with. It is not a board. It is just a Magistrate who will decide what course of action to take when he receives a complaint, and it can be dealt with quite speedily. As regards time, it may take two weeks, three weeks or a month. It should not be more than that. Of course, it depends on the particular case in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, just another point of clarification. Why can we not charge the drug addicts in court? Why do we detain them without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves? Is it because it is very difficult to make out a case against them that we take this sort of attitude?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why we adopted this practice is, if we allow the drug addicts to go free, there is a possibility that they may go deeper into drug addiction and infect others. As you know, any person being charged for any offence, can be bailed out. As a result he is free. And he can ask for an adjournment. In the meantime he can infect other people. On the other hand, as far as this procedure is concerned, a person is detained for rehabilitation on the basis of a urine test. I cannot see any other possibility of a wrongful detention unless there has been an abuse on the part of the enforcement officer or there has been a mix-up in the handling of the urine specimens.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can always write into the Act to refuse him bail. Anyway, can he not be given a chance to defend himself? Maybe something went wrong and he was put in detention through no fault of his own. He could have been lured into taking that drug. It could have been put into his drink. So give him a chance to defend himself, and we could refuse him bail, as I said earlier.

  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> To refuse him bail is the same thing. It might be even longer if there is a trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> He is being detained in prison!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> No. he is not detained in prison. He is being detained for treatment at a rehabilitation centre. If he is genuinely aggrieved, there is a Magistrate before whom he can go to, and the Magistrate can inquire into it speedily and arrive at the truth. The essence of the whole measure is speed, which is very important to both, from the point of view of the drug addict himself and the community at large.

Would the Minister consider amending the word "may" to "shall immediately"? This would provide a further safeguard to the person under detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, this word "may" gives the Magistrate discretion. Discretion ought to be given to the Magistrate.

  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill, 1977, will mark the opening of a new dimension in immigration control in Singapore, namely, Exit Control. However, it does not constitute a change in the basic principles of immigration control. This point needs to be emphasised in order to allay the apprehension in some quarters about the significance and effect of an Exit Control Scheme in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present immigration law in Singapore had its origin in the Immigration Ordinance of 1952. This was amended by the Immigration (Amendment) Ordinance, 1959, with effect from 1st May 1959 to take account of the creation of the status of a citizen of Singapore under the Singapore Citizenship Ordinance, 1957. Thereafter the substance of immigration law has remained substantially unchanged although there have been some modifications of the form of the law to reflect the various constitutional changes. The only major change during this period was the introduction of immigration control at the Causeway with effect from 1st July 1967.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, the Immigration Department has regulated the entry into and stay in Singapore of visitors through the issue of various types of temporary passes, such as Social Visit Pass, Student's Pass or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Employment Pass. It is an offence for a visitor to remain in Singapore after the expiry of his pass and he is liable - on conviction to imprisonment for a term of up to six months or to a fine of up to $2,000 or to both such imprisonment and fine. To ensure that foreigners will submit to examination by Immigration Officers on arrival in Singapore, they are only allowed to enter Singapore at entry points such as immigration anchorages, immigration control posts, authorised airports, or authorised landing places which are designated under the provisions of the Immigration Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major defect in the present system is that although the Immigration Department has the power to restrict the stay of foreigners in Singapore, the mechanism is not there for it to ensure that they leave Singapore on or before the expiry of their temporary passes. There is no scheme to require all foreign visitors to submit to immigration check when leaving Singapore. There are also no specially designated exit points through which they are required to leave Singapore. As a result, foreigners can walk out from Singapore undetected even though they may have long overstayed the validity of their passes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special survey conducted by the Immigration Department at various checkpoints revealed that during a two-day period in October 1976, a total of 2,447 visitors had overstayed in Singapore for periods ranging from a few days to over a year. These survey figures indicate only those who after having overstayed here subsequently, for some reasons, found it necessary to leave Singapore. The figures do not, however, disclose the number of visitors who have been overstaying here for very long periods and have no intention of leaving Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Immigration Department takes action to track down those who overstay when information is received about their presence in Singapore. For the who4e of 1976, only 2,695 persons who overstayed were arrested by Immigration
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Officers in this way. This compared unfavourably with the figures of those who overstayed as disclosed during the two-day survey conducted in October 1976. Although quite a number of foreigners have overstayed in Singapore unintentionally, there are many others who have deliberately overstayed for one reason or another. If this is left unchecked, there is a danger that the number of overstayers may increase to critical proportions with all its attendant security and social implications. There is, therefore, an urgent need to institute measures to ward off this danger.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill before the House will empower the Immigration Department to require foreign visitors to leave Singapore only through designated anchorages, airports or points or places of departure. It will also be empowered to require such persons to hand in Embarkation Forms at the time they leave Singapore. By matching, through the use of computer, the information contained in these Embarkation Forms with the arrival information of visitors obtained from the Disembarkation Forms submitted by them on arrival in Singapore, the Department will be able to identify the visitors who have overstayed. Follow-up action will then be taken against them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although overstaying is an offence, some allowance will be made for tourists and other categories of visitors who may have unwittingly overstayed in Singapore for a few days. For such cases, the authorised Immigration Officers will have the discretion to either issue a warning or compound the offence for a sum of up to $100 (under clause 21 of the amendment Bill).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no intention at this stage to apply the Exit Control Scheme to Singapore citizens. However, when Exit Control is implemented, the Immigration Department will be empowered to check those liable for national service leaving the country. It is an offence under the Enlistment Act for persons liable for national service to leave Singapore without an exit permit from the Central Manpower Base. However, due to the absence of departure checking at the moment, such people could leave Singapore
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> undetected temporarily or permanently. When Exit Control is implemented, the Immigration Department will have the manpower to provide departure checking for foreign visitors as well as Singapore citizens liable for national service. It is proposed in clause 17 of the Bill to confer upon an immigration officer the power to prevent those liable for national service from leaving Singapore if he does not have an exit permit. This will assist in the cutting down of the number of deserters and other cases of absence without leave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department will incur a one-time capital expenditure of $824,000 in implementing the Exit Control Scheme. The annually recurrent expenditure on manpower and other operating expenditure may amount to $2,000,000 and $850,000 respectively. But this expenditure is necessary to prevent the accumulation of foreigners who overstay, including undesirable elements, that can be a factor to affect the security and social stability of Singapore. The new Woodlands Checkpoint is ready and the Exit Control Scheme can be implemented as soon as the legislation is passed and necessary regulations enacted.

  <b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council (Amendment) Bill, 1977, seeks to repeal and re-enact section 16 of the Act which deals with pension benefits for employees of the Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Sports Council was established in October 1973, pensionable Government officers who were with the National Sports Promotion Board and the National Stadium Corporation were given the option to transfer their service to the Singapore Sports Council. On their transfer, they commenced contributing to the Central Provident Fund. This Bill has provisions to safeguard any pension, gratuity, provident fund or other superannuation benefit for which such officers were eligible before their transfer to the service of the Council.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Singapore Sports Council is also empowered to establish, with the approval of the Minister, schemes for the payment of pensions, gratuities, provident fund or other superannuation benefits to such employees of the Council as it may determine. When the officers retire, their gratuities, pensions and allowances will be calculated on the total service with both Government and the Council. The portion relating to the length of service with the Government will be borne by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in re-enacting section 16 of the Act will place transferred officers now in the service of the Council on the same footing as ex-Government officers who have been transferred to the service of other statutory boards, as far as retirement benefits are concerned.
