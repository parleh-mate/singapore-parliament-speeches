along  the  perimeter at the first storey of every HDB  block

may  not  be  a very practical one, because they may  instead

pose other problems, such as security risk to apartment units

on the second floor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to inform the Member that HDB will

continue  to  look  into ways to improve the  design  of  our

public  housing  estates  with  a  view  to  minimising  this

problem.   Recent  improvements include provision  of  proper

covered  entrance  porches  at each  HDB  block  and  covered

linkways  within  the  estates, which offer  some  degree  of

protection to HDB residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, I would like to stress that design

solutions alone cannot prevent killer litter.  The root cause

of  the  problem is the lack of civic consciousness  among  a

small  minority  of HDB residents.  For these  residents  who

continue to ignore the public education messages and  display

blatant  disregard for the safety of their fellow  residents,

HDB  will take strong enforcement action as provided  for  in

our  legislation.  This includes compulsory acquisition of  a

sold  HDB  flat  when  the lessee, his spouse  or  authorised

occupier is convicted of a killer litter offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the recent spate of killer litter

incidents  and the public discussion and feedback  generated,

my  Ministry,  together  with the Ministry  of  Law  and  the

Ministry of Home Affairs, has decided to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>

review  the current legislation on killer litter offences  to

reinforce  the legal infrastructure to complement our  public

education  efforts.  Meanwhile, we will continue  to  educate

the  public on the dangers of killer litter.  The  HDB,  Town

Councils  and the grassroots organisations will impress  upon

HDB  residents that they have a civic responsibility to their

fellow  HDB residents.  Ultimately, everyone has  a  part  to

play in making our HDB estates a safer place to live in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, there have

been  a  lot  of  discussions in the papers about  compulsory

acquisition of flats.  Does the Minister not think  that  the

compulsory  acquisition of a HDB flat is a  bit  too  severe,

because  it  punishes the family members  who  are  innocent,

rather  than the offender himself?  He has also said that  he

would  review  the range of penalties.  Has the  review  been

completed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, on whether the

penalties are too harsh, I think it is probably useful for us

to  remember  that  the victims of such  offences  are   also

suffering  very  severely.  Killer litter  offences,  whether

committed  by  the lessees or committed by members  of  their

households,  can injure, maim and even kill.  As  to  whether

the  punishment  is too harsh, in certain  cases  where  such

offences are committed deliberately, blatantly or where it is

a case of a recalcitrant offence, I do not think anyone would

disagree if we were to compulsorily acquire the flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do grant that there may be other instances

where  such  a  penalty may be too severe, and  this  is  the

reason  why  I explained earlier that the various  Ministries

involved will do a review of the offences.  The objective  of

this  review  is to make sure that the penalties  for  killer

litter  are strong but fair.  We need to make sure  that  the

penalties do act as a severe deterrence against future killer

litter  offences, because I think we do owe a  responsibility

to  the  other residents in HDB estates.  After all,  86%  or

almost nine out of 10 Singaporeans live in HDB estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the penalties must be seen to be

fair.  To achieve this, we will look at the penalties to make

sure  that  they  are commensurate with the  nature  of  such

offences and yet be flexible enough for the punishments to be

calibrated according to the severity of the offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a person who commits killer litter offences

can  be prosecuted by the police under the Penal Code.  Under

the Penal Code provisions against rash or negligent acts, the

maximum sentence ranges from an imprisonment term of 3 months

to  2  years  and/or  maximum  fines  from  $250  to  $1,000,

depending on the gravity of the offence.  There is no cap  on

fines for rash acts resulting in death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs will be introducing a

specific  provision in the Penal Code that targets at  killer

litter   offences.   This  is  different  from  the   general

provisions against rash and negligent acts under which killer

litter   offenders  are  currently  prosecuted.   Under   the

specific  provision for killer litter offences,  the  maximum

penalties  will  be  enhanced  to  give  the  courts  greater

flexibility to mete out stiffer punishments on the offenders,

if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of a specific and enhanced punishment

in  the  Penal  Code recognises the community's strong  stand

against  killer  litter.   These new  provisions  for  killer

litter  offences  will form part of a  review  which  MHA  is

currently doing of the Penal Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the court's punishment on killer litter

offenders,  the HDB, as the public housing authority,  has  a

responsibility to help maintain public safety in HDB estates.

Currently, under the Housing and Development Act, the HDB  is

empowered  to compulsorily acquire a HDB flat if, as  I  said

earlier,  the convicted killer litter offender is either  the

lessee, the spouse or an authorised occupier above the age of

14.   Depending on the gravity of the offence,  the  HDB  can

issue   a   final  written  warning  in  lieu  of  compulsory

acquisition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from Members of this House and from members of

the public suggest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>

that  such  a  measure may be too harsh on the  rest  of  the

family,  especially if the offender is not a flat lessee  but

an  authorised  occupier.  HDB, as the  landlord  and  public

housing authority, has the responsibility to promptly move  a

recalcitrant  killer litter offender out of a  high-rise  HDB

flat,  as he poses a threat to public safety.  It is on  this

basis   that  the  HDB's  compulsory  acquisition  power   is

justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB will continue to compulsorily acquire HDB flats

of  very serious or recalcitrant killer litter offenders.  In

other  words, compulsory acquisition as provided for  in  the

Act  will remain.  Such an offender will be debarred for five

years from buying or renting another HDB flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For cases which are serious but not severe enough to

warrant  compulsory  acquisition, the HDB  will  require  the

offender  and his household to sell their flat and  move  out

within six months.  In order not to deprive the family  of  a

roof over their heads, the offender will be allowed to buy or

rent a ground or first floor HDB flat.  However, he will  not

be  permitted to buy or rent a HDB flat above the first floor

for at least three years from the date of eviction.  This  is

for cases which do not warrant compulsory acquisition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For less serious cases, HDB will issue a final written

warning  to  the offender.  And if the offence  is  repeated,

then HDB will take compulsory acquisition action.  These  are

the  various levels of actions that HDB will take,  depending

on  the  severity  of  the offence.  The objective  of  these

different  levels  of severity is, in the ultimate,  to  make

sure  that the offender does not remain in the flat and  does

not have an opportunity to commit the offence again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, does the Minister

think  that it is equitable to all Singaporeans, in terms  of

compulsory  acquisition  of  HDB  flat  for  killer   littler

offence?   If  a  killer litter offender lives in  a  private

condominium,  is  there any law that his private  condominium

unit can be acquired as well?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there could be a situation where the killer

litter  offender is a mental patient.  In such a case,  would

the HDB consider moving the offender down to ground floor  to

solve the problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the Member asked, firstly, whether

it  is  equitable for killer litter offenders to  lose  their

flats.  Again, I must qualify that it depends on the severity

of the offence.  If the person is a very serious offender,  a

recalcitrant  or  repeat  offender, then  under  the  revised

guidelines,  he will lose his flat.  Under such circumstance,

I  do  not think any member of the public will feel that this

is unjustified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether a person in a private housing

estate will also be similarly evicted, the answer is no,  for

the  simple  reason that the HDB does not have  powers.   The

Housing and Development Act does not confer any powers on the

HDB  to move into a private property.  Private properties are

managed  by their own management corporations under the  Land

Titles (Strata) Act.  However, if there is an offender  in  a

private  estate and if that person is convicted, he  will  be

subject to the specific provisions which the Ministry of Home

Affairs  will be promulgating.  In other words, if you  throw

something  down in a private condominium and you  are  caught

and  convicted,  you  will face the  same  severe  penalties.

Whether  you are in a private or public estate, you  will  be

subject to the same laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as to whether his flat will be taken back, I

think that is a separate matter.  As I explained earlier, HDB

is  doing  this  because  it  has  a  responsibility  to  its

residents.    It   does   not  stop  or  prevent   management

corporations from taking similar action against offenders  in

their  estates.  It is entirely up to them.  So there  is  no

question of whether it is fair or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point he raised about mental patients,

first  of  all, it is up to the police whether such a  person

will be prosecuted.  The police has the discretion whether to

bring  such  a  person  to court or  not,  depending  on  the

investigations.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>

difficult  for us to say that when a person claims  insanity,

therefore  he  cannot be prosecuted.  If we  were  to  accept

that, then everybody will claim insanity.  So it is really up

to  the  police who does the investigations and  who  decides

whether  such  a  plea is justified or not, or  whether  that

person should be brought to court.  Having made the decision,

then  it is left to the courts to decide whether that accused

person  is guilty or not and, if so, to mete out the relevant

punishment.  It is only when the person is convicted that HDB

has the power to then decide what to do.  Here, HDB now has a

range  of  options  to  decide whether to  acquire  the  flat

immediately, to evict the person and allow him six months  to

leave,  to  sell the flat and to buy a flat on a lower  floor

or, if need be, to just issue a final warning.  These are the

various options the HDB will have.  Compulsory acquisition is

not the only option that will be available to HDB.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta-Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  welcome  this more calibrated approach  to  killer-litter offences  by MND as well as MHA.  I would like to  ask

the  Minister  whether, in the light of  this  approach,  the

Housing  and Development Act could be reviewed to  raise  the

maximum  penalty from $1,000 to $5,000, same as  the  penalty

imposed by the Town Council, for the non-penal offences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I would like to acknowledge that the

Member  has actually pointed this out to the Ministry  and  I

wish  to  inform him that immediate action would be taken  to

regularise  and harmonise these two provisions to  make  sure

that  there  is no confusion.  In other words, when  such  an

offence  is committed, both the Town Council and the HDB  can

act either separately or together.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  take it that before the  HDB  compulsorily

acquires  the  property, the offender is taken to  court  and

punished.   Does  the Minister realise that  this  is  double

jeopardy, which is wholly wrong in principle?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that I have is the one raised by the

Member for Hougang,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>

which I was going to ask.  Is the Minister not discriminating

between  a  dweller  in public housing and  a  dweller  in  a

private flat?  Why the discrimination?  If it is bad  in  one

case it is bad in the other.  The Government can acquire that

flat  and sell it.  Why is he showing discrimination?  May  I

have short answers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The short answer to the second question

is  that the Government is not discriminating.  When a person

is  convicted  of  a  killer litter offence,  whether  he  is

staying  in a private condominium or he is staying in  a  HDB

estate,  he goes to jail or he is fined, whichever  the  case

is,  and  the level of penalties meted out will be  the  same

irrespective   of   where  he  stays.   So   where   is   the

discrimination?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the action taken by HDB is concerned, this

is entirely a matter between the landlord, which in this case

is  the HDB, and the lessee.  It is surely the responsibility

of  the HDB as the landlord, in the same way that it will  be

the  responsibility of a management corporation of a  private

estate, to make sure that the safety of the residents in  its

estate  is  safeguarded.    I do not see what is  wrong  with

that.   It is entirely within the rights of HDB to make  sure

that the residents who live in HDB estates can walk around in

comfort and safety.  So by moving the person from a high-rise

flat  to  a low-rise flat to make sure that that person  does

not  repeat the offence is an eminently reasonable  thing  to

do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister has not answered my

question.  Does it not infringe the double jeopardy rule?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> These are two entirely separate

matters.  One is the conviction by the court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But you are punishing the person twice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> We are not punishing the person twice.

Firstly, he is punished in a court of law.  Secondly, he  has

violated a condition of the lease between the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>

landlord  and  the  lessee.  If he is in  a  private  estate,

similarly if he violates any of the conditions of the  lease,

he can be kicked out.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increases)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry (a) what is the total amount and what are the  rates

of  the three consecutive increases in electricity tariffs by

Singapore  Power since the beginning of this  year;  and  (b)

what is the justification for such increases in light of  the

fact that Singapore Power had raised its after-tax profits to

a new record of $904 million soon after our economic recovery

in 1999.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year, Power Supply raised

electricity tariffs on three occasions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st January 2000, by an average of 1.91 cents per

kilowatt-hour (kwh) or 16%;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st May 2000, by an average of 0.43 cents per kwh or

3%; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st August 2000, by an average of 2.81 cents per kwh

or 20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, the average electricity tariff is now about

16.89  cents per kwh or 44% higher than the average  rate  of

11.74 cents per kwh in December last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tariff increase is solely due to rising fuel cost.

Fuel  cost  makes  up  about half of the  cost  of  producing

electricity. Singapore imports all the fuel oil required  for

power  generation.    Our electricity  tariffs  are  reviewed

quarterly  and adjusted, if necessary, to pass on changes  in

fuel oil prices to consumers.  The computations are based  on

forecast  of  near term oil prices.  Any discrepancy  between

the forecast and actual oil prices will result in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>

either  an  over-  or under-collection of  revenue  by  Power

Supply.   Under  the current price regulation  regime,  Power

Supply is allowed to recover the under-collected revenue  or,

alternatively, required to return over-collected  revenue  to

consumers in the following quarter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1998, Power Supply reduced the electricity

tariffs by 14% to an average of 11.74 cents per kwh when fuel

oil  prices fell. Since then, fuel oil prices have  increased

by  109%,  from  US$11 per barrel in May 1998  to  US$23  per

barrel  in  July  2000.   It has gone up even  further  since

then.   Nevertheless,  Power Supply kept electricity  tariffs

unchanged  until  December 1999. I have distributed  a  graph

(Cols.  771-772). which is available on Members' seats  which

shows how much fuel oil prices have gone up  since March 1999

and how our electricity tariffs have also changed during that

period.    But because tariffs were kept unchanged  for  many

months, this has resulted in a substantial under-recovery  of

cost  by  Power  Supply  and  therefore  the  need  for   the

electricity  tariffs to be adjusted three  times  this  year.

Altogether  tariffs  have increased by  44%  since  May  1998

compared  to  fuel oil cost increase of 109%  over  the  same

period.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000825/20000825-HA-0720771.gif">Graph - Average Electricity Tariff and Fuel Oil Price (Cols. 771 - 772)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate the impact of the increase, Power Supply has

spread  the last tariff increase in August 2000 over a period

longer  than  the usual 3-month period.  For residential  and

small  non-domestic customers, the adjustment is spread  over

eight months.  For large non-domestic customers, it is spread

over five months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Singapore Power has granted rebates to

consumers  to help them tide over the economic crisis.  Since

July  1998,  Singapore  Power has  implemented  a  series  of

rebates,  increasing in steps from 0.3 cent per kwh  in  July

1998  to 1.3 cent per kwh in January 2000. Up till end  March

2000,  Singapore Power has given back a total of $355 million

to the consumers in rebates.  The rebates will continue until

the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his question, Mr Tay pointed out that Singapore Power

made a record profit of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>

$904 million in 1999.  This translated into a Return on Total

Assets  (ROTA) of 8.3%.  However, this was not the result  of

any   tariff  increases.  Singapore  Power  actually  reduced

tariffs  in  May 1998, and kept them unchanged till  December

1999.  The  profits  were  the  result  of  productivity  and

efficiency  gains  by  Singapore  Power.   Singapore  Power's

tariffs  are  regulated through a price cap using  the  CPI-X

approach,  ie,  Singapore Power is allowed to adjust  tariffs

(excluding  fuel  costs) by less than  the  increase  in  the

Consumer  Price Index, because we expect Singapore  Power  to

show  productivity gains and reduce its costs  from  year  to

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPI-X formula depends on X, the amount by which we

expect SP to improve productivity. If productivity goes up by

more  than X, SP gets to keep the gains. X was set  in  April

1997 for a 3-year period, at 1% per annum.  PUB reviewed this

formula  in  March,  at  the end of the  3-year  period,  and

decided  to  maintain X at 1% for one more  year  until  next

April,  since Singapore Power's expected ROTA was within  the

targeted 7-8% range.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in the process of restructuring the

electricity  industry into a competitive market.   I  briefed

Members on this during this year's Committee of Supply.  Next

April,  the  generation  companies  will  be  taken  out   of

Singapore  Power. Once the industry is fully  liberalised  in

about  3  years' time, consumers will enjoy more  competitive

electricity rates, better services and choice of suppliers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister aware that the

recent  increases  in electricity tariff have  exerted  great

cost  pressure  on families?  Secondly, the Minister  in  his

answer said that in 3 years' time consumers would enjoy  more

competitive electricity tariffs.  Is he sure of  that?   Does

he mean that it would be much lower?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We are very aware that the

increase in utility prices has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>

been  a  point of much concern to many households.  For  that

reason,  I thank Mr Tay Beng Chuan for raising this issue  in

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have attached, with the chart, a page (Cols. 773-774)

entitled  "Rebates  for Utilities Bills"  to  show  what  the

Government has done to offset the increase in utility prices.

In  January 1997 when the Government restructured  the  water

tariff,  water  conservation tax  and  water-borne  fees,  we

introduced  a  system of rebates to be phased  in  over  four

years.   It is shown in Table 1.  We have loaded it in favour

of  those  who  are living in 1- to 3-room  HDB  flats.   The

rebates   are  given  annually  on  1st  September  to   help

households  overcome the effects of utility  prices,  without

subsidising  utilities because we do not  want  to  subsidise

utilities  directly as this will encourage over  consumption.

What  we found is that over the last two years, 1- and 2-room

flats   have  not  increased  their  electricity   or   water

consumption.  For 4-room flats and above, there has  been  an

increase.   The  rebates that we have given  will  completely

offset  the  increase in electricity and water  tariffs  this

year  for  1-  to  3-room flats.  This is  according  to  the

numbers  which we have calculated.  Consumers can expect  the

rebates  to be included when they receive their bill  at  the

end  of  September.  For 1- to 3-room flats, the  rebates  of

$200 will kick in.  For 4-room HDB flats, the rebate will  be

$100.  This answers Mr Low's first question.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000825/20000825-HA-0720773.htm">Page - Rebates for Utilities Bill (Cols. 773 - 774)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his second question whether we can expect more

competitive   prices  when  we  deregulate  the   electricity

industry,  I think so.  In other words, if he takes  out  the

fuel  oil  component,  which depends on international  energy

market  prices,  he  will  find more  products  available  to

consumers.  In New Zealand, where the electricity market  has

been deregulated, every household has a choice of maybe 4  to

8   electricity  suppliers.   These  suppliers,   which   are

electricity  retailers,  will  have  their  own   long   term

contracts  with  the  power generating companies.   They  may

package them in different ways for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>

different  consumers.  For instance, if you are  prepared  to

accept interruptible electricity supply, you may get a  lower

rate.   If  you  use electricity at night, whether  for  air-conditioning or to heat water or recharge electric cars, then

you  may  enjoy  low  rates.  There could  be  other  bundles

created.   For  instance, instead of buying  air-conditioners

and  electricity separately, you may well go into a  contract

with  a  service provider who undertakes to provide a certain

level  of air-conditioning or dehumidification for a  certain

fixed price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all kinds of new products would be possible once we

deregulate.   It is a complicated exercise.  We are  starting

with  the  privatisation of the Gencos (generation companies)

next year, and then we will progressively open up more of the

market for competition.  And we hope that, say, within  three

years, all households will have choices available to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Would the Minister

explain  how  Singapore Power determines the  basic  rate  of

electricity tariffs?  What is the profit margin for Singapore

Power  to charge the consumers for electricity?  And  in  the

light  of  these  huge  record profits  for  year  1999,  can

Singapore Power be asked to trim the tariffs?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Although the profits appear

very  large, in fact it is over a very big asset base,  which

was  why the Return on Total Assets was only 8.3% even though

the  profits exceeded $900 million.  Our target for Singapore

Power  is  7% to 8%, which is a reasonable return on  utility

type assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Singapore Power set tariffs? There are two

components.   There are fuel prices for which the  regulatory

structure requires a complete pass through.  In other  words,

Singapore  Power  should make no money from  fluctuations  in

fuel  oil  prices.   Then  for the  non-fuel  component,  for

transmission  cost,  for  grid charges,  it  is  a  regulated

monopoly.  So there has got

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>

to  be argy-bargy.  We say, all right, this is your base, and

every  year  you  are  expected to show  an  X%  increase  in

productivity  after netting off for inflation,  and  we  have

worked  out 1%.  They have done better than that, principally

because  between the management and the unions, they  managed

to  galvanise the workers to really review all operations  in

the  industry and to see how they can make efficiency  gains.

They  have  done  a good job.  In the last  two  years,  they

increased  productivity substantially and  this  has  enabled

them to increase their profit margins.  Should we now, having

encouraged  them to increase efficiency, tax their efficiency

by  saying,  "Look, since you have made the efficiency  gain,

now  we  claw it back and subsidise consumers."?   I  do  not

think  that is a good principle because if you do that  once,

then  in future when you set targets for them, they will say,

"No, no."  Just do nothing.  Because if you do more, you will

be penalised for doing more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is important to maintain the integrity of the

regulatory  structure and keep in place the incentives  which

are important for the long term.  If rebates should be given,

they  should be given outside this system directly, which  is

what we have done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he has

not  missed the point in the question that was posed to  him?

The question was: what is the justification for increase,  if

you  have  made  a profit of almost a billion  dollars?   The

Minister says even with reduced prices, we made that  profit.

So  could  he  tell  us  what is the justification  for  this

increase?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I am not very clear about Mr

Jeyaretnam's question.  I thought I have made it  very  clear

that  the increase is directly explained by the surge in fuel

oil prices in the last one year.  Let me draw Mr Jeyaretnam's

attention to the graph which I have circulated.  You have  it

on  your  chair.  Take a look at the graph.  We have  on  the

left  hand  side  "Fuel Oil Price"; on the  right  hand  side

"Average Electricity Tariff".  The graph starts January 1998.

Around March

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>

1999,  fuel oil prices, because OPEC had an agreement, surged

all  the way from about US$9 reaching US$30+ in August  2000.

So it is this tripling of fuel oil prices which had led to  a

necessary increase in electricity prices.  Of course, you may

want to make an argument that we should subsidise electricity

consumption in Singapore.  But that is a different  argument.

We have for a long time taken the position that it is harmful

to  us,  as  a  country, to subsidise the use of electricity,

because  it  will  lead  to over-consumption  and  structural

vulnerability to energy fluctuation in the world or,  rather,

to the fluctuation of energy prices in the world.

<div align="center"><b>UNION REPRESENTATION OF EXECUTIVES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress report of Tripartite Committee)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he will give a progress report of the Tripartite Committee on

union representation of executives.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, in August last year, I informed the House  that

the  Ministry of Manpower would set up a Tripartite Committee

to  examine  the  issue of allowing junior and  middle  level

executives to join rank-and-file unions.  This Committee  was

chaired  by  the Minister of State for Manpower with  members

from  the  National  Trades Union Congress (NTUC),  Singapore

National  Employers' Federation (SNEF), the American Business

Council,  the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  the

German  Business  Group  as well as representatives  from  my

Ministry  and  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry.   The

Committee  held consultations with union and employer  groups

for  feedback  and views on the issue.  It has completed  its

study and submitted its recommendations to the Government for

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee pointed out that Singapore has enjoyed a

high  level  of industrial harmony and that our trade  unions

have adopted a cooperative approach to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>

strengthen  labour management relations for  the  benefit  of

employers  and  workers.   For  example,  the  NTUC  and  its

affiliates persuaded workers to take a cut in employers'  CPF

contributions during the Asian financial crisis.   They  have

been  proactive in skills upgrading with initiatives such  as

the  Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) to help workers add

value to their companies and remain employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee noted that under existing laws, executives

could form their own unions to represent their interests  and

engage  in  collective bargaining with  employers.   It  also

noted  that  the  educational  and  occupational  profile  of

Singapore's  workforce  has changed  significantly  over  the

years.  With an increasing proportion of the workforce  being

better  educated,  more employees are expected  to  join  the

executive ranks.  This could result in an employer having  to

deal  with  two  or more unions in the company if  executives

opted  to  form their own unions.  The NTUC was of  the  view

that  a single union at a workplace is preferable to multiple

unions.   A  single union could better promote  teamwork  and

closer labour management cooperation.  NTUC also pointed  out

that  a  single union representing rank-and-file workers  and

executives  would enable unions to draw good leaders  from  a

larger talent pool.  Good leadership in our union movement is

critical  to  ensure  that trade unions  are  able  to  serve

workers and help to enhance tripartite cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also noted employers' concern that

unionization  of  executives  in rank-and-file  unions  could

affect  management effectiveness and flexibility.   Employers

had  expressed  concerns  that there  could  be  conflict  of

interest, which may undermine business competitiveness.  Some

MNCs  were worried about the unionization of their executives

in  the  light of the adversarial labour-management relations

in their home countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee noted the concerns of both employers and

unions.  It concluded that in view of our harmonious labour

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>

management  relations, it would be desirable  to  allow  some

executives  to  join  rank-and-file  unions.   The  Committee

proposed  that  executives who do not have senior  management

responsibility and substantial managerial functions  such  as

hiring,  promotion, dismissal and disciplinary functions,  be

allowed   to  join  rank-and-file  unions.   They  could   be

represented  by  the rank-and-file unions  on  an  individual

basis  in respect of retrenchment and dismissal but  not  for

collective bargaining purposes.  The Committee held the  view

that  this approach would enable the unions to maintain their

membership  base yet avoid conflicts of interest or  loss  of

management effectiveness and flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that its recommendations do not adversely

affect  labour management relations and Singapore's  economic

competitiveness,  the  Committee  further  proposed  that   a

Tripartite   Working   Group  be  set   up   to   study   the

implementation issues and to reach out to employer groups  to

explain  the recommendations.  In the meantime, the  Ministry

should  consider  appropriate  legislative  changes  to   the

Industrial  Relations  Act to enable some  executives  to  be

represented by rank-and-file unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that

the  Government  has  accepted  the  recommendations  of  the

Tripartite  Committee,  including  setting  up  a  Tripartite

Working  Group  and  studying amendments  to  the  Industrial

Relations  Act.   I  would like to take this  opportunity  to

thank   members  of  the  Tripartite  Committee   for   their

contributions.

<div align="center"><b>SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Policy on sitting on boards of private companies and Government-linked companies)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what

is  the  Government's policy on senior civil servants sitting

on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>

the  Boards of Directors of private companies and Government-linked   companies;  and  whether  there  are  conflicts   of

interests and, if so, how are these conflicts resolved.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service has for many years operated a

scheme  to  appoint senior civil servants to  the  Boards  of

Directors   of  Government-linked  companies  (GLCs).    Such

appointments  help  the  officers to  better  understand  the

nature  of business and industry, and at the same time enable

the company to benefit from the officers' contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each such appointment is individually vetted and

approved  by  the parent ministry of the officer  and/or  the

Public  Service  Division,  to ensure  that  no  conflict  of

interest  will arise.  The officers appointed do not  receive

directorship fees directly from the companies.  Instead,  the

GLCs  pay  the  fees  to  the  Directorship  and  Consultancy

Appointment  Council (DCAC), which in turn pays the  officers

an   annual   allowance,  depending   on   their   level   of

responsibility on the boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the civil service has rarely approved

appointments of officers from the Ministries to the boards of

non-GLCs.  However, there have been exceptions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mr Teo Ming Kian, Chairman of the National

Science  and  Technology Board (NSTB), sits on the  board  of

AsiaOne.   PSD approved this after the Ministry of Trade  and

Industry  which supervises NSTB assessed that  there  was  no

conflict of interest with Mr Teo's primary job as Chairman of

NSTB,  and  that it would not affect Mr Teo's performance  of

official duties as a public officer.  In addition, Mr Teo was

not allowed to accept any shares or options which AsiaOne may

offer  to  its  Board  of Directors.   Mr  Teo  accepted  the

invitation  to sit on the AsiaOne board primarily  to  better

understand these newly emerging Internet companies so that he

could  help develop a more supportive environment  for  them.

Besides Mr Teo, a few NSTB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>

officers sit on the boards of private companies in which NSTB

is  a  significant  shareholder, as part  of  fulfilling  its

science and technology development charter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several officers of the Economic Development Board (EDB)

and EDBI (or EDB Investments), which is EDB's investment arm,

have  also been appointed to the boards of private and public

listed  companies.  Their appointments are  approved  by  the

Managing Director or Chairman of EDB, who are responsible for

ensuring that there is no conflict of interest.  Approval  is

based on several criteria:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as part of work. For example, where EDB or

EDBI  are co-investors; where EDB or EDBI officers, by virtue

of their domain knowledge, can add value to the companies; or

where   the   companies   specifically   ask   for   an   EDB

representative on their board for comfort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for networking purposes, when it helps the

officers  to  learn and understand more about the  companies,

industries,  technologies, and emerging trends, in  order  to

further develop existing and new industry clusters;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thirdly, for career development and exposure, where

such appointments will broaden the exposure and experience of

the officers as part of their career development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Chairman of EDB himself, Mr Philip

Yeo,  Members  would  be  aware  that  he  retired  from  the

Administrative  Service last year and is  currently  employed

directly by EDB.  His employment contract specifically allows

him to accept board memberships with remuneration, subject to

there  being  no conflict of interest and with approval  from

the Minister for Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo is currently a non-executive director in several

private  sector  companies, including, for  example,  Infosys

Technologies which is a leading Indian IT company,  SilkRoute

Holdings which is an investment holding company of e-commerce

start-ups, and United

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>

Overseas Bank.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry,  in  fact

the  Minister,  approved these appointments after  satisfying

itself that they did not pose any conflict of interest to  Mr

Yeo's  duties  in EDB and NSTB.  Should any of the  companies

have  dealings  with EDB or NSTB, for example, while  seeking

Government  assistance or tax incentives, EDB and  NSTB  have

standard   operating  procedures  to  prevent   conflict   of

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involvement of Ministers on company boards is

governed  by  a  Code  of Conduct for  Ministers.   Paragraph

3(iii) of the Code reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Minister should not hold any directorship in public

companies   or   participate  actively  in  any  professional

practice.   Nor  should  he  be associated  in  a  formal  or

advisory capacity with any commercial undertaking or  receive

any remuneration from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except that the Prime Minister may authorise the

Minister  to  hold  such  office  or  participate  in  or  be

associated  with  any  of the aforesaid activities  where  he

considers it in the national interest for the Minister to  do

so.  The Prime Minister's authorisation shall be published in

the Gazette."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew serves on several

international advisory boards, including Daimler-Chrysler,  J

P  Morgan  and  TOTAL  which is a French  oil  major.   These

appointments   have  been  invaluable  in  helping   him   to

appreciate the major changes taking place in the business and

financial world, and what Singapore must do to catch up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lee told Parliament last year (during the debate

on Singapore 21 on 6th May 1999), having had the advantage of

time and opportunity to attend meetings with top bankers, top

executives in different parts of the world, he had  concluded

that  our  previous  aspiration of becoming  the  centre  for

Southeast  Asia  was  inadequate.  This is  a  global  stage,

whether we like it or not, and to play in this global market,

we must have talent of a global standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM also described how having been exposed as a member of

an  international advisory board of a big American  bank,  he

could  see  the speed at which they themselves were  changing

and spreading

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>

throughout the world, and concluded that we had no choice but

to  stop  protecting our local banks from foreign competition

or face the prospect of being wiped out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the next phase of our economic

development,   we   will  need  to  recruit   many   talented

individuals,  in  Singapore and worldwide, to  contribute  in

different  ways  to our economy and society.   We  will  need

specialists  and generalists, chairmen and board  members  of

statutory boards and companies.  The distinction between GLCs

and non-GLCs will become less relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be invaluable for the public sector to have

officers who understand how companies work, and are  au  fait

with  developments  in  the business world.   Allowing  civil

servants  to  serve on the boards of companies will  help  to

achieve  this.   There  must of course  be  proper  rules  to

safeguard  against conflict of interest, and to  ensure  that

the   civil  servant's  primary  responsibility  and  loyalty

remains to his organisation and the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector encompasses a wide range of agencies,

from  Ministries  at  the  core of  public  policymaking,  to

research  institutes  which are really at  the  periphery  of

Government,  and  statutory boards  which  are  somewhere  in

between.  The appropriate rules and constraints governing the

appointment of officers to boards of companies will therefore

vary  for the different parts of the public sector.   PSD  is

reviewing the existing rules and practices, to see  how  best

we  can achieve this flexibility in the new situation,  while

upholding the integrity and ethos of the public service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, there may be no conflict of

interest where the individual civil servant is concerned, but

where  the companies are concerned, there is a perception  in

the  private  sector that such companies  with  senior  civil

servants on the board have an unfair advantage over the other

companies.   How do you address this concern of  the  private

companies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>

without the privilege of having senior civil servants on  the

board?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, we must

make  up our mind whether there is a problem and then  decide

how  to  deal with it if there is one.  If there is not  one,

whether there is a perception and whether there is ground for

it or not.  It is not a new thing for civil servants to serve

on company boards.  They have done it for GLCs for many years

-  DBS,  SIA, Sembawang, Keppel.  And frankly, some of  these

companies  would not have been built up had  there  not  been

very strong and effective civil servants, like Joe Pillay  in

SIA,  to run these companies and build them up into what they

are today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in a new position. We could continue the old

scheme  where  we make these arrangements for GLCs  and  then

say, "For non-GLCs, you are beyond the pale."  Or we have  to

review  the  position and say, "Well, it is a new  situation.

Whether   you  are  a  GLC  or  not,  it  is  not  a  crucial

distinction."   The crucial distinction is: is  it  going  to

make  a  difference  to Singapore?  Is  it  in  the  national

interest?   And  is there any conflict of interest  when  the

officer  serves  on the board?  Does he make a  contribution?

If  so,  then we work out schemes which enable us to do  this

and  maintain the integrity of the civil service.  And people

in  Singapore  know that if you have a civil servant  on  the

board, you do not get favours done.  Sometimes, the contrary,

because  then, they may find out something is wrong with  the

company.   Or  knowing that there is a civil servant  on  the

board,  the Government may be doubly cautious not to make  an

exception or exercise discretion when otherwise it might have

done so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are issues which we have to work out. We have to

take  the steps very carefully because we have a very  strong

reputation to uphold.  The integrity of the civil service and

the  ethos  of  the civil servants - that  they  are  in  the

Government  and that is their primary job.  There  are  other

things which they can do and which we think is good for  them

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>

do,  and we make arrangements, but do not forget where  their

primary  job is.  I think we want to preserve that.   But  if

you  are  in  a research institute and you have  developed  a

patent,  or got a new idea, or some new protein or drug,  and

you  want to go and start up a company and profit from  this,

but  we say that you cannot do that, then the only people who

are going to work in research institutes are the ones who are

not  going  to have ideas.  Because the ones who  have  ideas

will be off on their own, and there are many other places  in

the  world where these arrangements have been made and  there

are  opportunities to do it, including universities like MIT,

Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge or Oxford, which also have  been

trying  to  find  the  right  interface  between  where   the

university stands and where the private sector begins.  So we

have to find the right form.  I assure you we will try and do

it very carefully.

<div align="center"><b>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Minimum disclosure standards)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister, in

light  of  the  recent unsatisfactory handling  of  the  eWOS

initial public offer, if the Government will (i) ensure  that

the  public  has access to minimum disclosure  standards  for

future IPOs and (ii) intensify public education efforts.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a long

answer but I will try and finish it within six minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsatisfactory handling of the eWorld of Sports.com

Limited's initial public offering was the result of a failure

to  make  full and proper disclosure.  Although UOB Asia  Ltd

did  disclose United Overseas Bank Ltd's subscription  of  10

million  eWOS shares under the public tranche, it  failed  to

distinguish these shares from those that UOB was absorbing as

underwriter.  The 1.3 times public subscription  figure  that

was  disclosed  was  misleading.  UOB  Asia  also  failed  to

disclose  that 1 million shares under the public tranche  had

been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>

allocated  to  GK Goh Securities, who was the co-underwriter.

The  Exchange had reprimanded UOB Asia for falling  short  of

the high standards of disclosure that the Exchange expects of

issue  managers,  and  is essential  to  foster  a  fair  and

transparent market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, the MAS has stated that it reviews all such

cases  for possible infringements of the Securities  Industry

Act.   It  is  an  offence to create a  false  or  misleading

appearance  in  the  market for a share  counter.   The  MAS,

having   carefully  studied  the  text  of  the  announcement

published  in  the Straits Times on 4th August  2000  by  UOB

Asia,  the  text  of the statement issued  by  the  Singapore

Exchange on 11th August and the statement issued by UOB  Asia

on  14th  August  has  formed the view that  the  4th  August

announcement  was  sufficiently misleading  to  the  ordinary

investor to justify an investigation into whether an  offence

had  been  committed under the Securities  Industry  Act,  in

particular section 99.  This section makes it an offence  for

any  person knowingly to make a false or misleading statement

in a material particular that is likely to induce the sale or

purchase of securities by other persons or is likely to  have

an  effect  in  maintaining the market price  of  securities.

Accordingly,  the  MAS has referred the  matter  to  CAD  for

investigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue managers are professional advisors. If they fail

to  discharge their duties to the highest standards of  care,

competence   and  responsibility,  especially   after   being

expressly instructed by the Exchange, then they must face the

consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem in the eWOS case was a deficiency in

professional judgement and conduct, rather than a shortcoming

of  the rules and regulations.  Such conduct would have  been

unacceptable  even under our previous merit-based  regulatory

approach,  when  companies seeking an IPO  were  screened  on

their commercial merits.  High professional standards are all

the  more  important under a disclosure-based  regime,  where

investors need full information to evaluate what is on offer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Exchange cannot create explicit rules to cover every

scenario,  or  to  pre-empt  all professional  misjudgements.

Nevertheless,  in  the light of this incident,  the  Exchange

will review whether to prohibit underwriters from subscribing

to   IPOs   that  they  underwrite,  or  to  impose  stronger

disclosure   requirements  where  they  do  subscribe.    The

Exchange  will  study  practices in other  developed  markets

before deciding on the best approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has also been looking into the continuing disclosure

requirements  for  companies once  they  are  listed.   These

requirements  are  currently only non-statutory  SGX  listing

rules,  not  legal requirements.  They concern the disclosure

of material information regarding a company's operations, and

any  matter that may materially impact its share price.   The

MAS  is  studying legislation to give these requirements  the

force of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's role in investor education is indirect.

MAS  works with industry bodies and public associations  such

as   the  Exchange,  Investment  Management  Association   of

Singapore   and  the  Securities  Investors  Association   of

Singapore,  while  introducing  programmes  to  educate   the

public.   The  CPF Board also intends to educate its  members

about   the  products  available  under  the  CPF  Investment

Schemes.   The  Government  encourages  industry  efforts  at

education  and  will  support  them  with  funding  from  the

Financial   Sector  Development  Fund.    But   the   primary

responsibility  for  educating  retail  investors  lies  with

financial institutions and their representatives, who are  in

direct contact with their clients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifting from a merit-based regime of securities

regulation  to a more liberal, disclosure-based regime  is  a

process  that  takes time.  Investors, listed companies,  and

financial  institutions  need to learn  how  the  new  regime

works.   Participants  will  have  wider  latitude  to   take

business and market risks, and to judge the merits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>

of  investment proposals for themselves.  But there  will  be

absolutely  no  change in the high standards of  professional

conduct  demanded  of financial intermediaries,  and  in  our

strict  enforcement  of  rules and  laws  to  prevent  unfair

practices and false markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that during the transition from

merit-  to  disclosure-based regimes, some participants  will

test  the  limits of what is permitted.  But I  am  confident

that  after  a  few salutary test cases, they  will  discover

where  the  limits lie and the consequences of  transgressing

these limits, and a new balance will be established.

years of bond associated with the scholarship depends on  the

type  of  award and country of study.  For PSC, for  example,

the  bond is six years for US and UK; five years for  France,

Germany,  Japan  and  PRC;  and  four  years  for  the  local

scholarships.   The amount of sponsorship also varies  across

countries, depending on the cost of the university  education

as well as the cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government scholarships are given for the purpose of

identifying,  inducting and grooming talent  for  the  public

sector.   Thus, the Government is not in favour  of  awarding

prestige  or acknowledgement scholarship without the  scholar

making a commitment to serve in the public service.  There is

already much flexibility in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>

treatment  of Government scholars.  First, scholarship  bonds

have  been shortened from six to eight years to now  four  to

six  years  to  keep  up with the times.   Scholars  are  now

encouraged to pursue a much wider range of disciplines.  Many

scholarships also allow scholars who meet the criteria to  go

for postgraduate studies.  For example, those who are on SAF,

Police  or  PSC Overseas Merit Scholarships, have a  Master's

programme worked in as part of their scholarship term as long

as they complete their studies in four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past 5 years we have been active in

reforming our legislation in Intellectual Property  or  "IP".

We  enacted major amendments to the Patents, Trade Marks  and

Copyright  legislation.   We introduced  new  legislation  in

areas   such   as  Geographical  Indications  and  Integrated

Circuits.  As part of this ongoing effort to finetune our  IP

legislation, it is now timely to revise our law  relating  to

Industrial  Designs by this - the Registered Designs  Bill  - now before the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in drafting this Bill, we consulted various

relevant  parties.   The  Intellectual  Property  Office   of

Singapore  or  (IPOS) worked closely with the  Inter-Ministry

Committee  overseeing Singapore's compliance with  the  World

Trade  Organisation's Agreement on Trade Related  Aspects  of

Intellectual  Property  or "TRIPS".  The  Committee  includes

representatives from the Economic Development Board  and  the

Trade  Development  Board  through  which  the  industry  was

consulted.   IPOS  also  consulted the  Law  Faculty  of  the

National   University  of  Singapore,  the  Law  Society   of

Singapore  and  the World Intellectual Property  Organisation

(WIPO).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, this Bill creates a registration system in

Singapore for the protection of industrial designs.  It  will

replace the existing legislation - the United Kingdom Designs

(Protection) Act (Cap 339) - which provides that all  designs

registered  under the United Kingdom Registered  Designs  Act

1949  enjoy the same rights and privileges here,  as  in  the

United  Kingdom.  Hence, currently, local designers  have  to

register  their  designs in the United Kingdom  in  order  to

enjoy  protection in Singapore.  This is a circuitous,  time-consuming  and  costly  process.  It will  therefore  further

promote entrepreneurship if we have our own system to protect

registered designs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A design will be accepted for registration if it is new

and applied industrially.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>

It  will  not be accepted for registration if it is a  design

that  is  dictated  purely by the function  that  it  has  to

perform.  These definitions are consistent with the  approach

taken  in  the United Kingdom.  However, in line with  recent

trends  in  other  countries, the  definition  now  does  not

require  that the features of the design appeal  to  and  are

judged  by the eye, or that aesthetic considerations must  be

taken into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications will now be registered more expeditiously

as  they  will  be examined to ensure that they  meet  formal

requirements  only.   This is similar  to  the  international

system   of  registration  adopted  at  the  WIPO  diplomatic

conference  in  1999 as reflected in the Hague Agreement  for

the  International Registration of Designs.   The  period  of

protection  for registered designs has been shortened  to  15

years from the current 25 years.  This again is in line  with

trends in other countries where the periods range from 10  to

15  years.   Disputes  arising  from  the  registration,  for

example, where the registration is being contested on any  of

the  grounds  on which registration could have  been  refused

will be adjudicated by the Courts or by the Registrar of  the

Design Registry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill reflects many key provisions in other

Intellectual  Property legislation.  Let  me  mention  a  few

areas.   The  rights that the design registrant enjoys  under

the new Bill are similar to the rights enjoyed under other IP

legislation.   These are that he has the exclusive  right  to

make  or import into Singapore for commercial purposes,  sell

or hire, articles to which his design or any design, which is

substantially  similar  to  his  design,  has  been  applied.

Infringement of this right gives him recourse to injunctions,

damages or account of profit, order for delivery up and order

for disposal of infringing articles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defences available to an alleged infringer are also

similar to those available under other IP legislation.  It is

not an infringement if an act is done for private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

non-commercial  purposes,  or  if  a  design  is   used   for

evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government uses provisions that are similar to those

in  the  Patents  Act.  The Government may use  a  registered

design  for  the security and defence of Singapore,  for  the

implementation of civil defence measures in the  event  of  a

state of emergency or civil defence emergency and public non-commercial purposes.  Such use is ordinarily subject to terms

agreed  with  the  registered  owner,  including  payment  of

compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequential amendments will be made to the

Copyright  Act. Presently, designs which do not  qualify  for

registration  under  the  Registered  Designs  Act  may  seek

protection  under  Copyright law.  Up to  now,  they  may  be

protected under section 70 of the Copyright Act for 15 years.

This  protection has been removed as there has been  feedback

from  the related industries that there is no need to protect

such  designs. These are usually designs for spare  parts  of

articles.   This  position is similar to the  United  Kingdom

where there is no protection for such designs.  Consequential

amendments  will also be made to section 74 of the  Copyright

Act  to reflect the new reduced term of protection under  the

new Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, transitional provisions have been put in place

to  ensure  that  design  owners who had  obtained,  or  were

awaiting  registrations in the United Kingdom prior  to  this

Act  coming  into  force  will, under  the  new  legislation,

continue  to enjoy their existing rights.  For example,  even

though  the term of protection is being shortened, this  will

not  affect  the owners of designs registered in the  UK  who

will continue to enjoy 25 years protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2000 seeks to give

legislative effect to the income tax changes announced in the 2000

Budget  Statement. It  also  incorporates  six  other

amendments to the Income Tax Act.

<br><br><i>Tax Changes Announced in the 2000 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first begin with the tax changes announced in the 2000

Budget  Statement.  There are  a  total  of  seven  tax

changes  which require amending the Act.  I will  start  with

the tax changes affecting individual taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government gave a one-off tax rebate to

help  mitigate  the  impact of the  recession.   As  economic

recovery  is well underway this year, Dr Richard Hu announced

a one-off, across-the-board rebate of 5 percent on individual

income  tax for Year of Assessment 2000. Clause 24  provides

for the rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide greater recognition to those who stay with

their  parents, the relief for the maintenance of  each  aged

parent  will  be  raised by $500 to $5,000.   For  those  who

maintain  their aged parents but do not stay with  them,  the

relief  will  remain at $3,500.  The change will take  effect

from  the  Year of Assessment 2000.  Clause 10(a) amends  the

relevant section of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from providing for their own financial security,

individuals currently enjoy a tax relief for cash top-ups  to

the  Minimum Sum Account of their parents.  To promote inter-generational  ties and the concept of extended  families,  Dr

Richard Hu had announced that this relief will also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>

cover top-ups in cash for grandparents with effect from  Year

of  Assessment 2001. Clauses 10(b), 10(c) and 10(d) amend the

relevant section of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on the Income Tax amendments to

encourage  innovation, creativity and enterprise.  Currently,

authors,  composers and inventors can avail themselves  of  a

tax  incentive which limits their taxable royalty  income  to

10%   of   gross   royalties  received.   To  encourage   the

development  of  the arts and innovation in  Singapore,  this

scheme is now being liberalised accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Concession for authors, composers and

choreographers

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will be extended to include royalty

payments received by a composer, an author or a choreographer

from  music  recording  or film, dance  or  drama  production

businesses  in Singapore with effect from Year of  Assessment

2001.  Clause 2(a) amends the relevant section of the Act for

this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Concession for Inventors and Innovators

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from Year of Assessment 2001, this

concession  will be extended to cover any approved  invention

or innovation from the non-manufacturing sectors.  The scheme

will  also  be  extended to foreigners. To  qualify  for  the

concession,   the  work  in  developing  the   invention   or

innovation must be substantially carried out in Singapore and

the   invention  or  innovation  must  be  protectable.   The

Economic Development Board will administer the incentive.   A

qualifying individual will enjoy the concession for up  to  5

years.   Clauses 2(b) and 2(c) amend the relevant section  of

the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent announcement on 22nd May 2000, Dr Richard

Hu  introduced the new Entrepreneurial Employee Stock  Option

Scheme.   This  new scheme aims to foster an  entrepreneurial

spirit in the smaller and more risky companies and its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>

employees,  many of whom have forgone more secure and  higher

paying jobs to start or join these start-up companies.  Under

the  Entrepreneurial  Employee Stock  Option  Scheme,  a  50%

income  tax  exemption will be granted on gains arising  from

the  exercise of employee stock options, subject  to  certain

conditions.  The 50% tax exemption is available for 10  years

of  assessment  and for up to $10 million of  gains  derived.

This enhanced tax treatment will apply to qualifying employee

stock  options granted on or after 1st June 2000.   Clause  5

inserts a new section to the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to two tax changes affecting the

corporate sector.  To encourage the development of  the  swap

market  here, the concessionary 10% tax rate will be extended

to  income derived by financial institutions from trading  in

interest rate and currency swaps.  This concession will  take

effect from Year of Assessment 2001 and will apply until 27th

February 2003.  Clause 14 amends the relevant section of  the

Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu had also announced in the Budget the

reduction  of  the corporate tax rate by 0.5% to  25.5%  with

effect   from  Year  of  Assessment  2001.   The  tax   rates

applicable to other persons which are pegged to the corporate

tax  rate will correspondingly be reduced to 25.5%.   Clauses

9,  11, 12, 15(a), 15(c), 16, 17 and 18(a) amend the relevant

sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the 2000 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other tax changes not announced

in the 2000 Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to the Qualified Employee

Stock Option Plan Scheme which was announced in October  last

year.   Under the scheme, the payment of tax on gains arising

from certain qualifying stock options can be deferred for up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>

to five years, subject to an interest charge.  The Income Tax

Act  is thus amended to empower the Comptroller of Income Tax

to  extend  the  time for payment of tax on  such  gains  and

impose  interest for the deferment of tax payment under  this

Scheme.   Clauses  19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 amend  the  relevant

sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change pertains to share buyback through

Special  Trading Counters (STC) established on the  Singapore

Exchange.   The  Income Tax Act is amended  to  deem  certain

payment  made  by  a  company resident in  Singapore  to  its

shareholders, pursuant to a share buyback through an STC,  to

be  a  payment  of  dividend by the company and,  in  certain

circumstances,   to  be  a  receipt  of  dividends   by   its

shareholders.  Clauses 3, 15(b) and 18(b) amend the  relevant

sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Budget, Dr Richard Hu announced a temporary

suspension  of the annual limits on tax deduction for  banks'

general  provisions of 25% of qualifying profits and 0.5%  of

qualifying  loans and investments for a period of  two  years

(Year  of  Assessment  1998  and Year  of  Assessment  1999).

Clause  7 amends the relevant section of the Act to reinstate

these annual limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change amends the Act to enable certain

diesel  driven  vehicles  which  are  affected  by  the  Land

Transport  Authority's goods vehicle classification  exercise

to  qualify  for the one year accelerated capital  allowance.

Clause  8  amends the relevant section of the  Act  for  this

purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st December 1999, the Stock Exchange of Singapore

and  SIMEX were demutualised and became subsidiaries of a new

holding company known as the Singapore Exchange.  The  Income

Tax  Act is amended to reflect the change of name from  SIMEX

to  Singapore  Exchange  Derivatives  Trading  Limited.   The

existing tax exemption on certain income of the company  will

continue until 31st December 2003.  The Act is also amended

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>

to  allow tax exemption of dividends paid out of these exempt

profits  of  the company, subject to certain conditions.   In

addition,   the  restructuring  will  not  affect   the   10%

concessionary  rate  of  tax  applicable  to  certain  income

derived  by  any  company which was a member  of  the  former

SIMEX.   Clauses 4, 5 and 13 amend the relevant  sections  of

the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last tax change pertains to the tax

treatment  of  CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) investments.   A

CPF  member  may  use CPF savings to purchase  units  in  any

approved  CPF  unit trust.  Currently, certain  interest  and

foreign dividends distributed by such CPF unit trust are tax-exempt.  However, once the units purchased by the CPF  member

are  transferred to him when he is entitled to  withdraw  his

CPF   moneys,  his  investment  in  those  units  should   be

considered  as not falling within the CPF Investment  Scheme.

Any income arising henceforth from such investment should  be

subject to the normal tax treatment.  Clause 2(d) amends  the

relevant section of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support this Bill.  In fact, the amendments have been

debated   previously   and  quite   thoroughly   during   the

Government's  2000 Budget session.  Similarly,  the  proposed

Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme was also debated

previously  in  this House when Dr Richard Hu  announced  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to take this opportunity to raise a

query  on  the Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option  Scheme.

In  clause  13J  (4)  of the Bill, it is  specified  that  to

qualify for the tax benefit, both the company and the holding

company  have  to be incorporated in Singapore.   I  wish  to

point  out that this rule of both the company and the holding

company having to be incorporated in Singapore will mean that

several Singaporeans or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>

residents   who  are  working  in  companies  whose   holding

companies are not incorporated in Singapore will be  excluded

from  this scheme and therefore unable to enjoy this benefit.

There  are also several high tech companies which could  have

their parent companies incorporated overseas, eg, foreign  US

companies  setting up a base here.  And because they  may  be

offered stock options of their parent companies' stocks which

could eventually be listed on the NASDAQ, therefore they  are

unable  to  enjoy this benefit when the company gets  listed.

However,  these  foreign companies setting up  operations  in

Singapore actually will create employment and other  benefits

to  us.   They  will  also  add  to  the  overall  high  tech

innovative and creative environment that the Government wants

to  create.  Hence, I would like to ask the Minister  whether

we  should  consider  how to incorporate  amendments  to  the

scheme,  whereby persons working in foreign holding companies

of local companies can also enjoy this benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  support the Income  Tax  (Amendment)  Bill

introduced by the Finance Minister to give legislative effect

to  some  of  the  tax reduction measures announced  in  this

year's  Budget  Statement.  This includes reducing  corporate

tax  by  0.5%  to 25.5% with effect from Year  of  Assessment

2001.   The reduction of corporate tax is mainly to  maintain

our  competitiveness and to attract foreign investment.  This

is a policy of great urgency.  Yet the Government is delaying

until  the next fiscal year to implement it.  People  in  the

business  community  are  not happy because  they  could  not

derive any immediate benefit for this reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the statistics recently released by the Government

through  the media, the total tax revenue for the first  half

of  this year was as much as $15.5 billion, an increase of $3

billion or 24% compared to last year.  This is the result  of

the  economic  recovery and also the contributions  from  the

enterprises  and the people through payment  of  the  various

taxes.  This very substantial tax revenue is taken from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>

society.  It should be used on society.  As such, I  am  very

happy  with Prime Minister Goh's announcement at the National

Day  Rally that the Government has proposed a package of $3.2

billion  to  implement  a  series  of  measures  relating  to

education, training, baby bonus, elderly fund and the CPF top-ups,  etc,  to  develop Singapore into a  more  cohesive  and

competitive  nation,  and to help our people  deal  with  the

challenges in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From PM Goh's speech and the policies announced, we can

see  the  Government's strong confidence  in  the  future  of

Singapore,  and its compassion and willingness  to  help  the

lower-income group and the elderly people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Government's policy of high salaries to

attract  the  talented and hefty remuneration to  retain  the

able,  we  are  pleased to learn of PM Goh's circumspect  and

farsighted views.  I hope that the Government will  encourage

people  to continue thinking and deliberating on this  matter

and  to propose constructive suggestions, so that people from

all  walks of life will actively participate in this exercise

and to derive benefits from there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is also very optimistic

about  the  economic performance of Singapore in  the  second

half  of  this year.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry  has

adjusted the growth rate forecast upwards from 7.5% to  8.5%.

This  shows  that the Government would have more tax  revenue

and  considerable  budget surplus to  implement  the  various

proposed policies and projects, unlike in the private  sector

where  people  are for lack of funds less daring  to  venture

into new investment items.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking from another angle, has the Government

become  complacent?  Is the Government too persistent in  its

tax  policies and unwilling to reduce corporate tax,  foreign

workers'  levy,  vehicle taxes, property tax  and  the  other

taxes which affect our business costs?  As the Prime

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>

Minister  said,  we  are running into the  risk  of  being  a

complacent  "incumbent".  Because of our past  successes,  we

may  dangerously hope that the past formula will continue  to

work  for us in the future.  I hope that the Finance Minister

and  the  elite  in  IRAS will heed PM's valuable  advice  to

reform  our  tax system in a more innovative and  enlightened

attitude  and be in consultation with the business community,

and  try  their  best  to  lighten  the  tax  burden  of  the

enterprises,  big  or small, so that  they  could  accumulate

adequate   capital  to  venture  into  high-risk   innovative

businesses or long-term large-scale investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all along, Singapore has been labelled a "shoppers'

paradise".   This is mainly because Singapore is a  duty-free

zone.   If  we  can  go one step further to adopt  a  low-tax

strategy  in developing Singapore into a "business paradise",

then  we will instill more confidence in our people to  start

and  develop their business and be better placed  to  attract

foreign talents and capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Government's explanation, Government's

implementation of the policy of high salaries for the able is

for  the sake of Singapore's future, mainly to attract enough

talents  to  go  into  politics and to be  senior  Government

officials.   This policy has great impact on the enterprises.

This  is something that we cannot overlook.   Generally,  the

people's  response to this policy is that before  they  could

see  benefit  coming from it, the adverse effect  is  already

felt.  From the experience that we have learnt from the Asian

financial policy, we greatly appreciate the importance of our

cost  competitiveness as a basic ingredient to  the  survival

and development of our businesses.  We were able to tide over

the  Asian  financial crisis simply because we were  able  to

implement  the cost-cutting package effectively in  the  true

spirit  of tripartism.  The most effective part of the  cost-cutting   package   is   the  cut  in  the   employers'   CPF

contributions  and  the  employees'  wages.   These  measures

produced almost immediate effects in reducing the pressure of

wage-increases and retrenchment.  However,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>

with  the recent announcement of hefty pay rise for Ministers

and  senior civil servants and the rush of various Government

departments   to   increase   their   staff   salaries,   the

enterprises,  especially the SMEs are once again  faced  with

the  strong  pressure to raise the wages for  their  workers.

This   is  even  more  severe  than  the  pre-crisis   level.

Moreover,   Government  has  already   announced   the   part

restoration of employers' CPF contributions early next  year.

This has caused anxiety and worry to many businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest worry among our businessmen is that the

Government  will  raise its various taxes to  pay  for  these

hefty  increases in salaries.  This will result in a  vicious

cycle of increasing business cost, thereby causing an erosion

in our regional competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not take appropriate preventive measures, this

will  result  in the loss of confidence among  our  potential

investors, much to our detriment.  Just not too long  ago,  a

reputable   international  shipping  company  relocated   its

operational base to a neighbouring country in order  to  save

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, once again, I would urge the Government to

take  into  consideration  the huge  pressure  faced  by  the

enterprises in terms of wages and business cost, and try  its

best  to  reduce the rates of the various existing  business-related  taxes,  and provide more incentives  to  assist  the

development of SMEs so that the business community can  share

the  fruits of the economic recovery together with the  civil

servants and employees in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would also urge the Government to

consider   exempting   non-profit   making   industrial   and

commercial associations,  clan associations and other  ethnic

and  religious bodies from the payment of income tax.   These

civic  organisations can be said to be strong pillars of  our

social  development.  They not only cater for  the  needs  of

their  respective members but also assist the  Government  in

developing Singapore into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>

a  stable,  prosperous and cohesive society.  Exemption  from

the  payment  of  income  tax  will  surely  encourage  these

organisations to work harder to raise funds and to accumulate

more capital to implement longer term development and welfare

scheme to make further contributions to Singapore's community

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank

the two Members for their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in response to Mr Leong's query, Dr Richard Hu

explained    this   previously   when   we   discussed    the

Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme.  Basically,  we

are  putting  this scheme in place not just  to  benefit  the

individual  but also to anchor the activities  in  Singapore.

Therefore,  to  qualify  for the  scheme,  the  company  must

demonstrate   that  substantial  activities   are   done   in

Singapore.   Dr  Richard Hu explained then that  we  want  to

start  off by having both companies and the holding companies

incorporated in Singapore and then they automatically qualify

for  the  ESOP.  However, if they can demonstrate  that  even

though  they are not incorporated in Singapore and that  they

have  substantial activities in Singapore, Dr Richard Hu said

that  he  was  prepared to consider this  on  a  case-by-case

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank Mr Tay Beng Chuan for his

views.  This is an early start to next year's budget. I  will

convey  his  views  to  the Ministry  of  Finance  for  their

evaluation  for the next budget, but let me just  respond  in

general terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the tax burden in Singapore is not onerous. The

tax incidence is actually quite light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to balance business cost versus a fair

and competitive remuneration to our workers.  Although we  do

appreciate  the business community's concern about  cost,  we

must   also   ensure  that  there  is  fair  and  competitive

remuneration to our workers.  Therefore, the whole idea is to

strike this balance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I would like to assure Mr Tay that the Government

will  not  have to impose tax increases to pay for  the  wage

rise for the civil service.  This is well within our budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that we are not complacent. We

are  looking at the overall tax regime in Singapore.  We know

we  have to be competitive.  But at the same time, we have to

distinguish the two trends that we are facing.   One  is  the

cyclical trend.  Because the economy is doing well, one would

expect the tax collection to increase during this cycle.  The

second  is  the  structural trend.  We know that  because  of

globalisation,  competition,  and  changes  in  the  economy,

certain  tax collections would change over time.   Therefore,

we  must  be prepared for it.  Similarly, Singapore's society

is also undergoing restructuring.  We will need to spend more

not just on education but on life-long learning.  We need  to

spend more on health and many other competing demands.  So we

need to balance our tax collections with our tax expenditure.

But  as  I  said,  this is still early days before  the  next

budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before the House seeks to revise and

strengthen the law in respect of building control by:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) strengthening the system of accredited checkers in

their role in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>

checking  structural plans submitted to the  Commissioner  of

Building Control;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) imposing, on the appropriate qualified person, a

duty  to  ensure that the structure of a building is designed

according to prescribed requirements; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) clarifying the intended role of site supervisors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, following the collapse of the roof of

the  uncompleted Compassvale Primary School hall in June last

year, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) conducted

a  review  of  its  accredited checkers  system.  The  system

requires all structural plans and calculations to be  checked

by   an  independent  accredited  checker  before  they   are

submitted  to  BCA  for  approval.  BCA  also  examined   the

provisions  of  the  Building Control Act to  evaluate  their

adequacy in ensuring that our buildings are designed to  safe

standards  and  that  these  plans  are  checked.  The   main

provisions of this Bill arose from the review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now explain the proposed amendments in

detail.

<br><br><i>Strengthening the Accredited Checkers System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accredited checkers system was introduced into the

Building  Control  Act in 1989, following the  Commission  of

Inquiry on the collapse of the Hotel New World.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission had recommended that there should be a

mandatory  requirement  to  check the  structural  plans  and

design  of  a building, so as to minimise the risk of  errors

arising from lapses on the part of the designer. A system  of

independent checks by an accredited checker was put in  place

since then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its review, the BCA concluded that the current system

of  accredited checkers remains valid and is an efficient and

cost-effective  way to achieve an independent  check  on  the

building  design. However, the BCA highlighted two  areas  in

the present system which should be strengthened.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will elaborate on these areas.

<br><br><i>Resources of the Accredited Checker</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, an accredited checker can check any project,

regardless  of  its  size and complexity and  the  amount  of

technical  supporting resources that he has.  BCA's  view  is

that  an  accredited checker taking on a  large  and  complex

building  project  should  have  more  specialised  technical

support staff and resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill addresses this issue by requiring

an  accredited  checker  undertaking  large  projects  to  be

registered  and  to  operate within  an  accredited  checking

organisation  that has certain resources as required  by  the

Commissioner  of Building Control. The requirements  will  be

prescribed  in the Regulations.  These include minimum  staff

strength, amount of professional liability insurance  and  an

ISO  certification.  Only accredited  checking  organisations

will  be  allowed to check plans of building  works  above  a

prescribed  value. The value is set at $10 million  initially

but it may be adjusted from time to time to allow for changes

in  construction  cost. Individual accredited  checkers  will

only  be  allowed to check building works below  this  value.

They  will  be required to be covered by a minimum amount  of

professional liability insurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance is intended to provide for financial

claims  made by the public who may suffer personal injury  or

loss caused by the negligence of the accredited checker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise that the accredited

checker  is still personally responsible for the checking  of

plans   and   design   calculations,  whether   he   operates

individually  or within an accredited checking  organisation.

He cannot delegate this responsibility to his assistants.

<br><br><i>Review of the Accredited Checker's performance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that should be strengthened relates to the

need for a regular review of the performance of an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>

accredited   checker.   Under   the   present   system,   the

registration  of  an accredited checker is  valid  for  life,

unless  he breaches his duty. There is no provision to review

his performance regularly after his registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amended section 16 and new section 16A will

require   the  accredited  checker  or  accredited   checking

organisation  to  renew their registration periodically.  The

registration will be valid for one year, but this period  can

be  reviewed  in  the  future if some other  time  frame  for

renewal is deemed more suitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows the Commissioner of Building

Control  to  suspend  or  cancel  the  registration   of   an

accredited   checker  or  accredited  checking  organisation.

These  offences could include situations where the accredited

checker  has been censured, fined, suspended or de-registered

by  the Professional Engineers Board, where he has failed  to

meet  the prescribed requirements for registration and  where

his  performance failed to meet the standards  prescribed  in

the   Regulations.  During  the  period  of  suspension,  the

accredited  checker or organisation will not  be  allowed  to

practise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections 16A, 16B, 16C and 18A extend the

existing  provisions  relating to the  individual  accredited

checker  to  the  accredited  checking  organisations.  These

provisions include the registration procedures, suspension or

cancellation  of  registration procedures,  the  avenues  for

appeals  against  decisions  taken  by  the  Commissioner  of

Building Control and the requirement to maintain professional

and  financial  independence  in  the  building  works  being

checked.

<br><br><i>Exemption of Government buildings</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 18B allows the Minister to exempt

buildings  and  building  works carried  out  by  the  public

authorities   from  certain  requirements  of   the   revised

accredited  checkers  system.  With  the  exemption,   public

authorities with the necessary qualified accredited  checkers

in-house need not appoint an accredited

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>

checking organisation for building works above the prescribed

value.   These in-house accredited checkers will also not  be

subjected  to  the  requirement of  checking  only  plans  of

building works below the prescribed value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, the accredited

checking  organisation  is  introduced  to  ensure  that  the

accredited  checker  has adequate and appropriate  staff  and

resources.    Public  authorities  like   the   Housing   and

Development  Board  and the Land Transport Authority  already

have  the professional support staff and resources, and  good

internal  control and disciplinary measures  to  ensure  that

their in-house accredited checkers carry out proper checks on

designs.  However, if the public authorities appoint external

accredited  checkers, they will be subjected to the  relevant

provisions in the Bill.

<br><br><i>Design Duty of the Qualified Persons</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the accredited checker, it is also very

important  that  the  qualified person be  appraised  of  his

duties  and  responsibilities under the Building Control  Act

and   its  Regulations,  and  carry  out  such  duties   with

professionalism and due diligence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the maximum penalty for a design offence

committed by the qualified person is a fine of not more  than

$5,000 or an imprisonment of not more than six months or both

under the Building Control Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, an accredited checker who fails to

detect the same design offence will face a penalty of  up  to

$50,000  in  fines  (10 times the amount  for  the  qualified

person) or an imprisonment of not more than one year or  both

under  the  Building  Control Act.   The  difference  in  the

penalties  suggests that, in the design of  a  building,  the

accredited checker carries a much heavier responsibility than

that of the qualified person.  This clearly cannot be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the qualified person must carry the

primary responsibility of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

ensuring the integrity of his design, as he is the one  doing

the design in the first place.  He must not be lulled into  a

false  sense of complacency that the accredited checker  will

be there to spot his mistakes, and therefore there is no need

for  him  to  check his own work for errors.   The  qualified

person  must exercise due diligence in ensuring the integrity

of  his work.  The accredited checker only acts as the  final

mechanism  in  the system to check and detect any  lapses  in

design.   Ideally,  if  the qualified  person  exercises  due

diligence  in his design, the accredited checker  should  not

detect any design faults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 9 of the Act therefore seeks to

make clear the importance of the role of the qualified person

in  his  design duties.  It proposes to impose a duty on  the

qualified  person to take reasonable steps and  exercise  due

diligence  in  ensuring  that  the  structural  design  of  a

building  meets  the  specified  requirements.   The  maximum

penalty for a breach of this duty is a fine of up to $100,000

or  an imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both.  This is

more  severe  than  the maximum penalty that  the  accredited

checker  could  face  in order to reflect  that  the  primary

responsibility  of  the  building  design  rests   with   the

qualified person.

<br><br><i>Site Supervisors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn now to the amendments in this

Bill  that  concern site supervisors.  Site supervisors  were

introduced  into the Building Control Act when it  was  first

enacted  in 1989.  The intention was, and still is,  for  the

site  supervisor  to  assist  the  qualified  person  in  his

supervisory duties of construction work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current section 8 of the Building Control Act

stipulates  that construction works can only be  carried  out

under   the  full-time  supervision  of  a  site  supervisor.

However,   there  has  been  some  misconception  that   site

supervisors can work independently of the qualified person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill seeks to eliminate this ambiguity

by making it clear in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>

section  8  of  the Act that construction  works  are  to  be

supervised  by  the  qualified person, or a  site  supervisor

appointed  by  the  qualified person and  working  under  the

qualified person's control and supervision.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the amendments to the Building

Control  Act in this Bill will strengthen the legislation  on

the structural safety of buildings in Singapore.  It will re-emphasize  the  proper  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the

various professionals involved in the design and checking  of

buildings.    Finally,  it  will  ensure  that  the   highest

standards  are  observed  by all  who  are  involved  in  the

building and construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Building Control (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse of the roof at Compassvale School last year

was  a  shock  to  many of us, as we are  known  to  be  very

stringent  in our building control and regulations.   In  the

aftermath of the incident, we have been told that  it  was  a

result  of  human  error: firstly, the design  error  of  the

professional  engineer;  and secondly,  the  failure  of  the

accredited checker to spot the error.  We are told that  this

is  the current system and that this system of the accredited

checker checking on the work of the professional engineer  is

sufficiently stringent.  I can agree with that.  What we need

are  competent and diligent professionals who take their jobs

seriously  and not by adding another layer of  checkers.   In

principle,  therefore, I support what the Bill proposes,  and

that  is to ensure that professional engineers and accredited

checkers  exercise due diligence in their design and checking

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the measure to require accredited checkers to renew

their registration annually or after any period prescribed by

the Minister, I think there is a need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>

to balance the desire of control over administrative cost and

convenience.   The  present registration  of  the  accredited

checker  is  for life.  This new measure is a drastic  change

and  I  am  not sure whether it is entirely necessary,  given

that  the  Minister today already has the power to deregister

any  errant accredited checker at any time.  I think  renewal

of  registration for everyone in three to five years  may  be

more  appropriate and reasonable.  Using the  same  argument,

for  example,  what  about  doctors  and  lawyers  and  other

professionals?   Do we need to require them  to  renew  their

registration  simply because one or two of  their  kind  have

been   negligent?   Can  the  Minister  tell  us   how   much

administrative  cost  would  be involved  in  requiring  such

renewals on a yearly basis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new provisions allow individual accredited

checkers  to  check  building works below $10  million  only.

Checking  of  plans of building works above $10  million  can

only  be  given  to accredited checking organisations.   This

assumes  that the organisations would have more resources  to

do  higher  value  added work.  This new  requirement  is  of

concern  to the individual accredited checkers, as  it  would

reduce  their  business to some extent.  My question  to  the

Minister is whether individual accredited checkers have  been

found  to  be  less  able  to  handle  bigger  projects  than

organisations.   For  example, when we  see  a  doctor  or  a

lawyer,  we  seldom ask how many partners or directors  there

are in the company.  We base our decision on the professional

reputation of that person whom we are employing or seeing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this amendment Bill, the maximum penalty for the

qualified  person  for breach of duty has  been  raised  from

$50,000  and/or  a  jail  term not  exceeding  12  months  to

$100,000.   This is double the maximum penalty for breach  of

duty  by the accredited checker, and this is meant to reflect

that the primary responsibility of building designs lies with

the  qualified  person  and not the accredited  checker.   In

principle,  I can understand the rationale for  this.   I  am

told  by  the professionals in this industry that  this  Bill

does not give

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>

recognition  to  the  fact that contractors  should  be  held

equally  responsible.   The  QP  or  designer  can  only   be

responsible  for  the  design.   The  contractors  should  be

responsible  for the construction.  Proper structural  design

and  proper  construction are both necessary ingredients  for

the safety of the building.  This is especially important for

the  design-and-build projects where the contractors take the

lead   in  a  construction  team  which  even  includes   the

appointment  of  a  QP and the payment  of  his  fees.   This

amendment Bill does not seem to address this concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate but related matter, there is concern from

professionals  in the construction and building  sector  that

the  public sector is relying too much on competitive bidding

or lower pricing to select professionals for Government jobs.

This  method  may level down the industry and  contribute  to

shoddy  work.   The  local professionals would  like  to  see

selection based more on quality of work and design.  I  would

appreciate it if the Minister can comment on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

raise  the  following concerns which the proposed  amendments

would  affect  the construction industry and  eventually  the

general public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the proposed amendments seek to fine-tune

the  Accredited Checker Scheme and increase the  penalty  for

breach of duty by the accredited checker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of accredited checker was introduced after

the collapse of Hotel New World in 1986 and now, we are again

amending  the  Building Control Act due to  the  collapse  of

Compassvale  Primary  School.  It  seems  like  the  proposed

amendment  is a reactive rather than a holistic  approach  to

improve  the  safety  of  building  works.   May  I  ask  the

Minister, by amending the Act, how can we assure the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>

general  public that our buildings are safe and  structurally

sound?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is probably one of the very few countries in

the  world  that  implements the accredited  checking  system

whereby it is mandatory for an accredited checker, who  is  a

professional   engineer,  to  check  the  work   of   another

professional   engineer.   Obviously,  this   double-checking

system  results  in unnecessary duplication  of  professional

work,  contributing to construction productivity  losses  and

manpower wastages in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that the structural soundness of

buildings concerns public safety, hence the need for  double-checking.  But this approach may not effectively enhance  the

safety  standards  and professionalism  in  the  construction

industry.  Sir, we need to examine the root cause leading  to

the design of structurally unsound buildings.  If the problem

lies  in  the  lack of competence of professional  engineers,

then we should address the issue of increasing the stringency

of  laws governing the registration of engineers or reviewing

the professional training of engineers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the accredited checker and professional engineer

are  registered  under the same Professional  Engineers  Act.

So,  why not put the professional engineer solely responsible

for  his  own actions?  Raising the registration requirements

and   imposing  penalty  for  malpractice  to  ensure  higher

standards of professional practice could achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if the root cause of designing structurally

unsound  buildings  lies  in  the  quality  of  training  and

registration  system of professional engineers in  Singapore,

then  how  does the "double checking" system ensure that  the

accredited  checker will not commit the same mistake  as  the

professional engineer?  This is exactly what happened in  the

Compassvale School's roof collapse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry to explore other

options   which   will   instill   professionalism   in   the

construction

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>

industry.   We  need  to have a system whereby  professionals

take responsibility for their professional work, and face the

consequences  for failing to perform their work  competently.

A  system  that instills professionalism (ie, one  who  takes

responsibility for his own actions) will go a longer way than

a  system that creates mistrust (ie, one who doubts  his  own

standard  of work) and distrust (ie, one professional  having

to check on another professional's standard of work).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the accredited checker scheme needs to be

reviewed, as it may not provide a holistic solution to having

structurally sound buildings in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, construction practitioners have raised

concerns that the accredited checker system has increased the

cost   of  construction,  and  also  caused  a  shortage   of

professional engineers in Singapore.  The increased  cost  of

construction   is   eventually   transferred   to    property

purchasers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now request for some clarifications on a few

amended clauses in the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sections 8(1) and 10 insert the words "the

appropriate  qualified person".  May I ask the  Minister:  is

the  word  "appropriate" necessary?   If  yes,  what  is  the

distinction between an "appropriate qualified person"  and  a

"qualified person"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 16 sets the prescribed limit to be $10

million  for  building works that require the appointment  of

accredited checking organisation.  May I ask the Minister  on

what  basis is this limit derived?  Why is there  a  need  to

prescribe  a  limit for an accredited organisation  to  check

only buildings of a certain value if safety of the public  is

at risk?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, new section 16 also defines the "value of

building works" which means the total cost to be expended  in

carrying  out  the  building  works  (including  foundations,

structural  frame,  finishes and installation  of  services).

However, we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>

left  out  "walls  and slabs" as part of building  works.   I

propose that we insert the words "walls and slabs" after  the

words "structural frame".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I welcome this

Amendment  Bill  to the Building Control  Act.   We  must  do

everything  we  can  to  ensure the  safety  of  construction

workers.   It is too often, in the past years, that  whenever

we  opened the morning paper, we read that some accident  had

happened at a local construction site.  If that type of  news

is  allowed to continue, very soon Singaporeans will begin to

feel  that  it is another piece of news.  We become  used  to

that kind of news.  We become callous and unfeeling.  But, in

actual  fact,  lives are lost every time a  serious  accident

takes  place  at a construction site.  Those  who  have  lost

their  lives are human beings and they are also the  husbands

or  fathers or sons of some foreigners.  We must be  made  to

realise  that  the  loss  of lives of foreign  workers  means

sadness  and  hardship  inflicted on  their  loved  ones  and

relatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that developed countries, like Australia,

take  the  loss of life in the building site very  seriously.

That  was  one  of the reasons cited why units in  high  rise

flats  in  the inner city area in Australia are so  expensive

when  compared  to  landed properties in  the  suburbs.   The

developers  have to spend extra costs on safety  measures  to

make  sure  that no accident happens.  And if it  so  happens

that  one accident takes place, the whole building works have

to  be  stopped.  The investigation that follows is  normally

prolonged  and it takes weeks to complete.  That  would  cost

the  developers a lot of money for the stoppage.   Developers

in  Australia therefore prefer to spend more money on  safety

measures  rather than suffer long stoppages when an  accident

occurs.   Also, if an accident does happen at the  site,  the

developer shall get into the bad books of the authorities and

future applications to the authorities may be difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government is taking industrial

accidents at building sites very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>

seriously  and has put more stringent checks on the  detailed

structural  plans and design calculations of building  works.

When  we think of the need to check detailed structural plans

and  design  calculations of building works, the disaster  at

Compassvale School quickly comes to mind.  In that  accident,

Sir,  as  cited by the other two speakers, the roof collapsed

and seven workers were killed and others injured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that accident may have been prevented if this

Amendment Bill has been passed earlier before the Compassvale

School was built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the three

speakers for their support of the Bill, including Mr  Chiam's

support.   However,  I would just like to clarify  one  point

with  Mr Chiam and, that is, this Bill has nothing to do with

construction  site accidents.  Construction  site  safety  is

actually under the Factories Act which is administered  by  a

separate Ministry.  Although he supports the Bill, I think in

his speech he gave the wrong reasons for supporting the Bill.

I thought I should clarify this before we continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other two speakers. Mr Lew Syn

Pau  mentioned that the renewal of registration on an  annual

basis  may  be too onerous for the QPs and the  ACs.   I  did

mention in my Second Reading speech that we will review  this

renewal  period, and if it is most suitable to have a  longer

period,  we  will  amend  it.  If three  to  five  years  are

considered to be more reasonable, we will certainly amend it.

However,  just let me say that the requirement for having  an

annual review is to make sure that the qualified persons  are

aware  that they must be at their best professional behaviour

and  they  are  subject  to  a review.   Therefore,  in  this

process,  hopefully,  they  will be  able  to  exercise  even

greater  due diligence in their work.  Having said  that,  of

course, we will ensure that in the review process, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>

will make it as simple as possible in order to make sure that

the  administration  costs involved  are  kept  to  the  very

minimum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked why contractors are not responsible.

Indeed,  contractors are not responsible when you are talking

about  a building design.  Because in the construction  of  a

building, the contractor actually works under the supervision

of  a  qualified  person  (QP).  He  is  responsible  to  the

qualified  person.   If the qualified person  makes  a  wrong

design  and  the  contractor  carries  out  the  construction

according to that wrong design, then it is the QP who  is  at

fault,  and  not the contractor.  And if the QP's  design  is

correct,  then it is the job of the QP to make sure that  the

contractor  carries out his work according to that particular

design and according to proper construction methodology.   So

in  this particular amendment to the Bill, we are looking  at

making sure that the design in the first place is carried out

properly and, secondly, of course, make sure that there is  a

second  level check on that design.  This is in  response  to

his point about why the contractor is not responsible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that does not absolve the contractor if the

contractor  himself  is  guilty of contravening  any  of  the

construction  safety  regulations or construction  practices.

For  example, in the Compassvale incident, if I may  cite  an

incident,  the contractor was also fined because he  did  not

perform   certain  works  according  to  that   design.    So

specifically, he was fined for not doing work up to a certain

standard.   When  we  are talking about  the  design  of  the

building,  which is the subject of this particular amendment,

it  is  the qualified person, the design engineer as well  as

the  AC  who  should be made to exercise full  diligence  and

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew also asked whether the public sector bids which

are based on the lowest price would affect the quality of the

design.   If  I  may  explain the process for  public  sector

works,  the  public  sector contracts  are  awarded  only  to

contractors  which are pre-qualified.  They are  listed  with

the Building and Construction

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>

Authority (BCA), what is known as the "G" List, or Government

List.   The  Government registration system  is  incidentally

also used by the private sector but it is primarily a list of

contractors which are registered with the BCA and  from  this

list, public sector construction projects are tendered out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors which fall short of certain requirements,

which  fail to deliver the goods as it were, or which deliver

shoddy  goods or shoddy workmanship, will be delisted.   They

will  no longer be allowed to tender for Government projects.

So  it is in the interest of all the contractors to make sure

that they deliver a high standard of construction workmanship

and  that they do not tender frivolously for Government jobs.

Only  contractors with good track records are registered  and

the  list is updated every few years.  So in the first place,

we do have a pre-qualification system which would require the

G-registered  contractors to qualify to tender.   Contractors

are also regularly and vigorously screened.  The point I want

to  make really is that it is not just price alone.  There is

a  pre-qualification process which makes sure that there is a

certain minimum standard.  But having said all that, once you

are on the list, and once you are invited to tender, then  it

is  only  fair  that the tender price would  be  one  of  the

factors, if not the main factor, in deciding whether  tenders

are  awarded  or  not.  In the interest of  transparency  and

fairness,  this  must be so.  And there  are  only  very  few

exceptional  cases  where the tender is not  awarded  to  the

lowest  tenderer.  So it is not correct to say  that  tenders

are  based on the lowest price alone.  But it is also correct

to  say  that  if  they  meet the minimum  standard  of  pre-qualification, then price should be one of the most important

factors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, can I clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually I was

referring  to  professional  services,  like  engineers   and

architects, not the contractors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Similarly, for professional engineers

and  architects,  if they are registered  with  the  relevant

professional boards, then they would be qualified to  tender.

And when it comes to the awards, it is not a matter of price.

There  are  certain criteria for awarding these contracts  to

these professionals.  Price is one of the factors, but is not

the only factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered Mr Lew's questions. I turn now

to  the  questions posed by Dr Teo Ho Pin.  Dr Teo makes  the

general  point that the accredited checking system should  be

changed,  that  we should not have a second  level  of  check

because   it   would   then  distract  attention   from   the

responsibility  of the qualified person who,  in  this  case,

would be the structural engineer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes the point that professionals should take

responsibility for their work and I totally agree with him on

this.  But having said that, it would be irresponsible of  us

not  to,  in the light of experience, have a second level  of

check.   Singapore is not unique in this.  We are  unique  in

the sense that we have an AC system, a second person to check

the plans.  But we are not unique in having a second level of

check.  There are many countries which have a second level of

check.   The  only  difference is that this second  level  of

check is done by the building authorities.  So if we were  to

follow the system, for example, in Hong Kong and UK and  some

other  countries, we would have the Building and Construction

Authority (BCA) doing the check rather than an AC.  I do  not

think,  and  this  is the view of the Review Committee,  that

having  the BCA itself check is in any way superior to having

the  accredited checker do the checking.  In the light of the

Hotel  New World disaster and indeed, in a certain way  also,

because of the Compassvale incident, it is important  for  us

to look at the AC system, to see whether it is still relevant

and  the  recommendation and finding  is  that  it  is  still

relevant.  The  only point is that we need  to  refine  it  a

little  bit  more.  While I do agree with  Dr  Teo  that  the

professionals  must  take  primary responsibility  for  their

work, I must also add that it is incumbent upon the BCA whose

mission  is  to  make sure that buildings  in  Singapore  are

structurally  sound and properly designed not to  remove  the

second level of check.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked some specific questions about some

clauses  in the Bill.  He mentioned something about the  word

"appropriate"  in  new  section 10.  Basically,  what  he  is

asking  is  why  do  we  need to use the word  "appropriate".

Essentially,  when we use the words "qualified professionals"

in  the  Bill, we can either refer to the structural engineer

or,  in some cases, we can refer to the architect.  The  word

"appropriate"    really   allows   us   to    pinpoint    the

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of designs, we are looking at the structural

engineer who is the appropriate qualified person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we prescribe a limit of $10 million? In my

speech  I did allude to the fact that, in the case of  larger

jobs, it is deemed necessary for the Accredited Checker to be

able  to have access to more resources.  It is essentially  a

matter  of  how  much time you have available  and  how  many

assistants you have available to help you to do the checking.

Larger jobs require more checking.  It is as simple as  that.

As  to  whether  the limit should be set at $5  million,  $10

million or $20 million, BCA made an assessment of the  number

of jobs that are available in the marketplace. They feel that

$10  million is a fair limit as most of the jobs in town  are

below  $10 million.  So, they have set this as the prescribed

limit  in  the  first instance.  Again, as I have  indicated,

with experience, if we need to change that, we will do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on walls and slabs, I am not sure what exactly

Dr Teo means by this, but I will ask the BCA to look into it.

As  I  understand  it,  in  the relevant  section,  the  most

important point is that it is the total value of the building

works  that is relevant.  If the total value of the  building

works  exceeds  $10  million, then it cannot  be  handled  by

individuals.  If it is below, it can be done.  I presume that

walls  and  slabs will be included in the total cost  of  the

building.  I cannot imagine a building being put  up  without

walls and slabs!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON PARLIAMENT STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Parliament, noting the Report of the

Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc.  3

of  2000,  accepts the recommendations of the  Commission  as

contained  in paragraph 6 thereof and resolves in  accordance

with such recommendations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the announcement on 29th June 2000 in

this House of the revision of salaries in the public service,

a  Commission  consisting of the Speaker,  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  the  Minister for Finance,  the  Chairman  of  the

Public Service Commission and myself was set up in accordance

with Article 51(6) of the Constitution of Singapore to advise

on the application of the revised salaries and the payment of

Performance Bonus to the staff of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has presented its Report to Parliament on

19th  August  2000.   In line with the  announcement  on  the

Public  Sector  Salary Revision in Parliament  on  29th  June

2000,  staff in the Parliamentary Service and other posts  in

the  Parliament  Service, for example, the  Interpreters  and

Serjeant-at-Arms, will receive a salary revision of 3.8% plus

$50  and the base rate Performance Bonus (including those who

are  currently not receiving any Performance Bonus)  will  be

increased by 0.5 month with effect from this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the Parliamentary Service will also be

revised.   A new Upper Timescale Parliamentary Officer  Grade

IA has been introduced and for Parliamentary Officer Grade I,

there  will be two salary scales to account for the  creation

of the new Parliamentary Officer Grade IA.  Officers who were

promoted to Parliamentary Officer Grade I after January 2000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>

will  receive  the  revised salary scale  (Code  1697).   For

incumbents who were promoted before January 2000,  they  will

continue  to  be on their existing salary scale (Code  1360).

The  truncation involves a reduction of the maximum point  of

the  salary  scale  from  $6,785  to  $6,490.   The  existing

Parliamentary  Officer Grade IVA salary scale has  also  been

revised.  The revised structure of the Parliamentary  Service

is set out in paragraph 4 of the Commission's Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is asked to accept and approve the

recommendations of the Commission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the

Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc.  3

of  2000,  accepts the recommendations of the  Commission  as

contained  in paragraph 6 thereof and resolves in  accordance

with such recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its deep concern at the

widening  inequalities in our society and,  recognising  that

the   inequalities  may  lead  to  unrest,  calls  upon   the

Government immediately to put together a programme to  lessen

the inequalities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, through the media, completely

subservient to the ruling party  -  the Government  - a press

and  TV  which  see  their role simply as the  voice  of  the

Government, the Government has, over the years,  put  out  an

impression  that  Singapore  was an  affluent  society,  that

everything  was affordable, and people really had nothing  to

worry  about.   Because  of  the  media  serving  purely  the

Government,  this  impression  gained  acceptance  not   only

amongst  some people in Singapore but also outside Singapore.

But that only gave a picture of a part of the society, not of

the whole society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, because it could not be suppressed, there

were  peeks at the level of poverty in Singapore.   Sometimes

it surfaced that there were people who were living at extreme

poverty  level,  homeless, thrown out of HDB apartments,  but

they were soon forgotten, dismissed as isolated cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This claim of being an affluent society, of a society

where  everyone was able to afford not only the  basic  needs

but even the better things in life, defied the statistics  on

wage levels and other statistics that indicated the level  of

income  in Singapore.  But, nevertheless, the claim continued

to  be  made.   We  even had an officer from  the  Statistics

Department appearing before a Select Committee  -  I think it

was  in  1995 or 1996  -  claiming that the average household

income  in  Singapore was $3,500.  I drew attention  to  this

when  I  spoke  in  this House on 25th  August  1997  on  the

appointment of a parliamentary committee to review prices.  I

said  then  that  I had found it difficult to understand  the

statement  that the average household income was $3,500,  and

that  I  had  checked it with the officers of the  Statistics

Department  and  they had admitted to me that  that  was  not

quite  accurate, that for 50% of our population, the  average

household  income was well below $2,000.   In  fact,  if  one

looks at the figures, for 60%, it is well below $2,000.   And

yet  there  was  that  claim  made before  the  parliamentary

committee.  The Opposition, and particularly when I had tried

to bring up this question of poverty in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>

Singapore,  was  ridiculed and laughed at.  I  remember  that

when  I  was  in the House in the years 1981 to 1984,  I  was

berated  for  an  interview that I had  given  to  a  foreign

journalist that in an affluent society, there were still some

people who were starving.  But, as I said, I was not speaking

out  of turn.  And if one really looked at the statistics put

out  by  the Department of Statistics, one can see the extent

of poverty that exists in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I illustrate, Mr Speaker, Sir? In 1989 - 10 years

ago   -   there  were still 20,100 workers whose  wages  were

below $200 a month, and there were 74,300 workers whose wages

were  well  below  $400 a month, making  a  total  of  94,000

workers who were earning below $400 a month.  In 1999,   last

year  in  question, there were still 14,700  workers  earning

below $200 per month, and 33,700 earning below $400, making a

total of over 48,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that between 1998 and 1999, the

figures   in  these  two  categories  of  wage  earners   had

increased.   There  were more people in  1999  earning  below

$400,  as  against 1998.  So their incomes were  going  down.

There were more people earning below $400.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income gap after 1999 began to widen because the

salaries in the top sector were going up, whilst the  workers

remained  down  at the bottom.  So, we are  in  the  position

today of having a society where Ministers earn over a million

dollars  a  year.   I  see  in  the  last  sitting  of   this

Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister made a statement  about

the revisions.  I was not here then.  The salary of the Prime

Minister was given, after the revision, as nearly $2  million

annually.   No figures were given for the salaries that  were

to  be  paid  to  the Senior Minister and  the  Deputy  Prime

Ministers  after the revision was made.  The other  Ministers

would be paid, after the revision over $1 million annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not politics of envy, Mr Speaker, Sir. No doubt,

it  will  be  labelled as one.  But, seriously,  we  have  to

consider and ask

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>

ourselves a question: how is it that in a society the  lowest

employee gets below $200 a month and the Ministers earn  over

$1  million a year?  That is nearly $100,000 a month.  Are we

to  be  proud of that fact?  What does that say for ourselves

as  a  society?  Does it say that we are concerned  with  the

under-privileged, the people who do not have enough?  Or does

it  say  that we are a society that shows a callous disregard

for  those down below and allows those who are able to go  on

earning  more  and  more and more without  any  ceiling?   We

should  ask ourselves that question.  What does it say  about

Asian  values of which this Government makes a  lot.   Is  it

Asian  values  that  a  society  with  this  yawning  gap  is

acceptable?   I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is an  affront.

But  if it is argued that it is not contrary to Asian values,

then  let me say I do not think very much of Asian values  if

the Asian values can tolerate this great disparity in income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the present poverty line in Singapore? I would

commend  to  the Government that one of the immediate  things

they  should  do  is to set up a Commission to  inquire  into

poverty in Singapore, to admit truly and honestly that we  do

have  poverty  in  this society and that  the  Government  is

prepared to take it seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, can you allow the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I asked the question: what is the present

poverty  line?  I inquired from persons.  The first person  I

inquired  was a single person living on his own.  His  answer

was  that he needed about $1,000 a month to live in Singapore

to  pay for the rent, for all the other things that went with

a  basic  standard  of  living, not  a  living  that  affords

chocolates, perfumes and luxury items, but basic needs.  Then

I spoke to another man and he said he had only one child.  He

said  he needed at least $1,200 to $1,300 a month to maintain

the  wife and the child.  Finally, I spoke to someone who had

two  children.  His answer was, "Easily over $1,500.  I  need

at  least $1,600 or $1,700 a month."  Have we made any  study

of  the requirements in Singapore for a family of four, three

or even just one?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asking for a Commission to inquire into poverty in

Singapore.  I would suggest that we seek the help of somebody

from  the  United Nations Commission to come and help  us  to

make  a  scientific study.  They who know about  poverty  can

then  make  a  proper  study and show the comparison  between

Singapore  and other countries.  But we have got this  income

disparity  report.   I  was not surprised  when  I  saw  that

report, as we said in the press report that I made on  behalf

of  the party.  We knew all along that the people down  below

were suffering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this report now disclose? That for 30% of our

members in the society, the average household income is  just

over  $1,000  a  month.   30% is not to  be  laughed  at,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.  How do you expect them to survive?  When I say

"survive",  I mean a decent standard of living  on  $1,000  a

month,  when you consider that Singapore is one of  the  most

expensive places to live in.   This is even told to me, as  I

have  said time and time again, not by people from India  and

Malaysia,  but by people from the developed countries.   They

say  Singapore is very expensive.  If you set that  level  of

income  for  the  30%  against  those  in  the  top  earners,

Ministers  and  top civil servants, judges, I  say  it  is  a

national disgrace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last sitting, again when I was not here, I see

the Minister tried to minimise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>

the  report.   Of  course,  we  had  seen  that  earlier   by

Government officials trying to minimise the severity  of  the

report.  He is reported to have said that the poor are not as

badly  off  as  made  out to be.  I find  that  difficult  to

understand.   How  badly  must  they  be  before   they   are

recognised  as  being badly off?  Should  they  be  starving,

dying on the streets before the Government recognises that we

have  a  section of our people who are badly off?   This,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  a country which is by  no  means  a  poor

country.   We  boast, and again we make much of it,  that  we

have  built up foreign reserves to $128,457,000.  So  we  are

not a poor, struggling country that finds it difficult to see

that  its people can afford a basic decent standard of  life.

All  they need, as I have kept saying again and again,  is  a

political  will to do something about the condition  of  this

30% of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met the Prime Minister at the National Day

reception of the President, and I told him I had this motion,

he  said,  "We  have got our programme ready.   We  have  got

everything ready."  I said, "Great."  I hope I shall be  told

what is it that the Government has got.  What measures has it

decided  upon  to  check and correct this  imbalance  in  our

society?   Then I saw at the National Day Rally the programme

of  the  Government was to hand out lollipops.   It  is  like

handing out lollipops to children who are being querulous  to

keep them quiet.  May I tell the Government that handing  out

lollipops  is not the answer.   Something more than  that  is

needed,  something  which will improve  the  lives  of  these

people over the long term.  Of course, the local media,  true

to  its  role,  highlights  $3.2 billion,  how  generous  the

Government is.  We forget that that is our money.   All  that

the Government is required to do is to see that it is put  to

proper  use, a judicial use that benefits all members of  the

society,  not any particular section of the society.   So  we

need to do something immediately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to list, first of all, what measures that I say

have  to be put in place and then come back and talk on  each

of  these  measures a little.  The first one which  is  quite

clearly crying out is that we should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>

put our workers in a position of equality with employers.   I

shall  expand  on this.  But today the workers have  no  more

rights than the serfs had in the middle ages under the common

law, and I shall read an excerpt from the Second Reading of a

Bill  in 1968, as exactly what was done.  We need to put  the

workers  on  an  equality with employers.  You  have  got  to

recognise  that labour has a definite contribution  to  make.

Labour  is  not  subservient  to  capital.   Labour  is   not

subservient  to  land.  It is these three factors  which  are

necessary for production.  So they must be given equal rights

with  capital.  For that, I shall list out why we need a  new

Employment Act.  Secondly, we need a new Industrial Relations

Act.   Thirdly, we need a new Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act,

to protect the workers from exploitation by the employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I am listing this out before I speak on each

one  of  them.  We have got to democratise our trade  unions.

Give  them  the  power that trade unions in  other  countries

have.   We need to see that they are run on democratic lines.

Let  us  remove the anachronism of a Cabinet Minister leading

the  trade  union  movement.   How  is  that  possible?   The

Government  should  be the biggest employer  along  with  the

statutory  boards.   And  we have its Ministers  leading  the

trade  unions,  the  workers.  It is  laughable.   The  fifth

proposal  is  to  have a new Wages Council, where  again  the

trade  unions  and  the  labour have equal  rights.   At  the

moment, they are outnumbered by the employer, 2 to 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, we have got to have a new Trade Disputes Act.

I  am aware that there should be some limit on strikes.   But

we  should not take it out completely from the trade  unions.

Strikes still remain the most powerful weapon in the hands of

the  workers.  But as I said, I concede that there should  be

some limit.  But at the moment, it is completely taken out of

their  hands.   I see that the then Minister for  Labour,  Mr

Rajaratnam, referred to the strikes in the 1960s  as  one  of

the  things that we could not afford in our society.   But  I

ask the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>

question: who were responsible for the labour disorder, if it

was labour disorder, in the 50s and 60s?  Sir, I was here,  I

have  said this before.  Our present Senior Minister was  the

legal adviser to a number of trade unions.  He was advocating

the rights of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, we got to give workers proper representation

before inquiry tribunals, before they are dismissed by  their

companies.  At the moment, it is all a farce.   So all  these

measures are necessary to give our workers their rights which

they deserve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eighth proposal is that Government now considers

seriously  revising  the  CPF contribution  rates.   We  have

advocated  that  the employees should only pay  15%  and  the

employers pay the same amount.  I call upon the Government to

bring  up the employer's contribution to 15% immediately  and

to  reduce the employee's contribution to the same level,  so

that  they  have a bit more money to take home and to  spend.

Then,  I have a number of measures.  These are all structural

changes we have to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may touch on the measures to meet the needs of

people  who  cannot  afford them.  I  think  it  is  time  we

seriously considered social security for those in need.   The

problem in other countries was that they give social welfare,

medical  relief to everyone, with the result that  there  was

abuse  of the system.  But surely we can do something to  see

that  only  the  needy  get  the  benefit  under  the  social

security.   Could  we not provide social  security  and  give

benefits  for  those earning below $2,000  per  month?   They

carry a welfare card to be entitled to all the benefits.  And

I am proposing that under that scheme, it should provide free

medical  care to those who qualify.  Medisave does not  cover

outpatient charges. That is where most of the money goes.   I

hear  complaints from people about how much they have to  pay

every time they go to a polyclinic for outpatient treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, there should be payment of a children's allowance,

not just designed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>

increase the population.  But a children's allowance - I have

been calling for this many, many years - for those who are in

need  of this allowance, to see that they can bring up  their

children, and educate them sufficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again, under the social security, I think the

Government  should  seriously  consider  introducing  old-age

pensions  for those over 65, regardless of whether  they  are

CPF  contributors  or whether they have savings  in  the  CPF

fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I am proposing is that the Government now

provides  free  education to all our students  whose  parents

earn below $2,000 a month.  A claim has been made, and it  is

still  made, and I see that it is in today's paper,  that  in

Singapore,  education is free.  This  is  one  of  the  false

claims that is constantly made about things in Singapore.   I

check  it  up, and I have checked it before as well.   But  I

checked  it  up  recently, rang a family up.  They  have  two

children in a primary school.  Do they have to pay any school

fees?   They  say  that they have to pay $15  every  quarter.

What  is in a name?  It does not matter.  You do not call  it

school  fees, you call it under some other name, and  collect

the money.  But the money still has to come from the parents.

At  secondary level, they say they have to pay $51 a quarter,

that is, $17 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us stop this sham of saying free education for

all,  and  see that families earning below $2,000  get  their

children educated free in Singapore.  We can afford, if  only

we did not spend so much of our money on unnecessary things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, under the social security, we should consider

unemployment  benefits for those unemployed, perhaps  limited

for  a number of months.  If they are genuinely unable to get

employment,  they should be helped and not told, "Hard  luck,

poor chap!  Just carry on, try and get another job.  Try  and

improve  your  skills.  We are all right, but you  know,  you

just  carry  on.   Soon enough you will  get  a  job."   This

question of improving skills - how much more are you going to

be able to teach or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>

improve  the skills of cleaners and road sweepers?   So  what

are  we  talking  about when we say that  they  have  got  to

improve  the skills and learn more?  How much more  can  they

learn?  Can we have an answer to that question?  So what  are

we going to do?  Are we going to leave them just earning $400

a  month,  and  not give them any benefits, and  say  go  and

improve yourself?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say something about what I have listed first, and

that  is  a new Employment Act that we need.  We need  a  new

Employment  Act for the 21st century that will recognise  the

rightful  place of labour in society.  I see that a call  was

made  by  the NTUC.  It was reported in the Straits Times  of

23rd  August  2000 that labour needed a new social  contract.

Well,  that  is  it.  But let us not just talk  about  a  new

social  contract.   Let us give them a  new  Employment  Act.

This  present  Employment Act was passed on 10th  July  1968.

Before  that,  there was the Employment Ordinance  from  1955

which, let me tell Members, gave our workers more rights  and

benefits.   But  these  were  all  curtailed  under  the  new

Employment  Bill,  because the British had pulled  out  their

forces  and we needed to improve ourselves, and so we  needed

to   attract   foreign  capital,  we  needed   multi-national

companies to come in, and therefore the workers had  to  lose

their rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajaratnam, moving the Second Reading of this Bill,

acknowledged  that  there  were quite  a  bit  of  criticisms

outside Parliament of the Bill.  But he dismissed that and he

said, and I am going to read what he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the people will respond provided they are convinced

that the effort and difficult adjustments demanded are really

directed towards eventually promoting the well-being  of  the

people as a whole and not merely to enrich a privileged few - whether   gay  and  fun-loving  political  leaders   or   the

racketeering ruffians with whom they are allied."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not my words. These are the words of Mr

Rajaratnam  who was then Minister for Labour.  He  said  that

the  justification  was that in the end, the  measures  would

promote  the welfare of the people.  Well, has the Employment

Act promoted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>

the well-being of the people as a whole?  Has it achieved the

objects  that Mr Rajaratnam was propounding?  Or has it  left

the  workers worse off? Let us ask these questions seriously.

He mentioned particularly about the criticism on clause 10 of

the  Bill  which  curtailed the right of the  worker  on  the

period  of notice that he had to be given before his services

were  terminated.  Under the old Act, the worker had a longer

period of notice before his services could be terminated.   I

would  not  spell  them out for want of  time.   But  he  had

considerably more notice.  And those who worked for more than

five  years  had two months' notice.  The new Act  passed  in

1968 by a government which had professed itself to be worker-conscious  radically cut this down.  It did  not  matter  how

many  years  the employee had worked, the maximum  period  of

notice  required was reduced to four weeks.  And if you  have

worked for less than six months, you do not get any notice at

all,  you  can  be just fired immediately.   So  we  need  to

appoint a committee to re-examine the Employment Act  and  to

see  whether  we  still  need to continue  with  a  law  that

practically makes our workers helpless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the employer holds the whip. It is no good

saying,  "Oh,  there are benefits provided, and the  employer

has  to provide that."  But as long as he can hire and  fire,

these benefits are valueless.  I have heard people come to me

and  say,  "I  have  been given notice."   Why?   "Because  I

questioned my superior.  I told him that I do not think  that

was   right   on  something.   So  they  said  I   am   being

insubordinate."   So there you are.  And  he  has  no  remedy

because under the Act, there is nothing he can do.  There  is

section  14  which, on the face of it, gives him a  right  of

appeal  to the Minister.  But I have mentioned several  times

that that is really valueless.  We have got to have an Unfair

Dismissals Act under which the court can compel the  employer

to take the worker back into employment and, failing that, to

pay  adequate compensation for his losses and damage that  he

would  suffer.  This is the position in developed  countries.

This is the position

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>

in countries where they recognise the value of labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said about trade unions. In the same month that the

Employment  Bill was presented to Parliament  in  July  1968,

there  was  presented  the Industrial  Relations  (Amendment)

Bill.   This really sounded the death knell for trade  unions

and see what the Minister said when he presented this Bill to

Parliament:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trade unions have never questioned the rights of

management to manage, first, as a matter of commonsense, and,

second,  it  is because these rights are common  law  rights.

But  whatever the theory, the rights of management have  over

the  years been eroded, perhaps not as a conscious policy  by

trade unions.  What this Bill seeks to do is to restore these

rights  of  management to the employers by making common  law

rights into statute law.  No rights are being taken away from

the  workers  because the workers never claimed these  rights

even though some of these rights have in practice been denied

to   management.   We  are  not  restoring  these  rights  to

management  merely out of a sense of justice and  fair  play.

But  because  we are convinced that unless proper  management

functions are allowed to be performed unhampered there  would

be little or no economic expansion or fresh investments."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.06 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you have it, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I said.

This  Government  was  putting workers  back  into  what  the

workers  were in the Middle Ages.  Because under  the  common

law,  with  its  emphasis  on the  power  to  make  your  own

contract,  the workers were unable to secure any  rights  for

themselves.   But progressive countries saw the need  to  cut

down on these common law rights of the employers and to bring

in  statutory provisions to protect the workers.  But here is

this  Government  saying, "Oh, the workers  never  had  those

rights."  Of course, they did not.  And so it says,  "We  are

now  going  to  restore our workers to  that  position.   The

former  labour  government was misguided in giving  them  the

rights.   We  are now going to take it away."  That  is  what

this Government did in 1968.  Because what it did in this Act

was  to  make  the trade unions toothless.   Section  16,  or

section  17,  which gave the trade unions the power  to  give

notice to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>

employers  of a new agreement for the workers was drastically

altered.   Under the old Act, the trade unions had the  right

to  make  proposals about whose services should be terminated

and  what  should  be done before they were  terminated,  the

conditions  and a host of other things.  I have not  got  the

time to read all that.  But this was taken away completely by

the  Employment Act, "No trade union can submit any  proposal

to the employer on all these rights."  So where does it leave

the trade unions?  Practically powerless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone from Hong Kong saw me the other day and he said,

"I   see   now  the  trade  unions  are  very  busy   running

businesses."  I said, "Yes, exactly, because they  cannot  do

the  work  that  they  should  be  doing.  So  they  go  into

business."   But he said, "Is that the work of trade unions?"

I  said, certainly not.  So we need to look at this.   Is  it

still  necessary to keep our trade unions in this subservient

position  that  they  have to go on  bended  knees  to  their

capitalist  employers?   Or  should  they  not  negotiate  as

equals?  And for that, we need a new Industrial Relations Act

and  then  we need a new Unfair Dismissals Act.  That  is  so

clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, as I have said, an employer can just

terminate  the services of an employee just because  perhaps,

as  one Member said some time ago if the worker whistled  and

the  employer did not like the tune or something he had  only

to  say, "You can leave."  We need to protect him and to  see

that  he  is  adequately compensated,  if  his  services  are

terminated without proper cause.  Section 14 is no protection

at  all for an employee who is unfairly terminated.   We have

got to protect him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fourth on my list is allowing trade unions to be

run  on democratic lines.  Let them select their own leaders.

It should not be left to the Government to appoint leaders in

the  trade  union movement.  Remove the post of  the  Cabinet

Minister  as Secretary-General of the NTUC.  He is  paid  for

doing just that, to keep the workers policed on behalf of the

Government.  Then, as I said, we have got

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>

to  change the composition of the Wages Council.  We have got

to  see that the trade unions get equal representation.  They

should  have  a definite say on how much a worker  should  be

paid.   At the moment, they are outnumbered.  Let us consider

appointing a new Wages Council, not just the workers, but for

everybody,  as  I  said.  Let us have a National  Council  on

Salaries for Ministers, Judges and top civil servants so that

everyone  is  put  on  an equal footing and  given  the  same

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth proposal that I said about amending the

Trade  Disputes Act, again, I do not have to  say  very  much

more.  We have got to give the trade unions the right to call

off  the workers, if the employers get very unreasonable  and

adamant  about enforcing their own position on the employees.

Let  us  give  the worker the dignity he needs.   I  see  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister, some days ago, was saying  that  the

worker  is  worthy  of  respect and he should  be  given  the

respect he deserves.  Let us stop all this rhetoric.  You can

only  give the worker the respect and the dignity if you give

him  the  rights.   A person without any  rights  is  in  the

position  of  a beggar and how can you tell the beggar,  "You

have  dignity, my man! Stand up, you have dignity!", when  he

is  forced to go down on his knees, as the workers are  doing

at the moment, when negotiating with the employers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same lines is this representation before

inquiry tribunals.  The reason for excluding lawyers was that

lawyers  would make trouble.  They would be too costly.   But

at  least,  the lawyers will be there to protect the  worker.

Why   do  we  not  force  the  companies  to  pay  for  legal

representation and have a proper inquiry before they  dismiss

a  worker?  Surely if a company is interested in the  welfare

of  its  workers, it will agree to pay for the legal services

of  any employee who is charged with anything so that  he  is

properly represented and protected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your one hour

is up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will take up the rest in my reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the problem of

income gap has been in existence all along. The magnitude  of

the gap also reflects the seriousness of inequalities between

the  rich  and  the poor in our society. The  recent  figures

released  by  the  Statistics Department showed  signs  of  a

further widening income gap between the rich and the poor.  I

hope  this will not become a trend, otherwise it will be very

serious and will cause a divide in our social communities and

ethnic groups, thereby weakening our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the types of occupation of members of the families

in  the  bottom  10%, as revealed in the survey  report,   it

would  appear  that  the cause of the  problem  lies  in  the

widening  gap of salaries for different jobs. Therefore,  the

top  priority of the Government is how to upgrade the workers

in the low-income jobs.  At the same time, it should help the

small and medium enterprises to develop and to make them more

competitive and more effective, so that they could  have  the

means to pay higher wages to their employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, on many occasions in this House, urged the

Government  to  show more concern for those workers  who  are

aged  40 years and above with low educational foundation  and

have  hardly any skills.  They are the people who are  facing

very  acute challenges ahead, particularly when Singapore  is

moving  towards a knowledge-based economy and  an  influx  of

foreign  workers. The Government's answer is inevitably  that

the  Ministry of Manpower has all sorts of technical training

courses   awaiting  these  workers  to  enrol   and   upgrade

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this attitude of the Government is very

negative.  Although  the Government has  made  available  the

various  courses,  it  does  not necessarily  mean  that  the

workers  would  participate in them.  Many of  these  workers

have to do two jobs or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>

overtime  work to earn enough to support their  families.  By

the  time  they finish work, they would be exhausted.   Where

would  they have the energy left to pursue upgrading courses?

Even  if they want to change jobs, they do not know what type

of  jobs to change to, and they worry that when they start  a

new  job, the initial salaries would be very low as they lack

the  experience. As such, the starting pay  may not be enough

to support their family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, many of these workers do not know

English  and  many courses and examinations are conducted  in

English.  There  is  no  way  they  could  participate.   The

Government  should be more proactive in helping  these  lower

income  workers.  When these workers are prepared  to  accept

skill upgrading training, the Government should pay them cost

of  living  allowances during the period of training,  as  an

incentive for them to upgrade themselves and move to  better-paying jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the recent labour market report, those

workers above the age of 40 years with below secondary  level

education are more likely to be retrenched.  As such, if  the

Government  does not look into these problems  seriously,  we

can  well  expect the income gap in Singapore to  continually

widen.   The  Government should not be so naive as  to  think

that  so long as the economy recovers, and the labour  market

tightens,  the  employment problem of these workers  will  be

naturally resolved, and their income would be raised.  Please

do  not  forget that by that time, the income gap  among  the

various   job   sectors  will  be  correspondingly   widened,

resulting  in greater inequalities between the poor  and  the

rich.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government embraces the principle of market

economy, and the rate of  charges for public service is based

on  affordability.  To the lower-income group, this  type  of

policy is a merciless blow.  If the Government does not  take

prompt  steps to effectively check the widening  income  gap,

then the standard of living for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>

the  lower-income  families will simply  continue  to  slide.

This  will  be  a  great  mockery to the  Government's  self-proclamation that Singapore is an affluent society  and  that

some  of  our service industries are number one in the  world

and have reached world standards!

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, first of all, I

would  like  to comment on the NCMP's observation that  there

are 14,700 Singaporeans earning less than $200 per month.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 48,000 less than $400.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> As far as I know, there is no full-time job in Singapore that pays that kind of wages, but this

may  be  so for part-time jobs.  So I suggest that  the  NCMP

study  the  statistics a little more to understand  the  real

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fail to see how a new Industrial Relations Act or

a new Employment Act or the reconstitution of the NTUC or the

National  Wages  Council and the rest of his suggestions  can

solve  the  issue  of the widening income  disparities.  This

shows a lack of understanding on the part of the NCMP on what

are  the  real causes of the problems that we are  discussing

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the Ministerial Statement by

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister on the new salary  revision  for

civil servants and also during Questions for Oral Answers  on

30th  June  this  year in this House, the issue  of  widening

income  gaps  between  the top and  the  bottom  earners  was

addressed  to a certain extent by some Members of  the  House

and by the Deputy Prime Minister and also by the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry.  From the discussions in the House,  it

was  obvious that the issue of the widening income gap is not

unique  to Singapore.  In fact, it is an issue which is  part

and  parcel of the new economy. From the discussions, it also

shows  that  the Singapore Government is not sitting  on  its

laurels  for the problem to become a chronic issue. The  NCMP

should  judge the Government on the proactive actions it  has

taken to address the issues.  Obviously, he has not been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>

reading  about and following the developments in the  country

in  recent  times, especially on how the country is preparing

to address the issue of participating in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this in mind, I am moving an amendment to the

motion standing in the name of the NCMP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Can I have your amendment in

writing?  [Amendment handed to Mr Deputy Speaker]. Yes, it is

in  order.  You can move your amendment.  Have you circulated

your amendment to Members?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> I will ask the Clerk to do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May we see it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, it will come to you in due

course.  [Copies of amendment distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delete the words after "House" in line 1 to the end,

and to insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) notes that globalisation and the knowledge economy

are widening income disparities worldwide;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) reaffirms the strategy of embracing globalisation

to create growth and prosperity for Singaporeans; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) supports the Government's policy to equip all

citizens  to  benefit from the new economy, to  uplift  lower

income Singaporeans and to strengthen social cohesion."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the widening of income disparity, as I mentioned

earlier,  is  a  worldwide phenomenon and  is  affecting  all

countries  that are embracing the new economy and  those  who

have  opened up their economies as a result of globalisation.

In  fact,  it  is  happening in the USA, the world's  biggest

economy, in the OECD countries and it will also happen in all

other  countries that, as a result of the world becoming  one

big  market,  will  have  no choice but  to  globalise  their

economy.  A country could decide to isolate itself  from  the

problem  by  not  globalising and not  participating  in  the

phenomenal  growth of the new economy.  But  obviously,  this

will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>

not  be  a rational decision because the world will not  wait

for  those  who  are  not  able  to  change  and  accept  and

participate  with the new rules of economic development.   So

we  have no choice but to participate in this new economy  if

we  want  to survive as a country in the years ahead.  If  we

look  at  the  Gini  coefficient in all  countries  that  are

already  at an advanced stage of globalisation, all  of  them

are recording a widening of income disparities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Deputy Prime Minister put it in his speech

during  the debate on the Ministerial salaries, globalisation

has created a single world market for talent.  In my opinion,

this  is  precisely  the root cause of the  issue  of  income

disparities.  The new economy will see wealth creation  being

accelerated by those who dare to take the risk and to venture

into new areas of technology and business. Wealth creation in

this new economy will be quite different from wealth creation

that  happened in the age of industralisation or in  the  old

economy in general.  While the enterprises in the old economy

created  wealth  through bricks and mortar and  also  through

bricks  and mortar businesses and this typically took a  long

time to be created, in the new economy, entrepreneurs will be

able to create wealth at a much faster pace than any time  in

history and the quantum of the wealth created will be so huge

and  unimaginable in the old economy.  People like Bill Gates

created so much of wealth in such a short time that they will

not  be able to spend all their money in their lifetime,  nor

in  several generations to come for his family.  Sir, Richard

Li  from  Hong Kong created his few billion dollars worth  of

wealth  in just three years, matching what his father created

in  30  years of his lifetime. Such is the nature of the  new

economy  and such are examples of things to come in the  next

phase  of  economic development in the world and by  default,

such  will be the nature of things to come for Singapore from

now onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, more Singaporeans will be more daring and

willing to try and hence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>

will  have  a  chance to strike the gold at the  end  of  the

rainbow.  We  are  already seeing many  Singaporeans  seeking

opportunities   in   the   knowledge   economy,   giving   up

alternative, stable employment in traditional industries  and

businesses.  The  question  is:   should  we  discourage   or

encourage such people?  Should we create an environment  that

retards  or  inhibits  such  people  or  should  we  have  an

environment that further encourages more people to try?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure Singapore's continued growth and

prosperity  in the future, we have no choice but  to  embrace

globalisation  and to participate in the new economy  and  to

allow  practices consistent with the development of the  high

growth knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new economy where opportunities will be

more  equal  than  in  the  past,  everyone  will  have   the

opportunity to create wealth, but not everyone will  want  to

or  will  be  able  to  participate  as  effectively  in  the

knowledge-based economy.  However, in such an economy,  those

with  skills  and the relevant capabilities  will  command  a

higher premium and therefore higher wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, entrepreneurs and technopreneurs will help

create wealth for the country and hence create more jobs  for

others  in  Singapore.  If  we  do  not  encourage  such   an

environment    that    encourages    technopreneurship     or

entrepreneurship,  we  will  lose  our  talented  people   to

countries  like  the  USA  where they  will  be  given  ample

opportunities to excel. The competition for talent is  global

in  nature, as I mentioned.  Since our people will have  more

choices  and will be a lot more mobile than in the  past  and

since  we  have other countries equally hungry for  the  best

talents  from  around the world, if we  do  not  satisfy  the

demands of such Singaporeans whose skills are valued in other

countries, they will pack up and leave.  Similarly,  even  in

big  companies,  or  for that matter in the  Government,  the

capable and talented people will have to be well rewarded  if

we want to keep them.  Paying them high

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>

salaries  is  well worth the expenditure if they  can  create

competitive advantages for the organisations that  they  work

for.   We  should  therefore compare the  worth  of  our  top

talents  against  the global workforce  in  a  global  market

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at things from a global perspective, then

we  have  no choice but to accept the fact that the wages  of

our top earners will have to be determined on a global basis,

and  we have no choice but to allow each to achieve his  full

potential  of  earning  capability.  We  cannot  artificially

suppress anyone in order to address the issue of income gaps.

So, the obvious thing to do is to let things go and allow our

top  talents  to  earn  however much  they  can.   When  this

happens,  the sure thing to happen is that those at  the  top

end  will  be extraordinarily rich, and this will worsen  the

issue  of the income gap compared to the lower income earners

in  the  country.   In every society, there  will  always  be

people at both ends of the spectrum.  This is the reality  of

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we also cannot artificially prop up

the  wages  of the low income earners in order to  close  the

gap.  Because, just as the competition for talent at the  top

is  a global one, similarly, the competition for jobs at  the

lower end is also global in nature.  So our unskilled workers

who form the lower income earners in the country will have to

compete  with  workers  from  countries  like  India,  China,

Indonesia,  Bangladesh and other countries around the  world.

Price  of  our labour must be competitive compared to  labour

from  these  countries.  We cannot artificially prop  up  the

wages of such people through practices like the minimum  wage

system,  because  we  will risk over pricing  ourselves  and,

hence,  cause an acceleration of companies relocating out  of

Singapore to countries that offer cheaper infrastructure  and

labour cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be realistic, we therefore have to accept the fact

that  more  wealth will be created by just a few people.   On

the  other hand, every society will always have its share  of

people who cannot successfully

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>

catch up with progress and who will lack the necessary skills

to  do well.  Therefore, income disparities will continue  to

be worsened as we progress in this new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we will have very high income earners who will be

able  to  enjoy very comfortable lives and who can choose  to

live  in  any country they choose to live in, our low  income

earners should not be deprived of the necessities of life and

they should also have a share in some of the luxuries of life

in  Singapore.   In  other words, we  must  ensure  that  all

Singaporeans have a reasonably good quality of life no matter

what  their  background.  This must be the  Government's  key

responsibility  so that we will continue to  enjoy  the  good

social  cohesion that Singapore has enjoyed in  the  last  30

years or so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real question then is: how should the Government and

the  people of Singapore prepare to tackle this issue so that

all  Singaporeans, no matter what their background or  income

levels  are, will have a good life in Singapore  and  no  one

should  feel deprived or live in envy of others who  enjoy  a

higher income level?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the best bet for us is not to try to

balance income levels, but to have a level playing field  for

opportunities, so that no matter what walk of life one  comes

from,  he  or she will have an equal opportunity to  earn  as

high  an income as possible and have a chance to make a  jump

from  the  lower  10% earners to the top 10% earners  in  the

country.   Everyone  should have a chance of  achieving  what

they aspire to achieve and their success or failure should be

the  outcome  of  their own effort and  capability,  and  not

because we created some obstacles for some of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot just think of redistribution of wealth.

Otherwise,  we risk losing our wealth creators.  I  therefore

hope  that  the  Government will continue  to  emphasise  the

concept  of  equal opportunities for all Singaporeans,  which

has brought success for Singapore up to now.  I sincerely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>

believe  that in this new economy, it will be even easier  to

make that big jump, to create wealth for oneself, provided we

have a sufficiently well trained population.  It is therefore

critical that the Government equips all Singaporeans with the

right  tools  so that they will be able to benefit  from  the

tremendous opportunities that the new economy provides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure Members of this House will agree with me

that Singapore already allows a great deal of social mobility

for  everyone, no matter what their background is.  Over  the

last  35  years,  since independence, we have  seen  so  many

examples of families who have seen hardship and poverty,  and

who  have  later  broken out of their social  position  as  a

result  of their children being given opportunities to  excel

in their studies, thus allowing them to take on good and well

paying  jobs.  Similarly, for those who are willing  to  work

hard and improve themselves, they have been able to attain  a

better  standing in society, because the country allows  them

to  do so.  No Singaporean is expected to remain poor forever

and our society allows everyone to rise up the ranks, whether

in  position or in income earning ability.  This  is  what  I

mean by equal opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government's answers to the new economy

are  and  should  be the following.  First  of  all,  a  good

education  for  every Singaporean child, who  is  trained  to

learn  for  life  and  trained to  plug  into  the  knowledge

economy.  We should never end up in a situation where a child

from  a lower income family does not do well in studies as  a

result  of  the  family not being able to afford  it.   Every

child  should continue to be given equal opportunity to excel

in  his or her studies, and our education system today allows

it.   In  fact, I was surprised that the NCMP mentioned  free

education.  I thought we already have free education starting

from   primary  school.   And  for  families   who   are   in

difficulties and cannot afford to pay school fees, there  are

many  avenues  of  help, and I have not come  across,  in  my

constituency at least and I am sure many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>

Members  will  agree, of any child who has not been  given  a

chance to fulfil whatever level of education he or she  wants

as a result of not being able to pay for it.  So I really did

not  understand the issue of free education that  the  Member

brought up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an opportunity for all Singaporeans to be

retrained  easily and affordably at any point of their  lives

is  also an important thing that the Government should  focus

on.   We are already seeing problems of our older workers who

have  become  unemployable as a result of  their  old  skills

becoming   outdated  and  irrelevant  in  the  new   economy.

Initiatives like the Skills Redevelopment Programme  and  the

concept  of life-long learning must continue to be  developed

to address this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NCMP has a lot to learn about retraining. Even

cleaners, the example that the Member brought up, can learn a

lot, especially when we decide to automate and mechanise  the

industry.   I have actually seen training manuals two  inches

thick that contain a lot of materials on how cleaning can  be

done more efficiently.  And I think our cleaners and our road

sweepers  can benefit from such training and, as a result  of

automation and mechanisation, they will be able to earn a lot

more  income because of the higher value added that they  add

to their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thirdly, a related issue which I think is very much

relevant in the new economy, as it was in the old economy, is

that  everyone should have access to affordable  housing  and

medical  care.  We should never over price these  necessities

to  the  point  where only the well-off can get good  medical

care  and  good homes.  The Government has a direct  role  to

play  in ensuring this happens fairly and should continue  to

be  accountable  for equity in the future.   As  long  as  we

continue  to  ensure  that every Singaporean  has  access  to

housing and medical care no matter what his income level  is,

we will continue to avoid any issue of envy or the feeling of

being  left  out.   And I think we have many programmes,  eg,

Medifund and the various top-up schemes and assistance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>

schemes  that actually will be able to help families who  are

not able to afford such necessities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should have sufficient safety nets to help

those in society who cannot keep up with the pace or who just

cannot  overcome  the obstacles, so much so  that  they  have

difficulties in making ends meet.  No matter how much we  do,

we  will  always have such people in our society.   In  fact,

this  is a fact of life in every country in the world.  There

can  never  be a situation where you have zero percentage  of

the  population who are in this position.  Comparatively,  we

do  not  have  too  serious a problem today,  if  we  compare

ourselves to even countries like the USA where there are many

people living on the streets.  We do not have a single family

living  on  the street in Singapore today.  And we  must,  of

course, continue to systematically help such people who  will

tend to lag far behind in society for whatever reasons.   We,

so  far, have a good track record and should continue to keep

it this way in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned, there will always be people who

face tremendous problems and difficulties, and this is a fact

of  life  in any country in the world.   Therefore,  hardship

cases were present in Singapore in the last 30 years and they

will  continue to be present.  The real issue is how can  all

of  us  reach out to such people and try to reach out, locate

them  and help them as much as we can through all the various

schemes  that exist.  Therefore, we should not mistake  these

hardship  cases  as  an  outcome of the  widening  of  income

disparities.  We should continue to evolve on how  we  handle

and resolve such hardship cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, the key solution of the

widening  income  disparities  is  to  balance  opportunities

rather  than  balancing income levels through  artificial  or

unrealistic  means.   Such an approach  which  Singapore  has

adopted,  ie, levelling of opportunities, is more sustainable

in  the  long run and will produce the best outcome  for  all

Singaporeans.   We must not restrict the growth  of  the  top

income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

earners and, at the same time, we should continue to focus on

uplifting  the  lower income Singaporeans through  the  means

that  I  mentioned earlier.  Only then can we ensure a strong

and  united  Singapore.  We are fortunate that the Government

has  already  proactively addressed  the  issue  of  widening

income gaps, and this is precisely why we will not run into a

situation of riots or unrest that the NCMP has brought up.  I

feel  that  the  NCMP  does not sufficiently  understand  the

issues  of  the  new economy and therefore has raised  issues

that  are  so  misleading.  He needs to  plug  into  the  new

economy if he is serious about addressing such issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It has been proposed, as an

amendment, to leave out all the words after "House" in line 1

to the end, and there to insert the words -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) notes that globalisation and the knowledge economy

are widening income disparities worldwide;

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) reaffirms the strategy of embracing globalisation to

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) supports the Government's policies to equip all

citizens  to  benefit from the new economy, to  uplift  lower

income Singaporeans and to strengthen social cohesion."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Can I speak on the amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, later on. Mr Chay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I would like to speak in support of the amendment to the

motion in the name of Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the NCMP just now, I found that it is as if

we  were  all  caught in a time trap together  with  Rip  Van

Winkle,  going  into  the 60s, hearing  all  the  stories  of

industrial  strike  actions  and demonstrations  on  workers'

rights.    I  think  he has also forgotten that  during  this

period,  trade unions had also changed and trade  unions  had

also modernised.  He recounted about the experience of a Hong

Kong gentleman

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>

who  visited  him  and said, "Oh, now,  they  are  all  doing

businesses."  Trade unions have always been doing  businesses

right from the beginning  -  cooperatives.  It is one of  the

features  of  European trade union movement that  cooperative

businesses were started right from the beginning of the trade

union movement.  And even today, if you visit countries  like

Sweden  and  Germany, cooperatives run by unions have  always

been  there.   But  there  may be  a  difference.   Those  in

Singapore run by our NTUC are pretty successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks about Cabinet Ministers being in the trade

union   movement.   Perhaps  he  has  forgotten  our   unique

historical struggle.  The PAP was founded by many leaders who

have trade union connections.  It is more than a gesture.  It

is  more  a  pride that we have got Ministers  who  can  also

represent our workers' rights at very, very high level in the

Cabinet  so that workers' rights are taken care of,  problems

and  issues  discussed,  weighed and even  anticipated  right

before  they arose.  The NTUC in Singapore has been  singular

in  promoting  the trade union movement.  It highlighted  the

problems  of  workers  in training and  retraining  that  are

necessary for the new economy.  It spearheaded programmes  to

raise  funds and got the Government to co-fund and  today  we

have  this SRP programme which is being run by the  NTUC  for

the  retraining of workers.  So I find all these issues  that

he  has brought up rather misleading, but it is important for

us  to  lay  clear before the public that these  issues  have

actually been addressed before and some of the issues that he

has brought up are really misleading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk in support of Mr Inderjit Singh's motion.

He pointed out quite correctly that this inequality in income

in  the  last 20 years in advanced countries like the US  and

OECD  is quite an important fact.  There has been this rising

income inequality in these countries.  This is attributed  to

several  important factors which he has already  highlighted.

But I would like to develop on some of them later on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole issue of income inequality actually arose

from this report some  months ago on this phantom $133 worker

that the Straits Times reported.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is from the Statistics Department.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Yes, from the Statistics Department,

but I say "phantom worker".

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Then sack the Department.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> This issue arose from the Department

of Statistics' paper on income disparity.  Of course, arising

from  that  there have been many reports on this widening  of

income  gap  and many proposals on why and how such  gaps  as

reflected in the Gini coefficient should be closed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth and income distribution has always been

an   area   of   concern  by  economists,   politicians   and

journalists. These issues attract popular interest because at

best they reflect a genuine concern for the well-being of our

fellow men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment motion recognizes our economy's openness

and  the  globalization forces that sweep the world  economy,

with  so  much  technological  and  communication  technology

advances that are going on. These forces will have an  impact

on our society and will cause more advanced segments and less

advanced segments within the society to develop. We  have  no

choice, I believe,  but to embrace this because we are a very

open  economy.  The Government will have to continue to  take

steps  to  foster greater social cohesion and the  Government

has done so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward some positions from economic

studies  that  we  must  see these widening  inequalities  in

society in perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the Department of Statistics' paper of May

2000, "Is Income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>

Disparity Increasing In Singapore", the Gini coefficient  was

shown  to have increased from 0.446 in 1998 to 0.467 in  1999

which showed a positive increase of 0.021. From 1990 to 1999,

the increase is 0.031.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the ratio of the average income of the 9th

decile  to the 2nd decile, the figure  rose from 5.5 in  1990

to 6.8 in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no doubt that there is a widening income

disparity in Singapore over the last decade, but we must also

remember that the GDP in that period doubled, averaging at  a

compound rate of 7% per annum for a decade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Government been taking action to lessen the

disparity at the lower end  by appropriate transfer of income

and assistance schemes? The answer is yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Government has realized that some years ago

and that this is likely to be an enduring feature of our open

economy  at  this  stage  of  our development  where  we  are

actually  embarking on a growth path, not  just  catching  up

with  the  advanced countries, or what they call "catching-up

growth"  but  in  the  literature they  call  it  "endogenous

growth",   ie,   growth  that  comes  with  technology.   The

Government has, over the last few years put in all  kinds  of

assistance  programmes such as rental and assistance  scheme,

SC&CC  rebates  and  utilities rebates, RUAS  scheme,  public

assistance and various personal tax rebates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Lollipops!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Lollipops to him, but not to many

people who need them. By the way, these lollipops cost a  few

billion  dollars.   These  schemes have  been  in  place  for

several  years.   What have been the main driving  forces  in

changing the face of our economy over the last 10 years  that

these   will   have  a  significant  impact  on  our   income

inequality?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to say that it is our increasing

openness and dependence on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>

the  world  economy  in trade and also in  resource  factors.

Secondly,  it  is the globalising force that is sweeping  the

world  economy.   Thirdly, it is the emphasis  we  have  been

putting  in  raising our productivity, by raising  the  skill

content  of  our exports and manufactures in  order  to  stay

competitive.  Otherwise, we will have less investments coming

into  Singapore.  Fourthly, it is the emerging  technological

changes  and  knowledge-based system that will determine  the

new employment profile in the New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These driving forces affect wages unevenly. Skilled

labour  gets  to do better and better because they  are  paid

better and better.  Unskilled labour wage cannot rise as fast

as the skilled ones.  Often times, there will be dislocations

and  unemployment  where jobs and incomes  are  lost.   As  a

result of all this, there is income disparity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the high degree of our economic openness and the

state   of   globalising   forces  impacting   us   and   the

technological  progress  that affects  the  growth  in  these

economies,  what  can  we  draw from  the  studies  of  these

countries' experience similar to ours?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that our experience is not unique. This

means many countries like the US and the OECD countries  over

the  last 10 - 20 years, as pointed out by Mr Inderjit  Singh

just  now,  have also exhibited this tendency towards  rising

income  inequality as their mature economies embark  on  more

skill intensive technological growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that this issue of economic

growth and income distribution over time and across countries

have  been an issue of considerable interest study since  the

50s.  It is not a new subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first economists in this area of studies was

the   earlier  Nobel  Prize  winner,  Simon  Kuznets,   whose

hypothesis  was  that economic growth would  generate  rising

income    and    wealth   inequality   during    the    early

industrialization period,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>

and   later   a  declining  inequality  during   the   mature

industrialization period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hypothesis has always been controversial but in the

last  20 years, the experiences of the United States and  the

OECD countries do not conform to this hypothesis of declining

income inequality at the mature stage, as rightly pointed out

by  Mr Inderjit Singh. This is because the experience of  the

OECD  countries has been one of sharp rise in wage inequality

since the early 70s to till today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies have also identified certain factors

which  have  caused this tendency towards wage inequality  in

these  advanced mature economies. The most important of these

is  skill biased technical change. Once an economy is engaged

in   the  international  trade,  the  impact  of  trade  will

reinforce  the  labour  saving  technologies  and  the  skill

intensity  of  jobs  so that the wage inequality  is  further

deepened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of globalisation and the borderless world

means  that  MNCs locate themselves all over the  world  such

that  they can produce at the lowest cost.  My colleague,  Mr

Inderjit  Singh,  has very elaborately highlighted  on  this.

Modern  communication means they can employ their  executives

from  anywhere so that relative scarcity of labour skill  and

talents  is  transparent.   That means  executives  are  also

competing  globally.  Workers are also  in  a  way  competing

globally,  except  that executives can  move  across  borders

whereas ordinary workers have to do so within the confines of

borders.  Modern technology and communication also means much

flatter  organization so that wider control can  be  executed

giving  productivity to the higher level executives, enabling

them  to  be better rewarded. Skill biased technical progress

also can substitute for unskilled labour.  That means that as

progress  is  introduced, more and more skill intensive  jobs

will  be  demanded.  It is complementary to  skilled  labour,

dislocating  unskilled  labour  by  demanding  more   skilled

labour. In this process,  wages are made more unequal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driving force of technologies does not just cause

income  inequality across industries but also within industry

differences.  This is due to more skilled  labour  having  to

work  with  newer  types  of capital requiring  more  updated

skills, leading to better wage rewards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these driving forces of technology and change, our

Government and the NTUC have prepared our workers for the new

challenge ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the NCMP has heard of ManPower 21, this new

Manpower Development Plan for the new economy.  He said we do

not  have  any scheme.  The NTUC raised funds for the  Skills

Redevelopment  Programme,  which is  jointly  funded  by  the

Government.  Today,  I  was told the demand  for  the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme has been very good.  This will ensure

that  our  workers  will  be continually  upgraded  in  their

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech has

just   announced  a  $3  billion  package  to  target  social

objectives,   to  foster  greater  community  bonding   among

Singaporeans.   Many programmes have been in place  for  some

years,  such  as the asset enhancement scheme,  CPF  top-ups,

rental  rebates  on  service  and  conservancy  charges,  and

Edusave rewards which are aimed precisely at levelling up the

lower  income  classes. This levelling  up  approach  is  the

correct  approach. Otherwise, if the top income  earners  are

constrained,  our  dynamic  economy  will  suffer  and   more

unemployment will result, when growth slows down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that happens those with skills and knowledge will

move  elsewhere,  reducing our potential for economic  growth

and employment generation, bringing us into a vicious trap of

slow growth and low income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment in the

name  of Mr Inderjit Singh and I wish that the NCMP would  be

better informed in future when he talks about the NTUC.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I heard

from  the two speakers were not unexpected at all.   This  is

what we have been hearing ad nauseam.  What it boils down  to

is  this.  Mr Inderjit Singh says it cannot be helped at all,

lah.   It is globalisation, lah.  So there is nothing to  do.

So  sacrifice  the  worker at the altar of  capitalism.   The

worker  is  to  be completely thrown onto the  rubbish  heap,

because  he  has  no  place in the  society.   Talking  about

improving  skills, about 50% of our workers  have  less  than

secondary education.  So how are you going to teach  them  to

understand the intricacies of machines and other things  that

are needed?  Can you explain that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, of course, is a very important thing. That

is  why I say that we have got to see that every child  gets,

what  they say, the same opportunity.  But how can  you  when

the  family is struggling to make its ends meet?  Expect  the

family  also  to see that the children are properly  educated

when  they have to pay school fees.  One of them said that  I

was  wrong in saying that there is no free education.   I  do

not  know whether he has got children.  But does he not  have

paid something every month, because that is what every parent

tells  me?   So  it  is  a sham to say  that  there  is  free

education in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good just indulging in words - we must do

something; we must do something; we must do something.  Spell

out  your  measures. That is what is needed now.   Enough  of

rhetoric.  And the amendment does not seek to spell  out  any

measures.   It says, "supports the Government's  policies  to

equip  all  citizens to benefit from the new economy".   What

are  the  Government's policies?  We have not heard  anything

about  that.   What are the Government's policies  to  uplift

lower  income Singaporeans?  I still say that what was handed

out at the National Day Rally, are lollipops as are those  so

much  vaunted rebates on rent and conservancy charges.   They

do  not  address  the  problem of the difficulties  faced  by

people  who are only earning $400 or $500 a month,  and  they

cannot afford the basic things in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set out a number of things that the Government

can do.  I am not here

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>

advocating  that everyone should be paid the same.   That  is

not  what I am advocating. What I am saying here is  that  we

have got to see that in this globalisation, new economy, that

a  substantial portion of the population do not suffer  as  a

result  of  that.  Other developed countries have got  proper

safety  nets.   The UK government has got a  national  health

service and had it for years now, providing medical care  for

those  in  need.   Do  we  have  it?   They  have  an  Unfair

Dismissals Act.  They have enough protection for the  worker.

Do  we  have them?  So are they saying, "We can't do anything

for  the  workers.  It is all globalisation."   Societies  in

those countries will not tolerate that answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of saying that there is something that we can

do,  the poor worker has to accept globalisation.  Let us say

that  it  is  immoral that in a society like Singapore,  with

just 3 - 4 million people, very rich in its foreign reserves,

for  30% of the people to be living at the poverty line.  Let

us  have it openly, instead of indulging in all these  words,

words,  words, which is what we have had from the  Government

and  from  its supporters.  The Government must do this,  the

Government  must do that.  Let us have them.   What  are  you

going to do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this amendment adds nothing to what we

already know and it does not say how the people who are  left

out are going to be helped.  All it says is, it is a fact  of

life,  accept the fact of life, let us return to the  law  of

the  jungle.   Those who are able, those who are strong,  can

push ahead.  Those who are weak, those who are disabled,  can

all  just  be  left behind to die.  That is the  law  of  the

jungle.  Is that what we want in Singapore?  Or do we want  a

caring, humane society which says that we have a duty,  as  a

society, to look after our needy, those who are unable to  do

things  for themselves.  I hear several complaints  from  the

disabled on how neglected they feel in Singapore.  But it  is

not  for  them  that  this motion is moved,  it  is  for  our

workers.   Shall  I say that, unless you also strengthen  the

workers' rights, you are not going to help them improve their

positions,  and so try and lessen the gap.  It is  only  when

they have rights that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>

they can do something to improve their position.  If you keep

them  as  serfs and tell them they have got to go  on  bended

knees  to  the employers, then they cannot improve themselves

and so lessen the inequalities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I have not only these measures to

improve  the  workers' life, I have a number of other  social

benefits that should be granted.  Why can we not grant  them?

Why  can  we  not recognise that this 30% of our people  need

these  benefits  -  provide free medical care,  provide  free

education for their children.  That means, their parents will

not  have  to pay one cent.  Not keep saying, "Oh, no  school

fees.", but the parents pay $15 a month for other things that

are  provided in the school.  Why can we not have an  old-age

pension?  Have you given answer for that?  What is wrong with

it when other countries have all got an old-age pension?  The

CPF  is  not the answer.  Do all families have enough in  the

CPF  to  meet their needs when they grow old?  Many  of  them

will have nothing, practically nothing.  So what do they  do?

And  what  do  we do about the unemployment problem?   It  is

growing.   So what do we do about them?  Just throw  them  on

the dust heap.  It is globalisation, it is globalisation.  So

we cannot do anything for you.  It is just bad luck!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to continue. I really cannot understand

what  I  have heard this afternoon.  It comes as no surprise,

but  to  say the least, it is amazing that in a society  like

ours we should hear these views in the 21st century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I did not originally

plan to speak.  But listening to the NCMP, I thought I should

respond to some of the allegations that he has made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping forces are affecting our life in Singapore and

will  affect  our  life  even more so, especially  the  lower

income workers in future.  There are now faster technological

changes that would affect

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>

the  ability of our workers to hold jobs due to the fact that

the  competition that we face, the companies in Singapore are

facing,  will be more global rather than local.  As a  result

of  these  two factors, our employees cannot expect full-time

employment  any more because their companies will restructure

and restructure from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP needs only to listen to the speech of DPM Tony

Tan  yesterday at the Manpower Summit which brought  together

representatives  from the Government, employers  as  well  as

unions  to understand the sweeping changes that have affected

the  world  and  are affecting Singapore; and listen  to  the

Prime  Minister  very carefully to understand and  appreciate

what are being done for the ordinary folks in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do our workers need generally? Basically, I think

they  need three things: (1) fair remuneration; (2) fair play

at  workplaces; and (3) job security.  All three of which are

being  provided for by the unions in Singapore.  What we  are

doing  is not just to give them the basic but more than  just

basic, in order for them to enjoy a better life and in  order

to   keep  enhancing  their  ability  to  provide  for  their

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talked about the Employment Act and the

need  to  change the Employment Act and Industrial  Relations

Act.   Yes,  there  will always be a need to  change  and  to

review  Acts  and  laws.  I agree.  But, first,  we  have  to

recognise  the factors that would require us to review  these

laws.   And secondly, there is, of course, the need to change

mindset.   That is what I think we all need to do, especially

those who do not understand the forces of globalisation  that

are now affecting us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Employment Act, Mr Jeyaretnam asked: who

benefits?  My answer is the workers have benefited from  this

Act  because it has helped us to attain full employment  over

the  years,  and  this  is the best protection  that  we  can

provide  for  our workers in Singapore.  Because  in  a  full

employment situation not only would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>

our  workers  be able to retain their jobs, but at  the  same

time,   they  can  get  higher  salary.   In  the   face   of

globalisation where our workers cannot expect to  keep  their

jobs  for  life, what the unions, working with the Government

and  employers, are doing is to ensure that they  are  better

skilled and reskilled to be able to enjoy better quality jobs

and better income in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also spoke of the Industrial Relations Act

and  the  fact  that our workers' right to  strike  has  been

removed.   He cannot be more wrong than that.  The unions  in

Singapore   have   the  right  to  strike.    Mr   Jeyaretnam

understands this.  But they choose not to strike because that

would  work  against the interest of the workers  themselves.

They  can strike if they get the support of more than 50%  of

their members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP should look at some countries in Europe to

understand  how  they  are  responding  to  these  forces  of

globalisation  and  trying to protect the interest  of  their

members  and workers, and we have seen this.  In one  meeting

with top leaders of a union from a European country, we asked

whether  they  had  forgone the approach of  striking.   Very

quickly,  the  top  leader of the union  said,  "We  are  now

focusing  on  partnership."  What is meant by  "partnership"?

It  means  that  they  are  now  working  more  closely  with

employers  by  establishing a partnership  institute.   While

they   talk   about   workers'  strike,  human   rights,   at

international level, at home, they talk about ways to enhance

the  workers'  skills so that they can get  better  jobs  and

better income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also talked about the union's role for not

serving their workers well.  Tripartism has been the hallmark

of  our industrial relations in Singapore and it has done  so

well.   I  am very proud to say that so many unions from  all

over the world are looking at our example, even though we  do

not  project  ourselves  as a model for  any  country.   They

thought that it is worthy for them to come and watch  how  we

are  doing things so that they can learn a thing or two.  And

I am proud to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>

say  that, despite the fact that they see the model  that  we

have  been practising for a long time, we are not ashamed  to

learn  from that trade union in Europe which is now  focusing

on  partnership.   We will learn from anywhere  in  order  to

enhance further our services and protection for our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new challenges are many. In the past, we were

talking  about full employment and employment.   Now  we  are

talking about enhancing employability.  In the past, we  just

talked  about  cost competitiveness.  Now we talk  about  new

capability in productivity and innovation.  Sir, what we  are

now  doing  is  actually  focusing  on  job  creation,  skill

creation and employability enhancement for our workers.   And

these  are  the  best  protection that we  can  give  to  our

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam gives the impression that nothing is being

done  for  older  workers.  Again, he cannot be  more  wrong.

Because 80% of those who have gone through SRP training  have

less than eight years of formal education and 70% of them are

above  40  years old.  Some 30,000 workers have been  trained

under  this Skills Redevelopment Programme and as  far  as  I

know,  we are trying to train 70,000 more people in the  next

three years.  If that is not helping workers to cope with the

forces of globalisation, I do not know what is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, what is important is to help our workers

cope  with the changes in the new economy rather than talking

about  doling  benefits to them.  It will not  help  them  in

future.   You can give free medical services.  You  can  give

free of everything, but in the end, it will not help them  in

the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talked about the problems of having a

Cabinet  Minister  being  the  leader  of  the  trade   union

movement.   He sounds like the trade union leaders in  Europe

talking  about  us, probably about five to seven  years  ago.

Even now, they are changing.  They are coming to discuss with

us on what we have done for our workers that they can take  a

look at.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has fought for continuing education and training for

our  workers?  It was NTUC.  Who fought for SRP and Education

and Training Fund?  - $100 million a year and the Government,

as  announced by the Prime Minister, has agreed to give  $500

million more to a fund that will ultimately be $5 billion  in

Lifelong Education Fund. NTUC has a part in it.  And  because

NTUC  is led by a Cabinet Minister, the workers' concerns  go

direct to the Cabinet and it has helped the workers.  Who has

first articulated the view that CPF should be restored early?

It  was  NTUC.  And who during the recession tried  to  lower

costs  for ordinary Singaporeans?  It was NTUC, through  NTUC

FairPrice,   and  various  other  cooperatives.    So   these

cooperatives  are not just organisations which are  there  to

make  money.   We are in business because we are helping  the

workers.   Mr Jeyaretnam, we are in the business  of  helping

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is NTUC outnumbered in NWC? Again, he is very wrong.

NTUC,  the Government and the employers have an equal  number

of representatives on the NWC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Government is an employer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> The Government is the representative

of  the people.  He said that we are forcing Singaporeans and

our workers to accept the effects of globalisation.  What  we

are   doing   is  actually  helping  them  to  be   part   of

globalisation and benefit from it, and not run away from  it,

but overcome the forces and benefit from it.  He said that we

should  help those who are left out.  But we are not  helping

just  those  who  have been left out, we  are  helping  those

Singaporeans so that they are not left out.  So  before  they

are  left  out, we want to help them through skills upgrading

and other schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I can only summarise that Mr

Jeyaretnam has written the workers off.  What we are doing is

that we have tried to help our workers to overcome the forces

of globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quickly respond to Mr Low Thia Khiang. He

expressed concern over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>

the  widening income gap and workers older than 40 years  and

those  with low skills.  Every Singaporean should.   But  who

first   identified  the  potential  dangers   of   structural

unemployment?  It was NTUC.  It was in 1997, even before  the

recession  began.  And what did we do?  We did not  just  sit

down  and  talked  in  Parliament.  We  designed  the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme and asked the Government to  fund  it

and  raised it to be a national programme.  We also  realised

that  there would be workers who could not benefit  from  the

SRP.   NTUC  itself  set up a fund called the  Education  and

Training  Fund.  We have raised $5 million and the Government

has  topped  up $15 million.   The Government has  agreed  to

give another $15 million if we can raise another $5 million - to raise the fund to $40 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very easy to talk about how to help the

workers,  but we should not just criticise efforts that  have

been made or, worse still, not recognising what has been done

for the workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the speaker, by way of

clarification, what is this call by NTUC for a  new  contract

that  I  saw in the Straits Times on 23rd August.   Could  he

explain  to us what is this new contract that you are calling

for?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I do not think this is a forum to

<div align="center"><b>PROMOTING THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR A GRACIOUS SOCIETY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br>5.28 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

having  responsibility and consideration for others  are  the

building  blocks  for a gracious society.  I  would  like  my

colleagues here to step up the promotion of these  two  vital

ingredients that will help us become the gracious society  we

envisage.  In his 1996 New

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

Year's  Day  Message,  Prime  Minister  Goh  suggested   that

Singapore should aim to become a gracious society and  called

on    Singaporeans   to   complement   Singapore's   economic

achievements with social, cultural and spiritual development.

Again,  at the debate on the President's Address in 1997,  he

said  that his focus was on the need for Singapore to develop

"heartware" and not just economic competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has achieved the economic success that we

can  be proud of, but have we achieved the same milestone  in

social  success?   The  answer, I am afraid  to  say,  is  an

obvious "no"!  In the past few weeks alone, we were bombarded

with  articles in the Straits Times on "killer litter",  maid

abuse,  maids  falling to death while cleaning windows,  road

bullies, violent patrons in cinemas, bond breakers and so on.

These   are  examples  of  more  extreme  irresponsible   and

inconsiderate  acts.   There  are  many  less  severe   daily

occurrences  ranging from urinating in lifts,  littering  and

leaving rubbish on the common corridors of HDB flats, to  not

giving up seats to elderly people or pregnant women in  buses

or MRT trains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nation, we have attained remarkable

achievements  and  we  have  received  accolades  from   many

countries  including our neighbours. We  have  a  world-class

airport   and  seaport,  a  graft-free  society,  a  diligent

workforce  and  a high per-capita income. But  as  a  people,

especially  when  abroad, many Singaporeans  fail  to  endear

themselves to others by their lack of tact and by  their  too

freely   uttered   comments   on   the   inefficiencies   and

inadequacies of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social graces and living graciously form part of the

value  system of a society. It is about how we live  and  the

quality  of our lifestyle.  It is about individuals  and  the

community and extended communities in which they live. Social

graces are human acts that contribute to community and social

bonding and thereby help build a more stable nation.   Social

graces are part of gracious society and life enrichment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in slightly more than one generation, Singaporeans

moved from the village "kampong" of low-rise buildings to the

city  of  high-rise buildings.  We are now entering the  21st

century  and  beginning  our  move  into  cyberspace.   In  a

"kampong"  society,  people  knew  their  neighbours,   their

children  played  with  their neighbours'  children  and,  in

general, there was a great deal of interaction at all levels.

There was a sort of social support system and much sharing of

joy  and  sorrow.   By  contrast, Sir,  the  modern  city  of

Singapore appears to be a myriad of different people, looking

distinctive and detached.  Neighbours hardly know each  other

when,  in  fact,  they  need to be on even  friendlier  terms

because they live in ever increasing proximity as years go by

and they cannot help but bump into each other every day. Sir,

life would be that much more pleasant if smiles and greetings

were  being exchanged at the start of each day.  And, at  the

end  of  a  hectic day at work, it would be better to  return

home  to  a friendly neighbourhood and an environment without

animosity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans must be persuaded that social bonding

and  neigbourliness are beneficial to all. Back in the 1950s,

researchers stumbled on a curious fact about the citizens  of

Roseto,  Pennsylvania. Their age-adjusted heart  attack  rate

was   less   than   half  that  found  in  the   neighbouring

communities.  The usual explanations were studied, and  ruled

out.  There  was nothing special about their diet,  exercise,

smoking  habits, or genetic predisposition.   But  there  was

something different about the little town. The immigrants who

had  founded  it in the 19th century had come from  the  same

Italian  village, and they had created a tight-knit community

in  its  likeness.  There were strong churches, a mutual  aid

society,  and scout troops.  Rosetans were unusually  willing

to  draw  on one another for financial and emotional support.

They  were  rich  in what today is called social  capital  or

connections  among  individuals - social  networks,  and  the

norms  of  reciprocity and trust that arise  from  them  that

appeared to be the clue to their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>

healthy hearts.  Over the next decades, socially mobile young

people rejected their parents' way of life.  Newcomers  moved

in.  By the 1980s, Roseto's new generation had a heart attack

rate  a  little above that of their neighbours. As the Roseto

story suggests, people whose lives are rich in social capital

can cope better with traumas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being gracious is an attitude. Sir, our attitude towards

others is shaped by the people we are around with and by  the

circumstances  and  situations we encounter.  A  lot  of  our

attitudes were formed when we were young.  Parental influence

is  a  very big factor.  If parents do not model graciousness

in  their  daily living and interactions with their  children

and  others, how can we expect their children to do so?   The

children  then  carry these attitudes into adult  life.  When

they  have  their  own  children,  it  is  a  similar,  self-perpetuating  situation.  We need to arrest this perpetuating

trend now and reverse it by not just targeting the young  but

their parents also.  The promotion of the basic elements of a

gracious society - the responsible and considerate behaviours

must  be stepped up. While most people agree that we may  not

become a socially developed nation overnight, the earlier  we

strive  for this, the better.  Best and speedier results  can

only be obtained if we have the will and the concerted effort

involving  the Government, civil service providers and,  more

importantly,  the people themselves.  The main  crux  of  the

matter   here   is   to  be  successful  in  convincing   our

Singaporeans   that  socially  responsible  and   considerate

behaviours are beneficial to all and that we want to  achieve

the  status  of  a socially developed country  to  match  our

economic  success. Singaporeans do not need  regulations  and

deterrent  punishments  if they are convinced  that  socially

responsible ways can make life better for one and all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we go about achieving the gracious society we

desire?    Sir,   I  would  like  to  offer   the   following

suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government must lead the way. The Government must

continue and further demonstrate to be a caring Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>

Sir,  this  Government must show the way for  the  people  to

follow.   More  resources  must be  put  into  the  focus  on

facilities  as  well  as  programmes  to  develop   Singapore

socially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Policy makers must conscientiously promote

graciousness.  Social and civil services policy makers should

now focus more on community bonding.  Our Government has done

an  excellent  job in providing good quality housing  to  the

people.   The  common  corridor  design  of  the  older   HDB

apartments,  which facilitates interaction among  neighbours,

has  given way to new designs that allow greater privacy  but

lessen interaction among neigbhours.  HDB must provide better

designs  but,  at  the  same  time,  has  neigbourliness   as

priority.   Our  policies, such as foreign spouses  who  have

been  repatriated  because they have  AIDS,  resulting  in  a

breakdown of families and hardships is not the right kind  of

message the Government wants to convey to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just two examples. All our ministries,

when  setting  out policies, should be consciously  promoting

and  be  instrumental  in our efforts to  become  a  gracious

society.  I hope our civil service will take the cue from  PM

Goh and work towards a more gracious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All Singaporeans must make a concerted effort. No

government   can   mandate  people  to  be  considerate   and

responsible.  However, Ministers, MPs and grassroots  leaders

in  society can promote these attributes and set the example.

Sir, we can, together with our grassroots leaders, convey our

national  challenge  to  sustain a  prosperous  and  gracious

Singapore  to our residents and imbue them with  a  sense  of

national purpose.  Being neighbourly is a start to building a

gracious  society and we can make Singapore a nicer place  to

live in by our actions. The crux of the matter lies in making

people   see   that  socially  responsible  and   considerate

behaviours  are beneficial to all.  I would like  to  suggest

that  all  of  us promote the 5Cs of gracious living  to  our

residents in our respective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>

wards.  These  5Cs  are  the  attributes  of  being  cordial,

courteous, caring, considerate and cultured constituents.   I

believe  that the People's Association's involvement in  this

promotion   will  have  beneficial  results   especially   in

coordinating  with our grassroots organisations  and  in  co-sponsoring   the  different  activities  organised   by   our

community centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Graciousness as second nature in our young. Sir,

our  young will be the future of Singapore. Effort should  be

stepped  up  especially for this group when they are  at  the

susceptible years. Starting from as early as pre-school, just

in  very  simple story-telling with an activity to  reinforce

their  learning will be useful. Children pick up things  very

quickly.   Learning to be gracious is not quite like learning

a  textbook subject. The goal is to make graciousness  second

nature.  More innovative ways of imbuing this attitude in our

students   have  to  be  delivered  in  our  school   system.

Currently,  schools  have life skills and  community  service

programmes  that they can broadly interpret  and  apply.  The

success  of  these  programmes  of  course  hinges   on   the

leadership of the principals and the teachers concerned.  The

teacher  who  teaches it must model graciousness  himself  or

herself.  The  teacher  must believe in  it.   The  emotional

quotient  (EQ)  of its people is invaluable if  Singapore  is

going to continue in its success in the new millennium.  What

emphasis  the  Government places on life skills and  personal

development in the school curriculum (of course balanced with

the  academic)  will  ultimately  determine  the  success  of

Singapore becoming a gracious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Expansion of national campaigns. The Singapore

Kindness  Movement, which focuses on small acts of  kindness,

was launched in January 1997, in response to PM Goh's call to

develop  a  more gracious society.  It has made inroads  into

schools  with some imaginative programmes.  It has also  gone

to the nurseries and kindergartens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this movement should be further supported to expand

its programmes to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

target  more  people in our population and to be more  active

and  innovative  throughout the  whole  year.   The  National

Courtesy  Campaign has also made good progress over the  past

22  years and should therefore expand further to reap  better

results  on wider audience.  More mass media use by them  can

bring  about a culture of kindness and consideration  amongst

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Promotion of culture and the arts. A vibrant

society  is  not only reflected in its economy.  It  is  also

reflected in its culture and the arts.  The appreciation  and

the  love  of literature and the arts are aspects of gracious

living.  We  should heed the Chinese saying, lao ye  jie  he,

which  means "strike a proper balance between work and play".

There  are many areas for improvement to further develop  our

arts scene here.  I am glad that the arts will receive a  $50

million  extra funding as part of Government's plans to  turn

Singapore  into  a  world-class city with a vibrant  cultural

scene.   The  key  to  the success of Government's  five-year

investment in the arts is that the audience base must grow in

tandem with the funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be no good if we could afford stage

production  after stage production with no audience  support.

Hence,  more effort must be spent in this area. The flagship-companies  scheme must also include training  and  developing

talent,  churning  out  productions  that  are  creative  and

commensurate with the audience level and opening their  doors

beyond the exclusive clique of the artistes and taking on the

responsibility of bringing the arts to a wider audience.   In

many  major  cities  of  the  world,  parks  are  areas   for

relaxation and are ideal locations for sculptures.  We do not

have the luxury of the land here, but the banks of our rivers

and canals can be further maximised for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end by referring to what Prime

Minister  Goh said when he addressed grassroots organisations

at the Triennial Conference in 1994, and I quote:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our challenge is how to sustain our prosperity and

continually  improve  the non-material, moral  and  spiritual

aspects  of  our lives.  Beyond prosperity, we  can  build  a

gracious society, a good society, a society of distinction."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Dr Lily Neo has identified

having  responsibility and consideration for  others  as  the

building blocks for a gracious society.  I thank her for  her

many  suggestions  and I am very sure my  colleagues  in  the

various   Ministries  will  respond  and  look   into   these

suggestions put forward by her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our vision in Singapore 21 is to make Singapore our

best  home.  If Singapore is just a place for people to  make

money,  earn a good living, and nothing more than that,  then

our  vision will not come through.  What we need to do is  to

continue  to  strengthen our social foundation,  inject  more

civility  into  our  daily life and  make  Singapore  a  more

pleasant and gracious place for all to live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every day we come into contact with many people.

Some are friends and colleagues we have known for years.   So

it  is only natural that we treat them with human decency and

courtesy.   This is good, but this is not good enough.   This

is not good enough to make us a gracious society, because our

real  challenge  is for everyone to learn to respect  others,

not  just friends whom we have known for years, but  also  to

respect strangers whom we may be meeting for the first  time,

regardless  of  their stations in life.  This  may  not  come

naturally  for many Singaporeans yet, but we must  try.   For

example,  when we sit down at a hawker centre and  a  cleaner

comes  along to clean the table, do we grab our things, cover

our  nose,  turn our body and mumble to ourselves,  "Hmm,  so

smelly!"?  Or do we smile, look at him or her in the eyes and

say,  "Thank you for cleaning my table"?  It is actually  not

so difficult, only if we try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, if we are in a restaurant or in a shop, do we

go  around  ordering the sales staff because the customer  is

king, or do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

we  put  across our request politely and thank them  for  the

service  and show our appreciation?  The question really  is:

whose job it is to turn Singapore into a gracious society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one day, there was a job to be done. Four persons

came together.  Their names were Everybody, Somebody, Anybody

and  Nobody.  Everybody thought that this job should be  done

by Somebody.  Anybody could have done the job but, at the end

of the day, Nobody did the job.  So Everybody was very upset,

because  Anybody  could  have done the  job.   They  expected

Somebody  to take the lead, but it ended up Nobody doing  it.

So,  you  have a situation whereby Everybody blamed Somebody,

where actually Anybody could have done the job that ended  up

with Nobody doing it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is quite clear that we can only become a

truly gracious society only if every Singaporean plays a part

and  make  mutual  respect for others  our  way  of  life  in

Singapore.  I want to assure Dr Neo and Members of this House

that the Government will surely do its part to ensure that we

create the environment for this to take place.  But as Dr Neo

has suggested, all Singaporeans must make a concerted effort.

In this regard, instead of calling for the Government to take

the  lead  and for the policy makers to promote and act,  why

not let all of us in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>

take the lead together so that we can get there sooner rather

than later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us can observe each other and learn from

each  other  every day all the time.  We can look around  us,

observe how our fellow Singaporeans behave and interact  with

each  other.  If we like what we see, let them be the windows

of  our  life.  Look out of the windows and learn from  their

graciousness.   If  we  do not like  what  we  see  in  their

behaviour, then let them be our mirror in life.  Look at  the

mirror  and  ask, "Do we behave this way too?"  Reflect,  and

learn from other's mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say that in the

spirit  of  Singapore  21,  I join  Dr  Neo  in  calling  all

Singaporeans  to step forward as active citizens,  strengthen

our  social  foundation and reinvent the  Singapore  society.

Working  together, we can, and in PM's words, "build  a  more

gracious   society,  a  good  society  and   a   society   of

distinction."    Hopefully, let us do it sooner  rather  than

later.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether

the  Government  will consider giving (i) more  varieties  of

scholarships in terms of varying years of bonding and  amount

of  pecuniary  involvement; (ii) prestige or  acknowledgement

scholarships  with  no  monetary  involvement;    and   (iii)

scholarships  with  flexible terms  like  deferment  of  bond

service for further postgraduate courses and/or training.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government scholarships today already vary in terms of

the  years  of  bond,  as  well as in  the  pecuniary  amount

involved.  The  number  of years of bond  associated  with  a

scholarship  depends  on the type of  award  and  country  of

study.  For PSC, for example, the bond is 6 years for US  and

UK,  5  years for France, Germany, Japan and the PRC,  and  4

years  for  the local scholarships. The amount of sponsorship

also  varies across countries, depending on the cost  of  the

university  education as well as the cost of living.   Hence,

the liquidated damages vary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government scholarships are given for the purpose of

identifying,  inducting and grooming talent  for  the  public

sector.  Thus,  the Government is not in favour  of  awarding

prestige nor acknowledgement scholarships without the scholar

making  a  commitment to serve in the public  service  (Since

1993,  President  Scholarships have not  been  awarded  on  a

nominal  basis to individuals.  The last time it was  awarded

nominally,  was  to  a  scholar to  pursue  Medicine  at  the

University of Cambridge in 1992.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already much flexibility in the treatment of

Government  scholars.   First, scholarship  bonds  have  been

shortened  from 6-8 to 4-6 years to keep up with  the  times.

Scholars  are now encouraged to pursue a much wider range  of

disciplines.  Many scholarships also allow scholars who  meet

the  criteria  to go for postgraduate studies.  For  example,

those on the SAF, SPF or PSC's Overseas Merit Scholarships or

OMS,  have  a Master's programme worked in as part  of  their

scholarship terms, as long as they complete their studies  in

4  years.   There  are  also about 10 PSC  scholars  who  are

pursuing  doctoral programmes.  On getting their PhDs,  their

bonds may be transferred to the local Universities or to  one

of  our  public  sector  research  institutions.   Government

scholars  also  go  for  industrial and research  attachments

locally and overseas with our blessings.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOLARSHIP BONDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  (a) whether there is a rising trend, over the  last

five   years,   of  Government  scholars  who   broke   their

scholarship  bonds;  (b) whether the  scholar's  parents  and

guardians should be required to sign a performance bond for a

specific  sum, on the basis that they can exert  their  moral

influence  on the scholars; and (c) whether fiscal  deterrent

measures  can  be  imposed  by requiring  the  bond-breakers'

prospective  employers to recompense the bond  on  a  non-tax

deductible basis and requiring the bond-breakers to be  taxed

in full for any reimbursement made by their employers towards

the bond payment.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the PSC is the largest scholarship provider, I asked

them  for  their statistics.  The figures show that over  the

last five years, the number of PSC scholars who have broken

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>

bond  each  year,  as  a proportion of the  total  number  of

scholars currently in service under bond, has fallen from  5%

in  1995  to  2%  in 1999.   In PSC's experience,  the  bond-breaking rate rises when the economy is doing well,  and  our

salaries   get   out  of  line  with  the   private   sector.

Conversely, the rate falls when the economy is not  doing  so

well.  This is only natural.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the proportion of bond-breakers is

low.   The  newspaper debate that followed the  Sunday  Times

front-page  article had created an exaggerated impression  of

the  severity  of the problem.  We should see this  issue  in

perspective,  otherwise  we  would  be  unfair  to  the  vast

majority of scholars who did not break their bonds and who do

not intend to break their bonds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government scholarship deed requires two sureties.

The  scholar accepts the scholarship with the full knowledge,

consent  and approval of the two sureties.  The sureties  are

usually  the  parents, immediate relatives and  close  family

friends.   Thus, when a scholar is thinking of  breaking  his

bond,  he  not  only has to consider his moral obligation  to

serve,  but  also the trust and expectations his parents  and

sureties have of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax system is set up for a larger purpose. It

should not be used per se to deter bond breakers.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>PROCREATION POLICIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  his Government intends (i) to review the success  of

the policies adopted to improve procreation in Singapore; and

(ii) to consider, in line with most private sector practices,

a five-day working week to allow civil servants to spend more

time with their families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (for the Prime Minister):</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has announced in his National Day

Rally Speech on 20th August 2000 two measures to address  the

problem of falling total fertility rate in Singapore.   These

are  the  Baby  Bonus Scheme and paid third  child  maternity

leave.  The Prime Minister has also said that more supporting

measures  will be announced soon as it is important  that  we

have  a total environment conducive to raising a family.   He

has  appointed  Mr  Lim  Boon Heng to chair  a  committee  to

oversee this critical matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's query on 5-day working week for

civil   servants,  PSD's  approach  is  to  give   Government

ministries some flexibility to decide on their working hours.

If  ministries choose to adjust the working hours  for  their

officers   within  the  overall  framework  of  the   42-hour

workweek, PSD has no objection so long as this improves their

levels  of  service  to  the  public,  and  does  not  affect

productivity.  However, there will be no general rule for the

whole Civil Service to switch to a 5-day working week.  Doing

so  would  send  the wrong signal that since  the  Government

itself is now working fewer days, we have now arrived and  it

is all right for workers throughout the economy to shift to a

less intense pace.

<div align="center"><b>RETIRED CIVIL SERVANTS' PENSION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  pensions of retired civil servants will be  adjusted

in the light of the recent public sector salary revision.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions are calculated based on the pensionable

component in an officer's last-drawn salary and the length of

his pensionable service.  As pensions are given on account of

past service, they are not adjusted whenever the salaries  of

serving officers are revised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government does recognise that some of the

older  pensioners are receiving low pensions relative to  the

cost of living, and therefore assists them by paying a top-up

allowance, called the Singapore Allowance, to supplement  the

pensions that they receive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Allowance was last revised in August 1997,

when   it   was   raised  from  $130  to  $140   per   month.

Concurrently,  the  gross  pension  eligibility  ceiling  was

raised from $900 to $950 per month.  Since 1997, the Consumer

Price  Index  has  increased by only  2.1%.  This  year,  MTI

projects  inflation  to  be  only  1-2%.   Nonetheless,   the

Government  will  review the present quantum and  eligibility

ceiling  for the Singapore Allowance, to determine if another

revision is justified.

projects  to restore the growth of the construction  industry

which  has  contracted  by 9.8% for  the  eighth  consecutive

quarter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of contract value, construction demand in

Singapore has dropped from its peak of $23.5 billion in  1997

to  $15.3  billion in 1998 and $11.7 billion  in  1999.   For

2000,  however, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA)

has  forecasted that construction demand would rise to  $17.3

billion,  an  increase  of  $5.6  billion  from  1999.   This

increase   is   mainly  due  to  two  Government  reclamation

projects.  However, the volume of building works is  expected

to remain stagnant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a time lag between the award of contract and

the  progress payments made, the construction industry  could

move  into  positive value-added growth towards  the  end  of

2001.   This  is  provided that the good performance  of  the

economy is maintained over the next two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To boost the construction demand and to take advantage

of  the  competitive tender prices, the Government  has  been

looking  at  ways  to advance some of the infrastructure  and

institutional  projects.  The number of projects  awarded  by

the  public  sector rose by 25% in 1999, although  the  total

value  of  projects still fell.  This is mainly due to  lower

tender  prices. The Government will continue to look at  ways

to  advance  the  public sector projects, particularly  those

that  are  nearing  the tender calling  stage.   However,  as

construction projects would need a few years to complete, any

action taken now will not lead to immediate results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local contractors would inevitably be affected by the

fall  in  construction demand. According  to  BCA's  records,

local  contractors have been concentrating  their  activities

mainly  in  building projects. To soften the  impact  and  to

avoid  being  adversely affected by  the  slow  down  in  the

building  workload,  local  contractors  should  consolidate,

merge  or  diversify their operation to participate in  large

scale  infrastructure works.  They should also use this  time

to  improve their productivity, skills and competitiveness to

prepare for the recovery of the industry.

<div align="center"><b>NOISE POLLUTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment   whether  he  will  consider  installing   sound

barriers to reduce traffic noise pollution along expressways.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment,  as  vehicles  and  MRT  trains  are  additional

sources  of noise when they pass near residential  areas  and

schools,   whether  he  will  consider  introducing  acoustic

barriers to reduce the impact of the noise to the residential

areas and schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been working closely with the Ministry

of   Communications  and  Information  Technology,  and   the

Ministry of National Development to reduce the noise  problem

from vehicles and MRT trains on nearby residential areas  and

schools.   Some of the measures taken include the  imposition

of   set-back  distance  on  roads  and  train  tracks   from

residential  buildings, noise standards for  new  and  in-use

vehicles,  road design, and the use of low-noise MRT  trains.

Studies  have  shown  that the noise  levels  at  residential

buildings and schools near roads and MRT tracks are generally

within the guidelines adopted by ENV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority previously studied the use

of  noise  barriers  along expressways. It  found  that  such

barriers   may  not  be  effective  in  shielding  noise   in

Singapore's   high-rise   setting,   because   they    cannot

effectively block the noise on the higher floors, unless they

completely envelop the entire expressway.  Nevertheless,  LTA

will  study each case on its own merits, and if feasible  and

effective, will consider erecting noise barriers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise however that in land-scarce and highly-urbanised Singapore, some degree of noise pollution is

inevitable.   While  we can impose certain building  set-back

and   other  requirements  at  the  planning  stage  for  new

developments, there is much less room to reduce noise problem

in  built-up areas with an intensive road network  and  heavy

traffic flows.

<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC CONGESTION ALONG THE CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology how he proposes  to

solve  the  traffic congestion problem at the  Braddell  Road

exit along Central Expressway towards Ang Mo Kio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many motorists travelling along the Central Expressway

(CTE)  towards  Ang Mo Kio exit at Braddell Road  during  the

evening  peak hours.  The Braddell Road exit leads  into  the

junction  of  Braddell Road/CTE under the CTE flyover.   This

junction  experiences  very heavy  traffic  flow  both  along

Braddell Road as well as along the CTE Braddell Road exit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic flow along Braddell Road and the Braddell

Road  exit  of  the CTE will improve when the interchange  at

Braddell  Road/CTE junction is expanded.  The Land  Transport

Authority is currently constructing a 3-level interchange  at

this  junction.  A vehicular underpass is being built to take

the  main  Braddell  Road traffic under this  junction,  thus

avoiding  the  traffic signals.  Work, which is in  progress,

will  be completed by end of 2002. Once this main traffic  is

taken away from this signalised junction, more green time can

be  given  to  the CTE Braddell Road exit.  The traffic  flow

along the Braddell  Road exit will then be smoother.

<div align="center"><b>UNDERGROUND PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   his

Ministry   will  consider  building  underground   pedestrian

walkways  to  link  up  City Hall MRT station  to  the  major

commercial buildings in North Bridge Road/High Street area to

improve  the  road  safety and ease  the  traffic  congestion

there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it is cost effective to do so, the Land Transport

Authority  (LTA) will provide underground linkages  from  MRT

stations  to nearby major developments.  When City  Hall  MRT

station  was  built,  it  was linked  to  Raffles  City.   An

underground  pedestrian  walkway was also  constructed  under

Stamford  Road  to  connect the station to the  St.  Andrew's

Cathedral  side  of  North Bridge  Road.   More  recently,  a

private  developer  has constructed an  underground  shopping

mall,  City Link, that connects Suntec City to the City  Hall

MRT   station.   These  walkways  take  care  of  the   major

pedestrian movements to and from the MRT station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has no plans to provide an underground walkway from

City Hall MRT station to the North Bridge Road/High Street

area.  The commercial developments in this area are less

intensive and hence attract a lower pedestrian traffic.

There are already adequate pedestrian crossings at the

signalised junctions and good walkways along North Bridge

Road for pedestrians' use.
