<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, carrying on from where hon. Member Irene Ng left off

yesterday,  this cut on the abandoned babies  has  to  do

with  the  situation  as we currently  have.   Given  the

existing  law  at the same time and our concern  for  the

well-being of the abandoned babies, what can the Ministry

do  to  help the community understand the issues  and  to

find  ways  and means to help abandoned babies and  their

mothers and/or putative fathers so as to send a signal to

the  society  at large that, while we do not condone  the

abandonment of babies, we would still help the  expecting

mothers  and  their  babies and,  where  possible,  their

fathers too?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, yesterday, my

colleague spoke on the abandonment of babies and the need

to  provide  a safe environment for them.   I  could  not

agree more because, each year, there are many couples who

head  for  places elsewhere to look for babies to  adopt.

Yet,  in  Singapore, we have, on average,  five  or  more

abandoned  babies each year.  I was told there were  five

in 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many well-meaning Singaporeans out

there  who  are more than happy to accept these  children

and  we give them a safe and warm environment.  They  are

prepared to give our babies a second chance.  It  is  not

for  us  to  judge the morality of the parents  who  dump

these children.  There are reasons for wanting to abandon

the  babies, albeit anonymously.  The law, as Prof. Ngiam

has  earlier  pointed out, does not  make  it  legal  for

anyone to abandon babies.  They could be jailed for up to

seven  years  and  be fined.  There are penal  provisions

like  these,  and  we wonder why people are  not  leaving

their  babies  at HDB doorsteps, or even offering  babies

for adoption at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister, in his recent reply, said that

only  a  few  jurisdictions allow for legal  dropping  of

babies.   I  had wanted to ask the Minister if  in  these

jurisdictions,  the introduction of such legislation  has

resulted in an increase in the number of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



babies  being abandoned.  Even if it has, does it matter?

The  issue at hand is one of morality.  Of course, it may

be  said  that  permitting mothers to drop  their  babies

anonymously  may encourage foreign workers to  unlawfully

get  pregnant, and to choose baby abandonment as  opposed

to  abortion  as  the preferred route to  deal  with  the

problem.  I am referring here to the sex workers and work

permit  holders.  The problem may be more  apparent  than

real,  as it can be dealt with administratively.  We  can

require  them to go for more regular check-ups to surface

their  pregnancy  way  before the full  term.   And  this

leaves  us  only  with  a  very  small  segment  of   the

population  who could possibly get away with an  unlawful

pregnancy.  My suspicion is that, as in the days when  we

tacitly  allowed  babies to be dropped at  CHIJ,  we  may

never have a greater number of abandoned babies than  was

the case previously.  This baby drop was stopped sometime

in the 1980s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that allowing parents to anonymously leave

their  babies  will  allow  for greater  opportunity  for

counselling and advice since they will have the  absolute

assurance  that the full weight of the law  will  not  be

thrown at them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to relook at our policies. The problem will

not go away by denying the legality of baby drops.  Think

of  the  babies who have been abandoned in  the  previous

year.   One was left bloodied and naked, in a lift  lobby

at  Sims  Place.  She was lying on newspapers  and  could

have  been easily mauled by stray dogs, attracted by  the

smell of the mother's blood fresh on the skin of the new-born baby.  Another was left on the bench at the basement

of  KK  Women's  and Children's Hospital  on  a  November

evening.   Yet, a third was found in a cardboard  box  in

the  lift  landing of a block of flats  in  Tiong  Bahru.

Over  the  last  month, we had two abandoned  babies  who

died.   How  many  more babies have  to  die  before  the

Government will act?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not personally think that there are compelling

reasons not to allow legal baby drops for adoption.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin, could you finish your speech

soon?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Yes, I am finishing. I will just

finish by saying that a life is a life no less, no matter

what  the  colour  is.   I would  urge  the  Minister  to

reconsider.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, I would

like to thank hon. Members who have spoken about our  TFR

and  the  need for us to look into the issue of abandoned

babies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry defines its policy goal on family in a

simple phrase:  "More Strong and Stable Families".  Short

and sweet, to the point.  Our policies are designed to be

pro-family, pro-marriage and pro-children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first talk about our policy goal of "More

Families".   Mr Charles Chong, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee  Shoon,  Dr

Jennifer  Lee and Dr Maliki have asked about our marriage

and  birth trends.  Sir, Members must well know that  the

birth  rates have not been very encouraging in  the  past

few  years.  The number of resident births fell to 38,700

in  2002, compared to 39,300 in 2001 and nearly 45,000 in

2000.   The total fertility rate has continued  to  fall,

from  1.6 in 2000 to 1.41 in 2001.  Last year, it  hit  a

record low of 1.37.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2000, the Prime Minister announced the Baby

Bonus  and the Third Child Paid Maternity Leave  schemes.

Together  with  these  two schemes,  we  also  introduced

marriage  and  paternity leave in the civil service,  and

extended  the  childcare subsidy to non-working  mothers.

In  2002, the child sick leave was made available to male

civil  servants and extended to children up to  12  years

old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of measures we introduced in 2000 takes

a   holistic  approach,  providing  not  only   increased

financial   support,  but  also  measures  to  strengthen

childcare options, work-life practices as well as  public

education.   Our  approach has been  to  create  a  total

social   environment  conducive  to  family  and   having

children.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my Ministry is concerned with the fall in

fertility rates, we think that it would be too  hasty  to

conclude that these initiatives are ineffective.   Family

policy,  however well developed, requires  a  strong  and

stable economic environment to achieve its purpose  of  a

stable  or  high  TFR.  Let me quote  the  experience  of

another  country  to  explain.  Between  1990  and  1993,

Sweden suffered from an economic crisis.  The Swedish GDP

declined  by  5%.  At the same time, the number  of  jobs

fell  by  nearly 10%.  Along with the economic  recession

came  the  decline in TFR, from 2.14 in 1990 to  1.59  in

1996.   Since  then it has hovered around 1.5.   Economic

cycles and economic prospects impact fertility rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all we know, our birth rates could have been

worse  if  not for the schemes that I mentioned  earlier.

Let  me quote another example.  Quebec introduced a  baby

bonus scheme, formally known as the Allowance for Newborn

Children in 1988.  After an initial rise in TFR, Quebec's

TFR started falling.  Many thought the scheme had failed.

And in 1997, the scheme was removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, an empirical study published in 2002 by

Kevin Milligan, an Associate Professor in Economics  from

the   University   of  British  Columbia,   has   a   new

perspective.  Milligan says that Quebec's fertility  rate

was  worse  than the rest of Canada throughout the  1980s

before  the  baby bonus.  But after the  baby  bonus  was

introduced, the fertility gap between Quebec and the rest

of  Canada  was reduced by 86%.  Milligan estimates  that

the  baby  bonus  probably resulted in  an  extra  93,000

births,  over and above the births that would have  taken

place  even if there was no baby bonus.  This represented

a  14.5% increase.  While Milligan's study may not be the

last   word,   it  does  serve  to  caution  us   against

prematurely evaluating our policies.  So let us not be in

a  hurry  to  throw  the proverbial  baby  out  with  the

bathwater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's baby bonus helps couples to defray part

of  the cost of bringing up their children.  Couples  can

use the baby bonus to pay for infant care, childcare and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



kindergarten fees for all their children.  As at the  end

of  February 2003, some 31,800 children and 3,400 mothers

have  benefited from the Baby Bonus and Third Child  Paid

Maternity  Leave  schemes respectively. They  received  a

total  of  $46 million under the Baby Bonus scheme.   For

the  Third  Child  Maternity  Leave,  $18.8  million  was

disbursed for the same time period.  Close to 90% of  the

families  have  co-saved into the Children's  Development

Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee suggested that we study the European

countries  which  have higher fertility  rates.   Indeed,

some   countries  have  bucked  the  trend   of   falling

fertility.   One  example  is  Norway.   Norway's   total

fertility  rate has remained around 1.8 in  the  past  10

years.   Another  example is France.  In  1993,  France's

total  fertility  rate was 1.66, but 10 years  later,  in

2002, total fertility rate had rebounded to 1.9, which is

high  among  developed countries.   The  relatively  high

birth  rates  in both countries were often attributed  to

generous maternity and parental leave schemes, as well as

family   and  child  support.   Interestingly,  the   CNA

reported  last  month  that Singaporeans  living  in  the

Cazaux Airbase in France are enjoying a baby boom!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are valuable lessons that we can learn. My

Ministry is far from throwing in the towel.  Instead,  we

are  studying the policies implemented in those countries

to  see what we can learn and adapt to the local context.

We,  of  course,  have to bear in mind  the  culture  and

societal  norms which enabled those policies to  work  in

the  countries  I mentioned earlier.  The  challenge  for

Singapore  is  to  replicate the successful  policies  of

those countries in a different operating environment  and

culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Jennifer Lee also notes that immigration

should  not be the only solution to our falling fertility

problem.   I agree with her.  Whilst we must continue  to

attract new citizens to top up our population, we must be

mindful that many countries are also competing for  them.

My  Ministry  believes  that the  renewal  of  the  local

population will remain critical in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has suggested that there be an

Inter-Ministerial  Committee called  Making  Singaporeans

Committee to arrest the decline of our TFR.  I would like

to  assure  the  Member that the two existing  committees

that  he mentioned will continue to consult our community

partners  and  the  public,  particularly  young  married

couples,  in reviewing our policies to achieve that  much

needed breakthrough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Singaporeans are marrying later. In 2002, the

median age of marriage was 26.2 years for women and  28.9

years for men.  In 1990, it was 25.3 years and 27.9 years

respectively.  At the same time, not many married couples

would have their first child immediately.  And if we  are

lucky,  some may even consider having a second or even  a

third.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this phenomenon is understandable. Our young,

especially those who go on to tertiary education, spend a

considerable amount of time studying. But once they start

working,  they  want to focus on building their  careers.

Graduate  women tend to start a family when they  are  30

while  those  with  post-secondary  education  are   only

slightly earlier, usually starting their family when they

are  about 29 years old.  After all, multi-tasking  is  a

favourite  buzzword  today, but when  it  comes  to  life

goals, we seem to be single-mindedly single-tasking!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who wait longer would come across another

barrier, and Dr Balaji has mentioned this earlier.   This

time it is mother nature.  In a Straits Times' article on

3rd January 2003, Dr Christopher Chen from the Gleneagles

Hospital  estimates  that  1  in  5  couples  here   face

fertility  problems.  Conceiving at a later  age  reduces

the  opportunity to have more children as  the  fertility

window is narrower.

<br>11.15 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I would like to cite my own personal

example.   I followed the model that I mentioned earlier.

I met my wife in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



the US, got married, but both of us were studying and had

our  first  child when I was 40 years old,  after  I  had

established my career in NUS and bought a home.   We  had

our second child when I was 42 years old.  If you ask  me

now  whether we want to have a third child, my wife would

say  no,  only because she is getting older.  So,  it  is

very difficult that, as we try to plan for our lives,  we

also  have to understand that there are choices  that  we

have  to make and, as we make the choices much later,  we

actually  reduce the opportunity for us to have a  larger

family.   I  came from a family of nine; I wish  to  have

four.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how do we overcome this challenge? It is not

easy,  but  we  must  try. As Mr  Charles  Chong  rightly

pointed out, there must be both monetary support and non-monetary   incentives   to  help   create   a   conducive

environment for Singaporeans to have more children.   So,

we  facilitate  interactions through  the  SDU  and  SDS,

introduce  procreation measures to help couples  to  have

more  babies,  and provide care services  for  the  young

ones,  so  that the parents can continue to  build  their

careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Maliki have asked about the

effectiveness  of the Social Development Unit  (SDU)  and

the Social Development Services (SDS).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDU and SDS ran an operating budget of about

$3.7  million  in  FY2002.   Together,  they  have  about

105,000   members.   On  average,  about   2,500   social

activities   are   run  every  year   for   over   74,000

participants.  In addition, about 10,000 members actively

participate in both the units' dating services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proportion of married female graduates

increased from about 44% in 1987, to 57% in 2001.   Since

its inception 19 years ago, I am happy to say that nearly

30,000  SDU members have gotten married.  For  SDS,  more

than 100,000 members have married since 1985.  This is  a

success rate of about 55% of total SDS membership.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki asked if we do review the effectiveness of

our  SDU  programmes in view of the changing  profile  of

singles.  Indeed, SDU reviews its programmes regularly to

attract the interest of the changing needs of each cohort

of  singles.  Towards the end of 2000, SDU outsourced the

management  of  its socialisation activities  to  Premier

Club,  a  private company.  Since then, many  new  dating

programmes have been introduced, including Speed  Dating,

Blind  Dates, and Zodiac Dates, which have proven  to  be

very popular.  This positive change is evidenced by a 20%

increase  in  the  participation from  members  who  were

previously inactive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Dr Maliki's concern about marriage not being

a  priority among his students.  From a survey  conducted

by  my  Ministry,  18% of couples met their  partners  at

their workplace, while another 17% met them at school  or

university.  Dr Maliki would thus be pleased to know that

the  SDU is pro-active, and will be rolling out a funding

scheme  by the new academic year, called Project  Network

to  co-fund student bodies' activities aimed at promoting

gender interaction and relationship-building skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, Mr Eddie Teo, Permanent Secretary in

the Prime Minister's Office, was asked what he would like

to  say  about the President's scholarship that  he  got.

His  last words on this were: Oxford was where I  met  my

wife.  A year or two later, when he was addressing a  PSC

seminar,   he  reminded  the  young  crowd  of  potential

scholars and their parents of the importance of balancing

school  and social life.   He shared how he had bought  a

bicycle  so  that  he  could visit  his  wife,  then  his

girlfriend, every day.  His only lament was that the  PSC

refused  to  up  his allowance, and thus  he  could  only

afford  a  pounds5 bicycle with no brakes and no  lights!

Perhaps,  PSC  knew better, for who needs a  bright  lamp

when romance is in the air?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my fellow MPs will agree that socialising is

indeed  important, and it is important to balance  school

and social life, or work and social life. SDU and SDS

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



help  our  singles get that balance.  Given  Dr  Maliki's

fervent  interest in the subject, I hope I can  count  on

his  support and assistance to promote social  activities

in  the university; so too Prof. Ngiam.  Dr Jennifer  Lee

talked  about  the importance of institutions.   I  would

call   on  the  universities  and  institutes  of  higher

learning  to  play an active role in facilitating  social

activities  for their students.  In fact,  I  would  also

urge  all employers to play their part to help us address

this national concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Ms Irene Ng asked about childcare

centres.   They  have  indeed raised a  highly  pertinent

point,   for   the  availability  and  affordability   of

childcare  are  critical, if we are to  encourage  family

formation.  There are now 632 childcare centres providing

53,000 places, and the take-up rate is about 72%.   Thus,

there  are  enough places to meet demand at  the  moment.

While  we have plans this year to develop 50 more centres

to provide an additional 3,500 places, we will only do so

when  the  enrolment  picks up.  We will  also  encourage

employers  to  set  up workplace childcare  centres  but,

ultimately, this will have to depend on demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childcare centre subsidy rate is currently $150

for  working mothers who place their children in full-day

care,  and  $75  for  working  mothers  who  place  their

children in half-day care.  Non-working mothers who place

their  children  in full or half-day care  also  enjoy  a

subsidy of $75.  In this financial year, my Ministry  has

disbursed a total of $54 million of subsidies so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed this Committee last year that my Ministry

would  look into a pro-rated childcare subsidy to mothers

who  need  flexible childcare.  I am happy to inform  the

Committee that my Ministry has introduced such a  subsidy

programme from January this year.  As of 13th March 2003,

140 children are benefiting from the pro-rated subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Ms Irene Ng have also spoken on

infant  care.  I agree with them that more  needs  to  be

done  to  develop infant care.  Presently, there  are  13

infant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



care  centres with 170 places.  Centres that offer infant

care  have  stricter requirements in terms of staff-child

ratios.  This is because babies need a greater amount  of

individual  attention.  Staff are also specially  trained

for  infant  care.  Because of this, the fees for  infant

care range from $650 to $1,500, which are higher than the

fees  for  the older age groups.  My Ministry  recognises

that  the  childcare  subsidy may  be  insufficient  when

compared to the infant care fees.  While I have mentioned

earlier  that the baby bonus may also be used  to  offset

the  infant  care  fees, we are currently  reviewing  the

situation  to ensure that services remain affordable  for

parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng mentioned that when she surveyed her

constituency, she found that the demand for  infant  care

centres  was  high.  The waiting lists  at  the  existing

infant  care centres are also testimony that centre-based

care  can be a suitable option for some families.  Ms  Ng

will  be pleased to know that MCDS is looking at  how  to

increase the supply of infant care across the island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS has no objection, should operators want to

operate their centres round the clock, if this is to meet

the  needs  of parents working night shifts and irregular

work  patterns.  However, our regulations state  that  no

one  child  should remain in the centre for 24  hours  or

more  continuously.  Members would agree with me  that  a

childcare  centre should not be operated as a residential

institution  for young children.  My Ministry  takes  the

view  that  no baby or pre-school child should remain  in

centre-based care for the better part of 24  hours  on  a

regular basis.  Home care, at least for part of the  day,

and   the   opportunity  to  bond  with  one   consistent

caregiver,  preferably a parent, is in the best  interest

of babies and young children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is consistent with the practices

observed  in  other developed countries.   Thus  far,  my

Ministry  has not received any application for a  24-hour

childcare centre licence.  I assure the Committee that my

Ministry will assess all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



applications  carefully to prevent abuse,  and  that  the

developmental   well-being  of  the   children   is   not

compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to centre-based infant care, my

Ministry has piloted the Family Day Care, which is  home-based infant care with trained babysitters.   This scheme

allows  housewives  and retirees to care  for  babies  or

young  children, and earn income in their  own  home.   I

believe  Dr Lily Neo mentioned this yesterday.  It  could

be  a  suitable  option,  particularly  for  infants  and

children  under  18 months, as it provides  care  by  one

consistent  caregiver  in  a  home  setting.   Since   my

announcement last year that the scheme would  be  piloted

by  Southeast and Southwest CDCs, Northeast CDC has  also

joined in the pilot.  So far, 600 care-providers and  300

parents have registered for this scheme.  It is premature

to  consider  accrediting the caregivers at  this  stage.

However  the three CDCs keep a record of those  who  have

been trained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are possibly many more models of care which

can  be  explored to suit the needs of different parents.

My   Ministry   welcomes  more  suggestions,   and   also

encourages more organisations and enterprises to come  up

with innovative ideas and solutions to meet our childcare

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have asked also about what we are

doing to strengthen families in Singapore.  I will ask my

Minister  of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to respond to  these

questions  later.   Let me now turn  to  the  subject  of

abandoned babies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concerns of Ms Irene Ng, Prof. Ngiam Tee

Liang  and  Mr Sin Boon Ann about the plight of abandoned

babies.  On average, five babies were abandoned each year

from  1997 to 2002.  Since January 2003, two babies  were

abandoned and two were found dead.  Of the two  dead,  we

know  for  sure  that  one  of them  was  stillborn;  the

Coroner's   report  on  the  second  is  still   pending.

Notwithstanding  these clarifications, I  share  Members'

concern  that  babies are involved.   This  is  a  highly

emotive issue,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



and there are no easy answers.  What we all share is that

we  want babies to be safe, and we also want to help  the

mothers as well.  Indeed, our hearts go out to the babies

and  their mothers.  The question is how to help both  of

them effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, pregnant women in distress can seek help.

They  must  be aware that, if they come forward  and  say

that they are unable to keep their babies, they will  not

be  prosecuted  for  abandonment.  We  have  a  care  and

counselling system that has prevented desperate  acts  of

endangering a baby's well-being. This system has  worked.

Last   year,  515  enquiries  on  pregnancy  issues  were

received  through  the hotlines.  Of these,  33  pregnant

women were helped at the shelters, 19 later gave up their

babies  for adoption, while the rest were helped to  keep

their  babies.   In  assisting the  pregnant  women,  the

social  workers walk through all the options  with  them,

and  support them all the way.  This will ensure that the

well-being of both the baby and the mother is taken  care

of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is a role for the community.

Pregnancy takes nine months.  A woman cannot go about her

life   unnoticed.   Those  around  her  can  and   should

encourage her and even accompany her to come forward  for

help.  Whatever the circumstances she faces,  abandonment

can  never be the solution. She could alert someone, even

a  stranger,  to hand over the child, if she cannot  take

care of the baby.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity about the help is also very important.

Even countries that have tried safe havens or baby drops,

have  not  been  able  to  stop abandonment  and  related

deaths,  either because the mothers are in  no  frame  of

mind  to  use such baby drops, or because they  were  not

aware  of them.  Ours is an approach that seeks  to  help

both the mother and the baby.   Of course, it is best for

women  to  seek assistance early, before the birth  of  a

baby  but,  even if they do not, we can still  help  them

after  the  delivery, if they feel unable to  keep  their

child.  It is never too late to come forward for help.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to further publicise the system and,

especially, the helplines and hotlines for pregnant women

in  distress.  In this regard, my Ministry has  made  24-hour  helpline  numbers readily available at  the  notice

boards of Residents Committee centres.  This is the flyer

that  we  have  put  up  in all the  Residents  Committee

centres [indicating].  Anyone who is facing problems  and

needs  support  should tap into the care and  counselling

system.   Confidentiality is assured  for  all  who  come

forward  for  help,  and we will increase  our  publicity

efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls for legislative changes and to

set  up baby drops. Both Mr Sin Boon Ann and Ms Irene  Ng

have said that it is not for us to judge the morality  of

the  parents who dump their children.  Let me assure them

again  that  if mothers come forward, they  will  not  be

prosecuted  for abandonment.  That is key.  Let  me  also

say that it is not so much a question of morality as much

as  it  is  a concern that we will inadvertently endanger

the lives of more babies, if we legalise abandonment.  By

lifting the inalienable responsibility of parents to care

for  and  protect their children, we risk the safety  and

lives  of many more babies and children.  Moreover, there

is no evidence to suggest that, by legalising abandonment

at  baby  drops,  desperate  acts,  such  as  the  recent

instance  where a baby was found with the umbilical  cord

intact, would be stopped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a system where those who step forward

early  are supported by social workers and given shelter,

if necessary.  There are many instances where both mother

and baby have been helped this way and have moved on with

their lives.  The system does not discriminate, and  will

help  all those who come forward, local or foreign alike.

I  assure  Members  that the help  is  given  with  great

sensitivity and, in really desperate situations,  nothing

will  compromise  the  safety and health  of  mother  and

child.   Contrary  to what Ms Irene  Ng  thought,  I  can

assure her that there is no obsession about obtaining the

biological  information of the mother. The priority  must

always be the safety of the mother

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



and  the  child. In fact, we walk her through the process

and  allow her, at her own time and own pace, to give  us

whatever  information that she is prepared to share  with

us.

<br>11.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has alluded to the point that for

baby  drops  to  be  effective, they have  to  be  easily

accessible and known to those who are likely to use them.

Sir,   based  on  my  staff's  consultations  with  their

American counterparts, the US experience continues to  be

contentious as to whether baby drops are a good  approach

or  whether publicity focusing on engaging pregnant girls

early  in  their pregnancy might be a safer approach  for

both the mother and baby.  For baby drops to work, almost

every  front  door has to be a potential  baby  drop,  as

those in desperation will not be in any frame of mind  to

go  to  designated places.  That is why the role  of  the

community and the public is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will a change of legislation and the setting up of

baby   drops  really  stop  the  abandonment  of  babies?

Countries that have implemented baby drops have not  seen

a  decrease in baby abandonment.  In the US, some see the

"Baby  Drops" as an encouragement to abandon the  babies.

According  to  a  State  Legislative  report  by  the  US

National Conference of State Legislatures, the Baby Drops

were  not "receiving" as many babies as expected.   There

were  still  cases of abandonment in public places,  even

with the presence of "baby drops". Ms Ng spoke about  the

Safe  Haven law in the United States.  An article in  the

Straits  Times  last  week (12th  March  2003)  had  this

headline  "US safe haven laws fail to save  babies".   In

the  Los  Angeles County, despite its Safe Haven law,  14

babies were found abandoned in 2001, and 11 of them died.

Not  a single woman that year took advantage of the  Safe

Haven law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, 10 babies were safely surrendered, but 13

were  abandoned, eight of whom died, according to  county

statistics.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



Baby  drops  are  only a piecemeal solution  to  unwanted

pregnancies and they may have unintended consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng is right that we should not think of

baby  abandonment  as  only a woman's  problem.  We  must

educate the men too. If the men are more responsible  and

stand by the women they made pregnant, then the women are

less likely to abandon their babies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, everyone has a part to play. Parents

too  have  an  important role in the  education  process.

Last  year,  there  were about 850 births  among  teenage

mothers.   We  should be mindful not to tar  all  teenage

pregnancies as `unwanted' pregnancies.  However,  besides

MOE's  sexuality  programmes in schools,  MCDS,  together

with   community  partners,  has  also  implemented   two

sexuality  education programmes for teenagers  and  their

parents. They are called - No Apologies and WAIT (Why  Am

I  Tempted).   Both  are designed to  help  young  people

develop responsible attitudes and character traits and to

assist  parents to work with their teenagers on sexuality

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, men whose partners are grappling with unwanted

pregnancies  must be more responsible and  encourage  and

support  the women to seek help.  The community can  help

by  being  alert to pregnant women in distress.   Parents

can  be  good  role  models and be  supportive  if  their

children get into trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, each and every one, do our part, we can be a

more caring community.  More babies will be saved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I begun my response this morning to Members

earlier  by talking about babies, and ending  it  now  by

talking  about  babies  as well. I cannot  emphasise  the

importance  of babies to Singapore more.  The  causes  of

falling  fertility are many and complex,  and  it  is  of

concern  to  us,  as a country and as  individuals.   Our

package  of  incentives and support programmes  may  take

time  for it to be effective. We may need to modify  them

along the way.  I thank my parliamentary colleagues for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



their  many  suggestions, such as to look at policies  of

the  Nordic countries, expand the infant care support and

many other useful comments.  We would certainly look into

all  of  these  to see how else we should  approach  this

matter.   This  is a national problem. We need  all  your

support to see how we can help resolve this together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now call upon MOS, Mr Chan Soo Sen, to reply

to the second part of the cuts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I would like to thank the Minister

for  his  reply.   I have three points for clarification.

The  first  point  is that I would like the  Minister  to

confirm  whether or not I heard him right  when  he  said

that  the Government will not prosecute a mother who,  in

desperation, decides to leave the baby at the appropriate

centre,  that is, all forms of prosecution and  not  just

the  act  of leaving the baby behind.  Will the  Minister

please confirm this?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> If a mother walks

into  the  shelter, we will walk her through the process.

If  she is a Singaporean and she has not contravened  any

law,  she  will not be prosecuted.  The act of coming  to

the  shelter  means that she is not abandoning  the  baby

and,   therefore,   she  will  not  be   prosecuted   for

abandonment.  But if she is a foreign worker or she is of

any  other citizenship, other laws will probably have  to

come into play.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would not the Minister therefore

agree  with  me  that the prospect of  prosecution  under

other laws itself may serve as ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is not a clarification, Mr Sin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Okay, I will save this for another

day.  My second clarification is this.  The Minister  has

said that legalising baby drops is going to endanger  the

baby  more.   I  do  not  understand  why.   Perhaps  the

Minister can explain.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, our view is

that, by having a baby drop,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



we  may  not  be able to trace the mother  nor  know  the

background  of  the family nor what we can  do  with  the

baby.   If the mother comes to our shelter, we can  do  a

lot more.  What I have been demonstrating this morning is

that  the system that we have in place is indeed  helpful

to  both  mother and baby.  The statistics  that  I  have

given  earlier this morning demonstrate that there  is  a

system that can help the mother walk through the process.

If  the  baby  is  dropped somewhere,  it  will  be  very

difficult  for  us  to trace the parents  and  help  them

through the process.  But, at this point in time, Sir, if

a  baby  is  dropped,  I  would like  to  call  upon  the

community  to also help us. As I mentioned in my  speech,

every  front door is almost a baby drop, so, the role  of

the  community  is  also important to  help  us  in  this

sensitive issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, how would not knowing the

background of the mother endanger the baby any more  than

if she just leaves him anonymously somewhere else?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, at the end of

the  day,  we  have to look at both the  welfare  of  the

mother  and  baby.  The mother must have been very,  very

desperate  to  abandon  the  baby.   So,  there  must  be

something that we can do to help her to walk through  the

process.   If  you ask me, I would prefer the  mother  to

keep  the baby, because we want the baby to be raised  in

the  comfort of his or her natural parents.   If  we  can

help  them  as  a family, that would be a better  outcome

than  just to leave the baby by the roadside, and for  us

to deal with the baby alone.  I am not saying that if the

baby  is  dropped, we are not helping the baby. We  will.

But  together, with the mother, we can do a lot  more  to

ensure that her family is being helped.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> That is precisely my point, is it

not?   By  providing  a safe place for  the  baby  to  be

dropped will enhance the safety of the baby, rather  than

to  leave  things as they are at the moment where  babies

are just left off at public places.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is not a point of clarification,

Mr Sin.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Can I seek a further

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Minister agree with me

that  with  legal  baby drop, it reduces  the  chance  of

babies  being left in places which are not frequented  by

people.  Even in the statistics cited by the Minister for

the  other  countries, there are legal baby  drops  which

reduce  the  number of babies being abandoned  at  places

that  are  not  desirable.   I  did  not  say  that,   by

legalising  baby  drops, we are going  to  do  away  with

abandonment of babies. That is not the point.  The  point

is  that it gives the babies a safe haven for them to  be

legally placed and be put up for adoption.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> I do not

necessarily disagree with the Member that if  we  have  a

baby  drop,  it  may help. But we have  to  look  at  the

experiences of other countries and look at the experience

of  the system that we have in place. The system we  have

in place, so far, is effective.  Maybe there is a lack of

publicity.   That  is why we will step up  the  publicity

efforts  to encourage mothers, who want to give up  their

babies, to come to the shelters.  The statistics  that  I

cited  earlier show that the system works.  So  far  this

year,  out of the five who have been abandoned, two  have

been  found  and the first one was still born.   I  agree

with  Mr Sin that one baby dying is one too many. We have

to  find  a way to help them. We are confident that  with

the  current system in place, we will be able to help all

mothers  who  either  want to give  up  their  babies  or

whatever their choices may be.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin, I think we can pursue this

another day.  Mr Chan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, allow me now to address

the remaining questions relating to families, ie, "Strong

and Stable Families".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore families are by and large in good

shape, although we have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>



admit  that  they are under some pressure.  It  would  be

helpful  to  promote support options for the family.  The

community  can  support the family.  Families,  in  turn,

should support one another as well as the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many partners under our Many Helping Hands

approach.  We actively consult them as we do not own  all

the wisdom on family issues.  In fact, everybody can be a

family  expert.  One important partner in family  is  the

Committee  on  Family.  This is headed by  Mr  Noel  Hon.

This is a people-sector led committee.  It has, over  the

years, provided invaluable advice on family initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another committee that has allowed us to tap the

strength   of  the  community  is  the  Family   Matters!

Singapore  Committee, which I chair, but I  have  to  say

that  most  of the work is done through the various  sub-committees  headed by people from the people sector.   We

are  carrying out the blueprint developed by  the  former

Public  Education Committee on Family or  PEC  which  was

then chaired by Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 40 of the 70 PEC recommendations are being

implemented,  some  18 months after the  PEC  Report  was

released.  Some  of  the initiatives  undertaken  include

partnership with the Singapore History Museum to organise

a  wedding exhibition aimed at reinforcing the importance

of marriage as an institution, and a recent collaboration

with  the  advertising industry to launch  annual  Family

Matters   Awards   for   the  most  pro-family   TV/radio

commercials and print advertisements because  we  believe

that people look at advertisements quite seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May this year, we will be collaborating with

Media  Development  Authority  (MDA)  and  Institute   of

Advertising  Singapore to organise a  regional  broadcast

conference  focusing  on how the  media  impacts  on  the

values of the young and the families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also later highlight two key recommendations

of the PEC, namely,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



Romancing  Singapore  and  the  School  Family  Education

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Matters! Singapore Committee continues to

be   the   people-movement  that   the   PEC   envisaged.

Unfortunately,  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon  is  not  here.   In

fact,  I want to thank her for the good work done at  the

PEC  as well as for her foresight in putting together  an

extensive network of people- and private-sector partners.

When  I  succeeded  her  to  be  the  PEC's  Chairman,  I

continued with her legacy of engaging the people- as well

as   private-sector  agencies.   Today,  many   community

partners are leading the initiatives as well as corporate

donors,  like  Singapore  Totalisator  Board,  have  come

forward   to   provide  substantial   funding   for   the

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Maliki has asked about Romancing Singapore.

My  Minister  has  earlier shared with Members  the  very

serious  challenges facing us as a result of the changing

attitudes towards marriage and procreation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now seeing more "young" marriages breaking

up.  And  by  "young" marriages, we mean those  marriages

that break up within five years.  The proportion of civil

divorces among marriages under five years increased  from

9.6%  (208  out  of 2,178 divorces) in 1990.   This  9.6%

increased to 15.3% (533 out of 3,491 divorces)  in  2001.

Muslim  divorces  of similar marriage  duration  remained

high  at  34.7%  (467  out of 1,347  divorces)  in  2001.

Though  the  number  is still small,  compared  to  other

countries, divorce is certainly an area of concern and we

cannot be complacent about it.

<br>11.45 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context, and with these concerns in

mind,   that   the  Romancing  Singapore   Festival   was

initiated.    Romancing  Singapore  is  a   people-sector

initiative  led  by  two  private-sector  volunteers,  Dr

Finian  Tan  and  Ms Claire Chiang.   It  was  funded  by

donations from the Singapore Totalisator Board  at  about

$400,000.  It generated good media coverage with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



500,000 people participating in over 100 Festival events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Festival reminds us all to build relationships

that  are  vital to marriage and family.  It is not  just

about  getting  singles to consider romance.   It  is  as

much,  if not more, for married couples to nourish  their

relationships  like  the case of Mr and  Mrs  Valberg,  a

couple  in their 70s, who renewed their 50-year  marriage

vow at a Romancing Singapore event.  When asked about the

love  of  her  life,  Mrs  Valberg  remarked,  "Once,  my

husband,  who is usually very quiet, broke  into  a  love

song  while we were walking along the Esplanade."   Small

gestures  like these are really romantic.  Yes,  we  need

such  small acts of romance to keep marriages  alive.   I

have to say that that story is very inspiring to me too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hope you do not break into a song!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, perhaps some other day, when

my wife is around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Maliki suggested a Men's Movement for

men  to understand the feelings of women, and for us  men

to  be  able  to  run after the women.  I  fully  concur.

While listening to some of the feedback from SDU, as well

as  SDS,  that the Minister talked about, there  was  one

feedback  which said that a girl called up SDU and  said,

"The  man you chose for me was really unromantic  because

at  the  first dinner we had to go Dutch."  I  never  did

that  while I was courting in Oxford.  There was  another

interesting  story  of a man calling up  SDU,  after  the

first  date, and said, "Can you tell me when I  can  hold

her hand?"  I was totally speechless when I heard that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I wonder if the aim of the movement should

be  how to be gentlemen.   And maybe to learn the wonders

of   falling  in  love,  staying  in  love,   and   being

spontaneous in small gestures of romance like Mr  Valberg

who is in his 70s with 50 years of marriage behind him.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on a more serious note, while Family

Matters!  Singapore Committee organises  programmes  like

Romancing Singapore, the Ministry supports VWOs like  the

Centre  for Fathering to run programmes like Father-Child

bonding camps - one of the phenomena that we always  hear

about  is  that  the  father had  disappeared  -  couples

adventure camps, as well as to conduct  talks for  single

men on how they can be good husbands and fathers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar programme is Forum Adam, an initiative

started by none other than Dr Maliki in 2001, which  aims

to  provide  a platform for Malay men to share challenges

as  husbands  and fathers.  My Ministry is  working  with

YWMA  Mendaki Family Service Centre, Al Khair Mosque,  to

start a Father Support Group, following this year's Forum

Adam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have strong marriages, we must ensure that we

start  them right.  In a survey conducted by my  Ministry

recently, twice the number of participants found marriage

preparation courses to be highly useful as compared to  a

similar survey conducted in 1999.  So, perhaps there  was

a  general agreement that such courses are getting to  be

more important.  We are encouraged by these findings.  We

will  make marriage preparation more accessible. One such

initiative   is   the  launch  of  an  on-line   marriage

preparation programme on the "About Family Life" website.

That  will  be in about three months' time, in June  this

year,  so that people who are too busy to come to us  can

access the website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang would be happy to know

that  since last year, a number of Deputy Registrars  and

Licensed Solemnisers have agreed to expand their role  to

be  Marriage  Mentors, and we have developed  a  training

programme for them.  A number of them are JPs, grassroots

leaders  as  well as religious leaders.  Underlying  this

initiative  is the premise that, being respected  members

of  the  community, couples will welcome their advice  as

well as counsel.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the Healthy Marriage Programme, which

aims  to  better prepare Malay/Muslim youths for  married

life.   The  programme is a developmental and  preventive

initiative.   It  aims  at  inculcating  teenagers   with

healthy values and positive views about marriage as  well

as family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has called for MCDS to work with agencies

like  the Ministry of Education to put our young  through

life  skills  and  character building programmes.   I  am

happy  to  report  that  MCDS  is  implementing  the  PEC

recommendation on the School Family Education  Programme.

Last year, together with Fei Yue Counselling Centre,  the

North  West, South East and South West CDCs, my  Ministry

piloted  the  School Family Education Programme  in  four

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme has reached out to almost 12,000

people within a year of its implementation.  The idea  is

to  reach out to the parents through their children.   It

equips  parents with effective parenting skills, children

with  life skills, and supports all parents, as  well  as

teachers,  to  balance career, school  life  as  well  as

family life.  The bonus is that, in the process, in  line

with my Ministry's vision to promote strong families  who

help  others,  parent  volunteers now  run  some  of  the

schools'  family  life  centres  and  are  starting  peer

support groups.  So we are beginning to reach a stage  of

parents beginning to inspire other parents.  We see  that

the  pilot  is a success and my Ministry will expand  the

programme to more schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also looking into another programme

called  Journey  of  Life.  It  is  being  developed  for

students  in  polytechnics, whereby through  experiential

learning,  students  are  imbued with  healthy  attitudes

about  love,  spousal relations, family relationships  as

well as aging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been working in partnership not

only  with the Ministry of Education, but with the people

and  private  sector in family life education.   I  would

also like to report that we are trying all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



things  possible to engage families, and to  empower  our

partners,  such  as  Family  Life  Ambassadors,   through

sharing   of  resources,  experience  as  well  as   best

practices.  Working with our partners, we find  there  is

no  shortage of bright and creative ideas.  Indeed, there

is  no  monopoly of good ideas and wisdom if we  can  all

encourage everybody to come forward and contribute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We communicate our messages through as many channels

as  possible. One effective way has been through  various

MediaCorp  and MediaWorks TV programmes in all  the  four

languages.  Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has this idea  of  a  TV

documentary and that she will be pleased to know that her

idea of a TV documentary called "My Home", based on real-life stories of individuals and their families overcoming

challenges,  telecast  over a period  of  two  years,  in

English  and Chinese, since 2000, has already  seen  four

seasons so far. Each episode on average reaches more than

700,000 viewers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our latest TV family programme on Vasantham Central

has  also  achieved  an  unprecedented  drama  viewership

rating  of 30% of the Indian population.  I am told  that

this  is equivalent to the most popular Bollywood movies.

So, maybe we are beginning to see Sollywood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Malay human interest stories with family life

messages  in  "K  Inc" on Channel Suria was  consistently

among  the top 10 programmes broadcast. Besides, we  also

have  other  popular TV programmes on parenting,  eg,  an

English  TV drama called "First Touch" and the  drama  "I

Not Stupid", which carry our parenting messages.  We have

used  TV  stars such as Xiang Yun, Gurmit Singh  and  top

Malay  and  Indian TV stars to promote the importance  of

family  in  TV  commercials.  We accept the reality  that

people  do  not listen to us, Members of this House,  but

they  listen  to  messages from people whom  they  really

enjoy seeing, eg, film stars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadshows in the heartlands and in the central

business district featuring

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



comedians  such  as  Jack  Neo have  also  helped  widely

disseminate   family   messages,  ranging   from   inter-generational bonds, to parenting as well as marriage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another channel that we use to communicate our

family  life messages is the National Family Week.   This

year,  we  will adopt the theme "Parenting Teenagers"  to

help parents better connect with their growing teenagers.

For  this, I have a personal interest because I  do  have

two  teenage sons.  So you will see me participating more

actively this year in the programme.  The programmes will

include  bonding activities such as "Parent-Teen obstacle

challenge" in a TV reality programme, as well as a multi-media  contest involving the family unit in the Singapore

Street  Festival.  The Festival, by the way, is organised

by the Orchard Road Business Association and supported by

several statutory bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as we try different communication media,

depending  on our audiences, my Ministry is  also  paying

more  attention to inter-generational communication.   In

July  2002, a Task Force was formed under Family Matters!

Singapore   Committee  to  promote  the   importance   of

grandparenting     and     positive    inter-generational

relationships.  We  also launched  a  funding  scheme  to

encourage  the private and people sectors to develop  and

implement   programmes  that  promote  inter-generational

bonding.  At the time when we were young, we remember our

grandparents very dearly.  I think we do notice that  our

children  do  not  seem to share such sentiments  towards

their  grandparents, and yet grandparents are potentially

a   very,  very  important  part  in  encouraging  fellow

Singaporeans to have more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2001, we have celebrated Grandparents Day. I

believe  we  may be the first in the world  to  celebrate

Grandparents Day, during Senior Citizens' Week, and it is

done on a larger scale to recognise the contributions  of

grandparents as well as to honour their important roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 200,000 people signed up for Family Life

Education  programmes in 2002.  Since 2000, participation

rates at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



these   programmes  have  also  been  increasing   at   a

phenomenal rate of 25% per annum.  We could not have done

this  without some 700 dedicated Family Life  Ambassadors

who  comprise individuals, organisations and corporations

from the private as well as the people sectors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chan, please speed up your reply.

We have a lot of cuts to deal with.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Yes, Sir. That being the case,

perhaps I will just conclude by saying that every year we

celebrate  family  three times.   In  February,  we  have

Romancing  Singapore.  In May/June, we  have  the  Family

Week, and in November, we have the Senior Citizens'  Week

and  Grandparents  Day.  We involve  various  sectors  to

promote  family  and  we have been receiving  better  and

better responses.  I characterise the situation of family

when  I  began my reply by saying that family is in  good

shape, though under pressure.  But, on the other hand, we

see  many  people  wanting to be part of  our  effort  to

promote  family.   So, we are very  encouraged.   We  are

confident that we will do well.

12.00 noon

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, despite an MCDS'

social  attitudes  survey of 2001  showing  that  98%  of

Singaporeans  polled agreed that they would  support  and

spend  time  with their elderly parents,  I  believe  the

neglect  and abuse of the elderly may be on the increase,

because  of  increasing financial and  other  constraints

within  the family, and in changes in the sense  of  duty

and filial piety to the elderly.   What causes this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, some of the elderly do not have enough CPF

asset  or  assets to last their remaining years.   Others

have problems after upgrading to bigger flats because  of

the  downturn  in the property market.  Early  retirement

and retrenchment may take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



further  toll not only on the elderly but  also  on   the

adult  children upon whom they might have depended.   The

elderly may also be targets of schemes to relieve them of

their  assets,  either from people within the  family  or

from outside the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, families are already under stress for time

and  caregivers' roles.  Double incomes are  a  necessity

and  people face retrenchments and redundancy.   Extended

family  networks  are fast disappearing  with  increasing

pressure on time for work, procreation, childcare, skills

retraining,  upgrading, continuing education.   There  is

little  time  for  people  to spend  with  their  elderly

parents.   When  the  elderly become frail,  it  is  even

worse.   There is often no respite for those who have  to

look after the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think medical doctors in the House are familiar

with the term "dumping syndrome" to denote the phenomenon

of  elderly  patients  with only vague  medical  problems

being  brought  to  A&E departments for admission  during

festive  seasons.   In many cases, the  medical  problems

were  stable,  but  the  social  problems  were  obvious.

Relatives  would disappear soon after the old person  was

admitted  only  to reappear after Chinese  New  Year,  or

whatever festival, was over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, elderly people who, in the past, neglected

or abused their family members.  Others may have been too

busy to bond with their children when they were young and

may have left them to the care of maids or foster parents

to  an excessive degree.  I think these people would have

great  difficulty in expecting a high degree of care  and

concern from their own children when they are old.   Just

as  we  have developed a legal and service infrastructure

for  child abuse and neglect, I believe, because  of  all

these  reasons,  we  should develop a national  eldercare

programme of support infrastructure for the elderly.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir,

increasingly, I see elderly residents coming to my  meet-the-people session asking for a 1- or 2-room rental flat,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



because they feel unwanted by their adult children.  Many

of  these elderly people have several children, but  they

claim that their married children have no place for them,

or  that they all could not get along.  Some would  break

into tears when they relate how difficult life is at home

with their children's families.  And several say that  if

they  cannot  get a rental flat, that they  would  rather

jump  down from a HDB block than to carry on living  with

their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it might be better for them to live

apart if it means a happier life for them all.  But I  am

also  concerned that this might point to a trend in which

children, valuing their own privacy and space, have  been

making  their  elderly  parents feel  unwanted,  and  are

looking to pass on the responsibility of caring for their

parents  to  the State.  Rental flats, as  we  know,  are

heavily subsidised by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel there is a need to educate children from

young, but also those who are adults now, on the need  to

support their aged parents without being forced to do  so

by  the  law.   And we need to strengthen the  values  of

filial piety in this society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must try to check this trend early to make sure

that  we do not see more and more elderly parents  coming

forward to say that they feel unwanted by their children,

especially  given our greying population.   At  the  same

time, we need to step up our services for the elderly, so

that  they  can  spend their days enjoying programmes  at

these  service centres and perhaps return  home  only  at

night.   This might minimise the friction at home.   Sir,

can  I  ask  the  Minister what is  being  done  in  this

direction?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight another trend of

singles,    especially   women,    bearing    the    main

responsibility of caring for their elderly parents.  Some

are finding it very hard to cope.  They say that they get

little  help  from  their married  siblings.   They  need

support.   I  would urge MCDS to look into  this  growing

trend  and  see how we can support singles who  care  for

their elderly parents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it has been

three-plus  years since the IMC on the Ageing  Population

published its report with 78 recommendations covering six

broad  areas in which attention was required to ready  us

for the successful greying of our population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Ministries and agencies have moved at

different  speeds  to  act on the  recommendations  under

their  purview.   The Health Ministry has  launched  many

initiatives,  but I believe significant fine-tuning  will

need  to  be  done  as  it monitors whether  the  desired

progress  and outcomes are being achieved.  The Transport

Ministry  has  responded in part, but has made  it  quite

clear that the requirement to move the masses efficiently

must  take precedence over the needs of the small numbers

of the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has already so much it

needs  to  do  with refocusing CPF back to  the  original

intent  of taking care of the basic retirement  needs  of

account   holders  and,  at  the  same  time,  facilitate

continuing employment of older workers.  It does not want

to open another front on special accounts for homemakers.

So  its  response is simply that this should be  achieved

through the current provision of voluntary contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand all their reasons and priorities.

However,  we  have been so farsighted in identifying  the

impending  demographic challenge so early and recognising

the   need   for  across-the-board  cooperation   between

multiple  agencies  that need to  act  together  to  have

convened  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee in  the  first

place,  it  will  be  a shame to lose  this  good  start,

especially  in danger now, as we face the toughest  times

that we have had to weather since the earlier days of our

history  as an independent  nation.  I am concerned  that

in  the midst of addressing pressing economic issues,  we

sideline   and   neglect  to  push   onwards   with   the

implementation of the recommendations.  We should persist

even  while  dealing with the current hardships.   It  is

important  because  many  of the  policies  and  measures

involve interlocking components of our infrastructure  on

the one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



hand, and attitudes and mindsets on the other, that  will

take  a  long  time to do, to change and  to  take  root.

Although  we say that it will hit almost 20% of over  65s

only in 2030, the truth of the matter is that our rate of

ageing  will increase exponentially from 2010,  which  is

not so far away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister, who has the unenviable task

in  MCDS of coordinating our efforts on the elderly, give

us  an  update  and  his assessment of  progress  in  the

implementation of the IMC recommendations, and  what  are

the  priorities  and main challenges  for  the  next  few

years?   Particularly important, I believe, will  be  the

efforts directed to helping caregivers cope, as this will

be  a  growing  group which deserves  our  attention  and

support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Warren Lee, you can take your two

cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, I recognise that there are

provisions  in our laws to protect the elderly,  such  as

the  Women's Charter, the Penal Code, the Maintenance  of

Parents  Act and the Mental Disorders and Treatment  Act.

However,  there  is,  currently,  no  over-arching  legal

framework,  like  the Protection of  Children  and  Young

Persons Act.  There are, apparently, lots of complex grey

areas  and  a  lack  of consensus about what  constitutes

elder abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are difficulties about what constitutes a

minimum standard of care for the elderly.  If we  are  to

go  after  family  members for delay in  seeking  medical

care,  for example, do we also recognise that the elderly

may refuse to accept medical care?  If the working adults

in  the family can barely put food on the table for their

own  children,  how  much more can they  be  expected  to

provide  for their elderly parents?  There is a  need  to

balance  the  independence and  personal  choice  of  the

elderly  who may choose to continue to live in an abusive

situation  at home, and the role of the State  to  uphold

justice.  Perhaps there is a place for a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



comprehensive Act to provide for the State to assume  the

role of guardian and protector in selected cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, laws are not enough. We need to

provide practical help to families to help them to  cope.

I  would urge the Government to consider two suggestions:

firstly,  increasing  resources  for  the  MCDS'  Elderly

Development Division to develop a whole new framework  of

care for the elderly, to increase detection and expertise

and  to develop a national consensus on the issue as well

as  to improve on existing institutional and VWO services

for  the elderly.  Just like there are women's clubs  and

men's  clubs,  perhaps  we  also  need  to  have  elderly

activity  clubs  along the lines of  SAGE  and  even  our

senior  citizens' clubs, which would form areas of mutual

support  and help the elderly age gracefully together  in

small and closely-knit groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister would also consider an elderly

protection  and  care service along the  lines  of  MCDS'

Children  and  Young Persons Service.   The  emphasis  is

really  not  about  wayward working  adult  children  but

finding workable solutions for families in need.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, going by the latest

figures on rental flats, about 66% of those who stay in 1- and   2-room   rental  flats  are  singles,  widows   and

divorcees.   Most are above 40, with a higher  proportion

being  above  60.  All are considered lower income,  with

household incomes below $800 a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the greatest problems faced by ageing

lower   income  singles,  which  I  include  widows   and

divorcees  as  well, are loneliness, depression  and  the

fear  of  dying alone.  They suffer from low  self-esteem

and  a  sense  of  exclusion.  The  job  market  in  this

knowledge-economy  often shut  the  door  on  them.   The

marriage option is not always open to them.  Most of  the

singles  in  this  group often find it  hard  to  find  a

partner,  unless they venture further afield  to  Vietnam

and  China.   But even this has its attendant  risks  and

problems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is little help preaching to them to get

married.   Few  of  these low income singles  mix  around

beyond  the  neighbourhood coffeeshop, mainly because  of

money and transport problems.  We need to zoom in on  the

plight of older singles, many of whom lead depressing and

isolated   lives.   The  isolation  of   older   singles,

especially  the  lower income, will  become  increasingly

more prevalent as the population greys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is being done

to  reach  out to this group of ageing singles,  to  make

sure   that  they  are  integrated  into  the  mainstream

community.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, there is a saying

with  regard to growing old gracefully  -  use it or lose

it.   Yes,  use  your brains, spread your experience  and

wisdom  or you stand to lose them.  Keep up the  physical

activity or you may lose your muscle and strength.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are one of the fastest ageing societies, the

best  approach for us to adopt is to ensure that all  our

elderly,  especially our retired, are  encouraged  to  be

active  physically,  mentally and socially  in  order  to

maintain  good health.  This will not only  prevent  many

illnesses  but  will  also  result  in  happier   people.

Prevention  of illnesses and keeping the mind active  and

healthy should be prioritised.  Depression which is  more

prevalent in the elderly can be prevented by getting  the

elderly more engaged socially and involving them with new

hobbies  and  purposes in life.  We need to do  more  and

facilitate  better in achieving total holistic  care  for

the  well-being of our elderly.   And this should be done

island-wide,  not  just  through the  Ministry  but  also

through voluntary organisations, grassroots organisations

and charitable organisations.  Of course, the Ministry of

Community Development and Sports should facilitate  these

organisations in setting up care centres that aim  to  do

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Ministry of Community Development

and Sports started care centres a  few years ago with the

above

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



views in mind, and catering not only for the elderly  but

also  for the children.  May I ask what progress has been

achieved  so  far  and  will  this  project  be   further

expanded?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan is not present. Mr

Heng Chee How is not present.  Ms Braema.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

thank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do know that there is a growing number of single

women in our midst.  Women also tend to live longer,  the

median age being 80.4.  More women are also prone to long-term  illnesses, such as osteoporosis and gynaecological-related  problems.  And there are also more women without

CPF savings.

<br>12.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the Ministry of Manpower and the

statistics that were released last year, 52% of  the  1.5

million  inactive CPF holders were women.  Of  this  lot,

330,000  were  aged 40 and above.  In the  singles  camp,

from the data of the Department of Statistics, 64,000 out

of  the  193,000  are women aged 35  and  above.   Widows

numbered 11,500; divorcees took 20,600.  Median income of

singles,  I am told, is about $2,000.  Widows,  divorcees

and singles with qualifications of below secondary school

level   are  about  1,000.   Against  the  map  of  these

statistics  as well as the access to financial resources,

I  would  like to ask the Ministry whether it  is  timely

perhaps to conduct a comprehensive study on how our women

are coping where their financial resources are concerned.

What  are  the services that need to be put in  place  so

that  we meet this need before it descends on us?   Also,

at  the  same  time, let us also look at the  roles  that

women  have  been  playing for the  longer  time  in  our

society.   Till today, they are still the main caregivers

taking care of, as we have heard, the elderly, the  young

people, etc.  For doing all that work, at the end of  the

day, what is it that we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



going  to  give  them  where  financial  independence  is

concerned?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like

to  thank the Members who have spoken on a matter that is

close  to  our hearts - caring for our aged and preparing

for an ageing population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the point raised by Ms Braema

Mathiaparanam.   As Ms Braema Mathiaparanam  has  pointed

out, there are certain segments of our population who are

less financially secure.  In general, women may need more

retirement savings as they tend to live longer than  men.

For  women  who  have  less capacity and  opportunity  to

accumulate  financial resources, for example,  housewives

from  low income families with no CPF accounts, the  low-income, or lower-educated singles and divorced women,  it

is even more important for them to develop adequate means

and  resources to support themselves in their  retirement

years.  Work is still the best form of welfare.  And  for

those  who  are unable to support themselves, our  social

safety net schemes would help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has asked whether or not we have done a study on

how  our women are coping.  I cannot say for certain that

we  have done a particular study in this area.  But  part

of  the  IMC focus is to understand how Singaporeans,  in

general, including single women who are older, cope  with

the financial demands of their retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is aware that there may be women who

need  help  in  coping  especially  with  the  impact  of

economic restructuring.  In fact, we have begun dialogues

with  the  three key women's organisations,  namely,  the

Singapore  Council  of  Women's Organisations,  the  NTUC

Women's  Committee  and the PA Women Integration  Network

(WIN).   The aim, as I said earlier, is to try  and  help

our  women  folks  to explore what are the  collaborative

opportunities  in training and re-skilling  of  women  in

areas, such as IT

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



and  domestic services. So the long-term goal is to  give

them  some skills so that they can find jobs and  develop

some  financial  independence.  Together with  other  key

agencies, we will study the long-term financial needs  of

women,  as part of our strategy of taking a more sectoral

approach  towards  addressing  the  ageing  concerns   of

different  groups of Singaporeans.   So I would  like  to

assure  Ms  Braema that we will look into this matter  as

part  of our effort to understand better how Singaporeans

are  coping in their retirement age.  In this regard, the

services that are needed will be put in place as and when

there are service gaps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng spoke about the need to educate our

young   about  supporting  their  aged  parents.   Filial

responsibility  has  and will continue  to  underpin  our

philosophy of the "family as the first line of  support".

With  an ageing population, smaller families and a rising

dependency  ratio,  we must continue to  reinforce  these

social values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, we have been strongly promoting the

Singapore   Family  Values,  one  of  which   is   filial

responsibility.  These values are taught  in  the  Civics

and Moral Education, a compulsory subject for our primary

and  secondary  students,  and Civics  at  pre-university

level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS also undertakes a year-round public education

drive  to  foster positive attitudes towards  family  and

older  persons.  As  part of this  effort,  we  are  also

stressing strong inter-generational ties and the need  to

care for our elderly parents, not just their physical and

financial  needs but also seeing to their  emotional  and

social  needs.   And Mr Chan Soo Sen has alluded  to  the

Grand  Parenting  Day that we have started  a  couple  of

years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, over the years, introduced tax

reliefs  and  other schemes to encourage Singaporeans  to

take  care  of their parents.  These schemes include  the

parent   relief,  relief  for  CPF  top-up  of   parents'

retirement account and the use of Medisave savings to pay

for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>



parents'  hospital bills.  Our housing policies encourage

Singaporeans to live with or near their parents,  and  Ms

Irene  Ng would be pleased to learn that close to 88%  of

our seniors still live with their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the few who do not provide for their parents,

the  Maintenance of Parents Act provides a legal recourse

for  the aged parents to seek financial maintenance  from

these children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we promote filial piety, we also

empathise with families that are struggling to cope  with

the  demands  of caregiving.  A few MPs have  called  for

more to be done to help our elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that my Ministry has

invested  substantially  on eldercare  and  developmental

programmes.   In fact, our expenditure in this  area  has

more than doubled over the past four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Jennifer Lee has asked for an update of the

Eldercare   Master   Plan.    Briefly,   86%    of    the

recommendations would be implemented and we  are  looking

into  launching a new round of policy deliberations.   At

the  next  round  of  deliberations,  we  will  focus  on

employment and sectoral needs, especially single elderly,

both  male  and female, and what are the things  that  we

need to do to help them so that they can continue to  age

actively in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, many of the programmes are

already  in  place.   For example, we  have  revised  the

funding  norms  to  give the VWOs more resources  to  run

programmes, such as day care, befriending and counselling

services.  Six new day care centres have been set up over

the  past  two  years.  There are now  more  support  and

resources for caregivers, through a caregiver centre  and

the availability of carers' manuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from setting up facilities, we have made

efforts  to  develop new capabilities in anticipation  of

future needs, such as gero-counselling and upgrading  the

skills

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>



of  our  aged  care workers to enable them to  deliver  a

higher  quality  of  service.  I have mentioned  some  of

these initiatives yesterday, for example, developing bite-sized  eldercare  training  courses  under  the  National

Skills Recognition System.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to allude to the point that Dr Jennifer

Lee  has  mentioned about the IMC and whether or  not  we

have   been   making  headway.   Sir,   one   significant

breakthrough  is  that our policies  now  facilitate  the

entry of more players into the eldercare industry.   This

will gradually grow the pool of service providers and the

variety  of  services, hence providing  more  choices  to

users.   For  example, last July, we extended  Government

subsidy  to  co-operatives  providing  services.   I   am

pleased  to  say that two day care centres  run  by  NTUC

Eldercare Co-operative have come on board.  We will  move

towards  extending the user subsidy to private  providers

within the next two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a second breakthrough is that we now provide

not  just eldercare but developmental programmes for  the

elderly,  and  opening  up  additional  avenues  for  our

seniors to contribute and remain active.  Active aging is

still  the cornerstone of our philosophy for the elderly.

Initiatives  include the Active Seniors  Programme  which

has  involved 1,200 senior volunteers.  We also have nine

Neighbourhood  Links located in different  parts  of  the

island,  which  encourage inter-generational  interaction

and  mutual  help.  So these are opportunities  which  we

have  created  on  the ground for the elderly  to  remain

together with the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third breakthrough is that starting from April

this  year,  my  Ministry will be funding community  case

management  service as a national programme.  This  is  a

significant  development as it would  pave  the  way  for

better  coordination  of community  care  for  our  older

people.   The service has been piloted locally  and  over

97% of the caregivers surveyed have found the service  to

be  beneficial.   This service provides a one-stop  entry

point for frail elderly who have multiple and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>



complex  needs.  Case managers will assess the  elderly's

needs  and put together a package of appropriate services

and  continue to monitor the progress of the  individual.

We  will spend about $400,000 on this programme annually.

Over  the  next  couple of years,  MCDS  will  study  the

feasibility of a one-stop assessment and referral service

for  our  elderly.  Such a facility could bring  about  a

quantum improvement in the care of our aged.  My Ministry

will  study  this  issue closely  with  the  Ministry  of

Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a much needed breakthrough is in terms of

employer  mindset in hiring older workers.  We will  work

with  the  Ministry  of Manpower and  other  partners  to

address this issue, but there is a need for employers  to

do  their part.  In this regard, I commend the KK Women's

and  Children's  Hospital and Dr Lee  for  being  a  fine

example in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has asked about the progress of the

3-in-1 elderly care centre.  She is probably referring to

the  Tampines 3-in-1 Family Centre, which was set  up  in

1995,  not by my Ministry, but at the initiative  of  the

PAP  Community Foundation branch in Tampines.  The centre

is  progressing  well and is a good example  of  how  the

proximity of services can promote social integration  and

inter-generational  bonding.  In  planning  services,  my

Ministry will continue to explore co-location of services

where  there  are opportunities to do so.   Dr  Lily  Neo

would   be   pleased  to  learn  that  we  are  currently

developing  a multi-service centre in Jurong West,  which

will house services for the young and old under one roof.

The  centre is expected to be ready by the end  of  2004.

We will study the benefits of this pilot before expanding

the concept to other housing estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all our seniors have families to turn to, and Ms

Irene Ng has touched on the needs of one such group - the

elderly singles.  Our programmes, such as befriending and

home help, have succeeded in reaching out to some of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>



these  individuals, offering them much needed social  and

emotional  support.  Notwithstanding this, we agree  that

more could be done, particularly for those living alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, we are working towards

strengthening  the  community support  network  for  this

group,  through  developing  a  manual  that  will  guide

agencies  on the action to take when they encounter  such

individuals  and how to link them to support services  in

the  community, such as the Neighbourhood  Link  and  the

Befriending Service.  I spoke about this yesterday as  an

example  of  community resilience and  that  we  want  to

develop  support groups for all who are in Singapore  for

them to continue to have social and emotional support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee suggested an Elderly Protection and

Care  service along the lines of MCDS' Family  and  Child

Protection  Service and the Children  and  Young  Persons

Act.   We agree with Dr Lee that the emphasis must  first

be on finding workable solutions for the family and not a

punitive, legalistic approach.  This is why it is best to

adopt a multi-agency approach and ride on the established

Family  Violence  Dialogue Group and  Networking  System,

rather than set up a separate machinery and legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any elderly person requiring help can access

services  through  a number of contact points,  including

the Family Service Centres, GPs, community agencies, MCDS

or   the   hospitals.    Healthcare   professionals,   in

particular,  are  all well placed to identify  and  refer

suspected elderly abuse cases for help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are actively working to educate those in the

Network  on how to deal with elderly abuse.  We  recently

ran   a  seminar  on  this  subject  for  social  service

practitioners   and  health  care  personnel   and   made

available  a booklet entitled 'Understanding Elder  Abuse

and Neglect - Detecting and Helping'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the initiatives I have mentioned are part of

our overall strategy to prepare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  for  the  challenges of an ageing  population.

Our   approach   is   threefold  -   promoting   personal

responsibility   through   public   education,   creating

opportunities for our seniors to contribute  and  play  a

role,  and strengthening our eldercare services  to  help

families cope with caregiving.  The challenges are multi-faceted  and require a coordinated effort not just  among

the  Government agencies, but also among all  sectors  of

the  society.   The  desired outcome  is  for  our  older

Singaporeans  to  age with dignity  and  to  continue  to

remain  healthy, active and secure in their golden years.

I think I have addressed most of the concerns.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki, you have five cuts back to

back.  You can take them altogether.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, on Family Service

Centres, I would want to declare my interest as a  member

of  the Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre.  We have  heard

the initials FSCs for the umpteenth time in this Chamber.

Set  up  in  the early 1990s, we now have about  35  FSCs

serving  a population of 3.3 million people.  This  works

out   to   approximately  96,000   persons,   or   24,000

households,  per FSC.  I wonder if this is an  acceptable

ratio of FSCs to households in MCDS' view.  Otherwise, is

MCDS  planning to allow more FSCs to be set up  to  cater

for  the  growing  need of so-called social  services  in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my understanding is that MCDS provides 50% of

the  recurrent cost of running an FSC that  it  approves.

As I have many questions for the Minister on this cut,  I

will  just go straight to the questions.  First, who  are

the  service users of the FSCs?  What percentage  of  the

geographical population is the FSC actually serving?

<br>12.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on funding justification, what were the

outcome measures of FSCs and whether they have been  met?

Have FSCs been effective?  What are the criteria used  to

assess their effectiveness?  What service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>



standards  are set, and how are these standards  ensured?

What criteria are used in granting organisations licensed

to  operate  FSCs?   Is  there a licensing  mechanism  in

setting  up  and operating FSCs?  Does MCDS  license  and

monitor  those FSCs that do not receive funding from  the

Government?   How  are these standards assessed  in  such

FSCs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this latter issue is of importance as, unless

FSCs,  whether  funded by MCDS or not, are  subjected  to

clear guidelines and service standards, residents may  be

using  services from these FSCs without knowing  if  they

have   the  requisite  staff  qualification  and  service

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the pioneer FSCs are operated by VWOs.

However,  lately, I note that many of the  new  FSCs  are

affiliated  to  religious institutions.  I  was  informed

that  in  some of these FSCs, there are religious symbols

and  paraphernalia.  In this regard, I would like to  ask

how does MCDS ensure that these do not become barriers to

access  by  those  who  do  not  profess  the  particular

religion of the organisation.  How does MCDS ensure  that

everyone   has   access  and  is  not  disadvantaged   by

structural  characteristics of the FSCs?  In short,  what

is the MCDS' policy on this matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another critical issue relates to the access to

services,  ie, the language proficiency of the  staff  in

the  FSCs.   Not everyone speaks English, especially  the

elderly and low-income families, who are the bulk of  the

service users.  Are there guidelines to ensure that every

FSC  has a sufficient range of staff members who are able

to  speak all the official languages, to ensure access is

not denied through language gaps?  I would also encourage

MCDS  to  monitor  issues  of cross-cultural  interaction

between helpers and services users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on domestic violence. Sir, I would

like  to  also declare that I am the adviser to a  Centre

called Promoting Alternatives to Violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday we heard about the start of Gulf War

II.  We have talked about the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>



devastating  impact  of terrorism on  people.   Yet,  for

generations,  another form of terrorism has  been  taking

place in our midst, ie, terrorism in our homes.  Domestic

violence,  which encompasses psychological  and  physical

terrorism, has a debilitating effect on the family.   The

1997  amendment to the Women's Charter has  opened  doors

for victims and their families to seek help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that the first source of help for the

victims  of violence is the police.  I must applaud  MCDS

and  the  Singapore  Police Force  for  spearheading  the

National Family Violence Police Networking System,  which

allows  victims  needing help to  go  to  Family  Service

Centres.   This system has been in place for five  years.

I  would  like to know what is the extent of the  problem

now.   How  many incidents of violence have been reported

to the police in the last five years?  I have heard that,

when  incidents of violence occur and families  call  the

police  for  assistance, there is  a  tendency  for  some

police  officers to downplay the violence,  because  they

perceive  it  as  a  private domestic quarrel.   In  this

regard,  I would like to ask what is the police  protocol

with  regard  to handling domestic violence cases.   Even

with the protocol in place, what is being done by way  of

monitoring  to  ensure  that these  protocols  are  being

adhered to?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is that victims of violence are

already  being  disempowered.  It takes a great  deal  of

courage and will for them to seek help.  When attempts of

help  are  thwarted  by  well-intentioned  officers,  who

sometimes confuse family violence with marital and family

disputes,  it  is harder for the victims to come  forward

again.   Some  clients actually tell social workers  that

abusers tell them that it is no point seeking help, as no

one would believe them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all they are asking for is for the violence to

stop,  not  for  the relationship to end.  Perhaps,  this

message  needs  to be stressed to the very  people  whose

mandate is to stop violence, ie, the police.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>



Thus,  my question is: how does MCDS work with the police

in  ensuring  that  cases  of domestic  violence  receive

appropriate and immediate attention?  What are the  legal

obligations of the police to help?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is critical in repeated cases of abuse

that  we  see - because of what is known as the "battered

women"  syndrome,  ie, the sense of helplessness  or  the

fear  of further abuse to them and their children -  many

of  these victims are extremely fearful to seek help.   I

would like to ask the Minister how are such cases helped.

Would  MCDS  consider a system like the one in  Australia

where,  in  very  serious cases of  domestic  abuse,  the

police  can  apply what is known as an interim protection

order?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of child abuse, there are laws to

remove children from abusive homes.  In cases of violence

in  the  home,  eg,  in  cases  of  elder-abuse,  spousal

violence, are there laws that give the police the mandate

to remove adults from their homes when they are abused?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, we hear of cases of victims

in  cohabitative relationships being abused.  While  they

can seek private summonses, there is no formal protection

accorded  to them.  How is domestic violence with  regard

to  such couples handled?  MCDS has indicated that it  is

going to look into this matter.  I would like to ask what

is  the status of the situation now.  In the light of the

recent  murder cases involving couples who have  resorted

to  the most extreme form of violence - and some of  them

are  in  cohabitative relationships - does MCDS  plan  to

deal with violence in an intimate relationship?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the reasons, violence can and should

never  be  condoned.  It is our moral responsibility  not

only to respect but to protect the dignity of individuals

and families from abuse.  The world may be turbulent, and

war  may  be  going on as we speak.  We must continue  to

strive for peace.  Let peace begin within the four  walls

of our homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we deal with domestic violence, there is what is

called a personal protection

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>



order  (PPO), which can be taken up by victims to protect

themselves  from further abuse.  It is an instrument  and

an  avenue for them in this regard.  I would like to  ask

the  Minister  how many personal protection  orders  have

been  issued to victims of abuse in the last  five  years

and, if the trend is increasing, whatever the reasons may

be,  will  greater resources be allocated  in  addressing

this trend?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, violence does not occur once. There is such a

thing  that is called the cycle of violence.  Thus,  many

of  the victims are protected by PPOs from further abuse.

However, because violence occurs again, there is what  is

called  a  breach of PPOs.  I would like to ask how  many

cases  of  PPOs have been breached.  How does the  police

determine a breach?  I ask these questions because I know

of  many situations where victims are told by the  courts

and their social workers that, should a breach occur, all

they  need  to  do is to call the police.  However,  when

they seek police assistance, they perceive that no action

is  taken although, according to documents given to  them

in  court, a breach has occurred.  It is even harder  for

them when psychological abuse takes place in the form  of

threats  and harassment, as these are often difficult  to

prove.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not questioning the professionalism of the

police  force.   Like many others, I am  proud  of  their

achievements.  I know that they maintain high  standards.

However, I would like to know what happens when a  person

breaches an order, ie, what kind of action is taken  when

a  breach occurs.  In the most recent year, what  is  the

breakdown  of  the  different kinds of action  taken  for

breach  cases?   As  one of the key stakeholders  of  the

National Family Violence Networking System, what is MCDS'

position  or  policy on breach cases?  How does  it  work

with the police in this regard?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the reasons, violence is disrespectful

behaviour.   Violence is also about making a choice  and,

with choices, come consequences.  When an abuser breaches

the PPO, he is in fact breaking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>



the  law  and,  when someone breaks the  law,  there  are

punishments to be meted out.  Thus, the issue  of  breach

of PPOs is important, because we need to send the message

to  both victims and perpetrators that the law has to  be

respected.  The actions of the relevant agencies, eg, the

police  and  MCDS,  must  also  reflect  this  very  same

message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware that, with issues of interpersonal

violence, getting the cooperation of victims when  action

is  taken is sometimes difficult, as victims do back out.

This  is  expected,  as no one wants the  member  of  the

family to be convicted.  However, we also need to keep in

mind that reporting a person for breaking the law is  not

-  and  I  stress, is not - about breaking up the family.

It  is  about  stopping  violence  and,  as  I  mentioned

earlier, we want to stop abuse and help families  rebuild

their relationships.  By doing so, we can keep the family

unit intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part of preventing a breach from happening is

the issuance of Mandatory Counselling Orders by the court

to  ensure  that abusers and victims of violence  receive

counselling services.  This is laudable, as we know  that

families  experiencing violence need  to  deal  with  the

trauma  of violence.  I have heard from many social  work

colleagues  how,  with  the introduction  of  counselling

orders, the entire family experiencing the violence  gets

an  opportunity to deal with the violence in their  home.

MCDS   should   be  congratulated  for  including   these

amendments  in the Women's Charter.  It can,  I  believe,

contribute to stronger family bonds and healthier  family

relationships.    Since  the  inception  of   counselling

orders, I would like to ask the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How many counselling orders have been issued in

the last five years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) For each of the five years, what is the

proportion of counselling orders issued to the number  of

personal protection orders issued?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Is this seen as an acceptable proportion?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) What is the likely explanation for this, and

what happens to the rest of the cases that were not given

counselling orders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked with families which have been mandated

to  come  for counselling and, though there is resistance

from  some  of them in the beginning, when they  see  the

value  of  how their families can be helped, they  become

open to the counselling process.  I would like to ask the

Minister  what are MCDS' assessment and plans on  how  we

can  reach  out  to more families experiencing  violence,

through   the  counselling  order  process.    Have   the

experiences  of  other  countries been  studied  in  this

regard, and what are the outcomes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues of family violence, though small in

number  in comparison with other countries, are a concern

for  us  in Singapore.  The impact of family violence  on

children growing up in homes has been documented in other

countries.   We  know  also of  how  adult  survivors  of

violence  have difficulty coping with relationships  when

they  have  grown up in violent homes.  I am not  talking

about    physical   violence   alone;    emotional    and

psychological  abuse  is  often  more  debilitating  than

physical violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, reaching out to these families who actually

take  the first step to seek help through the application

of  a PPO is critical.  The counselling orders reach  out

not  only  to  victims and abusers but, more importantly,

perhaps  to  the  hidden victims  of  violence,  ie,  the

children.   These  children  may  grow  up  learning  and

internalising  that  violence is  part  of  their  lives.

Studies  have shown that this can happen.  We  must  stop

family  violence,  and  I urge the Ministry  to  continue

working  with the courts in acknowledging the  importance

of  counselling orders in helping address the problem  of

family violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we talk about the children, I want to wrap up my

last cut with the issue of teenage birth and delinquency.

Sir, issues

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



of delinquency and teenage pregnancies are inter-related.

We have heard that statistics show that they are starting

to  move towards an increasing trend.  I cannot help  but

notice it also, as I see many teenagers getting pregnant,

some forced to get married, others choose abortion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the girls are getting pregnant, the boys are

getting  into trouble with the law, either due  to  their

sexual  behaviours or sometimes due to other  anti-social

and   criminal  behaviours.   If  not  assisted,  we  are

breeding potentially new multi-problem families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are these kids? Is it part and parcel of a

country's  development  that  we  have  such  issues   of

juvenile   delinquency   and  teenage   pregnancies?    I

recognise that dealing with youth problems is not an easy

task and requires the collaboration of many parties.  The

Government  has  set up the Inter-Ministry  Committee  on

Juvenile  Crime a couple of years ago.   I  am  sure  the

Committee  has  done much to curtail  the  incidences  of

juvenile crime.  But the problem of teenage pregnancy  is

a  serious  one  as,  often times, the  future  of  these

children  is  at stake.  As I mentioned earlier,  I  have

seen   cases  of  16  and  17-year-olds,  who  are  still

dependent   on   their  parents,  now  becoming   parents

themselves and have dependants of their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also called earlier for a detailed study

of  these  youngsters, not just the girls  but  also  the

boys.   What is their profile like?  Are they not fitting

into  the education system and its demands?  The Ministry

of Education has argued that streaming will allow them to

study  at their own pace, and should enable them  to  fit

into  the  system well.  Were these kids wrongly streamed

then?  I urge the Ministry to work with MOE to conduct  a

study to allow us to understand the problem better and to

develop more preventive programmes in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, delinquency does not happen overnight. Social

scientists  have  identified the stage of pre-delinquency

where   children  begin  to  manifest  early   signs   of

delinquency.  I would like to ask whether the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



Ministry   works   with  schools  in   identifying   pre-delinquents.    If  so,  how  many  pre-delinquents   are

identified  every year and what is being done  to  assist

them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the response given by MOE, I am sure MCDS

will also tell us that the role of dealing with the issue

is  not  theirs alone.  Certainly, parents  must  play  a

part.  The Children and Young Persons Act was amended  in

2001  to  allow courts to instruct parents to be involved

in  the  rehabilitation process  of  children.   In  this

regard, I would like to ask the Minister how many parents

have been involved in the rehabilitation process of their

children since the amendment of the Act took effect.  Are

both  parents actively involved in the rehabilitation  or

only  the mothers are involved, with the fathers  missing

again?   What are some of the problems that MCDS face  in

getting  parents  to  be involved in  the  rehabilitation

process?   How  are  these  problems  overcome,  and  how

successful have these efforts been?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the plight of many young teenage

mothers in the US dependent on the Government for aid and

continuing  the poverty cycle.  We cannot allow  this  to

happen  to our youth.  They are our future, and we cannot

allow  them to ruin their own future and, in that regard,

our country's future.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, like my

colleague before me, Dr Maliki, I am also concerned about

juvenile delinquency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the figures released by the Police recently

showed  that the number of juveniles arrested  last  year

rose  by  an  alarming 55.8%.  More than 2,200  juveniles

were  arrested, with students forming the bulk  of  those

arrested.   The number of juveniles arrested for  rioting

increased  by  138.7%  to  179 persons,  and  for  simple

thefts,  the number arrested increased by 116.6%  to  483

juveniles.  It was estimated that 85% of these  juveniles

arrested  were first-time offenders.  Addressing juvenile

crimes cannot just be the concern of the Police.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>



As mentioned by Dr Maliki, the parents, the educators and

the  community  must all play a part  in  instilling  the

right values in our youths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-ministerial Committee on Youth Crime has

been in existence for a number of years already. Are  the

recommendations and the initiatives of this Committee and

the programmes of the many agencies that are involved  in

youth    activities   preventive   enough?     Are    our

interventions reaching out to youths at risk early enough

before  it becomes a crime statistic?  Could the Minister

tell  us  what  new  initiatives  his  Ministry  will  be

undertaking to arrest the rising youth crime rate?  Is he

satisfied  that  there  is  enough  coordination  by  the

various  Ministries  and agencies to  effectively  tackle

this urgent problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir,

Singapore has undergone major changes in the economy,  as

well  as  in  our  social structure over the  last  three

years.  In  fact,  there are also major  changes  in  the

region and around the world.  These are tumultuous times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the outbreak of the Iraqi war, the world will

once  again be plunged into another crisis and it is  yet

uncertain how it will eventually turn out.  One thing  is

for sure - more changes in the world can be expected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amidst all these major changes, I am concerned

that   our  younger  generation,  which  grew  up  in   a

relatively secure and prosperous environment, may not  be

prepared  for the challenges that are coming  their  way.

They  may  be somewhat detached, somewhat indifferent  to

the  happenings in the world.  On the other hand,  trends

in  juvenile crime are most worrying. The statistics that

are shared by Mr Charles Chong a while ago tell us why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to do more to help our youths and help

prepare them for the future.  We need to understand their

aspirations  and their concerns. We need to  engage  them

and give them a clear

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



sense of direction and purpose. Our youth programmes  and

activities must be relevant to them.  We must  help  them

stay connected and stay out of trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  if  he  could elaborate on the youth  programme

that  comes  under his Ministry. What are the main  focus

and objectives of the youth programme?  How do we measure

the  effectiveness  of  the programme  in   engaging  our

youths  and  preparing  them for the  challenges  of  the

future?   How  do we reach out to the youths  to  involve

them in the programme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the spirit of remaking, I would

like to suggest to the Minister to consider undertaking a

thorough  review  of  the youth programme  to  ensure  it

remains  effective and relevant.  The  review  should  be

conducted  by the young people for the young people.   In

this way, we can ensure that the outcome will be relevant

to  them.   As  I  am no longer young,  it  will  not  be

appropriate  for  me to propose what  the  review  should

involve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to propose to the Government

to  consider appointing a Minister or a Minister of State

to  be  in  charge  of  youth development.   He  will  be

responsible  for  spearheading new initiatives  aimed  at

engaging  our  youths. This will provide greater  mandate

and sharper focus on the youth programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I am quite happy to receive this MCDS booklet on

"Key  Social  Statistics - Singapore 2002" recently.   On

its  back  page, it has 19 toll-free hotlines to  various

services that Ministries offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I cannot seem to find a crisis hotline

number.   Is there no such service or is the service  not

important?  I remember that a crisis hotline is available

and  widely  publicised inside army  camps  for  soldiers

having problems in crisis or feeling suicidal.  I believe

that  that service counselling hotline has been effective

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



reducing suicides for soldiers having suicidal thoughts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When citizens are faced with violence, crime or

disorder,  they know how to call "999".  When faced  with

fire  or  the  outbreak of fires, they know how  to  call

"995".   But  when overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness

and  contemplating suicide, there is no  easy  number  to

call  to  for  help.  An easy to remember hotline  number

like  "444"  or  in Chinese, "si, si, si", meaning  "die,

die, die" should be made available for citizens in crisis

to   call   to  for  help,  especially  when   they   are

contemplating  suicide.  Manned by  trained  professional

counsellors, such a last call for help could be a  matter

of  life  and death for that suicidal person, overwhelmed

by that sense of helplessness and loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand that such crisis helplines are

provided  by VWOs, like the SOS, the number is not  well-publicised  nor  easily remembered.  An  easy-to-remember

and  well-publicised national helpline number  should  be

set  up  to  supplement the works of the VWOs.   This  is

especially  critical  in  these difficult  times,  as  we

observe a higher incidence of elderly suicides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry can look into this request and

provide this additional and important service.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I thank Dr

Maliki for raising some of the issues.  Let me take  them

one at a time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we would know, Family Service Centres (FSCs) are

neighbourhood-based  focal  points  of  family  resource.

They  provide  services such as casework and counselling,

information and referral, and family education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCDS supports 35 Family Service Centres island-wide. One more FSC will start operating in Chua Chu Kang

this   year.  Each  FSC  serves  an  average  of   20,000

households  within a neighbourhood. Last year,  the  FSCs

served  an  average of one out of every  five  households

within their service boundary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance the effectiveness of the FSCs, my

Ministry,  together with the National Council  of  Social

Service   (NCSS),  introduced  the  Programme  Evaluation

System  (PES)  and Customer Satisfaction Surveys  in  all

FSCs  in 2001.  Sir, I am pleased to report that  80%  of

the FSCs have met the standards set by MCDS and NCSS.  We

are currently working with NCSS and FSCs to develop a set

of best practices and service quality standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the standards, we expect FSC

services to be open to all families, regardless of socio-economic  class  or race or religion.  Our  records  show

that FSCs' clients generally do not face language barrier

when  seeking  help from FSCs.  Moreover, we  expect  all

funded  FSCs  to  operate  on a  secular  basis  to  help

families who come to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some family service providers

which  do not receive funding from MCDS.  They have  been

set  up  as  community initiatives to serve the  specific

needs of their target group in the locality.  My Ministry

does  not monitor them. However, they will have to ensure

that  they  meet  the  needs of  their  constituents  who

support  their programmes.  My Ministry and the  National

Council  of Social Service will be most happy  to  advise

and  work  with  the  providers to better  improve  their

effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not go into the details of the

Programme  Evaluation System. I would be  most  happy  to

provide this to Dr Maliki, and there are about eight FSCs

known  to MCDS which are not funded by MCDS but  some  of

them  are funded through NCSS. So, there is a way for  us

to   work   with  them  on  how  we  can  improve   their

effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of domestic violence, I am glad that Dr

Maliki  sees it as a form of terrorism.  I would be  most

happy  to  provide  some of the specific  details  to  Dr

Maliki's  questions.   But let me  address  some  of  the

concerns on a more general note.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki's questions about domestic violence centre

on three main areas:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>



firstly, the trend in domestic violence in the last  five

years; secondly, how Police handle domestic violence; and

thirdly, how cases of non-spousal violence are handled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, between 1998 and 2002, the number of Personal

Protection Order (PPO) applications averaged 2,866  cases

per  year.   More than half (about 52%) are  issued  with

PPOs.  The number of breach of PPOs averaged at 147 cases

per  year.  The  average  number  of  persons  placed  on

counselling  is 770 per year.  I would just like  to  add

that  as a result of the downturn, the number of casework

and  counselling cases that we have seen through the FSCs

for 2001 was 10,300 and it went up to 11,200 families  in

2002.  This is an increase of 9%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaches of PPOs are considered offences and the

perpetrator  is  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine   or

imprisonment or both. The Police investigate all cases of

breach  and either issue warnings or put the perpetrators

in  the lock-up.  For persistent perpetrators, the Police

will institute prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPOs for children are also available to protect them

from  adult  perpetrators, without having to remove  them

from  their  homes.  And in the case of severe  violence,

the  Police will not hesitate to apply the Penal Code  to

bring  the  perpetrator to task.  So the example  of  the

Australian practice that Dr Maliki gave, we already  have

the provision for the Police to handle such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As research has shown that not all perpetrators or

victims  benefit  from counselling, there  is  a  set  of

criteria  to  screen out those who are less  amenable  to

counselling.    Their   outcomes   of   counselling   are

monitored,  and  these  will  be  reviewed  against   the

criteria to ensure that it is indeed targeting those  who

will  turn over a new leaf with counselling. As Dr Maliki

is  aware, we adopt a multi-agency approach in addressing

domestic   violence.   The  established  Family  Violence

Dialogue  Group  and Networking System allows  anyone  to

access help through any of the agencies that they get  in

touch with.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system also focuses on preventing domestic

violence through on-going public awareness and education.

The  latest  effort  in  public education,  for  example,

addresses dating violence as a preventive measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to learn from other countries

on  how  to  address domestic violence and what  measures

work  and what do not, so that our efforts will  help  to

reduce violence in the families, as also mentioned by the

Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the protocol and the specific

questions   regarding  Police  action,  I   think   these

questions  can  be  directed  to  the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs.   I will be most happy to assist the  Member  to

redirect  the questions to MHA for us to provide  a  more

comprehensive  answer on some of the queries  which  have

been raised by the Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the points raised by Dr Maliki,

Mr  Gan  and  Mr  Charles Chong regarding our  youth  and

juvenile  delinquents.  Youth, aged  10-30  years,  forms

about 28% of our population.  We must see how we can help

them  develop  their potential and mature  into  socially

responsible  citizens, with a strong sense  of  belonging

and rootedness in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like youths the world over, our young people are of

a  diverse  group, with different needs,  depending  upon

their  age,  education  and interests.   As  Mr  Gan  has

pointed  out,  their  aspirations  and  expectations  are

changing  rapidly and are quite different from  those  of

the older generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we engage our youths must therefore be tailored

to the segment that we want to reach. Thus, many players,

Government,   non-government  and  even  private   sector

organisations,  are  involved in a wide  range  of  youth

programmes today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong, Mr Gan and Dr Maliki have expressed

concerns about juvenile delinquency.  Dr Maliki has  also

raised about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



teenage pregnancies, out-of-school youths and families at

risk.   Over the last five years, about 2% of  the  total

number  of births were from teenage mothers.  I  wish  to

assure   Dr  Maliki  that  the  numbers  have  not   been

increasing.  In fact, it decreased from 953  in  2000  to

849  in  2002.   Nevertheless, MCDS,  together  with  the

community  partners,  will continue to  conduct  relevant

programmes  that  target  both the  teenagers  and  their

parents.  For  example, we have two  sexuality  education

programmes, which I have mentioned earlier, that  promote

abstinence until marriage and are designed to help people

develop  positive character traits and to assist  parents

to work with their teenagers on sexuality issues.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for juvenile delinquency, the Minister for Home

Affairs  has  responded earlier that the  rise  in  youth

crime is part of the overall increase in crime rate.   We

agree that juvenile delinquency, problems of families  at

risk, and out-of-school youths are best addressed through

a  coordinated inter-agency approach.  That  is  the  key

focus  of  the  Inter-Ministry Committee on  Youth  Crime

(IMYC)  chaired by Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee.  As  further

support  of a coordinated approach, my Ministry  is  also

working  with our strategic partners to build  integrated

case management systems.  The systems will enable service

providers  to  consult  with each  other  on  the  common

families  whom they are working with.  This  will  reduce

duplication   of   work  and  ensure  there   is   better

coordination among the service providers.  Of course, the

principle of confidentiality will govern the workings  of

the systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry agrees with Dr Maliki on the

importance of identifying and helping potential premature

school-leavers. For pupils who have persistent  tardiness

or truancy, the schools will undertake a pastoral role in

providing advice and counselling.  Schools may also refer

such  pupils  to  external agencies,  such  as  self-help

groups  or  voluntary  welfare  organisations  for  their

assistance.   Programmes, such as Project Reach  and  PAL

are coordinated efforts by various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



agencies targeted at early school-leavers who are at risk

youths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Children and Young Persons Act was amended

in  October 2001, parents of about 124 juvenile offenders

have  been given mandatory orders.  We are in the process

of   assessing   whether   such  mandatory   orders   are

successful.   The assessment will focus on whether  there

is  an improvement on the parent/child relationship.   In

our  preliminary studies, we are encouraged to hear  from

the  parents that they are now better equipped to  manage

and communicate with their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Mr Charles Chong have asked

how  we  can effectively engage our young.  The  National

Youth Council aims to empower mainstream youths with  the

values  and the skills to thrive and succeed in a  global

world.   It  engages youths by giving them the  space  to

develop and allowing them to form their own views through

experiential learning.  The Council supports  youths  and

youth organisations through grants, awards, national  and

international  programmes.  For example,  it  administers

the  Youth  Development Fund which provides  youths  with

seed  funding  to  run  community programmes.   NYC  also

supports the Youth Expedition Project (YEP), where youths

undertake  community projects in the regional  countries.

Through  the project, youths would have the opportunities

to  reflect on issues concerning the economic, social and

cultural developments of the country that they visit,  as

well  as Singapore.  Both programmes encourage youths  to

take  the  leap  to initiate and develop their  areas  of

potential and interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan and Mr Chong would appreciate that the impact

of many of these programmes would only be felt over time.

So  where possible, proxy or interim indicators have been

used  to  measure their effectiveness, and these  include

indicators   such  as  the  outreach  of  the  programme,

completion  rate,  and participants'  evaluation  of  the

programme.  Periodic youth surveys are done which provide

insight as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



to  whether we are moving towards our objective.  Let  me

share with Members one example in which Mendaki has  been

able  to  reach  out  to  a  group  of  youths  who   are

undertaking  a  project  under the  NYC,  called  Service

Learning.   We  have  matched that  particular  group  of

youths  or  young Singaporeans to run a reading programme

for   low  income  families.   These  are  some  of   the

initiatives  that  are in place to  help  us  engage  the

youths  so  that  they  understand better  what  are  the

challenges facing Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan also asked if we would review and revamp

major  youth  programmes.  I would  like  to  assure  the

Member   that   all   major   programmes   are   reviewed

periodically.  What is more critical is whether there are

gaps in the way we look at youth issues today, given  the

complexity  of  the  subject  and  the  numerous  players

involved.  We must ensure that our existing policies  are

in  line  and new policies are introduced, if  necessary.

Relevant  programmes can then follow.  So, with  this  in

mind, last year my Ministry formed a committee chaired by

my  Permanent Secretary, Ms Lim Soo Hoon, sitting  there,

and  involving officials from MOE, MHA, MINDEF, NYC,  MOF

and  PA.   I want to point to Ms Lim because Mr Gan  said

that  the committee should be chaired by a young  person.

She  is  indeed young, in fact, younger than I am.   This

Committee  will  review  and  coordinate  existing  youth

programmes,  identify gaps and propose  new  policies  or

programmes,  as appropriate.  As the Committee  is  still

new, let us give it some time to do its work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the issues.

May I invite Minister of State, Mr Chan,  to reply to  Mr

Chia's question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before Mr Chan replies, Dr Maliki has

got something to say.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Just a point of

clarification.   What about the cases  of  inter-personal

violence  among non-married couples, ie, the cohabitation

group?  They are not protected.  They cannot get PPO.   I

understand  that  MCDS will look into it.   What  is  the

status on that?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I am sorry. I

do not have the figures here, but I will be most happy to

provide   Dr   Maliki  the  figures  on  this  particular

question.   Can I invite Minister of State, Mr  Chan,  to

reply to Mr Chia's question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I am just responding to Mr

Steve Chia's point about national helplines.  We do  have

two  national  helplines.  One is by  the  Samaritans  of

Singapore (SOS).  The number is 1800-221-4444.   This  is

for   people  who  feel  desperate,  discouraged  or   in

distress,  in  other  words,  with  suicidal  tendencies.

Every  year, they receive about 37,000 calls.  About  90%

are non-suicidal and they very often refer these cases to

other  agencies.   The  other helpline  is  the  National

Family Centre hotline.  It is 1800-838-0100.  This is for

people  with any social problems and who need  help  from

Family Service Centres.  We will accept the point  by  Mr

Steve   Chia  that  both  these  numbers  can  be  better

publicised  and  we  will look into  how  we  can  better

publicise these numbers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, the Committee on Sporting

Singapore  (CoSS) was formed some years ago and  included

three Ministers and a Senior Minister of State.  The CoSS

made  a  number of recommendations to create  a  sporting

population.   Could the Minister give an  update  on  the

number of recommendations that have been implemented  and

also  when  will  the  rest  of  the  recommendations  be

implemented?   In  particular, what  are  we  doing  with

regard   to  participation  rather  than  excellence   in

competition  alone, as there are many health benefits  to

those who exercise regularly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, we recognise that sports

excellence  is an important means to help our  people  to

bond  as  a  nation.  To the credit of the Government  we

have embarked on various programmes to that end.  We have

gone  some  way  towards improving some selected  sports,

including  table tennis, bowling and bodybuilding.   Yet,

despite  our  efforts,  and with imported  talents,  that

first  Olympic gold medal still eludes us.   We  used  to

think that our ability

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>



to  excel  is  constrained by the size of our population.

However,  that seems like a fallacious argument as  there

are many other nations that are of the size of Singapore,

or  even  smaller, that have gone on to  sporting  glory,

while all we can claim for our sporting glory is our  own

Mr  Tan  Howe Liang.  He won our only Olympic medal  more

than 40 years ago.  I would like to ask the Minister  for

a realistic assessment of our potential to achieve world-class status in selected sports.  Are we not hindered  in

our approach by requiring sporting talents and potentials

to  be  scholars as well?  Will the Minister please  tell

this House what else the Government is planning to do  to

ensure that our vision of sports excellence will come  to

pass?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may take a leaf out of the Australian

government's  book.  In the Australian Sports  Commission

Strategic  Plan 2000-2005, it said that it will  continue

to  improve  programmes  for  elite  athletes  to  ensure

Australians  remain  in  the  vanguard  of  international

sports.  At the same time, it said that it was to develop

new  sources  of  income through effective  marketing  of

products and services and an increase in support from the

private  sector.  For the first point, I believe  we  are

already  on the right track.  The Government has  already

been  working to change the mindsets of Singaporeans that

sports  can  provide  an equally good alternative  career

path.  Our insistence on some minimum academic standards,

however,  as  was indicated recently, may  count  against

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is less well known - that sports

needs  a large amount of funding.  The Government  should

not  be  the  only one to fund this national effort.   We

ought  to  have  a  commercial strategy to  fund  already

popular  sports  that have a following in Singapore,  and

there should be concerted efforts to promote sports as  a

worthwhile corporate expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, we ought to have more role models besides

Fandi  and perhaps Mr Tan Howe Liang.  We need  stars  to

bring attention of our people to sports and this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



is  a  quality that we can tap.  This will not only serve

as  a  public  relations tool but also  an  easy  way  to

inspire  and  encourage younger Singaporeans to  identify

with sports.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, I agree that funding is a very

important point.  But perhaps a broad base of support for

sports  from  the population is just as important.   From

the perspective of myself, someone who only started being

active  in  sports in my secondary school  years,  may  I

suggest  the following, and I must say that this is  also

based on observations of Australia:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, start them young. Again I make the plea

for  a  broad-based participative approach  even  at  the

primary school years, especially since we know that  many

parents  and  grandparents have a rather  over-protective

attitude  towards their children, while others  may  feel

that this is a waste of time, which could be better spent

on studies and assessment books.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would say that we should not forget the

parents  and the adults because active parents,  who  are

themselves  into sports, are more likely to  be  able  to

persuade the young children to take up sports.   Or,  for

those  who  already  have sporting talent,  to  encourage

their children and give them the practical support needed

for  them  to develop, such as bringing them to the  5-11

training  sessions  a  week, if we  really  want  to  get

sporting excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would say, do not forget the young

people.   We  have  often lamented the  fact  that  young

people  tend to be rather inactive once they start  their

working  years.   But we must remember that  things  like

extreme sports, golf, triathlon and trail biking and even

rock  climbing,  tend to be taken up by  people  who  are

older   teenagers  or  young  working   adults.    Having

opportunities  for these young people to learn  and  take

part  in these sports would also give them an opportunity

for  interaction and, hopefully, this might  lead  on  to

marriage.   So  you will have a synergy  of  the  various

agencies within the MCDS where SDU might

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



actually  end  up  being  a synergistic  agency  for  the

sporting excellence for Singapore agency.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, when I read about the

Government's world-wide advertisement campaign to promote

Singapore, I immediately looked up the posters  published

in  some of the British and American media.  The campaign

profiles  seven personalities.  It includes  jazz  singer

and   actress  Jacinta  Abisheganaden,  fashion  designer

Andrew  Gan, SSO Music Director Liang Shui, and  some  of

the other personalities from the science and technologies

field.   I  looked in vain for a sports figure but  there

was none.  Apparently, we have none to boast about to the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made some steps towards sports

excellence, one which I applaud is the move to set up the

first Government Sports School to develop budding talents

in the sports arena.  But the announcement of the minimum

criterion that it needs an academic criterion,  which  is

Express stream as a minimum admission criterion,  to  me,

does  not  seem to be a step forward.  If  you  use  this

yardstick,  sports talents such as Fandi would  not  have

made it.  He was from ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, each of us has different gifts and talents.

Some  who  excel  in  sports may not  be  good  in  their

studies.   Of  course, some athletes can  excel  in  both

their  studies and sports but, more often than  not,  for

most  top  athletes  who are serious about  excelling  in

sports,  something has to give.  And, if  they  chose  to

excel  in sports, it often means that what will give  are

their  other  aspects of life, including  being  good  in

their studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be quite focused about what we hope to

achieve in the Sports School.  The stated mission of  the

Singapore   Sports  School  is  to  develop   Singapore's

promising  sportsmen  and sportswomen  to  their  fullest

potential.   It  aims  to  raise  the  level  of   sports

excellence achievements in Singapore, and the stated hope

is  that this will help us to reach the Government's goal

of becoming one of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by

2010.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this aim in mind, I feel that the Sports

School  should  not  be run like an academic  institution

which  puts  grades  first,  where  there  must  be  some

criteria  for  academic qualifications.  We should  allow

Technical  and  Academic stream  students  who  excel  in

sports  equal opportunity to enter the Sports School  and

to  maximise their sporting talents and to contribute  to

Singapore  in this way, not on a case-by-case basis,  but

as a rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I think that if we are serious about

producing  world-class athletes, we  should  take  sports

excellence a step further.  We should go all the way  and

set  up a sports institute for elite athletes.  This will

be where all the sporting needs of elite athletes will be

taken  care  of.  It is like the Sports School,  but  for

national  athletes  who are recognised  by  the  relevant

national  sporting bodies, elite or potential  elite.   A

good  model  that  we should look at  is  the  Australian

Institute  of Sports (AIS).  It leads the development  of

elite sports and is widely acknowledged in Australia  and

internationally as the world's best practised  model  for

elite   athlete  development.   It  offers   scholarships

annually to about 700 athletes.  The Institute was set up

following  the disappointing results from the  Australian

team  at  the  1976 Montreal Olympics.  But  since  then,

since  the  development of AIS, Australia has made  great

strides  in  its sporting talents.  Indeed, in  the  2000

Sydney  Olympics Games, the athletes that came  from  the

Institute  contributed to more than half  of  the  medals

that were won in the Sydney Olympics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The athletes also get help to make sure that there

is  life after sports.  One of our main concerns is  that

if  we train them in sports, would they have a life after

sports,  whether they can get jobs?  So I am saying  that

the  AIS  is  not an academic institution  but,  however,

there  is  help  to make sure that they have  life  after

sports, they have to take technical or academic course or

find suitable full-time or part-time employment.  I would

urge  the  Minister  to  consider  setting  up  a  sports

institute  to  help  us make our mark  in  the  world  of

sports.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, following the

Committee  on  Sporting Singapore Report, the  Government

has  earmarked $500 million under the Athletes Career and

Training  scheme to boost sports.  I spoke at  length  on

this subject last year, but I also pointed out that since

this  sum was being spread over three objectives, namely,

achieving  sports  excellence, sports  for  all  and  the

nurturing of a sports industry, the sum just appeared  to

be too little.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am one who would, in fact, advocate more money

than  what we have earmarked annually for sports, so that

we  can attain our dreams of achieving sports excellence.

But  I  was  a  bit surprised when I heard  the  Minister

announce  a  few  weeks ago that a  $650  million  sports

complex  will  be  built  in  Kallang  comprising  a  new

stadium, a new indoor stadium as well as offices,  shops,

restaurants  and other recreational facilities.   We  are

told  that  the  two new stadiums can also  be  used  for

events  such  as concerts.  And all these  are  meant  to

ensure  that  the new complex will be for  multi-use  and

that  the  complex will be a lively place the whole  year

round, and not just when there are sports events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that this is a case of putting the cart

before  the horse.  We will be spending so much money  on

hardware  that  we  will not have enough  money  for  the

software  which,  to  me,  is  more  important,  ie,  the

nurturing and development of sports talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore already has 13 stadiums, 12 public sports

halls, one indoor stadium.  Our present National Stadium,

built  in  1974,  can seat 55,000 persons.   In  fact,  I

remember  that  in  one Malaysia Cup match  in  1974,  we

actually  squeezed in 70,000 people.   The  new  proposed

stadium will seat approximately 50,000 people, about  the

same number as what the existing one caters for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new stadium, I agree, can make use of the

latest technology and we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



have the latest facilities.  One that is often used as an

example of the latest is the Sapporo Dome in Japan  which

was  used in the World Cup last year.  This one  has  the

latest works  -  one field inside the stadium, one  field

outside  the  stadium,  so  that  during  matches,   they

actually move the outdoor field into the stadium so  that

players  play under the best conditions.  But right  now,

they  are  wondering how to earn enough to maintain  this

stadium, just as both Korea and Japan are wondering  what

they  are going to do with all the 20 stadiums they built

to  host the World Cup, and they spent $131/2 billion  on

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same too for Sydney Homebush Stadium, the home

of  the  2000  Olympics.   Even  Malaysia's  Bukit  Jalil

Stadium, built for the Commonwealth Games in 1998, has  a

problem  to  cover its operating costs of RM2  million  a

month.  Unless we plan to host the Commonwealth Games  or

Asian  Games,  in  which case building just  one  stadium

would  not  be  enough, I am not so  sure  what  the  new

stadium hopes to achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we really need a complex with more shops,

restaurants  and  more office space to compete  with  the

present glut?  We already have eight million square  feet

of  empty  office space at the moment.  Are there  really

that many pop concerts that can fill a stadium of such  a

capacity?   Are  there  not  already  enough  venues   in

Singapore for such non-sporting activities?  Do we really

believe  that it will be such a vibrant sports  hub  that

families  will flock there all the time?  I do not  think

we  have  the  critical mass to keep  this  going.   Most

likely, it will turn out to be a ghost town.  Sir,  there

are  better  ways to spend $650 million in  the  name  of

sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Associations have complained

that the $500 million in the ACT hardly trickles down  to

them,  and they are the ones who need the money  most  to

nurture  sports talent.  Why can we not look at providing

more  facilities for the Sports School, and I  will  have

more  to say about this later so that more talent can  be

nurtured.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, your time is almost up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> I am summing up, Sir. If we have

this  $650  million  to  spend,  let  us  spend  it  more

sensibly, so that we can really develop sports talent and

produce sports heroes.  Otherwise, the rationale given is

just  wishful thinking, and I think we will probably  end

up  with the eighth wonder of Singapore!  Sir, I  am  all

for putting more money for sports excellence but, in this

case, I fear that we are putting our wrong foot forward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the vision

of  a  sporting  Singapore  has  brought  much  hope  and

excitement about the future of sports.  I would  like  to

ask  the  Minister  how the additional  $500  million  in

support of sports has been allocated to support the three

pillars  of  a  sporting  Singapore,  which  are   sports

excellence, sports for all and sports industry.  And  how

much  of  it has been disbursed and are we on  target  to

achieve the objective of the three pillars?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports School is a critical component of the

strategic plan for Singapore to become the top 10 nations

in Asia by 2010.  It will nurture our top talents so that

they  will become champions and, at the same time,  offer

them an opportunity to excel in life through sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Sports School will also bring about

a  mindset change and a clear message that we also  value

sports   talents,   not  just  linguistic   and   logical

mathematical  intelligence.  Therefore, I  would  suggest

that we should avoid admission criteria that put academic

results  first and sports talent second, to the exclusion

of our top talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 165 secondary schools in Singapore that

put academic results first, and rightly so.  But a sports

school  is  a  sports school, and perhaps  sports  talent

should  come  first.  Just imagine a sports  school  that

rejects top talents like Fandi Ahmad and Andrew Fang, but

perhaps  accept  lesser  talent  like  myself  who  could

probably make the Express stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask about the criteria for

sports to be included in the Sports

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



School.   For  example, how would netball  contribute  to

Singapore becoming the top 10 in Asia when only a handful

of  Asian countries play netball and is never included in

the  Asian Games and appeared only once in the SEA  Games

in  Kuala  Lumpur  in  2001?  Sir,  I  must  say  that  I

wholeheartedly  support  the  promotion  of  netball   in

Singapore.   But  the Sports School  must  not  lose  its

strategic  focus  and be over stretched  in  its  limited

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that when considering sports science and

sports  medicine  support, the Sports  School  will  also

synergise with NIE and the Singapore Sports Council, both

of  which have built considerable expertise in this area,

so that there will be no wasteful duplication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many Singaporeans, I am overjoyed that a sports

hub  will be built in Kallang.  It will become a thriving

centre  for  our  citizens  and  a  hub  for  our  sports

industry.  It should be a public facility that will cater

to  the National Day Parade, mega events and future major

games.   I hope that the public will be invited  to  give

inputs  on  its  development.  It should  be  built  with

passion  and  not  just numbers.  And together  with  the

Esplanade,  it could make Singapore the lifestyle  centre

of Asia, just like Monte Carlo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Code of Governance for the

national  sports  associations, as it would  bring  about

more  professional management and greater  accountability

for  the  good  of  sports promotion.  I  would  like  to

enquire about the progress of its introduction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you can take your

two cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Much

obliged, Sir.  Sports promotion in Singapore is under the

charge  of  the  Ministry of  Community  Development  and

Sports,  especially the Singapore Sports Council and  the

Ministry   of   Education's   Singapore  Schools   Sports

Council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



I  am glad, today, we have a Ministry of Sports and there

is a Minister who is fairly sports minded and, I am sure,

a  sporting person.  In the old days, I remember the late

Mr  E W Barker always wanted to be a Minister for Sports,

but  there  was no such Ministry.  And I hope with  that,

the  standard of sports should increase in Singapore, not

only  at  the local regional level but also international

level.   In  that  connection, has the  Singapore  Sports

Council or the Ministry as a whole done enough to promote

sports  persons at the national and international levels?

What  are the incentives and what are the steps taken  to

remove  the  disincentives?  We had,  in  the  old  days,

sportsmen  and  sportswomen  in  the  50s  and   60s   in

badminton, weightlifting, hockey and athletics. I hope we

will bring back the glorious days soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned, Sir, on the admission

criteria  for Sports School, I think it is important  for

us  not  to be too idealistic in wanting them to be  both

sports boys and also to be good in studies.  I think  the

main  criteria  must be sports and, if at all,  education

can  be a criterion but it should not be one of the  main

criteria, because we must produce sports boys and  sports

girls, and that must be the priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Council has a Code of Governance for

national sports associations, popularly known as  the  10

commandments.  There appears to be a maximum term for NSA

officers to serve in the various NSAs.  Could I ask  also

that  for  the  Singapore Sports Council members,  whilst

they  have done well, perhaps there should be a term  for

them  also, so that there is rejuvenation and new persons

coming at the helm to be in charge of sports?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about office bearers also in the Singapore

National Olympic Council, Singapore Football Association,

Singapore  Badminton Association?  I see a trend  towards

politicians  being more involved in these bodies.   I  am

sure  our  politicians are very busy, and  I  think  more

leeway  should be given for the citizenry to  participate

in leadership roles.  Therefore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



I  would  urge the politicians to be perhaps  patrons  of

these associations and not as Chairpersons or Presidents.

Give others a chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the approximately $500 million that has been

earmarked  for  sports as a result of  the  Committee  on

Sporting Singapore Report, how much has actually gone  to

the  NSAs?   Since the announcement of the  above  grant,

what  are  the specific budgetary plans for  the  various

sports  development objectives?  What  monies  have  been

spent  and under what headings?  What outcomes,  tangible

or intangible, have been recorded or accounted for?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is learnt that foreign consultants have been

employed  to the administration or divisions  within  the

Sports  Council.   How  experienced  are  they  and   how

effective  have they been?  What is their  experience  as

compared to local sports administrators who probably  can

do  a job as well?  If not, could we send them abroad for

training so that they come back with expertise and remain

loyal  to  Singapore?  How many talented athletes  do  we

have   and  are  receiving  funding  and  how   much   in

preparation  for  the  2003 South East  Asian  Games  and

beyond?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the MCDS propose to make sports less

defined  by  race?   As  we know, sports  creates  social

cohesion.  It is one of the best ways for different races

to play and grow together as friends, and gel together as

Singaporeans.  In this connection, I would like  to  know

why,   in   many  of  these  games  like  table   tennis,

basketball, swimming and wu shu, for instance, are played

mainly  by  the  Chinese, whilst sepak  takraw  and  even

soccer  by the Malays; and hockey and cricket by Indians.

What can the Ministry do to minimise this problem and get

our Singaporeans to gel together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, the setting up

of  the  Sports  School  to  provide  world-class  sports

training to talented student athletes to help them  reach

their fullest potential is indeed a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



good step.  I understand the first batch of students will

be recruited in January next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a local newspaper reported recently that

only  Express  stream students will be  admitted  to  the

school,  there  was  public  uproar.   Many  objected  to

setting   high  academic  qualification   as   an   entry

criterion.  It was even reported in the Straits Times  on

12th March that based on a survey of some 100 readers  of

the  Straits Times, only three agreed that high  academic

qualification is needed.  Even Khoo Swee Chiow, our well-known Mt. Everest hero, objected to the criterion.  In an

e-mail to the Straits Times, he wrote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Government wants to stress sports. Yet the

Sports School will be compromised by academic achievement

and this is a mixed signal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic pursuit must be secondary. Michael Jordan

only  does one thing in life  -  play basketball.   Tiger

Woods  only  does one thing in life  -  play  golf.   Ask

them  how  much  time they spend in practice,  they  will

probably say, "All my life".  Ask Fandi Ahmad, I am  sure

he has the same answer."

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of this strong objection to

setting  high academic qualifications as a criterion  for

admission  to  these schools, like my earlier  colleagues

who  have spoken on the subject, I would like to ask  the

Minister  to  review the entry criteria for admission  to

the  Sports School.  Could the Minister also tell us what

plans he has to ensure that the Sports School would  help

fulfil our dream of becoming a sporting nation?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, like my many

colleagues,  Mr  Sin Boon Ann, Ms Irene Ng,  and  several

others  who have spoken before me, and many Singaporeans,

I  am  dismayed  that  only Express stream  students  can

qualify  for  a  place  in the  Sports  School.   If  the

intention was to establish an academic institution,  then

I  do  not  see the relevance of constituting the  Sports

School  under  the purview of the Ministry  of  Community

Development and Sports.  In fact, I recently read in  the

media   that  10  schools  in  the  Woodlands  area   are

introducing a sports programme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



in the schools to nurture sport talents.  Other secondary

schools  and JCs have also signalled the same  intention.

Do they see an opportunity to outdo the Sports School?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree with the Sports School that

our sportsmen and women should be educated.  We want them

to  be  functional  citizens.  This means  they  must  be

literate,  able to read and write.  They must  reach  the

basic  academic  standards, able to live  a  normal  life

after their sports days are over, or if they fail to make

it in sports.  For those able to go further academically,

they  must  have the opportunity to do so in  the  Sports

School.   They must have the opportunity to  be  as  best

they  can be academically while perfecting their sporting

talent.   But the focus of the Sports School must  be  on

sports.  The intention of setting up the Sports School is

certainly  not  to nurture academic excellence  that  our

existing schools are doing very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, I feel that the Sports School should

identify those who have the talents to be good in sports,

regardless of academic abilities.  The School should then

work  with  them  to ensure that they achieve  the  basic

academic   education  to  be  functional  citizens,   but

nurturing  them in their sports talent.  By  putting  the

focus  or emphasis on the sports, the Sports School would

be able to achieve the goals for which it was set up.   I

hope  that the academic emphasis by the Sports School  is

not  a cop-out for fear of not being able to produce  the

sports  talents  but  making sure  that  they  cannot  be

accused of destroying the student's life, for the  latter

has his or her excellent academic qualification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki is not in. Mr Tan Soo

Khoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, the question here is whether

the criteria for admission into the Sports School are not

being  set too high.  By setting the entry level  at  the

Express stream, the Sports School

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>



is  actually  looking  for  sportsmen  with  brains.   An

official  was quoted as saying that this is in  order  to

prepare  students who, if they eventually do not make  it

in  sports,  can switch to academic pursuit.   Sir,  such

thinking is like admitting defeat even before the  School

is open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a stand actually means that aspiring sportsmen

and  sportswomen can only pursue their sporting  interest

if  they  can excel academically.  Sir, in that  case,  I

would just submit that we do not need a Sports School for

this.   There are already many schools in Singapore doing

this for a long time.  Schools like RI, ACS and a host of

others  produce all-round students all the time, students

who excel academically as well as in sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that, by setting such a standard, the

School may have missed the objective of why it was set up

in  the  first  place  and  that  is  to  produce  sports

champions.   Not all sports champions excel academically.

As  has  been  pointed out by Mr Chew,  I  do  not  think

someone like Michael Jordan, or for that matter, you  can

name a lot of other top sportsmen, Ronaldo and the like - I  do  not  think they were that great in their  studies.

And  it  is  like the same as if you want  to  have  good

musicians.  If the guy is gifted in musical talent or  in

singing,  you do not say that he needs to be academically

qualified before he can pursue such a career.  I  do  not

think  for  that matter the Rolling Stones  members  were

great shakes in their studies when they were young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, is setting a minimum standard of 200 points in

the  PSLE result too high and actually depriving us of  a

larger  talent  pool?   Even in the  United  States,  the

sports  colleges there require only an entry level  of  a

minimum of 2.0 grade point average - they call it the GPA

-  on  a scale of 4.0.  This grading is what I would term

as  a  fair pass, which is lower than our Express  stream

qualification and probably 2.0 grade point is  closer  to

our  Normal stream standard.  Furthermore, their  grading

takes place at a higher age for everybody, that is, after

High School.  Whereas in our case,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



the child is already streamed at a very young age and  on

the basis of just one single examination, ie, the PSLE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sports School must be seen as another route

for  those  who,  though they may have less  intellectual

capabilities, have other talents which, given  the  right

environment,  can be nurtured, exploited to the  fullest,

and that such people can bring honour to the country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports recently  launched  the

Code  of  Governance for the National Sports Associations

(NSAs).   This is indeed a good move as it will make  the

NSAs   more   effective,   more  transparent   and   more

accountable to the Government, their various stakeholders

and  the  general  public at large as public  monies  are

involved  in  the running of NSAs.  I fully support  this

move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how does his

Ministry  propose  to implement the  Code  of  Governance

among the NSAs.  I understand compliance is compulsory by

31st March next year, and there is not much time.  Sir, I

raise  this  because I was involved in the implementation

of  the code of corporate governance for listed companies

in Singapore, in my capacity as Chairman of the Singapore

Institute  of  Directors.  I know that the  task  is  not

easy,   given  the  initial  resistance  to  change   and

compliance and having to educate the many people involved

in the management of these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous seminars and workshop sessions have to be

held  to  explain  the code.  In the end,  we  could  get

companies to comply with the code in spirit and in  form,

but  ensuring  that the substance and the commitment  are

also  there is more difficult.  It takes time  to  change

mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I raise this concern because I believe that

implementing the Code of Governance among NSAs is  easier

said than done.  It requires a lot of effort and planning

on  the part of everybody.  I would therefore like to ask

the Minister if he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>



would  enlighten the House on the challenges  facing  his

Ministry in the implementation of this code.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, Dr Warren Lee has covered

some of the points which I intended to raise.  I will  be

very brief.  Sir, the Committee on Sporting Singapore  in

its Report for Sports for Everyone has suggested a target

of   getting  one  out  of  every  two  Singaporeans   to

participate in a sports related activity by 2005.  Almost

two  years  have passed since the Committee released  its

Report  in  July  2001.  There are about two  more  years

remaining  before the 2005 deadline.  Could the  Minister

give   us  an  update  on  the  participation  rate   for

Singaporeans in sports and what new initiatives are being

taken to increase the participation rate to our target of

50%?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like to

urge  the  Ministry of Education and MCDS to ensure  that

our  children  are  given maximum opportunities  to  play

sports in school.  I just want to quote our Minister  for

Education and Second Minister for Defence RAdm  Teo  Chee

Hean  that  ECA  in  sports should  be  broad-based  with

opportunities to specialise.  Just as pupils are  offered

a broad range of subjects in schools, they should also be

offered  a  range of ECA that exposes them  to  different

experiences  and  encourages the exploration  of  diverse

interests.   Presently, schools where  these  broad-based

opportunities should be given are presently left  to  the

individual  school's own resources to select and  nurture

certain  sports  which  they feel  they  are  capable  of

providing.   This negates the aim of a clear  broad-based

policy to provide ample opportunities for pupils to excel

in sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give one example. My little girl

wanted  to  play tennis and went for selection,  just  to

play  the  sport.  She was thrown five balls for testing,

and she came home telling me that she had managed only to

hit  one ball.  Hence, she was not allowed to play tennis

in school.  I have no choice but to send her to a private

class on Sunday and to pay $50 an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



hour.   I am able to afford it, but how many parents  can

afford  it.   I  concur with Dr Warren Lee that  we  must

start  the  young in sports early.  It is at this  tender

age  of  7 to 12 that world champions can develop and  be

nurtured.     Talents    can   be   identified    through

opportunities  to  participate  in  a  diverse  range  of

sporting  activities and outstanding pupils can  then  be

identified to provide the excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, the excellence factor has already

come  in  when  you  just  want  to  play  and  have  the

experiences  and,  most  often, the  excuses  are  always

limited facilities and human resources.   Presently,  the

Sports for All goals and programmes are developed by MCDS

and  the  opportunities given to the children are decided

by  the Ministry of Education.  There is obviously a need

for   total  coordination  and  commitment  between   the

Ministries.   I  would like to ask for an  inter-Ministry

committee to be set up to ensure that goals are  set  and

implementation  is carried out to ensure that  there  are

physical  and  human resources for maximum  opportunities

for the children to participate in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is small, and to build many stadiums and

running tracks is impossible.  We must build these scarce

resources where maximum shared uses are encouraged.  They

should  be built near the schools and conveniences,  such

as  near  to  MRT  and LRT stations, where  children  and

adults  can maximise the usage.  And what is the planning

provision for such stadiums and sports centres?  When was

the  last review done?  As for people resources, what  is

MCDS'  plan  to increase the number of sports instructors

in  schools as well as for the public sector, if we  want

to cultivate a sporting Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Maliki is not present. Mr Ong Ah

Heng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports has

delegated the task of developing a blueprint

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



for Excellence in Sports in Singapore to the Committee on

Sporting  Singapore.  This has provided a clear direction

for the sporting fraternity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as I can see, the allocation of $5

million, stretched over a period of five years,  and  the

blueprint  on 'Excellence in Sports' do not  reflect  the

true  situation.  Neither has the committee made  a  fair

allocation   of   funds   to  the  sporting   fraternity,

particularly  those sports associations not  regarded  as

having merit status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before the CoSS took over the centralised

management  of  funds,  other sports  associations  could

approach  the Singapore Sports Council and the  Singapore

Pools  for  funds  to finance their sporting  activities.

Now,  with centralised coordination of all funds  by  the

SSC,  those  National Sports Associations  without  merit

status  have  no recourse to financial assistance.   They

are expected to get help from the corporate sector.  With

the  current  economic slowdown, some sports associations

are  no  longer able to get help from the private  sector

and thus are not able to implement their annual plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that sponsorship for sports should be

prioritised  but  no  sport  can  achieve  a   level   of

excellence  overnight.  Ideally, each sports  association

should have a home of its own where its national team can

train.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land-scarce Singapore, I understand this

constraint, but the Ministry should try to help them on a

case-by-case  basis.   There are sports  that  can  share

facilities.  There are others which cannot.  One  example

is   basketball.   Since  the  Gay  World   Stadium   was

demolished  in  2001, the national  team  has  no  proper

training ground where they can train adequately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, I think quite a lot

has  been said about sports, sporting nation and sporting

people and, therefore, I have nothing more to add.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, many

Singaporeans  have  fully subscribed  to  the  notion  of

sporting  Singapore.  Sports, along with the  arts,  make

the  continued development of the character of  Singapore

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no surprise that residents in the Sengkang new

estate  look  forward  eagerly to their  sports  stadium,

especially  since  it  features so prominently  in  their

master plan.  Additionally, this sports stadium is  going

to  be  the first stadium to be co-located with a  modern

community club.  This CC is going to be a key centre  for

the  community  in the Anchorvale and Fernvale  areas  of

Sengkang.   Co-locating  allows  maximum  utilisation  of

common  areas,  such as the carparks,  as  well  as  non-duplication of sports amenities.  At the same time,  both

facilities can take full advantage of the Sungei  Punggol

river frontage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the need for the SSC to now fully cover

both  operating and building development costs has put  a

year's  delay  in  the plans.  Previously,  the  building

development of the sports stadium has been on  Government

grants.   Moreover, the bundling of four sports  stadiums

together  for  assessment  and  approval  compounds   the

magnitude  of  the problem for the SSC.  May  I  ask  the

Minister  whether  he  could  review  the  need  for  the

bundling  of  the  four stadiums and allow  the  Sengkang

Sports  Stadium  to proceed ahead, as the  CC's  fate  is

inextricably  tied  to  that of the  sports  stadium.   A

review to free up the gridlock would be most appreciated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainudin is not present and Mr

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I would like

to  thank  all Members who have spoken on the subject  of

sports.   I will try to the best of my ability to  answer

all   the   queries  and,  if  there  are  matters   left

unanswered, we will try and address them after  this  COS

through a written reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Warren Lee and Mr Ng Ser Miang have asked

for a progress update on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>



the    implementation    of   the   Sporting    Singapore

recommendations.  Of the $500 million Sporting  Singapore

Fund  set up in September 2000, we have thus far utilised

about  $125  million.  Out of the 40 recommendations,  we

have started implementing 36 of them.  The remaining four

recommendations,  which primarily  concern  the  National

Sports Associations (NSAs), will be implemented when  the

NSAs are more ready for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to elaborate on some of the key

initiatives  in  the three pillars of sports  excellence,

sports  for  all and sports industry.  Along the  way,  I

will  address  some  of the concerns raised  by  Members.

Together,  these  three pillars  form  our  vision  of  a

sporting  nation,  where  our athletes  do  us  proud  in

international  competitions,  our  people   play   sports

regularly, and where our sports industry is vibrant  with

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of Sports Excellence, our aim is to be

one of the top 10 sporting nations in Asia by 2010.  2002

was  a  watershed  year  for us.  We  achieved  our  best

results  ever  in the Commonwealth Games  and  the  Asian

Games.   We also had major international achievements  by

our  athletes  in  major  single-sport  competitions  for

badminton, bowling, table tennis and silat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree with Mr Sin Boon Ann that a small

population  base  does  not preclude  us  from  producing

Olympic  or world champions.  Although Singapore has  yet

to  produce  an Olympic gold medallist, we have  athletes

who  have  done  well in world or regional  competitions.

For instance, Jennifer Tan and Jesmine Ho are the current

World    Bowling    Masters   champion   and    runner-up

respectively.  Remy Ong is ranked as Asia's  top  amateur

bowler,  and Ronald Susilo is among the top 20  badminton

players in the world today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to achieve greater heights in sports

excellence,  on a more consistent basis, we  have  to  do

more.   We  have  already started  to  do  so  under  the

Sporting Singapore blueprint, and our efforts are focused

on three broad areas:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The development of the NSAs into effective

sports bodies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The setting up of a Sports School to develop

elite student athletes; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Our support for elite athletes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NSAs are an important component of our

sports   delivery   system.  They  are  national   bodies

representing  Singapore,  and  supported  as   the   sole

authorities  for their respective sports.  Hence,  as  Mr

Chew  Heng  Ching  has  pointed out,  accountability  and

performance  standards must be closely  monitored.   Last

year,  after  months of consultation  with  the  sporting

fraternity,  we  launched  the  Code  of  Governance  for

National Sports Associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things, the Code of Governance will

address a few key critical areas.  First, it will address

the  issue  of leadership renewal and fair representation

of  stakeholders in the leadership of the NSAs.   Second,

the  Code will address the concern of accountability  for

public   funds.   Increased  funding  support   must   be

accompanied by increased accountability.  Third, the Code

will  put  in place a system to ensure that the selection

of   athletes   for  major  competitions  is   fair   and

transparent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching has asked about the

implementation  of  the Code, and Mr  Ng  Ser  Miang  has

enquired  about its progress.  The NSAs for the Core  and

Merit sports are expected to comply with the Code by  end

of  FY2003.  However, we will consider NSAs' request  for

exemptions from, or delayed implementation for,  selected

clauses  in the Code on a case-by-case basis.  To  assist

the  NSAs  as  they comply with the Code,  the  Singapore

Sports Council (SSC) has already followed up with some of

the  NSAs.   SSC  will provide the necessary  assistance,

such   as   support   for   legal   advice,   review   of

organisational  structures  and  systems,  as   well   as

training.  We will work with each NSA to ensure that  the

implementation  of  the  Code  is  reasonable  and  well-supported.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



I  am  glad  that several NSAs have already started  this

review process on their own accord.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the performance expectations of NSAs

must  be  made clear.  In 2002, a review of  the  various

categories  of NSAs was done and a comprehensive  set  of

criteria was put in place for the classification of  NSAs

into   "core",  "merit"  and  "others"  categories.    In

essence,  when  SSC assesses the NSAs, it  looks  at  the

NSAs'  performance  in  international  competitions,  its

elite  athlete management, its promotion of the sport  to

the public, and its internal administrative systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For core and merit NSAs, SSC will set annual targets

through  the Partnership Agreements that it has with  the

NSAs.   Last  year, strategic NSA-specific  reviews  were

conducted for some NSAs, so that they know the areas that

they  have  to  improve on.  Some NSAs  involved  include

those  in  shooting,  netball,  sailing,  billiards   and

snookers, swimming, badminton and triathlon.  This  year,

we will share best practices among the NSAs, so that they

can learn from one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC supports the NSAs, mainly through financial

grants  and  the use of its facilities.  Last  year,  the

ceilings  of the total grants to NSAs were raised  to  $3

million,  $2  million and $0.5 million respectively,  for

NSAs in the "core", "merit" and "others" categories.  The

actual grants given out have increased over the last  two

years,  and will increase further in the next few  years,

if  the  NSAs have effective programmes.  Mr Ong Ah  Heng

has cited the case of basketball.  I am pleased to inform

him  that  the Basketball Association of Singapore,  like

other NSAs in the "others" category, is also eligible for

more  funding  support, as long as  they  have  effective

programmes  that  are in line with our  overall  national

objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong raised this in another matter, but

I want to address it, and he will be glad to know that we

have  not  left  out  our  elite disabled  athletes.  For

instance,  our  funding support for the Singapore  Sports

Council  for the Disabled has increased by eight-fold  in

FY2002.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach towards athletes is focused on

providing  them  with  assistance and  financial  support

during  their  training, rather than monetary  incentives

after  they have won medals.  This applies to both  able-bodied and disabled athletes.  There are private sponsors

and  people-sector organisations, such as  the  Singapore

National Olympic Council, which have monetary awards  for

medal  winners.   They have their internal  policies  and

guidelines on how such awards should be given out, and we

should leave these to their discretion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng also talked about the centralised

coordination of funds.  We think this is very  important.

Funds must be allocated to the most appropriate areas and

given  to  the  most effective programmes,  so  that  the

vision of Sporting Singapore can be realised.  Otherwise,

we  may  end  up  over-spending in one  area  and  under-spending in another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also help the key NSAs to set up their Centres of

Excellence,  which  typically are used  for  training  of

their   elite   athletes.   These  are  costly   projects

requiring both funds and land.  It is therefore  critical

that  we  weigh the costs and benefits carefully,  before

committing  to  any new Centre of Excellence.   In  cases

where a Centre of Excellence cannot be built immediately,

we  will  help the NSA to find a place for its  training.

Sometimes,  this  will  have  to  be  shared  with  other

parties.    So,  we  will  continue  to  work  with   the

Basketball  Association of Singapore to find  a  suitable

place  for its elite training.  I think the hon.  Member,

Mr  Ong, was referring to your goodself, Sir, and not me,

when  he  talked about the Minister watching a basketball

game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second area is the setting up of the

Singapore  Sports  School,  which  aims  to  provide   an

environment for promising student athletes who want to do

well  in their respective sports without compromising  on

their  education. The Sports School will begin operations

from  next  year,  and we expect to  have  about  100-150

students  in the first year.  Most of these  will  be  in

Secondary 1 and some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



will  be in Secondary 2.  In the steady state, we  should

have about 600 students.  The School will also be open to

elite  disabled  athletes.  The Singapore Sports  Council

for  the  Disabled  is currently helping  the  School  to

select suitable candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members of this House, ie, Ms Irene Ng, Dr Tan

Boon Wan, Mr Ng Ser Miang, Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Chandra

Mohan  and  Mr Tan Soo Khoon, and members of  the  public

have  spoken about the admission criteria of the  School.

Let  me  explain why we set up the Sports School  in  the

first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, Singapore loses many talented student

athletes because of the difficulties they face in  trying

to  balance their studies and sports training. These  are

students  who have the potential to excel in  both  their

studies  and  sports but, unfortunately, have  tremendous

difficulties  balancing them both today.  Something  must

give  in  the process and, sadly, it is often the  sport.

As we already have such a short supply of talented sports

people,  we must help these young athletes realise  their

sporting  potential whilst at the same time  ensure  that

they  meet  their academic potential.  This is  therefore

the target group of the Sports School.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked if we would not be losing out on

top  student athletes who cannot qualify for  the  School

based  on  their  academic results.   I  want  to  assure

Members  that the very talented student athletes will  be

assessed  on  a  case-by-case  basis.   Furthermore,  the

Sports  School, as rightly mentioned by several  Members,

is not the only path for promising young athletes.  Other

schools,  clubs,  and  NSAs  will  continue  to  play  an

important  role  in  developing elite athletes.   Student

athletes,  who cannot qualify for the Sports  School  but

who  have sports potential, will be trained by the  NSAs,

as  they  are  doing today.  The resources  that  we  are

pouring  in  to  develop the NSAs will  ensure  effective

programmes  for such young athletes.  These talents  will

not  be neglected.  The Sports School also plans to  work

with the NSAs to facilitate joint

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



training sessions with the Sports School students,  where

appropriate.   In  this way, we will  still  be  able  to

develop  their potential in sports, even if they are  not

in the Sports School.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a misperception that the admission

criteria  place  more emphasis on academic qualification,

rather than on the sports talent. I would like to clarify

that the first criterion for admission into the School is

that  the student must be talented in sport.  He will  be

among  the  very top of his cohort in that  sport.   Only

after  he  has crossed this hurdle will we  look  at  his

academic  results.   So, indeed,  sport  is  the  primary

consideration for admission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan noted that some mainstream schools

have  decided  to  put  more  emphasis  into  sports  and

wondered if they would outdo the Sports School.  I  think

it  is  good  that  mainstream  schools  are  emphasising

sports,  as  this  will  raise the overall  standards  of

sports among schools in Singapore.  Some of these primary

schools  will  feed  talented athletes  into  the  Sports

School.   And  some of the Junior Colleges will  probably

take in graduates from the Sports School.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng Ser Miang asked about the choice of sports in

the  School.  We will focus on eight sports in the  first

instance, namely, badminton, table tennis, bowling, track

and  field,  sailing,  swimming,  football  and  netball.

These  are key sports in Singapore.  Even if some of  the

sports  may  not  be  included in the major  multi-sports

Games,   such  as  Asian  Games,  there  are   equivalent

competitions  that  are equally  important  to  us.   The

School  will also take in promising student athletes  who

specialise  in  sports  outside of  these  eight  sports.

However,  the sports training will have to be taken  care

by the NSA, unless there is a critical mass.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School will have a modular approach to its

education so that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



student  athlete can better organise his  modules  around

the  training and competition schedules.  There  will  be

good  facilities, training programmes and sports  science

support  to  ensure  that his sports potential  is  fully

developed.  Finally, there will be hostel  facilities  so

that  students  can stay in the School as effective  time

management will be key to the students' success  in  both

sports training and academic education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ng Ser Miang has suggested that we work

together with NIE and the School of Physical Education in

the  areas of sports medicine and sports science so  that

we  will not duplicate these efforts.  I would assure him

that  both  sports  medicine and sports science  services

offered  to  our  students in the Sports School  will  be

offered, in collaboration and consultation with  SSC  and

the  School of Physical Education.  There will not be any

duplication  of  such  services as  both  the  School  of

Physical Education and SSC are in discussion on how  best

to work together on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sports School is a pioneer project in our

sports  development. I thank Members for their  interest,

concerns and suggestions. I am aware that there are  some

who  support our approach to the Sports School  and  some

who  do  not.  I would urge all to let the Sports  School

commence  operations  first.   Let  us  learn  from  this

experience.   If there are reasons to review  our  policy

later on, we will certainly do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third broad area for sports excellence is to

develop  a  comprehensive support system  for  our  elite

athletes.   This  will include funding support,  training

advice,  overseas scholarships as well as sports  science

and  sports  medicine support. For instance, the  Athlete

Career  and Training programme was launched in  2002   to

provide customised support to our top elite athletes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has suggested that we consider setting

up  a  Sports Institute for our elite athletes.  I  would

like to thank her for this good idea which we will study

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



further.  The setting up of the Sports School is  a  step

towards  a similar concept for Singapore. And,  again,  I

suggest  that  we gather the experience  of  running  the

Sports School first before we take this next step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the second pillar, which

is  the  Sports for All. I agree with Dr Warren Lee  that

recreational sport for the general public is important. A

sporting   lifestyle  can  lead  to  a  healthier   body,

development  of positive attributes among our  young  and

foster  closer bonding among our communities.  Mr Charles

Chong   has  asked  about  the  progress  of  the  sports

participation rate.  I am glad to inform him that it  has

increased from 34% in 1997 to 38% in 2001.  Our aim is to

increase  it  to  50%  by 2005. I  hope  all  Members  of

Parliament will support this effort and take up one sport

initially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be easy to achieve the 50% rate, but we

aim to get as close as possible to our target.  First, we

need  to create and customise sporting opportunities  for

the different segments of the general public.  Second, we

need  to  ensure that the sports facilities are available

and well-utilised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC has made a fundamental shift in its approach to

Sports  for  All from one of doing it itself  to  working

with   various  partners.   As  partners   have   to   be

identified,  enlisted  and  equipped  with  the  required

capabilities, this change cannot happen overnight, but it

has most definitely started.  SSC has also re-focused its

efforts on youth sports programmes.  SSC wants to nurture

a  lifelong love of sports in our youth for all its broad

merits,  and  not  just for healthy  lifestyle  purposes.

This  has  to  be inculcated in our children  right  from

primary  school.   Yet, another area  of  opportunity  is

women  sports,  which is given special  study  and  being

championed by certain NSAs, such as netball.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the students, SSC works with the Ministry of

Education,  schools and various NSAs. For  instance,  SSC

worked with MOE and the Football Association

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



of   Singapore  to  extend  the  "C"  Division   Football

tournament played by schools so that the school teams get

to  play  more  football matches. SSC also  supports  new

initiatives  such  as the "Catch Them  Young"  initiative

that  many schools have expressed interest in.   SSC  and

NSAs  have also organised sports camps, mini-leagues  and

competitions for children and youth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target is not just the school players. We also

want  to  encourage non-school team players to learn  and

play  sports.  Hence, SSC has introduced to  schools  the

Sports@Basic programme, which teaches students the  basic

skills   of   a  sport.  Some  50  schools  have   either

participated  or  expressed interest in participating  in

the Sports@Basics programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general public, the Sports for Life Centres

managed by SSC organise a wide range of sports activities

at  the  community level, such as sports  programmes  for

senior citizens and women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree with Mr Ong Ah Heng that we need to

leverage on our partners in sports, if we hope to  create

more sporting opportunities for Singaporeans. This is one

reason why we decided to transfer the Constituency Sports

Clubs from the SSC to the People's Association (PA)  last

year.  The SSC also works very closely with the Community

Development  Councils (CDCs), NSAs,  Constituency  Sports

Clubs  and  grassroots organisations to organise  a  wide

range of sports activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we also launched the Sports Partners

Promotion Programme to support our sports partners in the

organisation of sports events for the general public. To-date,  more than 60 applicants have been supported  under

the  scheme.   Assistance provided  by  SSC  ranges  from

financial support, knowledge transfer and networking.  By

supporting more sports partners, we hope to play the role

of  a  catalyst  and  encourage more partners  to  create

sporting opportunities for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong Ah Heng talked about the role of SSC in

organising mass sports

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>



events.   SSC  is already working with various  agencies,

such  as  the  PA,  in the organisation of  such  events.

Nonetheless, this year, we will review how  we  can  make

better  use of our resources, whether they belong to  SSC

or  our partners, so that we can re-channel resources  to

the more effective programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the issue of sports

facilities.   Singapore has a large  number  of  sporting

facilities on a per capita basis.  SSC manages  an  array

of facilities such as swimming pools, football fields and

indoor  sports halls. This supplements the facilities  in

the   HDB  common  areas,  eg,  basketball  courts,  CCs,

schools,  private housing and corporations. In  addition,

public  parks  and  even Sentosa can  also  be  used  for

selected sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC is reviewing its masterplan for sports

facilities  so  as  to  cater to changes  in  demographic

trends,  preferences,  as  well  as  to  achieve   better

utilisation,  accessibility and  cost  effectiveness.  As

part  of  this exercise, SSC will review planning  norms,

design   of   facilities  and  operations   of   existing

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better utilise these facilities, we are looking

into  arrangements to share some of these facilities,  as

Mdm Cynthia Phua has suggested.  SSC and the Ministry  of

Education  have started a pilot scheme on  Co-sharing  of

School Fields with the community. Under the pilot scheme,

seven  school  fields  will be  open  for  community  use

outside  the  school curriculum time. SSC  will  maintain

these   fields  and  manage  the  usage  outside   school

curriculum  time. Two school fields, Serangoon  Secondary

and  Dunearn  Secondary, have been upgraded  with  simple

changing  rooms for the players. Upgrading work  for  the

remaining  five  schools is targeted  to  finish  in  the

second half of 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where appropriate, parks also allow and provide

facilities  for  recreational  non-competitive   sporting

activities.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



instance, woodball is played in Sun Plaza Park,  mountain

biking  is  done in Tampines Biking Trail and  soccer  in

designated areas in Bishan Park, Pasir Ris Park and  East

Coast  Park.   NParks  and SSC also collaborated  in  the

recent  launch of Keep-Fit-Taiji-in-Parks as yet  another

means to promote parks for healthy recreational activity.

Concurrently,   we  are  also  making   better   use   of

temporarily vacant state land.  SSC has taken  possession

of two sites in Ubi Avenue 1 and Marina South and built a

total  of eight football fields on these two sites.  They

are  now  very  popular  among football  lovers.  We  are

looking into more of such opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim talked about the funding framework

for  sports facilities. We aim to seek greater efficiency

and  effectiveness  in the use of our  capital.  However,

this  will  not  slow  down the building  of  new  sports

facilities if the project is justifiable. I assure Mr Wee

that  we are in discussion with the relevant agencies  on

the  development  of several sports complexes,  including

the  one in Sengkang. The fact that we are pursuing these

complexes jointly should not affect their implementation.

Where  necessary,  we will proceed on  any  one  of  them

independently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the third pillar, which is

the  sports  industry.   It is  our  aim  to  double  the

economic  contribution of the industry from $680  million

in 1998 to $1.4 billion by 2010.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key strategy in developing the sports industry

is  to  create  and  attract major  international  sports

events  to  Singapore.  In  FY  2002,  a  total   of   29

international sports events were supported by SSC through

sponsorship and grants. These included the Rugby  7,  the

Caltex  Masters  and  the  Standard  Chartered  Singapore

Marathon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SSC also successfully secured the bid for Singapore

to  host the IOC Session 2005, thanks to efforts  of  the

previous  Chairman, Mr Ng Ser Miang.  This is the  annual

meeting  of the most prestigious world body on  sports  - the International

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



Olympic Committee.  More than 120 members of the IOC will

meet  in Singapore in 2005 to elect the host city of  the

<br><br>2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer  Olympic  Games. We  expect  this  event  to

receive a lot of media attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a feasibility study on redeveloping the

National  Stadium  into a multi-purpose  Sports  Hub  was

completed  last year.  I would like to thank Mr  Tan  Soo

Khoon for raising this matter.  The Government has agreed

with  its  recommendation  to build  the  Sports  Hub  in

Kallang.   The exact mix of facilities in the Sports  Hub

will  be  decided after a masterplanning of  the  Kallang

area  is  done. We aim to start construction in 2005  and

complete the Sports Hub by 2009.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Hub will be a national landmark, and will

not be a ghost town.  It will bring Singaporeans together

to watch and participate in sports, and at the same time,

cater  to  major  local  and  international  sports   and

entertainment  events. It will help foster  the  sporting

culture among Singaporeans and boost the sports industry.

At  the same time, the construction and operation of  the

Sports  Hub  will  generate economic spin-offs  and  help

create  jobs.  Details on the construction of the  Sports

Hub,  including  its design, its exact location  and  its

cost estimate, are currently being studied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan has addressed the concern of why is it

that  we need to build the Sports Hub together with other

facilities.  The Sports Hub is about a lifestyle that  we

want  to develop in Singapore, which not only focuses  on

sports,  but  other related activities.  If you  look  at

examples  of  the various sports stadiums in  the  world,

such as in France and other parts of the world, they have

developed  their stadiums into more than just a  sporting

stadium.   It  has, in fact, generated a lot of  interest

among  its local population.  The more recent example  is

the  Stadia  De  France in Paris which, despite  all  the

initial  cost,  has been able to turn around  and  become

more  profitable. Our initial study shows that the Sports

Hub in Kallang can be profitable, not only due to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



sports  events  but other events that will  generate  the

human traffic that we desire.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan has commented that there are

too   many   politicians  involved  in  national   sports

associations.  Sir, if they are passionate  about  sports

and willing to contribute to sports, then I welcome their

involvement.    Mr  Chandra Mohan  felt  that  we  should

involve  our  sports  people in these  organisations.   I

agree   that  former  athletes  can  often  provide   the

athlete's  perspective and add value to the organisation.

There  are  many  such  examples in  the  various  sports

associations,  such as Mr Desmond Koh, a former  Olympian

swimmer,  sitting  on the newly formed  Singapore  Sports

School  Board.   Ms  Grace  Young,  our  former  national

bowler,  is  assisting the Bowling  Association,  and  Ms

Annabel Pennefather, a former hockey national player, now

Vice-President of the Hockey Federation.   Even  the  new

SSC Board is headed by a former national swimmer, Mr Alex

Chan,  and has six other members who are former  national

athletes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by Mr Chandra Mohan on

whether or not we should rejuvenate the SSC, in fact,  we

have  done so.  Mr Ng Ser Miang has done a good job.   He

was  at  his  peak when we decided that we need  to  also

bring in new blood.  Mr Ng Ser Miang is now supporting us

through   his   various  connections  in   the   sporting

fraternity to help us further achieve our goal of being a

sporting  nation  in  2010.  Sir, I must  emphasise  that

appointments as Board members or staff should be based on

the person's ability to contribute and not simply because

he was a sports person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer briefly some of the other points

raised  by other Members.  I agree with Mr Sin  Boon  Ann

that  we need to attract corporate sponsors, and that  is

the purpose of building up the sports industry.  Based on

our  recent examples, the Rugby 7 and the Caltex Masters,

we  are  able  to  generate that.  So,  it  is  not  only

Government funding, but also the corporate sponsorships.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Tan raised a very good point regarding the

balance between hardware and software, and why we  should

spend $650 million on hardware.  Mr Tan would agree  that

we  need  both, hardware and software.  He is nodding  in

agreement and that is good.  Not enough?  Well,  I  would

agree  with  him  that we can do with a little  bit  more

money,  but the $500 million that we have is being  spent

well  on  the right areas, to ensure that we can  develop

not only the athletes but the supporting systems.  So  we

want to strengthen our NSAs, we want to help our athletes

and  we  want to encourage a larger base of people  going

into sports - the point raised by Dr Warren Lee and other

Members  of  the  House  - and  we  need  to  get  enough

Singaporeans to want to do sports and play sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan raised the specific point

about  foreign sports administrators.  We hired the  most

suitable  candidate for the job, and this  has  been  the

result  of Sporting Singapore blueprint because  we  need

people who are capable, who have done the work before  in

their own country and can share their experiences.  It is

not  that we are selecting foreigners, but we are  trying

to  select the best person.  So, in this regard, we  have

gone beyond Singapore to find people who are capable and,

at the same time, we are looking for Singaporeans who are

able  to help us in this effort.  So we will try our very

best  and,  at the same time, we will train  our  people,

through the various programmes that we have under SSC, so

that  they  themselves  also can  develop  the  necessary

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of racial integration and sports, I

agree  entirely  with him that, at the end  of  the  day,

sports  should  be  the  basis for  us  to  bring  people

together.   But, I do not think that we can force  people

to  play  a sport if they are not comfortable with.   You

cannot  ignore the fact that, for example, silat is  part

of  Malay culture, and predominantly you will see  Malays

in  silat.   But  it does not mean that  people  are  not

integrating.  If you go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



to a community centre on any one night, you will have the

silat  group at one corner, the wushu at another  corner,

but  they  are  all  under  the same  roof,  interacting,

talking, discussing with one another.  So I do not  think

we  should fault people for wanting to take up  only  one

particular sport.  We should encourage as many people  as

possible to adopt all sports that they are interested in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Dr Warren Lee raised a very good point

that  SDU  could  promote sports as part  of  the  social

interaction activities.  I would be most happy  to  learn

from him what more that we can do because, at the moment,

both  SDU  and SDS have regular followings amongst  their

SSC   members  in  golf,  beach  volleyball,   badminton,

cycling, bowling and yoga.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the last three years have been

very exciting for sports in Singapore.  I must thank  you

for  your  good  work, Sir.  For the first  time  in  our

sporting history, we have a clear blueprint to chart  our

course towards sporting excellence, promoting sports  for

all and developing a sports industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, underlying the specific programmes

that  I  have  mentioned earlier, is  the  need  for  all

Singaporeans  to support sports.  They  can  do  this  by

encouraging their children to be active in school sports,

by  attending  and  supporting local  sports  events,  by

participating in sports activities in their  communities.

All  these  will  underpin the gradual development  of  a

sporting  culture.   If  I might  cite  my  own  personal

example,  Sir.  I am a cyclist and I have  been  able  to

teach  my  7-year-old son to cycle.   Every  weekend,  we

cycle together at the East Coast Parkway.  As a result of

my  interest  in  cycling, I have been  able  to  enthuse

another  Singaporean to be interested in  cycling.   But,

Sir,  the  reverse  has  also  happened.   My  5-year-old

daughter  is a very good roller-skater.  As a  result  of

her  interest,  I  have begun to take up  roller-skating,

Sir, with a lot of bruises to show for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the emergence of a sporting culture is best

exemplified when Ronald Susilo

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



made  it  to  the  semi-finals and finals  of  the  5-day

Singapore   Badminton  Open  last   year.    Some   5,500

supporters  came  to  cheer  him  on  each  day.   School

children  of  all races and gender cheered him  at  every

smash.   Aunties,  makciks and pakciks  were  waving  the

Singapore  flag.  The atmosphere was electric,  something

we  have  not felt in a long time.  People from different

races,   different  ages,  and  different  socio-economic

backgrounds, all came together for a common cause  -  and

that  was  to cheer on our Singapore hero, and  that  was

Team Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Singapore, Sir, is about working and playing

together,  supporting one another  for  a  common  cause.

Team  Singapore is about being proud of Singapore.   This

concept goes beyond sports.  It is equally applicable  to

many  areas  where  our multi-racial  and  multi-cultural

society works together as one united people.  Sir, I look

forward to the support of this House as we seek to  build

Team Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Point of clarification,

Sir.   The Minister said that for Sports School, it would

look,  first  at  sporting talent and then  the  academic

qualifications.  Can I ask the Minister whether it  means

that if a student has great sporting talent ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, are you raising a

clarification?  That is not a clarification.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The clarification is that

if  the  student has great sporting talent but  does  not

meet  the  minimum qualification, and he is not from  the

Express  stream  but from the Normal or Academic  stream,

can he make it to the Sports School?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, as I mentioned

in my reply, we will look at such cases on a case-by-case

basis.   Ultimately,  it  is sporting  talent  that  will

become  the  first criterion but, yet, at the same  time,

the  academic standards of the particular child will have

to  be  considered.  Because, at the end of the  day,  we

also want the child to be able

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



to  study  in  school,  and to balance  both  sports  and

studies.  So, if there is a child that does not meet  the

academic criterion, as I said, we will consider it  on  a

case-by-case basis.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, point of clarification. My

concern is not that schools should share facilities  with

the public, but our schools do not have enough facilities

and  sports  personnel  to  allow  our  children  maximum

opportunities to enjoy sports.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, my apologies.

Last  year, SSC launched a programme, together  with  the

schools, where we gave a small funding to each school for

it  to  hire  a  coach  or someone  who  is  prepared  to

volunteer  to run sporting programmes for the non-athlete

students.   This is one way in which we can  address  the

lack  of  manpower  within the school system.   I  cannot

recall  the exact numbers, but more than 40 schools  have

joined  the  scheme, and a good number of  students  have

been involved in games in which they otherwise would  not

have been involved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I do not quite understand

the  Minister  when he said that he is  now  prepared  to

lower the admission standards to the Sports School  on  a

case-by-case basis.  If he is now prepared to lower it on

a  case-by-case basis, why stop at that?   Why  not  just

allow it for everybody?  I recall that one of the reasons

stated for not allowing admission for those with just the

normal  standards was that the school would not have  the

facility  to cater for Express and Normal streams.   But,

if  you are now prepared to allow people in on a case-by-case basis, that means you still have to run courses  for

those from the Normal Stream.  So why do it on a case-by-case basis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of the sports city, I

think he has missed the point ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It was not a clarification, Mr Tan.

Was the first one a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes, I am clarifying something on

---

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, you were asking a question. It

was not a clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, a clarification need not be

in the form of a question.  But I do not understand him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do not understand him?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> On the question of the sports

city, I find that he misses the point.  Do we really need

a  whole  complex with all the extra office space,  shops

and  recreational facilities?  Does he really think  that

people  will  be  flocking there?  He has  to  understand

that,  in  Singapore, if you really want to  have  people

going  to your sports stadium, the trick here is to build

more stadiums all over the island.  I do not think if you

build a multi-complex, people are going to flock over  to

Singapore.   That was the same argument we used  when  we

built  the  National Stadium in 1974.  But just  see  how

many  people go to the National Stadium every day?  After

the Malaysia Cup matches were over, you hardly could fill

the  stadium at all.  I must also tell him that the  cost

of  $650  million  for  the whole complex,  probably,  is

wrong.   Because,  to  build a  top-class  stadium  would

already  cost you $600 million, at least, and  I  do  not

think for that price you could build a whole complex with

all the other facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Yaacob, the second one is not a

clarification.  Just answer the first one.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the Sports

School,  as  I  clarified earlier,  we  are  prepared  to

consider on a case-by-case basis.  I will leave it to the

Sports  School to decide what sort of criteria they  will

use  when  there is a very, very good athlete, but  whose

academic qualification may not meet our mark.  The reason

why  we  are prepared to do so, and I think Mr  Tan  will

understand  this, is that even in schools,  for  example,

there  are  children  who are just slightly  one  or  two

points  off a certain benchmark.  They can be  helped  to

cross over to that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



particular  benchmark.   We understand  the  concerns  of

Members that we should not miss out on such talent.   But

I  would  like  to appeal to Members to  also  allow  the

Sports  School to start the programme and learn from  our

experience before we undertake a major review in terms of

its admission criteria.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> On a point of order,

Sir.  I  am interested to know the answer to the question

raised  by  Mr  Tan.  I would like to know  why  you  are

saying that the Minister does not need to answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That was not a clarification asked.

Pure and simple.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> I was the one making the

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, that is the answer. He was

the one making his clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the foreword of MUIS' report 2001 states

that the community should adopt a new mindset in order to

face  future challenges.  This change should  begin  with

the  community.  In  the  same report,  MUIS  stated  its

objectives  to lead the community in Islam,  as  well  as

provide guidance in its efforts to produce a community of

excellence that contributes to the prosperity of  Muslims

and  the  nation.  MUIS accepts its duty in  leading  the

Muslim community in this aspect.  My question is: what is

the  position of MUIS' leadership at the moment?   Is  it

becoming more effective?  How could this effectiveness be

measured?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there were voices that questioned MUIS'

credibility,  that  is, at the time  when  the  community

debated  on  the tudung, NEWater and JI issues.   I  have

said  before in this House that MUIS' credibility  should

not  be  questioned.  But this does not  mean  that  this

would  always be guaranteed and should not be a  concern.

On  the  other  hand,  MUIS' credibility  and  leadership

should be nurtured

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



and  strengthened all the time.  Among the elements which

influence MUIS' leadership is its relationship  with  the

community.  Is the question of MUIS' credibility  that  I

have   mentioned  earlier  connected  to  its  ties  with

society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a large part of MUIS' Executive Council members

are  made  up of those who are nominated by the community

organisations.  There are also members of  the  community

who  are  in  a few of MUIS' sub-committees.  Both  these

structures  have  the  potential to  bring  about  closer

cooperation  between MUIS and the community.   Can  these

ties  be enhanced?  What measures can be taken, in  terms

of  its  structure or programmes, in order to  strengthen

the ties between MUIS and the community?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MUIS' report for the year 2001 also states

that   the   challenge  today  is  to   build   on   past

achievements, without being shackled by old mindsets, yet

still  firmly  upholding true religious teachings.   With

such  challenges, what factors should MUIS give  priority

to?   What is being undertaken by MUIS so as to make  the

community share the same perspective?

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I just want to

echo what Mr Khalis has said and this is basically on the

role  of MUIS and its leadership.  What I am saying today

is very much what I hear on the ground with regard to the

perception  on the role of MUIS.  The role  of  MUIS  has

even  been more critical over the last year or so,  given

the fact that the Malay/Muslim community has been put  on

the  forefront quite a bit.  And often times, the  ground

is  asking  what is the position of MUIS in many  aspects

that  affect  the Muslim community.  In  this  regard,  I

would appreciate it if the Minister could clarify what is

the   relationship   between   MUIS   and   the   various

Malay/Muslim  organisations.   Because  some   of   these

Malay/Muslim    organisations    are    not     religious

organisations.  I  just want to clarify the  position  of

MUIS.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Islamic matters, how does MUIS

reflect   its  leadership  roles  through  the  different

actions or programmes that it has?  In this regard  also,

some  of  the  members  of  the  community  question  the

directions  of  MUIS, because I think they  see  MUIS  as

doing  a  lot of things but without a clear focus  as  to

what  are  the  directions.  Could  the  Minister  please

clarify that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another perception is that MUIS is spending a lot of

money  on the media to enhance its image, which was never

done before.  My questions are:  how much is being spent,

for  what purpose is it necessary, and are the objectives

being met?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I am

speaking  on  MUIS and Muslim affairs, forging  a  better

unity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the last North East District meeting, one

participant asked for the doing away with the position of

Minister-in-charge  of  Muslim  Affairs.   The  resident,

interestingly  a  Malay, sees it as  an  anomaly  in  the

context of a secular Singapore and also in our efforts at

pursuing a Singaporean Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe Singapore still needs a position of

the   Minister-in-charge  of  Muslim  Affairs.    It   is

important  to  see  the role in its correct  perspective,

especially  in  the  context of multi-racial  and  multi-religious  harmony  and  integration.   May  I  ask   the

Minister to share with us how he sees that role and  what

are some of its challenges?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, MUIS' position is also unique. Its

credibility must be preserved and indeed enhanced, not by

the  nature of its statutory position, but by the rapport

building  and  respect  from the people.   What  has  the

Minister's and MUIS' experience been over the last  year,

particularly  following the September  11  and  the  Bali

bombing, in forging better understanding of the issues at

hand and in achieving better bonding?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS' credibility is also as important in the

eyes of the non-Muslims, being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



the only statutory board with a religious role in secular

Singapore.  MUIS needs to play its part in bringing about

better   understanding   and  rapport   with   non-Muslim

organisations  and  the community at large.   MUIS  could

initiate  an annual inter-religious gathering  to  foster

better  understanding.   After all,  the  Inter-Religious

Organisation  (IRO) was initiated by  the  famous  Muslim

scholar,   Maulana  Abdul  Aleem  Siddique.   Would   the

Minister  share with us what has MUIS done  in  promoting

better racial and religious harmony in the schools and on

the national front?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the break

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head I (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman:</b> Sir, I would like to

focus  on  Islamic  education, following  up  on  several

discussions that have gone on in this House after the two

JI arrests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister announced the setting up of

a list of religious teachers by MUIS.  It is a kind of an

opt-in  scheme  where religious teachers can  have  their

names  registered with MUIS so that the public can  check

as  and  when  they need to.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister about the status of the list.  Has the list been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



helpful to the members of the Malay/Muslim community?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue of Islamic education was at the core

of  the JI incident and debate when Islam was used as the

reason  for  the  terroristic  mindsets.   The  community

started introspectively looking at the form and system of

Islamic education we have here.  I would like to ask  the

Minister to share the current system of Islamic education

that  we have in Singapore, as we understand today, there

are  part-time  and  full-time  classes  run  by  various

organisations.  My question is: what is the role of  MUIS

in  supervising and monitoring the system?  Is  there  an

accreditation   mechanism  for  organisations   providing

formal Islamic education?  If there is, who does it?  Are

licences  issued  for  such  institutions  to  run   such

classes?  Who issues these licences?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not too long ago, I also understand that MUIS

embarked  on  a thorough review of the Islamic  education

system, including its curriculum, structures, etc.  Can I

ask the Minister for an update of that review?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani:</b> Sir, about three

years  ago,  the Government decided to enforce compulsory

education (CE).  Madrasah students are exempted  but  not

totally  spared.  They are required to achieve a  certain

standard  in  English, Mathematics and Science  at  PSLE.

This  standard  is pegged to the average score  in  those

subjects  of  six lowest scoring national  schools.   The

first batch of madrasah students who are so affected will

sit for their PSLE in 2008.  They are now in Primary One.

This  CE requirement means that madrasahs have to  revamp

their   curriculum.   This,  in  turn,  calls   for   new

textbooks,  new  materials,  even  changes  in  teachers,

teacher   training  and  teaching  methods.    MUIS   has

embarked  on a curriculum development programme  in  this

regard.   Could  the  Minister give  an  update  on  this

effort?   What has been achieved thus far and  what  more

can we expect?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PSTE, which is the Malay acronym for

Secondary Four Certificate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>



Examination,  in the madrasahs conducted by  MUIS  a  few

years  ago  had  introduced a degree  of  standardisation

among our full-time madrasahs, at least for the religious

knowledge component.  The CE requirement infuses  further

standardisation,  this  time  in  relation  to   English,

Mathematics  and  Science.  Does this not  bring  greater

coordination  and cohesion among the madrasahs  now  that

they have to meet more common standards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are seeing advancements made in the realm of

knowledge  at a rate unimagined before.  It is imperative

that MUIS resources be allocated to enhance the relevance

and  quality of madrasah education in Singapore.  At  the

same time, all the madrasahs, MUIS and the community need

to  work  more closely together to meet these challenges.

The global landscape is undergoing changes in the wake of

the Sudanese side events.  We saw 9/11 and the threat  of

trans-national terrorism.  Ethnic conflicts and  tensions

occurred  and are still brewing in several parts  of  the

world and, even as we speak, there is now a war in Iraq.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are beginning to wonder whether the

theory  of the crash of civilisations is more valid  than

was  originally thought.  Do our madrasahs and MUIS  take

this  into  account  - the scenario  which  I  have  just

painted  -  when formulating or reviewing the curriculum?

I  believe they should, Sir, if the madrasah is  to  play

its role effectively in contributing towards the progress

of the community and the well-being of the nation.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, like other

communities, the Muslim community in Singapore must  also

do  its  part to strengthen our multi-racial  and  multi-religious social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Mr Ahmad Khalis and Dr

Maliki  have spoken about the important role of  MUIS  in

guiding the religious development of the Muslim community

and  the  need  to  forge greater  partnership  with  the

community.  I fully agree with the concerns raised by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>



three  Members.  Since September 11, MUIS has  made  even

greater efforts to galvanise the Muslim community towards

national unity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I agree with Mr Ahmad Khalis that the members of

the MUIS Council, as part of the leadership of MUIS, have

a  special responsibility to bring MUIS and the community

together  in  fruitful  partnership.   MUIS  also   works

closely with its networks of mosque committees, religious

and  community leaders and other key Muslim organisations

to  ensure  that the public has access to sound religious

teaching.   MUIS  makes  use of platforms,  such  as  the

Mosque  Council,  Asatizah Network, Muzakarah  Mosque  or

mosque  leaders' platform for coordination,  sharing  and

networking.  Such networks also strengthen MUIS'  ability

to  reach  out,  build a common vision and implement  its

programmes more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS also seeks to develop a corps of progressive

and  credible  local religious leaders.  It is  revamping

the  religious studies curriculum of the madrasahs.  MUIS

also  runs  a scholarship programme to ensure the  future

supply of well-qualified teachers and officials.  Sir,  I

will  touch  on  the  aspects of religious  education  in

greater   detail  in  response  to  Dr  Mohamad  Maliki's

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while MUIS is the key authority on Islamic

issues, it carries out its work with the support  of  the

Muslim  community.  For example, MUIS and Pergas  have  a

joint committee on asatizah development.  MUIS also works

with Mendaki and AMP to bring in speakers who can add  to

the  discourse on Islam and with Perdaus on  publications

to  guide the public on religious issues.  MUIS would not

have been able to do its work without the support of  the

wider  community.  Since 1975, 19 new mosques  have  been

built with the contributions of 130,000 Muslims from  all

walks  of  life.   Every year, some  3,500  haj  pilgrims

undertake   the  pilgrimage  to  Mecca.    Besides   MUIS

officials, we are also accompanied by volunteers, such as

doctors and nurses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



Their  tireless  contribution had  won  praise  from  the

pilgrims   and   the  Saudi  government   had   expressed

appreciation for the well-organised Singapore contingent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also encouraged by the number of

volunteers  wo have come forward to serve on the  various

MUIS  committees.  For example, there are 870  volunteers

in   the   Mosque  Management  Boards  and   other   MUIS

committees.  The MUIS Council and Fatwa Committee members

are  also volunteers.  Volunteers also serve in the Young

Muslim   Secretariat  and  as  teachers   for   religious

programmes   in   the  prisons  and  drug  rehabilitation

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I assure Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed that MUIS

will  continue  its  outreach to  strengthen  racial  and

religious harmony and to correct the misconceptions about

Islam  and  the Muslim community following the events  of

September   11.   MUIS  has  indeed  stepped  up   public

education  efforts, including goodwill visits, talks  and

dialogues and mosque open houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, more than 12,000 people attended

MUIS'  talks on "Understanding Islam and the Malay/Muslim

Community"   both  in  English  and  in  Mandarin.    The

programmes have received good feedback.  MUIS also hosted

students  for Learning Journeys and will extend these  to

civil   servants   this  year.   As  for  inter-religious

dialogue, MUIS actively participates in activities of the

inter-religious organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media in all languages have been helpful and

important  to  MUIS.   The Chinese media  has  been  very

forthcoming  in helping MUIS to reach out to the  Chinese

community here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Maliki raised the concern whether MUIS is

spending  too  much  money  on publicity.   MUIS'  Public

Affairs and Public Education Department is a small outfit

of  four officers and its public education budget in 2002

was $800,000.  To MUIS' credit, it has done a lot with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



these resources.  It has not spent the money on publicity

as  much as on delivering public education programmes  to

Muslims  and non-Muslims and responding to the challenges

in September 11.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these efforts, the Muslim community will be

in  a  better  position  to weather  the  impact  of  the

external  developments, such as the US war  on  Iraq,  as

well  as  maintain mutual understanding  and  trust  with

other  communities.  With the support of  the  community,

MUIS  will continue to guide the community in becoming  a

model Muslim community in our plural society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed has also touched on the

role of the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.  I  see

my  role  as galvanising the Muslims to take their  place

proudly  in the Singapore society, progressing  alongside

others  and contributing to Singapore's peace, prosperity

and progress.   Many I have spoken to share in this wish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last year, I have met with the leaders of

over  30  mosques,  sometimes  joined  by  my  Malay   MP

colleagues.   We  also  held  seven  dialogues  with  the

Malay/Muslim community and religious leaders over  issues

affecting the community.  The Malay MPs have also visited

non-Muslim  organisations, especially Chinese  employers,

to enhance mutual understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now address the question raised by Dr

Maliki  concerning religious education and the  religious

teachers'   director.   MUIS  has  formed   a   Religious

Education and Advisory Panel to advise it on improvements

to  religious education for the Muslim public,  including

target  groups, such as children and adults.  The  review

covers  areas, such as the curriculum, training  for  the

asatizah,  or religious teachers, as well as how  various

institutions, such as our mosques and private  providers,

can help enhance the quality of religious education.  The

advisory  panel is also actively gathering feedback  from

various stakeholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosque leaders have also actively contributed their

support and ideas to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



improve religious education through the Muzakarah Masjid,

a  regular  platform  which MUIS initiated  in  1997  for

sharing and networking among mosque leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch now on some of the areas that MUIS and

its  key  partners are reviewing.  First,  the  religious

education  curriculum.   MUIS  has  already  developed  a

religious  education  curriculum  to  teach  school-going

children basic Islamic knowledge.  This material is  used

in  classes run by our mosques.  And adults attend  talks

and forums conducted by various teachers at the mosques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, religious teachers. For classes held at

mosques,  the  mosque management boards ensure  that  the

speakers  and  teachers are qualified.  Last  year,  MUIS

provided  training  for  some 450 religious  teachers  to

upgrade their religious knowledge as well as expose  them

to issues in the economic and social spheres.  This would

put  them  in  a  better position to help their  students

apply Islamic principles to life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing the efforts of mosques, there are also

other  providers,  as alluded to by Dr Maliki,  including

the  Islamic  Missionary Committee, Muslim  organisations

and private education centres.  Whilst there is no formal

accreditation or licensing of these private centres, MUIS

keeps  regular contact with them to share and  update  on

the  developments.   These providers use  the  curriculum

offered  by  MUIS and actively keep MUIS  informed  about

their   classes.   The  mosques,  together   with   these

providers, cater to some 32,000 school-going children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time religious education is carried out by the

six madrasahs, with an annual intake of 400 pupils.  MUIS

administers the madrasahs and assists them with resources

for  teacher training, student development and curriculum

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked about the religious teachers'

directory launched in July last year.  The directory  now

lists 317

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



teachers.   Members  of the public have  been  using  the

directory  as a means to verify whether an individual  is

registered  with MUIS.  If an individual is  not  listed,

the public can still check with MUIS.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Muslims engage religious teachers for home-based teaching. Most home-based teachers teach

recitation  of  the  Qur'an, and do not  teach  religious

classes.  Increasingly, more people are approaching  MUIS

and  the  mosques  to  ask about the credentials  of  the

religious  teachers  or to recommend  suitable  religious

teachers.   At  the same time, various study  groups  and

teachers  have also approached the mosques  to  let  them

know  about  their classes, so that the  mosque  is  kept

informed   of   the   developments.    These   are   good

developments taking place in the Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I answer Mr Ahmad Khalis' question on

madrasah   education,  let  me  just  clarify  that   the

benchmark  to  be achieved by the madrasah  students  for

PSLE is pegged at the average PSLE aggregate score of EM1

and   EM2  Malay  pupils  in  the  six  lowest-performing

national schools, ranked according to the performance  of

their  EM1 and EM2 Malay pupils in the PSLE of that year.

So,  we take the six lowest-performing schools, take  the

Malay  students, and take that as the benchmark.   It  is

not  pegged to the average score in those subjects of the

six  lowest  scoring national schools, as the Member  has

suggested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the madrasahs, with the support of MUIS, have

strengthened  the  delivery of English,  Mathematics  and

Science to meet the requirements of compulsory education.

MUIS will ensure that madrasah students are given all the

necessary help to be ready for the PSLE in 2008.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the madrasahs have significantly increased the

contact  time  for English, Mathematics  and  Science  to

match  the  same exposure time that the national  schools

devote to these subjects.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madrasahs have hired 14 more teachers with the

relevant   qualifications  and  teacher  training.    The

madrasah   teachers   also  attend  in-service   training

conducted  to  enhance their teaching  skills  and  their

proficiency  in  English.    NIE  has  agreed  to   MUIS'

proposal  to accept madrasah teachers who meet the  entry

requirement  of  the Diploma of Education Programme  from

this  July.   MUIS is seeking nominations  from  the  six

madrasahs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Curriculum Development Project (CDP), which

takes  place  over six years, will revamp the  curriculum

for  Islamic  studies and Arabic language programme  from

Primary  One  to Pre-U 2.  The materials for Primary  One

have  been  completed, and teachers have been trained  to

use  them  from this year.  The next phase will focus  on

the Primary Two and Secondary One levels.  Some madrasahs

prefer to deliver the new curriculum in Arabic and Malay,

rather  than  in  Arabic  and English.   MUIS  will  work

closely with the madrasahs to facilitate this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS and the madrasahs fully share Mr Ahmad

Khalis' views that madrasah education must be relevant to

our  knowledge-based  economy and  plural  society.   The

madrasahs  will work together, in partnership with  MUIS,

to  achieve  these  goals.  As I understand  it,  in  the

curriculum  being rolled out by the CDP, they have  taken

into  account  some  of  the social  contexts  which  are

relevant to our Muslim students here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up on the issues raised on MUIS, let me

assure  Members that MUIS will spare no effort in helping

the  Muslim  community move forward  as  a  community  of

excellence.   MUIS will continue to work  in  partnership

with  Muslim  or  Malay  organisations  which  share  its

vision.   I  thank all those who have given their  strong

support, and urge every member of the community to  rally

together with MUIS.  MUIS is our institution, and  it  is

our   collective  responsibility  to  work  together   to

strengthen MUIS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Dr Tan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Yes, Sir, I would

like  to  seek two clarifications from the Minister.   He

mentioned  that  MUIS has allocated $800,000  for  public

education.  I think that is quite a good sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many of us on the ground always have this

feeling that we are not so sure as to how ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, what is your point of

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I am coming to it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please make it quick.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Yes, I think there is a lot of

time.   Very  briefly, there are so  many  practices  and

social behaviours that non-Muslims are actually not  very

sure  about,  and  I was wondering whether  the  Minister

could  ask  MUIS  to  give  those  on  the  ground  clear

directives  as to what is correct behaviour and  what  is

not.   Because, sometimes, we do not know whether or  not

to  shake hands with a person, and why at a function  all

the  food  must  be  halal.  We want to  get  some  clear

directive as to what is correct and what is wrong.   That

is one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to seek clarification on is

with  regard to the matter on religious teachers which  I

brought  up previously, because I want to make sure  that

politics and religion are not mixed at the mosque.  Can I

ask  the  Minister whether there are any more PAS members

teaching at our mosques?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If I may clarify, actually both your

questions are not clarifications.  I think there is  some

confusion as to what is a clarification and what is  not.

A  clarification  is  not  for  Members  to  ask  another

question, but to clarify if Members do not understand  or

the   answer  is  not  clear  or,  like  you  said,   was

misunderstood.   Nevertheless, I will let  that  one  go!

You can answer Dr Tan's questions, Dr Yaacob.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the second

point,  I think Dr Tan has made a mistake there.  No  PAS

teachers  are teaching in our mosques.  What happened  in

the  past  was that we had invited speakers from Malaysia

who,  when we started inviting them, were not members  of

any  political party, but who have since then joined one.

But,  as  I  have  told the House, we  will  continue  to

monitor the situation to make sure that whatever they  do

in  the  mosques,  they  do  it  properly  and  meet  the

objectives that we want to meet.  This is being monitored

by  MUIS.  We work together with the mosque officials  to

encourage  them to first get local speakers, if possible.

If  they  really cannot and want to get foreign speakers,

they  should  be  more selective.  So, I  would  like  to

assure Dr Tan that the system is in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about practices on the ground, I would

be most happy to ask MUIS officials to speak to Dr Tan to

clarify  on  some of the matters.  If Members  need  some

clarification,  I  think  MUIS would  be  most  happy  to

discuss  with them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the annual report of

the  People's Association (PA) provides in its vision  to

be   the  leading  organisation  in  building  an  active

community  where all contribute readily  to  the  nation.

The  mission provides:  to promote active citizenship and

multi-racial   harmony,  to  connect  the  citizens   for

community   bonding  and  volunteer  work,   to   provide

affordable access to life-skill and lifestyle activities,

and  to  bring the people closer to one another  and  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA has done well over the years. It has

historically  grown with the progress of  Singapore  from

the  1960s  till now.  It was the brainchild of  the  PAP

leadership.  It was a machinery to get the pulse and feel

of  the  citizenry.   Today, PA has bloomed  on  its  own

through  the management and administrators, organising  a

wide  range of activities for our people.  PA's board  of

management comprises 15 members, two-thirds of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>



whom are PAP members, and include the Prime Minister  and

three Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I ask the Minister why the need for this? The

Ministers  are busy people, and they should  be  released

from  such responsibilities, unless, of course,  they  do

not  want  to for political reasons.  Should  PA  not  be

governed  by  the people of Singapore and  not  political

leaders?  Politicians should learn to govern the  country

and  leave the governing of PA and other associations  to

the  citizenry.   Would the Minister not  agree  that  it

would  be  preferable  if power and  responsibility  with

regard to associations registered under the Societies Act

-  and I believe PA is one - are spread to citizens,  and

the  political leaders should be more sporting  and  must

learn  to  be  confident  of  their  own  citizens?   Our

citizens  should be allowed to bloom and they  should  be

given  the chance to hold senior positions.  Politicians,

especially  Cabinet Ministers, can always be  patrons  or

advisers of PA.  PA is an association of the people.   It

should  not be labelled as a PAP organ anymore.  It  must

be  an  institution  for  the  people  and  the  people's

activities,  and  it  must  be  depoliticised.   I  would

therefore   urge   the  Minister  to   relook   at   this

organisation  and make it a people's association  without

too  much connection with the PAP leadership in its board

of management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been commented, Sir - and PA recognises this

-  that  activities organised by PA are  being  supported

mainly by a particular race.  I am sure PA is trying  its

level  best  to  ensure that this problem  is  minimised.

Would  the  Minister  consider having,  perhaps,  in  the

office-bearers  of  PA  top  management,   more   Malays,

Eurasians and Indians, and have this advertised, so  that

all races would feel they are made welcome in PA?  It  is

also  important and crucial that all races  treat  it  as

their   national  duty  to  participate  in  PA-sponsored

activities.   Race-related organisations must  also  help

the PA.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo, you can take your

two cuts together, please.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to

raise   three  issues  with  regard  to  the   role   and

performance of the CDCs to-date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs, together with the grassroots

organisations, have done a great job in fostering bonding

among  residents.   In  the last  two  years,  CDCs  have

enlarged  their scope to embrace programmes initiated  by

other Ministries to help the citizens, eg, job fairs, job

placements,   and   dispensing  financial   and   welfare

assistance  to  the community.  This administrative  task

can  be  very labour intensive.  My question is:  is  the

current  manning  strength at the CDCs adequate  for  the

service providers to do an expeditious job?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second issue, recently the newspapers

carried  some write-up on the CDCs, and the role  of  the

Mayors  was also questioned.  In order to keep the public

more  informed  of the work of the CDCs and  the  Mayors,

perhaps  it  is  timely to produce an  annual  report  to

highlight  their milestones.  Many of our CDCs have  been

rehoused  with better facilities and amenities  to  serve

the  community.  Such projects do incur expenses,  and  I

understand  that  they  can be  quite  substantial,  even

though they may be for a good cause.  But the public  may

not  see  it in the same light.  As such, it is important

to  showcase  the CDCs' performance in an annual  report.

Would  the Minister consider such a suggestion?   Indeed,

the   CDCs  can  also  establish  their  key  performance

indicators  as  benchmark targets, so  that  no  one  can

allude  to  the Mayors of the CDCs for playing  a  lesser

role, as we have read recently in the newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, five CDCs had accumulated massive surpluses

last  year, some as high as $20 million.  At a time  when

the people need help, more financial assistance should be

extended  to  help  the  needy.   There  should  be  less

emphasis   on  accumulation  of  surpluses.   Could   the

Minister provide a breakdown on the amount spent by  CDCs

on projects to help the needy?  Also, what is the amount

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>



spent   on   job  assistance,  compared  to   the   total

expenditure of the CDCs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second cut, Sir, having been involved in

chairing  feedback sessions, I would like to submit  some

suggestions   that  I  have  gotten  from  the   feedback

sessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the issue of closing the loop in our

feedback  process.  That was talked about before,  but  I

would still like to raise it again.  A good communication

process  inevitably  involves  an  exchange  between  two

parties.  Simply put, in a lively and dynamic process, an

action  should  elicit  a reaction.   That  being  so,  a

feedback  from one party must also result in  a  feedback

from another party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is seemingly a 2-way process during a

feedback  session,  where participants  will  share,  and

panel   members   will  facilitate   by   verifying   and

clarifying.  Is this good enough?  Here, I would like  to

share  typical  dialogue  and  seminar  settings  at  the

workplace.  Typically, after such a session,  we  do  not

have  to  search  too  far to hear  groups  of  employees

gathered  together, making such comments as:  "As  usual,

someone else would make the decisions that we would  have

to  work and live with", or "Those who make the decisions

rarely,  if  ever, ask us what we should  do."   Finally,

these  same  people vent their frustrations in personally

unique  ways,  bad-mouth  their  employers  or  clam  up.

Consider  the  dollars  spent  in  these  dialogues   and

seminars, and ask ourselves what is really accomplished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an enterprise, the single most untapped

resource  is  the  wisdom of the people who  work  there.

Knowledge and expertise are the raw materials; wisdom  is

the  finished product.  When companies just focus on  raw

materials  and overlook wisdom, they are wasting  one  of

their   greatest  assets.   Similarly,  in  our  feedback

sessions,  we  are  just  focused  on  netting  the   raw

materials  which  flow one way from the audience  to  the

podium,  in  the belief that they will add value  to  the

feedback  databank.   Undeniably, such  meetings  do  add

value.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>



However,  they  also  squander a perfect  opportunity  to

reverse  the  flow and further tap into a  resource  that

will  yield even richer returns, ie, the support  network

for implementation of policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have often asked what has happened to their

feedback.   Why  is there no feedback to their  feedback?

The process of feedback must translate into an engagement

of participants.  Participants feel engaged when they see

what   they  say  matter.   Feedback  News,  a  quarterly

newsletter  of the Feedback Unit, can be a good  feedback

tool  on the feedback we have received.  I would like  to

ask the Minister whether Feedback News is distributed  to

every   participant  invited  to  attend   the   feedback

sessions.   At the same time, can we create a  column  in

Feedback   News  that  would  highlight  the   bites   of

participants attending the various feedback sessions  and

have   specific   commentaries  or  response   from   the

secretariat as to the follow-up action and final outcomes

for  each  of  the bites from the participants?   Through

Feedback  News,  we  can  begin  to  demonstrate  that  a

feedback mechanism to the feedback sessions is indeed  in

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, are there any other ways that the Ministry

is looking into to ensure an engaged process?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you have two cuts.

Take them together, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Feedback Unit is

a  useful  tool  for our people to give  their  views  on

current  issues,  be  it politics,  economics  or  social

matters, and the feedback being relayed to the Government

is useful to the Government for policy making.

However, the perception must be right.  Whilst the senior

officials   have   done  a  good   job,   including   the

chairpersons, the view may be that the chairperson, being

a  PAP  member,  may not be the ideal situation,  because

this  is a feedback session from the people.  It  may  be

timely to consider whether we should have an independent,

non-partisan person

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



of  repute  to  be the overall chairperson.   This  might

create  greater  participation amongst thinking  citizens

and  people  with  differing views and even  the  cynics,

because the feedback coming from them will be very useful

to our Government.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the chain of commands and what happens once

feedback  is  given to the Feedback Unit?   What  is  the

follow-up action from the Feedback Unit to the Government

authorities?  How many views given by citizens have  been

adopted  by the Government in one way or other?  What  is

the  means  of  reporting back by the Government  to  the

Feedback  Unit  and, thereafter, to the participants  who

participated in these feedback sessions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Feedback Unit has had several

chairpersons.   Do  we  have a basis  for  assessing  the

success of the Feedback Unit as a whole, and is it  still

considered a viable organisation worth keeping?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will just quickly go on to my next cut. Our

citizens  are  given  a great deal  of  opportunities  to

participate    in   Singapore   life   through    various

organisations,   including  Government  committees,   PAP

committees,   RCs  and  other  organisations   and   also

associations formed under the Societies Act, through  the

various 6,000-over associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, would the Minister look at the promotion of

citizenry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>



participation on a higher level, in political discussions

through  NGOs,  and  not restrict it  to  just  political

associations?  Politics belongs to the people.   We  must

encourage  them  so  that they will  show  concern  about

political life in Singapore and more would participate in

political activities and, hopefully, in politics  and  to

run for general elections in the years to come. There  is

this constant complaint that even the PAP may not be able

to  find enough candidates of the right number, and  that

could  probably  apply  even more so  to  the  Opposition

parties.   So,  by us encouraging promotion of  citizenry

participation  in   Singapore life,  including  politics,

perhaps  we could have a better feel of politics  amongst

our  citizens and, therefore, they will participate  more

in political life in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah is not present. Dr

Yaacob.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, let me address

the  issues on the Feedback Unit and active citizens, and

the other points will be taken up by MOS Chan Soo Sen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Feedback Unit solicits feedback from the

people through various channels.  It recognises the  need

to   close   the   feedback  loop   with   its   feedback

contributors. It routes the feedback it receives daily to

the   Ministries,  which  then  reply  directly  to   the

contributors. So those who provide the feedback are  kept

in the loop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit also publishes the Ministries' replies on

its  website  and in its newsletter so that  others  with

similar  concerns can benefit from the  sharing  of  such

information.   All  feedback  received  is  collated  and

compiled  into  a monthly report which  is  sent  to  the

Permanent Secretaries of all the Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close the loop with the Feedback Groups, the Unit

arranges  for the groups to meet with Ministry  officials

to  discuss  their  papers  and recommendations.   Papers

presented by the Feedback Groups at the Annual Conference

of  Feedback  Groups  are  also routed  to  the  relevant

Ministries   for   their  responses,   which   are   then

communicated to the groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has introduced many new

initiatives  over the years to encourage Singaporeans  to

participate actively in shaping the future of  Singapore.

Some  recent new initiatives include the People's  Forum,

tea  sessions,  web chats, regular straw  polls  and  the

production   of   a   vernacular   language   newsletter.

Significantly,  Sir,  there  has  been  more   pre-policy

consultation.  To address

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>



Mr Chandra Mohan's point, despite having chairpersons who

may  be  affiliated to political parties,  this  has  not

prevented people from coming forward in joining  some  of

the sessions that the Feedback Unit has started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next month, the Unit will launch a one-stop

consultation portal that offers yet another platform  for

Singaporeans  to  contribute their  views  and  ideas  on

national policies and issues online.  It will post on its

website,   consultation  papers   from   Ministries   and

Government  agencies for public comments.  Significantly,

the  portal will also provide information  to the  public

what  to  expect  from  the  consultation  process,  what

consultation  is,  what it involves  and  how  one  could

contribute effectively to the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these initiatives by the Feedback Unit are aimed

at   giving  Singaporeans,  whether  individuals,  people

sector  or  private sector organisations, a multitude  of

channels  to participate in national life and  contribute

in  shaping Singapore's future.  So there is no need  for

us   to   encourage  NGOs  to  participate  in  political

discussions.    We  are more than happy to  accept  their

feedback through the various channels that we have set up

under the Feedback Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging citizens to contribute their views and

ideas  on  national policies and issues  is  one  way  of

fostering   active  citizenry  for  the   betterment   of

Singapore.   MCDS  also  promotes  active  citizenry   by

supporting  and  tapping  the  passion  and  energies  of

Singaporeans  who  want  to  make  a  difference  to  the

community.   The National Volunteer Centre, for  example,

encourages  people from all walks of life to apply  their

skills   and   interest  in  volunteering.   It   matches

interested   individuals   and   groups   to    volunteer

opportunities.  The Centre also gives  a  grant  to  help

start  up  new  and  creative volunteer initiatives.  The

National   Volunteerism   Awards  recognise   outstanding

voluntary efforts every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I could address some of the concerns raised

by Mr Chandra Mohan.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>



have  mentioned earlier that there is no reason why  even

myself,  when I was a chairperson in one of the  Feedback

Unit   discussion   groups,   should   prevent   ordinary

Singaporeans from coming forward.  In fact, I would  like

to  place  on record that when I was there, chairing  the

sessions, most of our sessions were actively attended  by

Singaporeans from all walks of life.  I do not think  the

political  affiliation of the person  is  necessarily  an

impeding factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the basis for its success and whether

it  is  still viable - we are able to attract a lot  more

feedback,  and the People's Forum, for example, attracted

5,000 Singaporeans to come forward and participate in our

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I do not think we need to encourage

NGOs  to engage in political discussions because they  do

not need any encouragement.  I think they know what their

interests  are,  and  where are the  channels  which  are

available, be it through the letters to the Forum page or

through  public discussions that they have held in  their

own  premises to discuss some of these issues.  I do  not

think  this  is  one particular factor that  will  hinder

people from entering politics.  People enter politics for

the  reason that they want to serve the nation and it has

nothing  to do with the fact that previously,  they  were

engaged in any political discussion, whatsoever.  I  will

now ask MOS Chan Soo Sen to reply to the other questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I call Mr Wong first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I have not intended to answer this question by Mr

Chandra Mohan.  But he seemed to have a consistent  theme

in several amendments he filed on the various Ministries'

Heads,  for  example,  getting the people  to  join  this

organisation,   getting   the   people   to   run    that

organisation,  getting  people to  take  charge  of  this

organisation, and even getting the Prime Minister  to  be

rotated  among  the  Cabinet.  I  thought  that  since  I

answered some of these in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>



the   PMO's  Head,  I  should  deal  with  this  question

concerning the PA.  I am also the Deputy Chairman of  PA.

I  manage this on behalf of the Prime Minister.  That  is

why  I feel it is my responsibility to answer this rather

than just leaving it to MOS Chan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PA was set up in 1960 under an Act of

Parliament.  It is an Act of Parliament and not a society

registered  under the Societies Act.   So  it  stands  by

itself with statutory authority.  And, in a provision  in

the  Act,  it  provides that the Prime  Minister  be  the

Chairman  of the People's Association.  Why is the  Prime

Minister   the  Chairman  of  the  People's  Association?

Because  the  PA  is an institution for promoting  racial

harmony,  social cohesion and national unity.   The  PA's

original charter was to set up community centres all over

Singapore  so that residents of all races can intermingle

together   and  build  understanding  and   bonds   among

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, since 1993, when I became Deputy

Chairman  of  the PA, I also brought into PA the  various

grassroots organisations which, at one time, used  to  be

under   the  Prime  Minister's  Office  -  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committee, the Residents' Committee  and  in

the  last  few  years, the Civil Defence  Committee,  the

Boys'  Club, formerly run by the Police, and  the  latest

one is the Constituency Sports Committee.  All these have

been put together under the PA's guidance because we feel

that  the people serving in these various committees  are

volunteers, and they are the people who spend their  time

organising  activities and events  and  in  bringing  the

people   together  so  that  they  can  have   a   better

understanding of one another and to build a social  bond,

as  provided for in the original PA's charter.   That  is

why  the  Prime  Minister is in charge.  That  is  why  a

Minister, appointed by the Prime Minister, is the  Deputy

Chairman.   Because  it is a community  organisation,  it

does  not  necessarily mean that it must be  run  by  the

people in the way Mr Mohan wants.  It means that they are

run  by  the  people who represent the  people.  And,  as

Members of Parliament are elected by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



the  voters to represent the people, just as Mr Low  Thia

Khiang  and Mr Chiam are the people's representatives  in

Hougang  and in Potong Pasir, so we represent the people.

We  do not flinch from it.  Yes, we are busy, our MPs are

busy,  but we will make time for what is necessary to  be

of service to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA is not an organisation made up of only

Government  officers.   The PA has  about  100  corporate

members,   ranging   from   social,   sports,   cultural,

educational clubs, cadet groups, and so on.  Four members

from  among  them  are elected onto the  PA  Board  on  a

regular basis and, therefore, they are represented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA management is like any Government department.

They are made up of people who are appointed on their own

merit.   We  do  not have specific quotas set  aside  for

people  of particular races.  To do so is totally against

meritocracy,   the  principle  which   we   practise   in

Government.  But at various levels of PA, we  have  staff

who are of different ethnic groups, as you can see in our

community centres and various other secretariats  in  the

constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make this point very clear to Mr Chandra

Mohan.   His  idea seems refreshing, but I do  not  think

that,  at  the end of it, anybody has any idea  who  will

make  the organisation work.  So let us be practical,  be

realistic,  and  do  what  is  necessary  to   make   the

institution work for the benefit of Singaporeans.  I will

leave the rest of the answers to Mr Chan Soo Sen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I will address Mr Chandra

Mohan's  point  about multi-racial participation  in  the

People's Association's activities.  In fact, that is what

PA  is  all  about.   Among PA's  objectives  are  racial

harmony, social cohesion and, of course, the link between

Government  and  the  people.  And, therefore,  promoting

multi-racial activities has been a very key  priority  of

the  People's  Association. Over the years, the  People's

Association has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



introduced many initiatives to draw more people from  all

ethnic groups to join the activities, as well as to serve

as  grassroots leaders. There are far too  many  of  such

examples.  I do not think I want to waste the time of the

House  by  elaborating  them.  I will  probably  send  Mr

Chandra Mohan a copy of the PA's Annual Report and, if he

needs to, I can go through some of these activities  with

him.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to highlight just a few. Firstly, the

Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs). After the  IRCCs

have  been set up, it has so far organised 200 activities

to  promote inter-racial understanding. There is  also  a

programme  called Ethnic Bonding Homestay Programme.   It

was  introduced in school by North East CDC to  celebrate

Racial  Harmony Day 2001.  Under this programme, families

adopt  a child of a different race for a weekend, and  we

have a plan to expand this programme.  There are also the

Malay   Activities   Executive   Committee   and   Indian

Activities   Executive  Committee   in   our   grassroots

organisations.    They   promote   the   various   ethnic

activities so as to promote better understanding  between

these groups as well as other ethnic groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as an added incentive to encourage greater

minority   participation,  PA  gives  bonus   points   to

community  clubs, like CCs, as well as  RCs,  which  have

attained  a  high level of multi-racial participation  in

their programmes and activities.  Every year, we rank our

CCs  and  RCs,  and the ranking points give weightage  to

more multi-racial participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now address Mdm Ho Geok Choo's point

about  CDC.   She raised three points.  First,  she  said

that  because of the enlarged scope of activities,  which

are all very labour-intensive, do we have enough staff in

the  CDCs  to  handle these tasks.  The  answer  is  yes,

because  when a new function is given to the CDC it  must

come   with  the  resources  needed  to  implement  these

functions.  This has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



been the understanding that the People's Association  has

with  the various Ministries.  So, if they hand over  the

job,  they will have to also hand over the money as  well

as the head-counts.  From that point of view, whenever we

undertake a task, we will have the resources to implement

it.   And,  very importantly, in the CDCs, the volunteers

play  a very important role, and they do play a big  role

in  helping out in implementing these activities.  It  is

through the participation of active citizens that we are,

to put it this way, never alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo also suggested having annual

reports  for  the  CDCs because she said  that  not  many

people  know  what the Mayors are doing.  I do  not  know

what form of annual report she is thinking of.  If she is

thinking about printing a proper annual report, like  the

Town Council's annual report, it will cost about $20,000-$30,000  to print a few hundred copies.  We feel that  it

is  not necessary.  But there are a few ways that we  can

do  to  highlight more of these activities.  One  way  is

that  the various CDCs do have their newsletters.   Maybe

they   can   consider,   in  one  of   the   newsletters,

highlighting their annual activities.  So it becomes some

kind  of an annual report.  The other possibility is  for

the  People's  Association's Annual Report to  give  more

pages  to  CDCs,  so that each CDC will  have  individual

chapters  and  sections devoted to  them.   The  People's

Association would definitely look into this.  All  of  us

agree  that we should give CDC activities as well as  the

Mayor's role more publicity, so that our residents  would

know what they are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on surpluses and whether the CDCs have been

giving financial assistance to the residents, I would say

that  the CDCs have actually done much towards this  end.

Since  2001,  we have taken on more local  and  community

functions from the user Ministries.  That includes Public

Assistance,  Rent  Utilities  Assistance  Schemes,  Small

Family Improvement Scheme, and so on.  In year 2002, CDCs

have  disbursed close to $21 million to help 24,000 needy

Singaporeans  of  various  categories.   CDCs  are   also

responsible for developing and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



funding   childcare,  student  care  and  family  service

centres.    All   of  these  contribute  towards   social

development  and,  in some ways, help  towards  the  more

needy  families.  We spent about $8 million  in  2002  to

develop and maintain 74 such community facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But CDCs also operate on the philosophy that we do

not  just  give a fish.  We want to teach people  how  to

fish  and  the  best welfare is to help them  find  work.

Since  December  2001,  the CDCs  have  worked  with  the

Ministry  of  Manpower to provide job matching  services.

So   far,   they  have  done  it  for  32,000  retrenched

Singaporeans.  We have organised 14 community  job  fairs

as  well  as arranged 53 local job orientation  workshops

and  visits  to  various industries, such as  wafer  fab,

hospitality,   marine   and  transport   industries,   to

facilitate  retrenched workers to try to  work  in  these

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2002, we had also worked with the Ministry

of Manpower to pilot the Train-and-Place Programme.  This

programme offers training and employment opportunities in

informal sectors where there is demand for manpower.  The

CDCs have started the programme in areas such as domestic

cleaning, eldercare, childcare, confinement nannies,  spa

and beauty care, netball coaching, logistics, cooking and

catering,  as  well as horticulture and gardening.   This

programme  is  helpful for those older and  lower-skilled

retrenched Singaporeans.  The CDCs have trained about 600

persons and about 40% of them have found jobs.  About  $2

million has been spent to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would want to say that the CDCs have been doing

their part in helping the less well-off Singaporeans  and

the retrenched Singaporeans.  Certainly, we will do more,

but  the  CDC is also a people-sector community  oriented

organisation.   The various Mayors who  are  seated  over

there  have, through their channels, reached out  to  the

community, assessed their needs and attracted  new  ideas

and  volunteers  to  get  the  programme  started.   This

process will continue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want the Minister to

explain something about the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>



PA  which  I do not understand.  The PA's purpose  is  to

promote racial harmony and social cohesion.  One thing  I

do  not  understand is that Opposition  Members  who  are

elected by the majority of the constituents are kept  out

of  organisations or sub-organisations of  the  PA,  like

CCCs, RCs, CDCs, Boys' Club, including the CC itself.  So

how  can  you  promote social cohesion when  the  elected

Members are kept out of these organisations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, I am sorry I cannot allow

that  clarification.  Mr Wong, you  want  to  answer  the

question?  All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is important to answer this

question  because we have many new Members in this  House

and  they are not familiar with the answers which I  have

given   Mr  Chiam  in  the  past.   PA  is  a  Government

organisation.   It  is  a  statutory  board  to   promote

Government  policies which also include promoting  racial

harmony, social cohesion, bonding, etc.  Therefore, to do

this  particular  job it would have to be representatives

from  the  Government benches.  If Mr Chiam  were  to  do

that,  we  do not know whether he will be promoting  what

the  Government wants to do because, if he does, he would

not be in the Opposition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have another

clarification, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me hear first and then I will

decide  whether it is a clarification or not.   That  was

not  a clarification just now, Mr Chiam, just because you

said, "you do not understand" does not make it one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not understand what ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. It must be that you do not

understand  what the Minister has said.  If  you  do  not

understand what he said, you can ask for clarification.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is right. Because he said

the purpose is social cohesion and racial harmony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me hear what you have to say

first and I will decide whether it is a clarification  or

not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Opposition has never

been  admitted  to the community centres or  any  of  its

organisations  like  CCCs.  How does  he  know  that  the

Opposition would not support the Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, that would be the first time

I  hear the Opposition supports the Government.  If  that

is the case, then we will just look at the voting records

of  the  Opposition.  I am talking about  voting  records

because  we  will see that sometimes they do not  support

what  we do.  But, back to the question  why Mr Chiam  is

not  allowed  in  the  community centre.   The  community

centre  organises  activities  for  the  people.    Their

advisers are there to help these grassroots organisations

to do their work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Clarification, Sir. When I say

the  "Government",  I mean Singapore and  the  people  of

Singapore.   I do not mean the "Government" as  the  PAP.

Of  course,  we  are always against the  PAP  on  certain

issues because we do not think that those issues are good

for  Singapore.  If we think they are good for Singapore,

we will always support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you for clarifying your own

statements.  Yes, Mr Low, what is it now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, clarification from the

Minister.  When he talks about social cohesion,  I  would

like  to  seek his clarification.  What does he  mean  by

"social  cohesion"?  Does he also mean  cohesion  of  the

people or only cohesion of PAP supporters?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Although the party won 75% of the

votes, it represents all the people, including those  who

did not vote for it.  That is why we say we are the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



Government.  It is also the first time that I  hear  this

new argument from Mr Chiam that the Government is not the

PAP.  Actually, the Government is a PAP Government.  That

is  very  clear.  I do not know how this can  become  the

Opposition being the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is not a SDA government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is not a SDA government, for

sure.  It is a PAP Government, and we have a majority  in

this  House  and  we form the Government.   That  is  the

meaning of "Government".

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before this question of clarification

gets out of hand, let us get back to COS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister and

Minister of State for their responses and I beg leave  to

withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IC 1500.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was an announcement some years ago about

the  freeing  up of school fields for community  use.   I

understand  that a number of school fields  have  already

been  designated for community use.  Could  the  Minister

provide  us  an  update on the scheme, and whether  these

school  fields  will  be  reserved  mainly  for  use   by

organised  football and rugby teams with only  a  limited

period for community use?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, as I have

explained earlier, seven school fields will be  open  for

community  use outside the school curriculum  time.   The

available  slots are limited to mainly the  evenings  and

weekends.  About half of these slots are allocated to the

NSAs, such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>



as the NSA for football and rugby, the S-League clubs and

the  Constituency  Sports Club.  The other  half  of  the

slots  are  open  to  other  organised  groups  such   as

grassroots   organisations  and  private  sports   clubs.

Because of the schools' concern with security, we do  not

open   the   school   fields  to  informal   groups   and

individuals.  Instead, they are encouraged  to  book  the

SSC sports facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition, as I have mentioned earlier, some

of  our  parks  are  also  open to recreational  sporting

activities.  I would therefore like to assure the  Member

that we are, indeed, catering to the right customers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since I spoke in Parliament on the

establishment  of  baby-drops,  many  babies  have   been

reported  to  have  been abandoned in rubbish  dumps  and

other  places.   Also, two abandoned  babies  were  found

dead.   If  nothing  is  done, Sir,  many  more  of  such

unwanted  babies will die.  Sir, the purpose of  my  call

for the establishment of baby-drops is to save lives.   I

do  think  that  the  Government has a responsibility  to

build  baby-drops for those unwanted and abandoned babies

born through no fault of their own.  They deserve to live

and  the  Government must endeavour  in  its  efforts  to

change  the  mindset of the people to  accept  baby-drops

and, at the same time, continue to teach morality and sex

education in schools for the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been told that the Minister has, earlier

on  in  the day, dealt with this issue but, nevertheless,

although he does not agree with the establishment of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>



official  baby-drops, I would ask him, for  the  sake  of

saving  the lives of abandoned babies, whether or not  he

will  allow unofficial baby-drops in places like premises

of charitable organisations, churches and other places of

worship,  private hospitals and other suitable designated

places,  and these places be made known to the public  so

that  mothers with unwanted babies could put their babies

there  and,  more importantly, these mothers suffer  from

shame.  I think they also fear prosecution for abandoning

their  babies.   I  wonder  whether  the  Minister  could

consider  a  kind  of compromise and not prosecute  these

mothers   when   they  leave  their   babies   in   these

depositories specially designated for unwanted babies and

treat them not as abandoning babies, but babies left  for

adoption.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Yaacob, do you want to give the

same answer that you gave this morning?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, let me just

summarise  the answer.  We have discussed  the  issue  of

baby  drops  earlier, and we know that in  the  countries

where  they have tried, it has not really succeeded.  The

more  important point to remember is that if  the  mother

were  to  come forward to the various agencies,  we  will

help her.  It is not an offence and we will not prosecute

her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want to assure the members of the public is

that  the  system that we have in place is adequate.   In

fact,  as mentioned earlier this morning, we are stepping

up publicity in all the Residents' Committees with fliers

to  inform  members of the public that they also  have  a

role  to  play in helping our women folk who are affected

by  this  to walk through the process.  I would  like  to

inform  Mr  Chiam that we are not in favour of having  an

official baby drop.  But if anybody comes forward to  our

homes, I would encourage members of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>



the public to use  the official channels that we  have in

place.   Officials  at the homes such as  Pertapis,  Rose

Villa  and even some of the FSCs, will walk through  with

our  women folk the options that they have, and  we  will

ensure confidentiality of the information that they would

want to volunteer to the social workers.  I would like to

assure  Mr Chiam that the system is already in  place.  I

cited  some  numbers earlier.  Last year, well  over  800

inquiries  were received by all the various  homes  which

are  designed  to  help such mothers.   The  numbers  are

encouraging.   The  experiences in other  countries  have

shown  that  baby-drops, despite being  legal,  have  not

really worked.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification?

Although  the Minister says that much publicity has  been

given,  I just want to know whether more publicity  could

be  given.   Because  we still read in  the  papers  that

babies are dying in rubbish dumps.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I agree with

Mr  Chiam that more publicity can be given.  In fact,  we

have  started  to  do  so,  as I mentioned  earlier  this

morning, to put such fliers in the Residents' Committees.

If  the Member for Potong Pasir is interested, I can give

him  50  or 100 fliers for him to pin up all over  Potong

Pasir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, do you now want to drop your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I thank the Minister for his

answer and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Charles Chong.

You  have  three  cuts  here.  Take  them  all  together,

please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Thank you, Sir. I will take my

three cuts consecutively.  It will be a bit difficult for

me to take all three of them together!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IH 3100.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while going through Head I of the Budget book,

there are a few clarifications I would like to seek  from

the   Minister.   The  running  costs  of  the   People's

Association  programme, as listed  on  page  112  of  the

Budget  book, indicate a large variance  in the estimated

FY  2002  figure  and the revised FY 2002  figures.   The

variance  amounts  to more than $33 million.   Could  the

Minister  tell  us  what was the reason  for  this  large

variance?  And can the People's Association cope  with  a

$4.82 million reduction in its FY 2003 expenditure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on page 113 of the Budget book, I notice that a

sum  of $85,870,000 appears to have been set aside for  a

new  building  at the People's Association  headquarters.

Could the Minister enlighten us on when this new building

will  be  constructed?   And  what  will  happen  to  the

historical  Kallang  Airport  building,  that   currently

houses the People's Association?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the same page of the Budget book, a sum of

$10,357,200 has been allocated for the upgrading  of  the

facilities   at   the   National   Community   Leadership

Institute.   Could the Minister give us details  on  this

expenditure, and will the number of training  places  and

programmes  at  the Institute be substantially  increased

and improved as a result of this $10.3 million provision?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on community centres and

community clubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, community centres served as very

important  focal  points  for  community  activities  and

interaction, especially in the kampongs and in the  rural

areas.   The kampongs and the rural areas are now  mostly

gone  as  a result of redevelopment.  However,  over  the

years,  the  humble community centres have  evolved  into

very  impressive  and  also,  sometimes,  very  expensive

community clubs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



Are  community centres and community clubs still relevant

today,  as  they  were  in  the  past,  to  justify   the

expenditure on them?  There are already many  clubs  that

cater  not  only for the rich and famous, but also  clubs

for   businessmen,  NSmen,  policemen,  civil   servants,

grassroots leaders, union members and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on page 113 of the Budget book, under the

People's Association development expenditure, more than a

$1/4  billion, or precisely $257,720,760, appears to have

been  set aside for community centres and community clubs

under  various headings.  The figures on page 115 of  the

Budget  book indicate that the number of participants  in

activities organised by the 106 CCs in 2000 and 2001  and

<br><br>111&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCs  in 2002 is, on average, declining, from $28,000

per  CC in year 2000 to $26,500 in year 2001, and $25,500

in year 2002.  Could the Minister tell us whether CCs are

still as relevant as they are with the aspirations of our

population today?  And how many more CCs are we  planning

to  build  in  addition to the 111 that we  already  have

today?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third cut is on grassroots leaders. The

People's Association imposed a 65 years age limit on  key

appointment  holders  in  grassroots  organisations  last

year.   More  recently, the number  of  terms  grassroots

leaders  can serve in key positions has been  limited  to

three  terms.   Could  the  Minister  tell  us  how  many

grassroots  leaders have been retired from key  positions

due  to the age limit, and the number of members who have

to  relinquish  their posts within  the  next  12  months

because   of  the  term  limit?   Have  there  been   any

exceptions made to this, and what were the reasons  given

for   these   exceptions?   Has  there  been   difficulty

replacing these leaders with equally competent people who

have proven track records  in community service, and  not

just academic qualifications?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, a pilot scheme allowing residents

to nominate the RC members was started in some precincts.

Sir,  I am delighted to learn that the scheme has been  a

success.  However,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>



the  scheme  may not go far enough to allow residents  to

choose  their representatives.  Would the Minister permit

those  precincts that not only want to nominate but  also

to elect their RC members to do so?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, first and foremost, I would

like   to  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge   the

tremendous  contribution of the  grassroots  leaders  and

other  volunteers.   Many of them are people  movers  and

shakers who have helped shape and stabilise Singapore and

are integral to the shape of Singapore to come.  In fact,

in  the last year or so, as this House has been busy, the

grassroots  leaders have been equally  busy.   They  were

busy  understanding and disseminating  information  about

the  9/11  incident,  the Jemaah Islamiyah  arrests,  the

water  issue  and now even more needs to be done  in  the

weeks  and months to come to ensure that whatever happens

in the Gulf, whatever happens to the Iraq war, there will

be  peace  and harmony, especially religious  and  racial

harmony, in Singapore.  Most of these grassroots  leaders

are  volunteers  and, through sheer altruism,  contribute

their   time  and  energy  for  the  betterment  of   our

community.   Many sacrifice time, effort and even  money.

I  ask  myself what do they reap from it.  Is  it  money?

There is none.  Is it power?  Not necessarily so.  Is  it

prestige?   Well, there are only so many PBMs  and  BBMs.

So, what then could be the greatest gift?  I think it  is

personal growth.  As they help our society to grow,  what

can we do to help them to grow further?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the People's Association is doing a

tremendous  job in helping to recruit new volunteers  and

doing  part  of the training.  It also helps  to  provide

some resources to help grassroots organisations like  RCs

and  the various Cs to start up.  But it can do more  not

only to recruit and train new volunteers but also do more

for the existing volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider a few

suggestions:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To extend the range of courses to include

personal  development and family management, or even  in-depth  courses like fundamentals of public administration

and  so  on, because a lot of our new grassroots  leaders

are  people of quite good calibre.  When they  grow,  and

when  they  can  manage  their family  and  their  career

better, I think they would become even better volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increase funding resources to make it more

generous,  so that cash strapped grassroots organisations

will  not  be  hard pressed to choose between  allocating

resources  for  individual  growth  vis-a-vis   that   of

community needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Organise more international exchange programmes

to   encourage  wider  experience.   In  an  increasingly

complex  world, our grassroots leaders need  to  be  well

placed,   and  they  can  benefit  from  cross   cultural

exchanges of views and opinions with other like fashioned

international organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Grassroots Club. I understand that the

Grassroots  Club  is currently under-utilised.    Perhaps

more  could  be  done to turn it into another  venue  for

courses.   It can do the part of bringing more people  to

the Club.  I think that is good for the Club itself.  And

if  it can also decentralise some of the training centres

and  make  it more accessible to the grassroots,  then  I

think it is a win-win strategy for all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, Mr Charles Chong asked three

questions.  Firstly, the basis for reduction of the  cost

and  whether  after the reduction, there is still  enough

money  to run our programmes.  I would say that the basis

for  reduction  of  the  cost takes  a  bit  to  explain.

Perhaps we can talk about it separately, as I do not have

the details with me here.  The more important question is

whether the reduction would affect our activities.   Part

of  the  answer  was actually given when  I  answered  an

earlier  question.  Although we are doing more,  firstly,

we  are  not  the  only  Government  agency  that  has  a

reduction  in  expenditure.  The budget  situation  being

very tight this year, I think

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>



all  of  us would have to exercise an economy drive.   We

all  have  to  apply our mind to make the dollar  stretch

further.  So the People's Association will be doing that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, we rely on

volunteers to carry out a lot of our activities. When  we

have  new  functions, they will come  together  with  the

resources, the manpower, headcount as well as the  money.

When there is a new function that is to be allocated,  we

will  go  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  additional

funding.   And  when  there is a need,  the  Ministry  of

Finance  is  usually helpful.  I am not saying  that  the

process  is  necessarily easy.  They will scrutinise  our

justification.   But  if there is a need  to  do  certain

projects and there is additional need for money, it  will

be given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the new building. The

building activity in the People's Association is actually

to  replace  some  of  the  old container-type  temporary

buildings  housing many of our subordinate organisations.

If  Members come to the People's Association at the  west

block, they will find many such temporary buildings  and,

currently, there is building activity to build  something

more  permanent. So there is no question of tearing  down

our  facilities at Kallang and rebuild.  That  particular

item is not for that purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the National Community Leadership

Institute (NACLI) is concerned, it is actually related to

Miss  Penny Low's point on whether we are going to  spend

additional money on NACLI and whether there has been  any

increase in the type of courses.  Perhaps I will  address

this point a little later.

Mr Charles Chong also asked whether the community centres

are  still relevant.  Of course, they are still relevant.

We  know that, nowadays, people have more choices.  There

are other places to go to.  But all our community centres

and   community  clubs  are  doing  their  bit  to   make

themselves relevant and to attract the residents to  come

to them.  Despite the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



slight  decline  in  the  number  of  attendance  at  the

community centres, they are still relevant.  We will take

into  consideration the needs when we build the community

clubs  and community centres.  If we find that  there  is

already  a  declining  population or  attendance  at  the

community centre, then that community centre or community

club  may be closed.  So this particular review is  going

on all the time.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the age limit for the

grassroots  leaders, as well as for certain figures.   On

1st  April 2002, the People's Association introduced  the

retirement  age  limit  of  65 only  for  key  grassroots

leaders.   These  are for the Chairmen,  Secretaries  and

Treasurers  of the CCCs and the CCMCs.  On  1st  February

2003,  we implemented a new guideline limiting the tenure

of  RC and Neighbourhood Committee Chairman to only three

consecutive terms, with a total of six years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of these new guidelines really is to

encourage leadership renewal within the CCCs, CCMCs,  RCs

and  MCs,  especially in those key posts  like  Chairman,

Secretary as well as Treasurer.  For these three  members

who  have stepped down, there are other options for them.

They can be committee members and continue to serve.   In

the  case  of  the  Chairman,  for  those  who  are  very

outstanding, they can become honorary patron or immediate

past  Chairman  and  can  continue  to  contribute  their

experience as well as their knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the implementation has been smooth.

Since  1st April 2002, 24 key appointment holders in  the

CCCs and CCMCs have relinquished their posts with the new

guideline.   Another 16 key CCC and CCMC  office  bearers

would  be  due  to  retire  in the  next  12  months,  in

accordance with the age limit.  Also, a total of  111  RC

and two NC Chairmen would be due to step down in the next

12  months when they reach a three-year term.  Some would

be appointed, as I have said, as immediate past Chairmen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



To-date,  seven new RCs have new Chairmen as a result  of

this rule.  Only two appeals have been received so far to

extend  the term and these are under consideration.   So,

generally, the implementation has been smooth.  There are

a  small number of cases of advisors coming to appeal  to

say that this particular person is still very much needed

and  we  will consider, but the number is small.  If  the

justification is there, we would allow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked about the residents'

nomination  scheme.  This scheme is currently piloted  in

<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RCs.   Amongst them, 19 have carried out the exercise

and  the remaining two RCs will complete the exercise  by

August  2003.  To-date, the 19 RCs have received a  total

of 65 nominations, and amongst them, 32 have already been

appointed into the RCs.  We have people coming  from  all

walks  of  life and profession.  I think the results  are

very,  very encouraging.  The scheme is there to actually

supplement  the existing system of appointing  grassroots

leaders.  In other words, it is an additional alternative

to  try  and  encourage  more people  to  come  in.   The

results,  I  must say, have proven that the scheme  is  a

useful additional means of recruiting new RC leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PA is prepared to consider extending the scheme to

the  other  RCs if advisors recommend so.  If Mr  Charles

Chong is interested, we can talk about it later.  By  the

way,  this  is  not an election scheme.  It  is  just  an

additional system to bring in new grassroots leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low talked about the training for the

grassroots  leaders.  Yes, I certainly  agree  with  Miss

Penny  Low about the contribution given by the grassroots

leaders.   When the grassroots leaders join us, the  most

important attribute that they must have is the  heart  to

serve.   If  they  have a heart to serve  and  when  they

actually  start to serve, they would pick up  the  skills

along  the  way.   This has been the  kind  of  so-called

training  that a grassroots leader will receive.   If  we

ask some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



of  our grassroots leaders what they have benefited  from

being a grassroots leader, they would tell you that it is

the  exposure, the opportunity to enlarge the  circle  of

one's contacts, as well as to enrich one's life.  So, the

experience  of participating in a grassroots organisation

is already a very good form of training.  But, of course,

there  are  other training opportunities available.   For

example,  the  National  Community  Leadership  Institute

(NACLI), which Mr Charles Chong mentioned by quoting from

the  Budget  book, organises a very, very broad  list  of

courses.  If he wants, we can provide more details.   But

I will just read out some of the titles ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chan, we have another amendment to

deal with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Okay, Sir. We will share with him

the  details  later.  But take it from me  that  we  have

organised  a  very broad range of courses,  and  we  will

continue  to  extend the range of courses.  And  I  think

that justifies the additional money that we need in order

to fund NACLI.  The advisors can certainly approach NACLI

to  tailor  some  courses for the volunteers  to  go  for

leadership  courses.   I  think  I  have  more  or   less

addressed most of the questions, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I look forward to having a

separate  meeting with the Minister of State  and  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (5), Mr Chong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IM 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister provide the House with the

latest  figures on the number of applicants for  the  CCC

assistance scheme and the number who has been successful?

We were told that the number of applicants is decreasing.

Could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



the   Minister  confirm  that  the  figures  are   indeed

decreasing after the media conference on this subject  by

MOF, and by how much?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Second Minister for Finance had told the

House  that  he  was unaware of the cost in administering

the  CCC assistance scheme as the scheme was administered

by   the   People's  Association.   Could  the   Minister

therefore  tell us how much has been spent, in  terms  of

public funds and manpower cost, in the administration  of

the scheme?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, when Mr Charles Chong asked

a  question  in the House earlier this month, the  Second

Minister  for  Finance told us that the scheme  attracted

something  like  14,000  applications  and,  out  of  the

14,000,  only two were successful, and they were given  a

very princely sum of $177.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know the Second Minister went at great length

to  explain the rationale behind the scheme and, in fact,

he said that it was an opportunity for us to calculate to

the  applicants  to  show specifically  that  the  offset

package  that they get more than pays for the  additional

GST  expenditure, and that he thinks that it also  allows

us  to win the converts to the GST scheme.  Sir, I am not

too  sure  about  this.  All I know is  that  I  had  one

experience trying to explain the scheme to an old man and

to tell him why he could not qualify.  All he did, at the

end,  was  to  look at me and say, "Wah boh kow  ree."  - money not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so concerned with the dollars and cents of

implementing the scheme, but I think the danger  here  is

the  political cost to the Government.  We have given  so

much publicity to the scheme.  A lot of people have come.

Yes,  I  know there are some who just come to  try  their

luck.  But, at the end of the day, I think we have a  lot

of  people  leaving with a sour taste  in  their  mouths.

Since  our  experience in 1994, when we  first  had  this

scheme  -  at that time, we only had 30 applications  and

this  time, we just have two - I am wondering why we want

to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>



such  a  scheme.  Since we have the money, ie, $3 million

allocated, it would be better to have this money given to

the welfare fund of all CCCs.  If we divide $3 million by

84  constituencies, I think each of us would get $35,000.

I  am  sure  that, over the years, MPs and the grassroots

leaders have got the experience to tell the genuine  ones

from the needy ones.  And I think we could do with a  bit

more money to help those who are really deserving in  our

constituencies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, to understand the phenomenon,

we  have got to see the CCC assistance scheme in context.

The  scheme  was there because there was an assurance  by

the  Government that, with the introduction  of  the  GST

plus  all  the rebates and relief, nobody will  lose  out

overall  in  tax terms in the next five  years.   And  in

order to put the money where the mouth is, the Government

has  set  aside $3 million and anybody who feels that  he

has  lost out can come and apply, and the money is  there

and we will give the rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, the scheme was there when GST was first

introduced.   Therefore, when we increased the  GST  this

time,  there  must  be a scheme there to  give  the  same

assurance.   There  is, of course, a  difference  in  the

situation between 1994 and 2002.  In 1994, we were  doing

well economically and there were no such handouts, so  to

speak,  from the Budget.  There was no EDRS.  There  were

no  various  types  of  rebate schemes.   Therefore,  the

people  would  just  apply when they  thought  they  were

eligible.   But,  now,  after  introducing  the   various

schemes  to help the people because our economy is  doing

badly,  when they hear about this, they feel that  it  is

some   kind  of  a  handout.   Therefore,  20,000  people

applied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked whether we use additional

resources.  We did not use additional resources.  Our CCC

staff  and grassroots leaders mobilise themselves to  try

to  explain to the residents who come.  It has  not  been

easy.  But there is no additional public money involved,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>



partly  because we did not expect that type of  response.

Now,  the  number has indeed dwindled.  In the first  two

weeks  of  February, it was 3,500; and in  the  last  two

weeks  of  February it was 1,800.  So I think people  are

beginning to understand what the scheme is all about  and

they are not coming forward to apply anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon says that since we do not need the

$3  million, why not give it to the welfare schemes.  The

current financial procedure does not allow us to  do  so.

The $3 million was set aside for this purpose.  If it  is

not  used,  it has got to be returned to the Ministry  of

Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>4.40 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Infectious Diseases Act provides for the control

and prevention of infectious diseases in Singapore.  This

includes  provisions  to  undertake  investigations   and

institute  control measures, including  vaccinations  and

quarantine, to prevent the spread or the introduction  of

any infectious disease into Singapore.

required  for  the prevention and control  of  infectious

diseases  from  the  Ministry of the Environment  to  the

infectious  disease,  and  to enhance  the  Minister  for

Health's authority to order mandatory vaccinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now highlight the major

amendments that are being introduced in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, environmental health, quarantine and

epidemiology,    which   include    infectious    disease

surveillance  and  the investigation of  outbreaks,  were

carried out by MOH.  When the Ministry was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>



established   in  1972,  it  was  made   in   charge   of

environmental public health, which includes the provision

of  safe water supply, public cleansing, solid waste  and

sewage  disposal, drainage and control of  food  hygiene.

As  the control of many prevalent infectious diseases  in

the  1970s  was closely related to environmental  issues,

the  environmental  health  quarantine  and  epidemiology

functions of MOH were transferred to ENV in 1972.   These

functions  were  taken  over by the National  Environment

Agency (NEA) when it was formed on 1st July 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the surveillance and control of

infectious  diseases  are shared  between  MOH  and  NEA.

Their responsibilities are divided according to the  type

of  disease.  Diseases like typhoid fever and hand,  foot

and  mouth disease come under NEA.  But tuberculosis  and

HIV  AIDS  are  under the purview of  MOH.   The  current

system  works  reasonably well for the  surveillance  and

control of known diseases, for which the division of work

between  MOH  and ENV is well established.   However,  we

need  to  develop new expertise to deal with new  dangers

from communicable diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, almost similar expertise is being

developed  and  deployed in the two  Ministries  for  the

surveillance   and  control  of  diseases   under   their

respective   purview.    This  has   resulted   in   some

duplication of work and efficiency loss.  Nationally, new

expertise has to be developed to tackle emerging diseases

and  new health threats arising from bio-safety and  bio-terrorism concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of continuing with the current path of

developing expertise in the two Ministries, it  would  be

more   efficient   and  cost  effective  to   concentrate

capability  development within one  Ministry.   For  this

reason,   the   medical   related   functions   for   the

investigation,  prevention  and  control  of   infectious

disease outbreaks, which are currently carried out by the

National Environment Agency, will be transferred  to  the

Ministry of Health

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>



with effect from 1st April 2003.  NEA will continue to be

responsible for the environmental determinants of health,

such as environmental sanitation, food hygiene and vector

control.   This  includes  quarantine  and  port  health,

cleanliness  of  public  areas, inspection  of  premises,

control of vectors, environmental sampling, and execution

of   any  environment-related  measures  in  response  to

outbreaks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the transfer of the medical related functions

for   the   investigation,  prevention  and  control   of

infectious  disease  outbreaks  to  MOH,  the   following

amendments are necessary in the Infectious Diseases Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the existing Infectious Diseases Act

empowers the Director-General of Public Health,  NEA,  to

carry out infectious disease outbreak investigations  and

control.  The revised Act will transfer this authority to

the Director of Medical Services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the revised Act also provides for the

transfer   of  authority  from  the  Minister   for   the

Environment to the Minister for Health to declare an area

as  an infected area when there is reason to believe that

an  infectious  disease may be introduced into  Singapore

from the infected area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the authority to regulate the importation

of  disease-causing  organism  will  now  rest  with  the

Director  of Medical Services, while the Director-General

of  Public Health, NEA, will retain his current  role  in

regulating the importation of disease-causing vectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Bill revises the Act to amend the

definition  of health officers to include any person  who

is  appointed  by the Director-General of Public  Health,

NEA,  or  the Director of Medical Services.  This  is  to

cater  to  the  expanded role of MOH  officers  with  the

transfer  of  the medical related functions from  NEA  to

MOH.   Currently,  NEA officers are empowered  under  the

Environmental  Public  Health Act,  Environmental  Public

Health Regulations, Sale of Food Act, and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>



Control  of  Vectors and Pesticides  Act,  to  carry  out

functions  related  to the prevention, investigation  and

control  of  infectious  disease  outbreaks.   This  Bill

revises  the  Infectious Diseases  Act  so  that  similar

provisions  will  be included in the Infectious  Diseases

Act  to enable MOH to better investigate and prevent  the

spread of infectious diseases in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised Infectious Diseases Act will empower MOH

officers  to  enter premises without a  warrant  for  the

purposes  of inspection and search.  They will  be  given

the  authority to take samples or confiscate  any  matter

that  is implicated in an outbreak.  The person from whom

the  matter has been seized will be given the opportunity

to  lodge  a  complaint  within a stipulated  time  to  a

magistrate's  court against the seizure.  The  magistrate

can  then confirm or disallow the seizure, or even  order

that the owner be compensated for the loss resulting from

the seizure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Act will include provisions which

require  persons  to  furnish information  which  may  be

useful  in  the investigations and, for persons suspected

of  being infected with an infectious disease, to  submit

themselves for medical examination and undergo treatment,

where necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if investigations indicate that a public place

is  implicated in an outbreak, the amended Act allows MOH

to  close  or  cordon off that public  place,  so  as  to

prevent  further transmission of the infectious  disease.

However,  this power of closure does not apply when  such

power  has  already  been conferred  by  law  to  another

Government  agency or statutory board.  For instance,  in

the  event of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease

among  young children, it may be necessary to close  down

childcare  centres as a measure to control the  outbreak.

The  authority  to close down such places would  be  with

MCDS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if there is an outbreak of a

highly  contagious infectious disease within the premises

which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>



not licensed by any authority, the provisions in the Bill

will  give  the authority to MOH to close down or  cordon

off  the premises to prevent further transmission of  the

infectious disease.

<br><br><i>New Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight some of the new provisions

that  are  provided for in the Bill.  The  definition  of

infectious diseases in the Act will be revised  since the

current   Infectious  Diseases  Act  defines  "infectious

diseases"  as  diseases  that are  listed  in  the  First

Schedule  of the Act.  This means that under the existing

Infectious Diseases Act, the provisions of the Act cannot

be  applied  unless the implicated infectious disease  is

already listed under the First Schedule.  This change  is

particularly important in the modern age of rapid travel,

where   new   infectious   diseases,   eg,   West    Nile

Encephalitis,  Avian-Flu,  etc,  can  potentially  spread

rapidly   to   other   countries.   The   definition   of

"infectious  diseases"  in the Act  will,  therefore,  be

revised to encompass all infectious diseases, rather than

be limited to those listed in the First Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new provision introduced in the Bill will

enhance  the  Minister for Health's  authority  to  order

mandatory vaccination.  The existing Infectious  Diseases

Act  empowers  the  Minister for Health  to  require  any

person,  who  is not protected or vaccinated  against  an

infectious  disease, to be vaccinated,  if  there  is  an

outbreak  of  the disease in Singapore.  If there  is  an

outbreak overseas, the existing provision will not apply,

even  though  vaccination  may be  judged  necessary  for

public  health  reasons  to prevent  the  spread  of  the

outbreak  to  Singapore.  The Bill therefore revises  the

Act  to  allow the Minister for Health to order mandatory

vaccination, even when there is no outbreak in  Singapore

when  this  is  necessary to prevent the  spread  of  the

disease here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes it an offence for persons with

infectious  diseases  and who are likely  to  spread  the

disease  to  default  on  their medical  examination  and

treatment when they are required to do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>



so  by  the Director of Medical Services.  It also  gives

MOH officers powers to arrest such defaulters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1972, the control and prevention of infectious

diseases  in  Singapore has been a shared  responsibility

between  MOH  and ENV/NEA.  Now, with the rationalisation

of  public  health  functions and  the  transfer  of  all

medical-related public health functions from  NEA/ENV  to

MOH,   MOH   will   take  charge  of  the   surveillance,

monitoring,  outbreak investigations and control  of  all

infectious diseases.  MOH will assume lead responsibility

in the event of any infectious disease outbreak.  NEA/ENV

will  continue  to  be responsible for the  environmental

determinants of health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the

Infectious  Diseases Act, as outlined in the  Bill,  will

enable  my  Ministry to effectively carry out the  public

health  functions which are being transferred by  NEA/ENV

to  MOH.   The  amendments will also help to enhance  our

responsiveness  so as to enable effective prevention  and

timely  control  of all infectious disease  outbreaks  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand

to   speak   in   support  of  the  Infectious   Diseases

(Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in this Bill that enables the for the

prevention and control of all communicable diseases, such

as  prevention  and control of outbreaks,  notifications,

surveillance   and  investigations,  from  the   National

Environment Agency (NEA) to Ministry of Health  (MOH)  is

appropriate, and I welcome it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health is most suited to assume

this  responsibility of prevention  and  control  of  all

communicable  diseases. The Ministry of Health  is  in  a

better position to understand the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>



different types of communicable diseases and is  able  to

monitor  the  diseases better because those affected  are

usually  under  its care.  Furthermore, the  Ministry  of

Health  has the support of personnel and laboratories  to

better  investigate any diseases, is in a better position

to  inform and notify diseases more effectively,  and  is

able  to  involve  all the doctors in  Singapore  in  the

surveillance of any outbreak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is relevant indeed in view of the new

infectious   disease  named  Severe   Acute   Respiratory

Syndrome  (SARS)  that is threatening us  presently.  The

amendment  in new section 2(c) of this Bill enlarges  the

definition  of  "infectious disease" to  include  certain

diseases not specified in the First Schedule, but if left

uninvestigated or unchecked, would result in an  epidemic

of that disease. SARS definitely falls into this ambit as

it is not listed in the First Schedule, although it is  a

highly  contagious and dangerous disease.   Bio-terrorism

is  also the concern of the day.  A good example would be

the recent Anthrax scare. Anthrax is another example of a

highly  dangerous infectious disease that is not  in  the

First Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only 10 days ago, on 12th March, the World

Health  Organisation  issued a  global  alert  about  the

outbreak of SARS.  As of today, there are 34 Singaporeans

with SARS.  Other than the initial three cases, there are

an  additional  31  patients who  had  been  admitted  to

hospital. All these have been in close contact  with  the

patients  of SARS.  My question to the Minister of  State

is  which  Ministry is taking on the responsibilities  of

the  urgent situation of SARS now, since the transfer  of

responsibility  from  NEA  to  MOH  is  scheduled  to  be

effective  only  from 1st April.  We  need  to  have  one

Ministry  taking  the  lead  responsibility  and   seeing

through  the  whole process. Otherwise, this transitional

stage  will be detrimental to our well-being.  Could  the

Minister of State enlighten us on what has been  done  by

the  Ministry of Health and what role had been played  by

the  National  Environment Agency (NEA)  with  regard  to

SARS?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 13 amends section 32 to transfer the

responsibility   for  the  cleansing,  disinfection   and

treatment  of  infected  vessels, vehicles  and  personal

effects to the Director and Health Officers authorised by

the  Director.  May I ask the Minister of State  how  the

Ministry  of  Health  is  preparing  to  take  over  this

responsibility as this will be completely  new  for  MOH?

Are there personnel that can assume this role in MOH?  Is

MOH setting up a new department to take over this role?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 20 of this Bill empowers the Minister to

order  mandatory vaccination of persons in certain cases.

May  I seek the assurance from the Minister of State that

this  order will not be taken lightly until it is  proven

to be absolutely necessary?  This is due to the fact that

vaccines  are  not without side-effects  themselves.   At

times,  they  can do more harm than good in some  people.

Moreover,  we  may  not be aware of the  long-term  side-effects  of  certain vaccines.  Even  if  this  order  is

implemented,  we  have to be mindful that  it  is  not  a

blanket  order without exception, as it may kill  people,

such  as  the frail-elderly, the infants and  those  with

immune deficiencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 29 of the Infectious Diseases Act seems

to  empower the Director-General or Port Health Office to

obtain information to ascertain the health of the persons

on  board.   But  there is no provision  for  the  "Entry

Declaration" for travellers coming into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was reported in the Straits Times today by

Salma  Kahlik  that  the  three  Singaporean  women,  who

brought  SARS here, had been traced to a Hongkong  hotel.

They were all staying on the same floor as the doctor who

has  since  died.   In view of this current  outbreak  of

SARS,  and  the  fact that SARS is highly contagious  and

potentially deadly, should we not make sure that there is

provision  in  this  Bill  to provide  implementation  of

urgent measure on the containment of this illness?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be prudent that we take steps to ensure

that travellers do not enter

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  without declaring that they are free  of  such

disease  and/or  not  in  contact  with  person  who  had

contracted such disease.  May I ask therefore whether  we

can   implement  a  clause  of  "Entry  Declaration"  for

travellers by way of subsidiary legislation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister of State can address

my concerns.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, first let me explain a

little  bit about the role of MOH and NEA with regard  to

managing and preventing disease outbreaks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA has capabilities in dealing with the environment

and  how we can change things in the environment that can

cause  disease. MOH has the expertise in treating  people

who are sick and diagnosing illness in sick people.  Both

NEA  and  MOH have always worked together and  they  will

continue to work together.  What has happened in the last

30 years is that our concerns have shifted.  In the past,

our  concern  was  more  primary focus  on  outbreaks  of

diseases like malaria, dengue and food poisoning.  In the

future,  our concerns will be more on infectious diseases

like SARS as well as bio-terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these new types of diseases that we are

concerned  about will be first handled and  seen  by  MOH

rather than ENV, the department has been shifted from ENV

to  MOH.  However, even with the shift, MOH and ENV  will

have to work together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current outbreak, there is a task force

monitoring  the  management  of  this  outbreak.   It  is

chaired by DMS, and it includes NEA officers, as well  as

all  other relevant people involved. They meet every  day

and  they  make decisions so that there is a  coordinated

response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to her second concern, which is on

vaccination, it will require some extraordinary events in

countries  outside  Singapore  before  we  will  consider

ordering vaccination of Singaporeans to protect ourselves

from such an infection.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo wanted to know what measures we have

taken  with  regard to SARS and how we  can  prevent  the

disease from coming into Singapore.  Let me give a  brief

history of how the disease came to Singapore. Dr  Neo  is

correct.  A professor of medicine from Guangzhou fell ill

while  in Hongkong.  He stayed at a hotel in Hongkong  on

21st  and 22nd February.  He had previously been treating

pneumonia cases in Guangzhou.  He infected seven  persons

at the hotel, including the three Singaporeans. The three

Singaporeans returned on 25th February 2003 and they were

well  at that time.  Between 1st and 3rd March, they fell

ill  and they were admitted to our hospitals as cases  of

pneumonia.   On  6th  March, WHO  issued  an  alert  that

healthcare workers in Hanoi, who had treated an  American

who  had come from Hong Kong, were falling ill.  When WHO

issued  this alert, MOH instructed hospitals  to  isolate

the  three  patients and to implement stringent isolation

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 14th March and 21st March, which is today,

36  patients have been admitted with SARS.  Half of  them

are healthcare workers, half are family friends and close

contacts.   Infections in all the cases have been  traced

to  contact with the first three cases when they were not

isolated.   So  far, we have no case of  a  person  being

infected after the first three patients were isolated, or

of  any  infections  coming  from  contact  with  the  36

patients  who  have now been admitted and isolated.   So,

having legislation to prevent people coming in or through

declarations is not necessarily an effective  measure  to

prevent the disease from coming into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps taken by MOH to control the infection are

the  following:  We want to identify all suspected  cases

early.   So MOH has informed the public on what  symptoms

to  look  out for.  All hospitals and doctors  have  been

notified  on  the  evaluation of  these  cases  and  what

measures  to  take.  The disease has  also  been  made  a

notifiable disease under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>



the  Infectious Diseases Act.  All patients admitted  are

in  strict  isolation.   There have  also  been  measures

implemented  in  emergency rooms so  that  triage  nurses

would  know  how  to  deal  with  suspected  cases.   NEA

officers have been doing contact tracing.  They call  all

contacts  daily  and  check  on  their  status.    Health

advisories   have  been  issued  to  airlines   on   what

precautions  they  should take  to  prevent  sick  people

boarding their planes so that these sick people will  not

enter  Singapore.  Health advisories would also be issued

to  parents,  schools, pre-schools and childcare  centres

and, directly, parents will be told to look out for fever

in  their  children, if they have recently  travelled  to

areas  where this disease has been known to  occur.   The

task  force  looking after the disease  meets  daily  and

issues  press  alerts  and updates  the  public  on  what

happens.  The information is also on the MOH website  and

there is a hotline that the public can call.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this outbreak is quite serious. We still have

37  patients in the hospital, five of whom are critically

ill.   We  are  not  out of the woods, but  the  outbreak

appears to be under control.  We can be sure only in  one

or  two weeks' time.  We are working closely with WHO and

CDC to try to control this outbreak.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I just want to seek clarification,

Sir.   Should  we  think that we need to implement  self-declaration by travellers later on, can we implement  the

clause  of  the  entry declaration by way  of  subsidiary

legislation?   Could  I also ask whether  our  public  is

getting  sufficient  advice and guidance  presently  with

regard to SARS?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I think the public has been

given  all  the necessary advice and we will continue  to

update  the  public if there is any further  advice  that

they need to know.  With regard to whether it can be done

by way of subsidiary legislation, we will ask our experts

to look into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister for Finance, I beg to move, "That the  Bill

be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the International Enterprise

Singapore Board Act, or IES Board Act in short, to effect

the formation of Singapore Customs on 1st April 2003.   I

shall now elaborate on the amendments in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Customs will be a department under the

Ministry of Finance.  It will be a merger of:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the revenue enforcement and trade documentation

branches of the Customs and Excise Department; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Trade Facilitation Division and Statistical

Audit Unit, of the IES Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the role of Singapore Customs will be revenue

collection   and  enforcement,  and  trade  facilitation,

including  trade  enforcement measures  related  to  free

trade agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill inserts a new Part V-A into the

IES  Board  Act to transfer some of the undertakings  and

employees  of IES to Singapore Customs.  The undertakings

include  all  property  used  or  managed  by  the  Trade

Facilitation Division and the Statistical Audit Unit,  as

well  as all assets and obligations of the Board relating

to these departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the employees will be on terms no

less  favourable than those enjoyed by them prior to  the

transfer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends other Acts to effect the

transfer  of relevant responsibilities from IE  Singapore

to Singapore Customs.  These Acts are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Statistics Act; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Strategic Goods (Control) Act.;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the Customs Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to change the basis of valuation for goods

levied with ad valorem excise duties;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to allow the Minister to be able to grant

remission  of  duties,  taxes,  fees  or  other   charges

payable;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to empower the Director-General of Customs in

certain operational matters;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to remove provisions that are operational and

administrative in nature from the Customs Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to streamline and clarify provisions in the

Customs Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) to remove provisions that are obsolete due to

changes in policies and operational procedures; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) to make consequential changes as a result of

the formation of Singapore Customs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now elaborate on the main amendments in the

Bill.

<br><br><i>Change in Basis of Valuation for Motor Vehicles</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the basis of valuation used for the

purpose of determining the excise duty for motor vehicles

is  the  Brussels Definition of Value.  Clause 8  of  the

Bill  amends section 22 of the Customs Act to change  the

basis of valuation to the Customs Valuation Code, or CVC.

The CVC is an internationally adopted basis of valuation,

increasingly used by many countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new basis will exclude obligatory expenses such

as   advertising,  promotion,  warranties,  showroom  and

warehousing  costs.  This move will  result  in  a  lower

value for most motor vehicles, and hence lower the excise

duties  and  Additional Registration  Fees  collected  on

<br><br><i>Allowing Minister to Grant Remission</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Minister can only grant exemption and

refund  of duties, taxes, fees and other charges paid  or

payable by a person.  Clause 6 of the Bill amends section

13  to  allow  the Minister to be able to  also  grant  a

remission  of  duties,  taxes,  fees  or  other   charges

payable.   A  similar provision is also  found  in  other

pieces  of  tax legislation, for example, the Income  Tax

Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act.

<br><br><i>Empowerment of Director-General of Customs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the Act to empower the Director-General of Customs in several operational matters so as

to  give  Singapore Customs more operational flexibility.

This will in turn improve administrative efficiency.  For

example, clause 5 of the Bill inserts a new section

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>



11, which allows the Director-General of Customs to waive

the  payment, or recovery of payment, of any  duty,  tax,

fee  or  other charge, where the amount does  not  exceed

$20.

<br><br><i>Removal  of Operational/Administrative Requirements  from

Customs Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill streamlines the Act by removing provisions

that  are operational and administrative in nature. These

provisions   will  instead  be  part  of  the  subsidiary

legislation  relating  to  the  Customs  Act,   so   that

operational  and  administrative  rules  can  be  changed

quickly  in  line with the rapidly changing  environment.

For  example, clause 9 of the Bill amends section  34  of

the Act, which specifies the types and amount of dutiable

goods  that  travellers can bring into Singapore  without

permits.   By  not specifying such detailed  quantitative

limits  in  the Act itself, adjustments can be made  more

quickly when necessary.

<br><br><i>Streamlining and Clarification of Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Act will be amended to streamline some

provisions and to clarify several other provisions.   For

example, clause 16 of the Bill amends section 93  of  the

Act  to  clearly describe the situations where travellers

are required to declare the goods at the checkpoints.

<br><br><i>Removal of Obsolete Sections</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends the Act to remove sections that are

obsolete  due  to  changes  in policies  and  operational

procedures.   One  example  of  an  obsolete  section  is

section  35 which requires hard-copy permits not used  to

be  returned to CED within 24 hours or as soon  as  CED's

office  is  open.   Clause 10 of the  Bill  repeals  this

section since hard-copy permits are no longer used today.

Permits  are declared and approved electronically.   They

will be automatically invalidated upon expiry.

<br><br><i>Formation of Singapore Customs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 24 of the Bill will give legislative

effect to consequential changes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>



to sections 3(1), 98 and 138 of the Customs Act needed as

a  result  of the formation of Singapore Customs  on  1st

April 2003.  Clause 26 of the Bill amends other pieces of

legislation, like the Income Tax Act and the  Immigration

Act,  which  are needed as a result of the  formation  of

Singapore Customs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, on behalf of Members, I would like to thank

you  for  chairing the Committee of Supply and  also  the

Budget  debate  during the last 11 days.   We  have  also

extended  our sitting hours, starting from 11.00  am,  so

that   we  can  start  earlier  to  deal  with  the   707

amendments, a record, that were moved in the Committee of

Supply.   Of these, about 9% was taken up by one  Member.

As  a  result  of  this,  you have strictly  applied  the

guillotine.  I think some Members felt that they did  not

get  the  full  answers or did not have  enough  time  to

expand on their points.  Maybe I can dispense this  piece

of  advice, ie, please do not wait until the Committee of

Supply to ask all these questions.  Make full use of  the

Question Time and during the Committee of Supply to  make

as  many  points  as  they want, but in  a  succinct  and

precise  manner  to  get information  that  they  do  not

normally get at other times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members also do not have time to raise questions

despite one-and-a-half hours of Question Time, as we have

many  Questions  and therefore not all Questions  can  be

answered  on  the same day, please feel free  to  move  a

motion.  Members have all the time to make their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>



points  during the debate on the motion.  If  they  think

that one hour is too long for the motion, maybe they  can

move  a motion of adjournment.  I am sure some of us will

stay behind to listen to them!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid the need to be guillotined, please bear

that  in  mind.  Make full use of Question Time,  motions

and  adjournment motions, or even at other times, to  ask

questions, not necessarily in this House.  But if Members

want to have an answer and they want to make a statement,

by  all means, they can also make their statement to  the

press without having to come to this Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be

fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, we live in difficult

times.   The economy is glum.  The war has broken out  in

Iraq.   But from my vantage position here, I could  sense

the gloom and anxiety in hon. Members' speeches about the

state  of  the  world  and how we  are  affected  by  our

regional  and  global economic and political  conditions.

But  amidst  the gloom and doom, I also sense  a  resolve

among  hon. Members, a gritting of the teeth, as it were,

in   not  wanting  to  allow  the  challenges  facing  us

overwhelm our spirit and kill our aspirations and  hopes.

We talked about a "wow" city, London of the East, changes

in  mindset.  Mr  Lim Swee Say even had time  to  hold  a

conversation with Mr NEWater!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a gruelling session over the past two

weeks.  Most Members have done well in this debate,  both

in  content and in the earnestness of their speeches.   I

would  like  to  congratulate them.  I  especially  thank

those Members who gave their cooperation by keeping their

speeches  to  within  a reasonable length.   I  apologise

profusely to those Members whose speeches I have  had  to

guillotine, although my staff tell me that there  is,  in

fact,  a  lower  proportion of such speeches  this  year.

This  is of some comfort to me, hon. Members, for  now  I

can  go back to being my soft-spoken, gentle and likeable

self again!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, being an eternal optimist and an incorrigible

believer in  the power of life-long learning, I  hope  to

hear  fewer long speeches next year or, preferably,  none

at  all.   I   therefore look forward to an  even  better

Budget debate in 2004.  If I may borrow a phrase from  Mr

Khaw Boon Wan, "For us, good is not good enough."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me end by thanking my Deputy Speakers, the

Leader of the House and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>



the  Whip,  and their deputies, and the Parliament  staff

for their assistance and guidance.  Until the next Budget

sitting, good day and thank you.  [Applause].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be
