<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TRUST FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assessment rate)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether the assessment rate of 23 per cent

extended  to  Housing and Development Board  flat-owners applies also to the owners of pre-war flats

built  by the former Singapore Improvement  Trust,

and,  if not, whether consideration will be  given

to the extension of this concession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



Sir, the 23 per cent assessment rate

will apply only to those flats sold by the Housing

and  Development  Board under the  Home  Ownership

Scheme.  The concessionary rate will not apply  to

pre-war flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for fixing a concessionary rate of

assessment  for  flats purchased  under  the  Home

Ownership   Scheme   is  that   the   scheme   was

established to assist the lower income  groups  to

purchase  homes  for  their  own  occupation,  and

certain  restrictions on assignment,  sub-letting,

renting,  etc., are imposed in  respect  of  such

flats. The pre-war flats were sold under different

conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



They  were straightforward sales at market  values

without  due  regard to the income levels  of  the

purchasers,  and no restrictions were  imposed  in

respect   of  sale  and  sub-letting.  There   is,

therefore,  no  reason to extend the concessionary

rate  to such flats, and it is not intended to  do

so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>OWNER-OCCUPIED PROPERTIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Revision in valuation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Finance what is the basis for a rise of as much as

250  per  cent over the old annual value with  the

recent revaluation of owner-occupied property; and

if  he  will  give  an assurance that  concessions

given  by him to those affected house-owners  will

not be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent revaluation exercise

covered  about 7,000 owner-occupied properties  in

addition to other properties whose values had  not

been revised for years.



The  revised values reflect current rental  values

for similar properties, the annual values of owner-occupied properties range between 25 per cent  and

75 per cent of the true annual values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Property Tax Division collates and analyses

information  on rentals and values to  derive  the

rental an unfurnished property would obtain on the

market  if rented. While for a majority of  owner-occupied  properties the annual values  have  been

revised by 100 per cent to 150 per cent, there are

instances  where  the  annual  values  have   been

revised  by 250 per cent. In such cases,  it  only

goes to show the magnitude of under-assessment  of

annual  values  through failure to  revise  values

over the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Monetary Fund Team which

studied  our  taxation and revenue machinery  last

year  has  commented  that  property  tax  is  the

weakest  component of Singapore's  tax  structure

and  a  complete reorganisation of the  department

with additional staff is now taking place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is obvious that the status quo cannot

be  maintained for long, every consideration  will

be given to grant relief to owner-occupiers. For a

start,  it  is proposed to bring relief to  owner-occupiers  by  increasing the  exempt  net  annual

value  from  $3,000  to  $6,000  for  income   tax

purposes. This will ensure that a taxpayer  living

in  his  own house does not have to pay additional

income tax, except for those who live in luxurious

splendour  in  residences whose net  annual  value

exceeds   $6,000  per  annum.  A  Bill   will   be

introduced  in Parliament to amend the income  Tax

Ordinance for increasing the exemption limit  from

$3,000 to $6,000 of the net annual value of owner-occupied houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the revision in annual values will not

result  in  any additional property tax  liability

for owner-occupiers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has

not  answered  the second part of my  question.  I

would  like  him  to  assure the  House  that  the

concessionary  rate will not be withdrawn  by  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I have said that the

concessions  will  continue for  as  long  as  the

economic  situation warrants it. That is  all  the

assurance I can give to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy on taxation was given to

this  House  by  my  Minister  during  his  Budget

Statement  on the 9th March, 1970.  I  can  do  no

better  than to quote him. In column  50l  of  the

Hansard, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government's policy in recent years has been

to  depend on fast economic expansion and improved

tax  administration to provide  increased  revenue

rather  than  raise  rates of taxation  to  higher

levels or introduce new taxes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore in the interest of everyone in

this country, not less the property owners, to see

that  there is no let-up in the economic  progress

of our country.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE STOCK EXCHANGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Publication of Ferris Report)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Finance (a) whether he will publish the report  by

Mr  George  M.  Ferris Jr, of  the  International

Executive  Service  Corps  on  his  study  of  the

securities  market in Singapore; (b)  whether  and

what  useful  recommendations aimed  at  providing

greater  protection  for  the  public  have   been

accepted  by  his  Ministry;  and  (c)  when   the

recommendations will be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, the report of Mr George M. Ferris Jr, will

be  published  in  about  ten  days'  time,  after

discussions  which have been going  on  with  Bank

Negara  Malaysia have been concluded.  Mr  Ferris

arrived  in  Singapore on 20th October,  1969,  in

response to an application by my Ministry  for  an

expert   on   Stock  Exchange  problems   to   the

International  Executive  Service  Corps  on  13th

June, 1969. He reported on 11th November, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As will be apparent when the report is published,

Mr  Ferris  has made a penetrating study  of  the

Stock  Exchange in Singapore and Malaysia, despite

the shortness of his stay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a large number of recommendations and

has  undoubtedly uncovered the weakness of trading

practices  in  the  local  stock  exchange.  As  a

measure  designed  to dampen speculation,  he  has

recommended the imposition of margins and a higher

rate  of commission on delayed dealings. In  order

to  strengthen the financial position of brokerage

firms,  he  has  recommended the incorporation  of

partnerships as companies and the institution of a

system  of  surprise audits by a special  pool  of

auditors approved by the Exchange and agreed to by

the Government, as well as regular inspections  by

a  trained  inspectorate employed by the Exchange.

The  report  contains  recommendations  aimed   at

improving  the educational standard and  technical

competence  of brokers, remisers and dealers.  The

Ferris Report also proposes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



various   measures   aimed  at  disciplining   the

directors  of  listed companies and  reducing  the

advantage  that  "insiders" might  have  over  the

investing public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have distributed copies of the report to the

Stock  Exchange  Committee and have  held  several

discussions  both with the Committee  as  well  as

members of the larger brokerage firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While discussions were in progress, trouble broke

out in the Stock Exchange over Federal Paper. This

was  the  result  of weaknesses which  the  Ferris

Report had pin-pointed, in particular the practice

of  allowing delayed transactions to be  conducted

without requiring a cash deposit to cover  a  part

of the value of contracts. This practice, known as

"free-riding", undoubtedly contributed to the ease

with  which speculative attacks can be mounted  in

the Exchange. Mr Ferris recommended the abolition

of  free-riding, but members of the Exchange  with

whom  I discussed this subject were then reluctant

to agree to this particular recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of the Ferris Report in regard to

Stock  Exchange  reforms was  to  give  the  Stock

Exchange the option to improve its performance  as

a  self-regulating  body, as is  the  practice  in

several  countries, and only fall hack  on  direct

Government  control  through  legislation  if  the

Stock   Exchange   proved  itself   incapable   or

unwilling  to  carry  out  the  necessary  reforms

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that direct Government control is

necessary, my Ministry is carrying out studies  of

legislation in other countries. This  is  a  large

and  complex  matter,  as Members  will  doubtless

agree,  and  it will be some time before  a  final

decision can be made one way or the other.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SERVICE CALL-UP</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Defence if he will consider not to call up all the

children   in  a  family  for  full-time  national

service,  and  if  he  will enlist  the  remaining

children  for  part-time service if the  first  or

second child has already been called up for  full-time service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the implementation of the

enlistment  policy, the fact that in a  particular

family  there may be more than one member eligible

for  enlistment  will not be a  consideration  for

deferment from full-time national service  or  the

enlistment into part-time service of one  or  more

members  of  such  eligible group.  However,  Sir,

application for deferment from full-time  national

service may be made on the grounds of hardship, if

any,  and  if  such application is approved,  then

deferment  from  full-time service  of  the  other

members of the family may be granted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Is the Minister aware of the case where two

younger  members of a family have been conscripted

one  after  the  other? The  elder  one,  who  has

graduated from the Teachers' Training College, has

been  called  up for full-time service.  Will  the

Minister consider cases of this nature?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The applicant may apply for deferment, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Social  Affairs whether it is planned  to  provide

flood-lighting facilities for all games which will

be accommodated in the new National Sports Complex

in   Kallang   Park;  and  whether  flood-lighting

facilities  will  be provided for  sports  grounds

elsewhere  in  the  Republic  to  enable  national

recreation  to  take place in  the  late  evenings

without affecting productivity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, flood-lighting facilities will

be  provided  in  the National Stadium  now  being

built  at  Kallang  Park. Similarly,  the  covered

stadium  which  forms  the  second  phase  of  the

National   Sports  Complex,  together   with   the

swimming  pools and tennis courts, will be  flood-lighted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards flood-lighting for sports grounds

elsewhere in the Republic, Jalan Besar Stadium  is

already provided with flood lights. Three or  four

public  swimming  pools have  also  flood-lighting

facilities.    Installations   of   flood-lighting

involve  capital  and  running  costs.  Therefore,

unless there is sufficient justification in  usage

and  there are funds available, it is not intended

to  provide  flood-lighting facilities  for  other

public sports grounds.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development if he will ascertain from

the Housing and Development Board (a) what will be

the redevelopment scheme which is to take place on

the  site  of four old blocks of flats  along  Old

Airport  Road  now  under  clearance  action;  (b)

whether the affected families will be rehoused  in

alternative  accommodation  according   to   their

choice;  and (c) whether there will be any further

redevelopment  schemes in the Old Kallang  Airport

Estate in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the four blocks of three-storey

former  S.I.T. flats comprising 72 units of three-room   flats  along  Old  Airport  Road  will   be

demolished  for  the development of  a  two-storey

Hawkers' Emporium with 300 stores to relocate  the

hawkers  on both sides of the road and around  the

market.  A high-rise block of 288 units of  three-room flats will be built above the emporium. It is

proposed to offer these flats for sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 72 families affected by the demolition of

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Health

how  many  hawkers were cleared  and  re-sited  in

1969;  which  are the areas involved; whether  any

expenditure  has  been  incurred  by  the  Hawkers

Branch;  what and where are the areas, if any,  at

which   his  Ministry  intends  to  re-site  those

hawkers; and whether any assistance will be given,

and in what form.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,689 hawkers from

22 different areas were re-sited in 1969. I have a

list* showing the areas and the number of hawkers involved. As it is a rather long list, I  propose,

Sir, with your permission, to circulate copies  of

it  among  the Members of this House.  [Copies  of

list  handed  in  to the Clerk and distributed  to

Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See appendix, cols. 595-8.)

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1970/19700317/19700317-HA-0290595.pdf"">Appendix to Question 8 (col. 565) (Cols 0595-0598)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the expenditure incurred in

preparing the various sites to re-site these 1,689

hawkers  totalled $10,750. Most of the expenditure

was  in respect of wages for labourers and workmen

of the Ministry of Health. Nearly all the material

used,  that  is, cement slabs, etc, was  obtained

from   Government   stores.  The   only   material

purchased was cement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not been firmly decided what are the areas

from  which hawkers will be resited this year.  In

general, the areas will, however, be:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) those under immediate urban renewal

clearance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) those involving main traffic routes where

there is serious obstruction; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) where and when suitable alternative

accommodation is available.



<BR><BR> By  "suitable alternative accommodation", I do not

mean the nearest backlane or sidelane, for it  has

been decided that hawkers should henceforth be re-sited only in proper sites. Not every hawker  will

get  direct  Government assistance, but  deserving

hawkers  will be considered for subsidised  rental

when  they  are re-sited into proper  premises  to

enable  them to cater just as cheaply as they  did

when they were conducting business on the street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Punggol, I

would  like to state that hawkers and stallholders

inside  and  outside  markets  in  1969  cost  the

Government a total expenditure of $397,060.69 made

up as follows:



<pre>

(a) $265,396.74  for tap water

(b)   79,129.10  for electricity

Mr  Speaker, Sir, it must be appreciated that the

assistance given to hawkers by Government is by no

means small.

<div align="center"><b>HAWKER STALL LICENCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FEES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health (a) what is the cost of a licence for a

stall in public markets with water and light

supplies; (b) what is the fee for (i) a day

licence; and (ii) a night licence for a pitched-hawker stall in the city area such as at Orchard

Road or Albert Street; and what is the fee for

corresponding licences in the rural areas; and (c)

if the same rate of licence fee is charged for any

pitched-hawker stall irrespective of its location,

whether he will consider reducing licence fees for

such stalls in rural areas where the average daily

takings of hawkers are very much less than those

of their counterparts in the city area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the licence fees for stalls in

public markets range from $10 to $60 in a Class  A

market,  and from $10 to $40 in a Class B  market,

depending  on  the article of sale. The  fees  are

detailed   in   the   Third   Schedule   of    the

Environmental Public Health (Markets) Regulations,

1959, and the classification of markets into A and

B classes are listed in the Second Schedule of the

same  Regulations.  The licence  fees  for  street

pitch hawkers are uniform throughout the Republic,

irrespective of whether the pitch is in  the  city

or rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All licences for day pitches cost $10, except for

those  for  meat (that is, pork, beef and  mutton)

and  poultry, which cost $30 and $20 respectively.

A  poultry hawker's licence permits the hawker  to

conduct business the whole day, while the sale  of

meat  is  restricted from 6.00 a.m, to  4.00  p.m.

only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All licences for night pitches are $20 per month,

except  meat  and poultry in respect of  which  no

night  licences as such are issued. The  fees  are

detailed  in  the  Schedule to  the  Environmental

Public Health (Hawkers) Regulations, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All public markets are provided with water and

electricity. Water is also available to all cooked

food  street pitch hawkers, who number  more  than

ten  and  conduct  business  at  specified  hawker

sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the introduction of the new rates of

fees  for  markets and hawkers,  there  existed  a

series  of by-laws dating from 1909 onwards,  some

of  which  set  out  fees that  were  divided  and

subdivided into various categories. To begin with,

there were hitherto five classes of markets, three

in  the city area (Classes A, B and C), and two in

the  rural  area  (Classes A and  B).  There  were

different  rates  of fees for  each  of  the  five

classes  of markets, and in each class there  were

up  to 37 categories of articles of sale with each

category  being charged a different rate  of  fee.

Further,  even  within  each  category,  different

rates were charged, depending upon the size of the

stall  or pitch in the particular market. In  this

respect there were no less than 20 different sizes

of stalls and pitches in the various markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all these worked out to

something like 3,700 different rates of fees which

had to be collected by the Hawkers Department.  To

further complicate matters, at least three markets

of  the  same  class  in  the  city  area  charged

different  rates of fees. In addition, there  were

also different fees for:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) street hawker pitches which varied from one

rural area to another, the city having a standard

rate;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) hawkers' shelters which varied from site to site:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stallholders occupying vacant lands;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) itinerant hawkers;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) private markets;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) pasar malam hawkers; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) wall showcase hawkers.



<br><br>This  has  led to considerable administrative  and

accounting   difficulties  and,  at  times,   much

confusion.  The  new regulations which  came  into

force  on the 1st January, 1970, reduced the  five

classes  of  markets  to  two,  and  revised   and

standardised  licence  fees for  stall-holders  in

markets  and for the various categories of hawkers

which have remained unchanged for over 20 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the integration of the City Council into the

Rural   Board   in  1963,  it  was  necessary   to

standardise  the various rates prevailing  in  the

city  and  rural  areas and  also  to  reduce  the

numerous   categories   and  classifications.   In

general,  the  fees  for  hawkers  have  not  been

raised,  except  for itinerant  and  wall-showcase

hawkers  whose  fees have been brought  into  line

with   the  rates  payable  by  the  street  pitch

hawkers.   The   increase  of  fees   for   market

stallholders is marginal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small and compact city state such as ours,

it  is  not unreasonable to have uniform rates  of

fees  for hawkers within the city area or without.

For the reasons I have mentioned and the fact that

the new fees have only just been introduced, I  am

not inclined to consider reverting to the previous

practice  of  having separate rates  of  fees  for

hawkers conducting business in different parts  of

the island. In any case, Mr Speaker, Sir, what is

the  yardstick  to  gauge the income  of  hawkers,

short  of standing beside them and keeping  watch?

If  a  foolproof  method exists,  I  am  sure  the

Comptroller of Income Tax will be most interested.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as we still have different

classes  of  markets in Singapore, as outlined  by

the Minister just now, is it not possible also  to

have  different types of hawker pitches,  so  that

the  rate  for a hawker pitch in Orchard  Road  or

Albert Street will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



have  to  be more than that for a hawker pitch  in

the  rural areas where the hawkers do not earn  as

much?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Telok Blangah

could  suggest  a  yardstick  by  which  we  could

differentiate  between hawkers  plying  in  Albert

Street and those plying in, say, Kampong Heap Guan

San  in  Telok  Blangah,  then  I  shall  be  very

interested. And perhaps the Comptroller of  Income

Tax  will also be very interested. Unless  we  can

find  such  a yardstick, I am afraid  we  have  to

stick  to  our present policy of adopting  uniform

rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case, I will be

grateful  if the Minister can enlighten the  House

on the yardstick used to differentiate between the

various classes of markets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, as far as markets are concerned, formerly

there  were  five classes and we have now  reduced

them  to  two.  They have been classified  on  the

basis of various factors, one of which is the type

of  building that houses the stallholders, and the

other the facilities provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, can the

Minister  not use the same yardstick  for  hawkers

plying  in the city area and those plying  outside

the  city  area?  And can he also  say  whether  a

hawker  in  Orchard Road earns just as much  as  a

hawker in the rural area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, what is the

yardstick  by which you assess how much  a  hawker

earns? Has the Member for Telok Blangah some ideas

and can he tell me how we can have a yardstick?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> It is easy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> He suggested having a division of hawkers, with

separate rates of licence fees for the rural areas

and the city areas. Does he consider Bukit Panjang

town  a  city  area  or a rural  area,  or  Changi

Village a city area or a rural area?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1959, Singapore became a self-governing

state.  In September 1963, it became part  of  the

Federation of Malaysia. In August 1965, it  became

a republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution has undergone three fundamental

changes  in  a space of six years. It has  created

confusion   in   several  areas  whether   certain

provisions  continued to be law or were superseded

and altered. The present Constitutional provisions

relating  to the Public Service Commission  are  a

carry-over  of  those when  we  were  a  state  in

Malaysia.  The  Government could  have  left  this

Constitution (Amendment) Bill to be taken together

with  the  draft Constitution. This draft  is  now

being  vetted  by expert constitutional  draftsmen

before  it is tabled in this House. But  this  may

take  some time. And since it is the intention  of

the  Government  to afford every  institution  and

citizen an opportunity to make representations  on

the  constitutional draft, it may be a  few  years

before it is promulgated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has, therefore, been decided that we should

take the provisions relating to the Public Service

Commission in a separate Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes have been made to the existing provisions

in   the  Constitution  which  were  thought   too

restrictive   for   the   proper   and   efficient

functioning of the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to re-enact and provide a

comprehensive  part  in our  Constitution  dealing

with   the   public  service.  The  constitutional

changes  brought  about  since  independence  have

necessitated  these  changes. The  Public  Service

Commission have also recommended other changes  as

a  result  of their experiences, especially  after

August 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends the Articles in the Constitution

dealing  with  the qualifications  and  tenure  of

office  of the Chairman and members of the  Public

Service Commission. There will now be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



maximum of seven and a minimum of four members  of

the   Public  Service  Commission,  excluding  the

Chairman, instead of the present maximum  of  four

and   minimum  of  two  members.  The   provisions

relating to the qualifications for membership have

been  redrafted  to widen the choice  of  suitable

candidates for membership. Article 74 in clause  2

of   the  Bill  now  contains,  in  more  specific

language, those disqualifications from membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there have been doubts whether the

present  Article  80  would  prevent  the   Public

Service  Commission  from delegating  any  of  its

powers or functions, save to public officers. This

may  put  in  question  the  validity  of  certain

decisions of the Public Service Commission and its

delegates  which  were  made  in  good  faith.  In

several  cases, the appointment of a delegate  has

been  at  the request, or with the express consent

or  approval,  of the persons concerned  with,  or

directly   involved  in,  the  exercise   of   the

functions by the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid litigation on procedural and technical

grounds,  provisions  validating  them  have  been

inserted in Article 80D in clause 2 of the Bill so

that   no   proceedings  may  be   instituted   or

maintained  against the Commission as a  whole  or

any of its members for any exercise of such powers

and  rights.  But  where the  bona  fides  of  the

Commission  i3  challenged,  and  not  just  legal

technicalities,  a suit can be  taken  and  remedy

sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention of the Government that

those  aggrieved by an excess of authority  should

be  prevented from seeking legitimate  redress  as

the law allows. But the Government has to, and  is

prepared  to,  take the responsibility,  with  the

support   of  Members  of  this  House,  to   move

validation  clauses  in the new  Bill,  to  negate

frivolous or vexatious attempts at litigation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes, I hope, will enable the Public

Service  Commission the more efficiently to  carry

out their functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill. Its

purpose  is to strengthen the hands of the  Public

Service  Commission  so  that  it  will  be   more

effective  in  doing its work. We  know  that  the

P.S.C, is busy all the year round, because it  has

to   deal  with  thousands  of  applications   for

appointments  as public officers and  other  jobs.

There  are  only  a  few members  sitting  on  the

Commission  and, as such, they are  tied  down  to

their  work, and consequently there are delays  in

dealing   with   applications.   Therefore,    the

amendment  Bill has been introduced  at  the  most

appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the Public Service Commission

is  a very important institution of the state. Its

membership  comprises capable  citizens  who  will

ensure that the public service will have the  best

qualified  people  who  can perform  their  duties

well.  They  will  also be  able  to  serve  their

country well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the appointment of members to the

Public  Service Commission, there is a stipulation

in the Bill that Members of Parliament can also be

recommended  to  be members of the Public  Service

Commission.  This  will  enable  some  Members  of

Parliament  to  be  appointed as  members  of  the

P.S.C, and  render their services to the  country

well. In view of all this, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Prime Minister wish to reply to the

Member for Sembawang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have nothing to add.

the  financial  year 1st January,  1969,  to  31st

March,  1970, contained in Paper Cmd. 7  of  1970.

The  summary is at the foot of the page. There are

two  heads of expenditure and an amendment  stands

on  the Order Paper Supplement in respect of  Head

0402    -    Pensions,   Retirement    Allowances,

Gratuities, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0402 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0402 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister provide this House with a

breakdown of the number of retirements which  were

not   anticipated?  Has  this  big   increase   in

retirements affected any particular Ministry?  And

were there any main causes for it?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the cost of living allowances

on  pensions are still worked out according to the

old  system.  Most of the civil servants  variable

allowances  are now consolidated into their  basic

salaries.   Can   the  Minister  say   whether   a

pensioner's allowance can be consolidated into his

pension?  It  this consolidation is agreed  to,  I

hope pensioners do not get less than what they are

getting now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I do not think consolidation of cost of

living  allowances  would make any  difference  to

pensioners because, unlike serving officers,  they

have nothing to gain by such consolidation. In the

case of serving officers, pension is calculated on

basic   salary   so  that  when   their   variable

allowances  are  consolidated  into  their   basic

salary,  that  will have the effect of  increasing

the amount of pension for which they are eligible.

This  does not apply to pensions, in Still I  will

bear in mind what the



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Anson has said. I suspect a lot of

these  matters  remain as they are  through  sheer

bureaucratic inertia, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



may well be that by the year 2000, unless somebody

is  energetic  enough to inquire and question  the

basis  of  this  allowance, we  might  still  have

pensioners   drawing   their   cost   of    living

allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the questions raised by the Member for

Kampong Kapor, there has not been any increase  in

the  number of officers retiring. I will give  the

mid-year  figures of the number  of  officers  who

retired  in 1967, 1968 and 1969. In mid-1967,  467

officers   retired.  In  mid-1968,  553   officers

retired.  And  in mid-1969, 517 officers  retired.

The  number  of officers retiring in mid-1969  was

less than that in mid-1968. However, because those

who  retired in 1969 apparently drew more pay, the

net  effect  would  be that  the  cost  of  living

allowances  went  up by 13.4  per  cent  in  1969.

Whereas  in  1968,  the cost of living  allowances

went  up  by seven per cent as compared  with  the

previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of living allowances are provided to

pensioners  drawing less than $320  per  month  if

they   have  dependants  and  also  to  pensioners

drawing  less than $250 per month if they have  no

dependants.  It  so happened that last  year,  the

number of pensioners eligible for these allowances

was larger than had been expected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l01*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I am reminded of a

report  which appeared on the front  page  of  the

Straits Times on 14th February, 1970, carrying the

caption "New multi-million project, `Little Japan'

for  Jurong". This apparently, I believe, referred

to  the ambitious projects now being undertaken by

the  Jurong Town Corporation. To meet the  purpose

of financing the projects, this House is now asked

to approve a further loan of $5 million to be made

available  to  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation   in

addition  to  the $30 million already approved  by

the Committee of Supply in December 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Jurong has now become the "lifeline" of the

economy  of  the  Republic of  Singapore.  Further

expansion  of  the Jurong Industrial  Estate  will

certainly help to accelerate greater growth of the

economy especially in the l970s. All of us, inside

and  outside  this House, cannot feel  unconcerned

with  the  transformation that is taking place  in

Jurong.  This  being  the  case,  may  I  ask  the

Minister  for Finance to explain and enlighten  us

on  the details of the development projects  which

involve millions of dollars? In his reply, will he

also indicate to us when the projects will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



completed,  and,  if in several phases,  when  the

various phases will be completed? How many factory

sites will be available and will these be adequate

to  meet  the  number of applications received  to

date?  What  types  of  industries,  to  be   more

specific,  will be accommodated at  the  completed

sites?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, will there be sites for relocation of

warehouses  which  are in acute shortage  at  this

moment as a result of urban renewal schemes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not present.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the area under development to

which   the  Member  for  Mountbatten  has   drawn

attention  is that new stretch of Jurong  west  of

the  present Mobil Oil Refinery. An area of  about

1,000 acres is now being levelled by cutting  down

hills  and  filling up swamps. At the  same  time,

land  is  being dredged to produce two channels  - one  is being called Benoi channel, which is 4,000

feet  long,  750 feet wide and 15 feet  deep.  The

other is Tanjong Gul channel, which is 6,000  feet

long,  1,500  feet wide and 20 feet  deep.  It  is

necessary  to  do these rather expensive  dredging

operations  to  provide  suitable  sites  for  the

shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries as well

as   new  industries  which  will  fabricate  oil-drilling  rigs and produce other products required

by  the oil exploration industries in this part of

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-eight sites have been prepared and I have

been  informed by the Jurong Town Corporation that

33  of  these  sites have already been  taken  up.

There is a very serious shortage of land with good

sea ,frontage, and this shortage will continue for

some  time as a result of the rapid growth of  the

ship-building,   ship-repairing   and    servicing

industries    connected   with    off-shore    oil

exploration.  It  will  take  some  time  for  the

preparation  of the sites to be completed.  It  is

not  merely a matter of levelling land. It is also

necessary to bring in all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



other services which modem industry requires  such

as  power, supplies of industrial water,  in  some

cases  gas, as well as sewerage facilities and  so

on.  At  a  guess, I would say that most of  these

sites  will  be ready for occupation  in  about  a

year's time, and possibly the whole lot should  be

ready two years from now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warehouses are not the responsibility of the

Jurong Town Corporation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the explanation given by the Minister

for   Finance,   I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

103*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr J. F. Conceicao and Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it would not be an easy task to

belittle  the  achievements  of  the  Housing  and

Development Board. These are now world famous  and

we  derive  justifiable pride from  them.  In  the

process  of breaking the back of, if not  solving,

the  problems of physical housing, we have created

problems of a different dimension involving  human

beings and their social habits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progression from the environment of

traditional  slums  to  that  of  high-rise  flats

implies  the need for a change in communal values,

attitudes and standards of social cleanliness.  It

is insufficient for a human being to be impeccably

clean  within the confines of his flat, but to  be

careless  of  what  he does in  elevators,  common

stairways and corridors let alone common  latrines

and   baths.  Even  elevators  are  mistaken   for

latrines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our blocks of flats are becoming new

slums,  with an environment not conducive  to  the

healthy growth of the next and subsequent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



generations  of human beings. It is now  necessary

for  human beings living in blocks of flats to  be

organised on a corporate basis with their own self-governing institutions, perhaps along the lines of

management  committees of community centres,  with

adequate  powers to manage the social problems  of

flat-dwelling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come, Mr Speaker, for the Housing

and  Development  Board  to  direct  part  of  its

energies  to  solving  these  new  problems  which

involve not construction but human materials.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the tenor of my remarks will

follow  very  much the same lines as those  of  my

colleague  from  Bukit Panjang. I agree  with  him

that  it  will be very difficult for us to gainsay

the  achievements of the Housing  and  Development

Board.  The  Minister  for  Finance  himself   has

referred to the tremendous increase in the  number

of  houses  built in the last ten  years.  It  has

increased by about five times the original  number

in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own very slight reading on the subject of

housing projects has given me an impression which,

I  hope, is not simply due to the fact that I have

not    read   sufficiently,   that   our   housing

achievements  are,  perhaps,  the  best  and  most

effective  in  the  world. I  have  read  that  in

America,  for example, federal aid has been  given

to  middle-income  housing  projects,  whereas   a

relatively small programme is devoted to  aid  low

income housing projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore the emphasis has been on the

building  of  homes  for  low  income  groups.  In

addition  to  that, we are also providing  schemes

for  home ownership so that not only do we provide

our  people, especially those in the lower  income

group,  with shelter at comparatively low rentals,

but  we  offer  them security by giving  them  the

opportunity to buy their own homes on easy  terms.

This,  therefore, demonstrates a  relationship  of

responsibility    between   the    blousing    and

Development Board and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



our  people who live in flats and houses  provided

by  the Housing and Development Board. However,  I

feel  that  this  relationship  is  essentially  a

bureaucratic one. I would like to ask  whether  we

should  not take a greater interest in the  people

who live in these Housing Board flats, and whether

we   should  not  attempt  to  encourage  them  to

consider  the places in which they live  as  homes

and  not  simply as housing units? We can  already

detect  a growing interest among officers  of  the

Board in this respect. For example, fountains  are

provided in order to beautify the precincts  of  a

Housing   and   Development  Board  project.   The

important  point  is  to  educate  the  people  to

respect   these  social  amenities.  For  example,

shrubbery  must  not be destroyed,  and  fountains

should not be defiled, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we set about inculcating a sense of pride

and affection in the community and a commitment to

the  neighbourhood?  Perhaps  we  should  take   a

greater  interest in the sociological  aspects  of

community   development.   In   this   connection,

perhaps,  we  could ask the Minister for  Law  and

National Development how interested is the Housing

and  Development Board in getting the services  of

sociologists  to help them find out  the  problems

that  affect  people  who  live  in  Housing   and

Development  Board flats. There are many  measures

that  one can just give as examples. Could we  not

provide  premises for people who live  in  Housing

and  Development Board flats to meet  and  discuss

the  improvement of their neighbourhood? Could not

these  same  premises also serve as centres  where

people  could  come together, view an  educational

T.V, programme  and  learn  to   improve   their

environment?  They can also learn something  about

domestic   economy,   about   beautifying    their

premises, and about subjects that will make  life

that  much more worth living. This would give  the

people  a  greater  sense of commitment  to  their

environment.  These same premises  could  also  be

used  by  the  children who live in these  crowded

quarters  to  study and prepare for  their  school

work. These are just a few examples of what could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



be  done to augment the human qualities of life in

Housing and Development Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one could comment on the polar attitudes

that  are taken by the community and by the estate

officer in charge of a particular area. This is an

unfortunate situation. Sometimes an M.P, is caught

between the estate officer trying to implement the

Board's  rules  and  the community  who  seems  to

regard the estate officer as a natural antagonist.

Perhaps  something  could  be  done  to  encourage

better  relationship between the Board's  officers

and  the community. In this connection, one  could

ask what sort of training is given to officers  of

the   Board   in   the  understanding   of   human

relationship.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I thank both Members

for  their  kind  words and then attempt  to  meet

their criticisms or perhaps suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say that the Housing and Development

Board  has  been  very  conscious  of  the  social

conditions which have come about through living in

flats,  some of which are high-rise.  In  1966,  a

sample  survey was taken in some estates  and  the

net result was a report prepared by Mr Stephen H.

K.  Yeh  and  Mr Lee Yoke San in 1968 on  housing

conditions  in Singapore. This report  dealt  with

all  the  trends  and implications,  and  I  would

commend it to both Members. Perhaps I could  touch

on  some of its conclusions. Sir, I quote at  page

28 of the report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For the first time in Singapore, living in these

high-rise fiats has created a new way of life  for

a significant proportion of the population. Social

change,  as  reflected in people's lives,  is  the

result  of the inter-play of physical, social  and

individual  factors  and,  therefore,   both   the

quantitative  and  qualitative aspects  of  living

have  to  he  studied together,  if  comprehensive

knowledge is to be gained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, at the present time, there are some

200,000  people  living in the  congested  central

area  of  3  1/2- square miles, most of  which  is

scheduled  for slum clearance, and the  population

reallocated  to public housing in the interest  of

sound  land-use policy, better social welfare  and

general economic development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the social structure of slums

deserves attention



And they go on and on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board is acting in

accordance with the recommendations made  in  this

report  and  has  made some plans to  improve  the

living  conditions of tenants in the  Housing  and

Development Board estates. I would remind Members,

firstly,  of  the  sports complex  at  Queenstown,

which  is  at  the moment under construction.  The

Board  is spending $2,000,000 on this complex.  It

will  be completed by July this year and will have

five swimming pools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another particular item is the reservation of 40

acres of land at Toa Payoh for the construction of

another  sports complex. Work has not yet started,

but  it  will be done so that the younger children

will  have  more playgrounds, and the  older  ones

will  have basket-ball courts. The Board has  been

very  conscious of the needs of the people  living

in  flats, and in every housing estate places  are

reserved not only for shops but markets and stalls

and   even  cinemas.  Sometimes  light  and  clean

industries  are  provided  in  order  to   provide

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the little details about keeping

common corridors and lifts clean. It would be very

expensive,  from  the Board's point  of  view,  to

provide  a  liftman. I am sure Members will  agree

with  me that this is a process of education,  but

one thing we have done, and which has resulted  in

cleaner homes and cleaner estates, is the sale  of

the  estates. A man who owns his own home sees  to

it that it is clean. He sees to it that the common

corridors are clean. He sees to it that the  lifts

are  not  dirty.  Hence, one of  the  reasons  for

encouraging home ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the specific suggestions of both the

Members  for Bukit Panjang and Katong,  the  Board

will    soon    be    creating    committees    of

representatives in two or three blocks in each and

every one of our eleven housing estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be one committee for one block. And

the  Board  has  suggested  that  the  Member   of

Parliament  for the constituency, a representative

of  the  Board,  and  a member  of  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committee of the constituency, should

sit  as  members of this committee.  I  hope  that

Members of this House, in whose constituency there

are   many   housing  estates,  will  give   every

assistance to the committee about to be formed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Goh, have you anything to add to that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

104*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Ng Yeow Chong, Mr J. F. Conceicao, Mr Lim Cheng Lock, and Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the very substantial amount of

money  involved under this Head, I wonder  whether

the Minister can inform this House of the progress

made to date by the Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, and

the  Chartered  Industries of Singapore  Ltd.  And

also  what is the rate of return, if any,  on  the

amount invested in each case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Air Chartering Enterprises Pte. Ltd.,

can   the  Minister  give  full  details  of   the

management   and   operation   of   the   company?

Presumably  more  funds  will  be  required   very

shortly to acquire the necessary aircraft and,  if

so, what is the amount involved for the purpose?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bearing in mind the growing number of

Government  agencies now in operation and  in  the

course  of being set up, I feel that the  question

of  accountability of these agencies to Parliament

in   practice   should  be   given   the   closest

examination at this stage. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



things stand at the moment, there appears to be no

arrangement  in force to keep Parliament  informed

of the progress made on new ventures embarked upon

by  these  agencies from time to  time.  While  an

ordinary shareholder in a public company  is  sent

an  annual  report  by  his  company,  Members  of

Parliament  are denied this courtesy by  most,  if

not all, of these agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has fully explained in general the

rationale  behind  the setting  up  of  Government

agencies,   which   is   well   appreciated    and

wholeheartedly  supported by this House.  However,

there is, to my mind, the need for the performance

and  activities of these agencies to be kept under

constant  review by Parliament, so  as  to  ensure

that  they  will not veer from the  objectives  or

purposes  for which their setting up was intended,

and  that  there is no unnecessary  or  unintended

conflict  of  interests  committed  wittingly   or

unwittingly either with the public sector or  with

the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that all these aspects have not

escaped  the  attention of the  Minister,  but  to

ensure  the long-term continued accountability  of

these   agencies  to  Parliament,   perhaps   some

arrangement  ought to be made at  this  stage  for

Parliament to receive periodical progress  reports

from them. In saying so, it is not my intention to

suggest that Parliament should interfere with  the

work of the professionals or to impose unnecessary

restrictions or limitations upon the activities of

these  agencies, as such a course of  action  will

only hamper the healthy growth of such agencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I would like to touch on the sum of $70

million  to  be  voted as a Joan  to  the  Neptune

Orient Lines Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed gratifying to note that since

its  operation last June, the Neptune Orient Lines

has performed very well. However, the only setback

is that it has not been accepted as a full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



member  of  the Far East Freight Conference.  This

being  the  case, its cargo ships are barred  from

conveying goods to and from Japan, whereas vessels

of the other members of the Conference are allowed

to  enter  Japanese ports to collect and discharge

cargoes.  With the advent of containerisation,  it

is  vital  for Singapore to venture into  Japanese

ports: otherwise she will not be able to make  use

of  her  future container ships for the Far  East-Europe run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is learnt that the reason for the refusal of

Neptune  Orient Lines' entry as a full  member  of

the Conference is that its performance has not yet

come  up  to expectations. I understand  that  the

Neptune  Orient Lines' case to extend its services

to  Japan has been presented to the F.E.F.C.,  and

negotiations  have  taken  place  in  London  last

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our duty to safeguard the interests of

the  Neptune  Orient  Lines, as  it  involves  the

Government in a loan of $70 million. It is  futile

to  possess a car without making full use  of  it.

Likewise, having been accepted as a member of  the

F.E.F.C., it is considered unfair that the Neptune

Orient Lines, as compared to other members, is not

able to enjoy the full benefit of the rights.  For

instance, Japanese vessels have been permitted  to

carry  Singapore  cargoes to Europe;  whereas  the

Neptune Orient Lines' vessels have been limited to

transporting goods to and from Hong Kong only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister be kind enough to inform

this House of the outcome of the negotiations held

in  London in respect of the rights of the Neptune

Orient  Lines, and what appropriate  steps  is  he

contemplating  to  take in  order  to  extend  the

services of the Neptune Orient Lines in future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is good that

enterprise in Singapore is so free that Government

is  also  participating in  it.  The  reasons  for

Government's  participation cannot be sufficiently

repeated.  There  have been  expressions  of  some

misgivings in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



certain quarters, but I hope I shall not be  taken

as  being  condescending in this case when  I  say

that   the   Minister  for  Finance   is   to   be

congratulated  on being absolutely sure  that  the

people  are  under  no misapprehensions  regarding

Government's  attitude  of  fair  treatment  where

Government's  participation in private  enterprise

is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that we should be engaged in this sort

of  enterprise -~ I am speaking merely as a layman

so  that we can encourage our people to turn their

attention  towards  modern methods  of  management

where  business  is concerned, and  to  turn  from

trading   towards   industries.   Certainly    the

experience   that   we  get   in   running   these

enterprises  will  stand us in  good  stead  where

managerial development of expertise in respect  of

such enterprises is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a whole host of reasons to justify our

participation  in  commercial enterprises.  But  I

would like to make this point, Mr Speaker, Sir,I

hope I do not sound too priggish, or too much like

the  Chairman  of  the Public Accounts  Committee,

when  I  say  that perhaps this matter could  have

been brought up here a little bit earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have read in the newspapers

recently about the Jurong Bird Park. May I ask the

Minister  whether this is an economic proposition?

And  how  is Jurong Bird Park Pte. Ltd, going  to

derive its revenue?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> By selling bird seeds!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just a little doubt

about  the  Neptune Orient Lines. Out of  the  $70

million loan asked for, $18.9 million will be  "by

way  of  purchase price and downpayment"  for  two

Freedom-type  vessels.  I  understand   that   the

Neptune  Orient  Lines  is  negotiating  with  the

Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries in Japan and,

at the same time, with the Jurong Shipyard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we have a shipyard in the Republic

ready to build ships, can the Minister tell us why

we  should not give the order to our own shipyard,

instead of negotiating here and there?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am very pleased with the amount of

interest generated among Members in the commercial

ventures of the Government. Happily, these are all

going  on  fairly well, and with  good  luck  they

ought to succeed, the Jurong Bird Park included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Neptune Orient Lines, the position

is  as  stated  by the Member for  Mountbatten  in

respect  of  our negotiations with  the  Far  East

Freight Conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the big shipping lines are owned by very

powerful  financial interests in  very  large  and

powerful  countries. So when a small country  like

Singapore gets involved in the big league, I think

we  are  under certain disabilities.  Let  us  not

assume  that,  in terms of financial resources  or

political power, we are of the same stature as big

countries like the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany,

or  the  United States. Nevertheless,  within  our

rather  limited capabilities, we have  obtained  a

certain amount of sailing rights from the F.E.F.C.

At  present we are allowed 12 sailings a year from

June  1969 to July this year; one sailing a  month

from  Hong  Kong  to Singapore,  Port  Swettenham,

Penang,  Britain and Western Europe. As from  July

this year till the end of next year, the number of

sailings will increase from 12 to 18, which is one

sailing  every three weeks instead of one  sailing

every  month, with the proviso that sailings  from

Hong Kong will remain at 12 per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some restrictions as regards cargo

tonnage limitations, the types of cargoes, and  so

on,  which  Neptune Orient Lines  can  collect  at

various  ports. These restrictions are covered  by

confidential agreement, and I am not at liberty to

divulge them,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, negotiations took place

with  the  object  of getting for  Neptune  Orient

Lines  sailing  rights  from  Japan,  as  far   as

Thailand,  and also rights to collect  cargo  from

South  Thailand  and East Malaysia.  No  agreement

could   be   reached  in  the  course   of   these

negotiations,  and  a mediator  will  be  sent  to

Singapore  in  April  to consider  Neptune  Orient

Lines' request for improved sailing rights.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company has now five freighters on the Far

East  run, one freighter on the Straits-Japan run,

one  tanker on world-wide charter, and one coaster

carrying  cargo  in regional waters.  The  company

also  has  a  super tanker of 233,000 dead  weight

tons  on order. This is in partnership with a Hong

Kong   company.  So  far  the  company  has   done

reasonably  well. It will be some time before  the

audited   accounts  for  the  first  six   months'

operations are available, because in the nature of

the  business,  accounts  have  to  be  collected,

assembled and audited from the different ports  of

call.  The final preparation and auditing  of  the

company's  accounts  are more difficult  and  take

longer  time than would be the case of an ordinary

commercial venture. However, because of the rather

good trading conditions last year, the company has

done  much  better than new shipping companies  of

this sort would normally do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Chartered Industries of Singapore

Ltd.,  again,  this  company has  been  performing

reasonably well, its first year's operation  shows

a return of 18 per cent of capital invested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Chartering Enterprises Pte. Ltd., a subject

raised  by  the Member for Jalan Kayu, is  a  very

small  air cargo company. Its operation is limited

to  lifting  cargo between Singapore  and  certain

countries  in the region. Whether it  will  expand

beyond this modest operation is something I cannot

say for certain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue from Jurong Bird Park Pte. Ltd, will

be  from gate receipts. I do not know whether this

will be sufficient to pay for the operation costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



plus  interest  on  the loan and  depreciation  of

properties.  However,  as  compared   with   other

enterprises   of   this  kind,  for   example,   a

zoological  garden  or  a  marineland,  the  great

advantage  of an aviary is that it does  not  cost

much  to  feed birds. Furthermore, birds do  breed

and,  given  luck, some side income  may  even  be

generated from the sale of birds to other aviaries

of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd, will not be in

production  for  some years.  We  have  now  under

training  in  Japanese shipyards some 249  workers

recruited  by  Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd.,  and  the

construction  of the dock and quays will  commence

later this month. On the 21st of March, 1970,  the

directors   expect  to  award  tenders   for   the

construction.  This dockyard may be  completed  by

April  next year. But the company will be in  full

production  only  by  the year  1975  when  it  is

expected  to build some six Freedom-type  ships  a

year.  Whether Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, will  buy

ships from Jurong Shipbuilders Ltd. I do not know.

Presumably, if they need Freedom-type ships, which

can  carry  both  containers as  well  as  general

cargo,  then  they  will give  their  business  to

Jurong  Shipbuilders Ltd. But it is  by  no  means

obligatory on the company to buy ships from Jurong

Shipbuilders Ltd., although one hopes they will do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the accountability of our enterprises

to Parliament, I think we should have a clear idea

what  accountability means. If it is a  matter  of

providing information to Members of Parliament, of

course,  this  can be done regularly  at  Question

Time. If it is a matter of answering questions  on

matters  arising from these enterprises or  indeed

any  enterprises, then Ministers, of  course,  are

available   to   give   such   information.    But

accountability  to Parliament as a  constitutional

principle,  I  think, goes beyond this.  It  means

that  the  operation of Government departments  is

open  to detailed parliamentary inquiry either  in

the  House  itself or at meetings  of  the  Public

Accounts  Committee,  And, of  course,  Government

enterprises of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



nature  are not accountable to Parliament in  this

sense.  As  the Member for Jalan Kayu has  rightly

pointed  out,  as  these  enterprises  are  of   a

commercial,   business  nature,  they   would   be

completely  hobbled if they have to be  controlled

in  detail  by  Parliament. Subject  to  this,  of

course, if at any time Members would like to  have

information on the progress of these industries, I

will be most happy to give it to them.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TELEPHONE BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir I beg to move, "That the bill be

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is designed to enable the, Singapore

Telephone  Board,  from time  to  time,  with  the

approval of the Minister, to capitalise the  whole

or  any part of the sum standing to the credit  of

the  Board's General Reserve Account; such sum  to

be  capitalised to the stockholder (which in  this

case is the Government of Singapore) as issued and

fully paid-up capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to draw the attention of this

House  that  the Board's fixed assets and  General

Reserve  increased substantially during  the  six-year  period  1963 - 1968, as illustrated  by  the

following figures:

<pre>

                          1963              1968

                      ($ million)        ($ million)



Fixed assets at cost      76.6              110.7



Fixed assets after

  depreciation            43.7               70.4



General Reserve            7.0               40.0



Ordinary Stock            20.0               20.0

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the high level of the General Reserve

at the end of 1968 and almost a two-fold growth in

the  fixed  assets since 1963 due to the ploughing

back  of  surpluses into capital development,  the

Board decided in July 1969 to transfer $20 million

from  the  General Reserve Account to  its  equity

Share capital, thus raising it from $20 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



to  $40 million. The capitalisation took effect on

1st September, 1969, and to regularise matters, it

is  necessary  to  bring the  Singapore  Telephone

Board    (Amendment)   Act,   1970,   into   force

retrospectively to 1st September, 1969,  with  the

exception  of  clause 5 thereof. This  is  because

clause  5 of the Bill makes it an offence for  any

subscriber  to  make unauthorised  attachments  or

alterations,  and it is both unconstitutional  and

undesirable   that  such  provision  should   have

retrospective effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has been taken to make the following

minor  amendments to the Singapore Telephone Board

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The definition of "auditor" is amended to

bring   it  up  to  date  as  the  Companies

Ordinance   (Cap.  174)   has   since   been

superseded by the Companies Act, 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The quorum for meetings of the Board has

been   raised  from  Two  to  four   members

present,  in  addition to  the  Chairman  or

Deputy Chairman, as the total membership  of

the Board is now nine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. Question put,

and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee: reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
