<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read  a Second time." Sir, the object of this Bill

is  to  replace the present system of Registration

of   Deeds  affecting  land,  with  a  system   of

Registration   of  Title.  Of  the   jurisdictions

throughout the world which have inherited  English

Law,  Singapore must be one of the last to  follow

this  course  of  certifying or  guaranteeing  the

ownership of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government succeeded in obtaining

the  services  of Mr John Baalman, Barrister-at-Law and Senior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



Examiner of Titles to the Registry of Titles, New

South  Wales.  Mr Baalman is an  expert  on  the

Torrens  System  of land registration.  The  Bill

before this Assembly is his work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of the system of Registration of

Title over the present system of conveyancing  by

deeds are now almost universally recognised.  As

long  ago as 1891, the Judicial Committee of  the

Privy  Council  stated that  the  object  of  the

Torrens  System is "to save persons dealing  with

registered  land from the trouble and expense  of

going behind the Register in order to investigate

the  history  of  their  author's  title  and  to

satisfy themselves of its validity. That  end  is

accomplished   by  providing  that   anyone   who

purchases  bona  fide  and  for  value  from  the

registered  proprietor and  enters  his  Deed  of

Transfer  or  Mortgage  on  the  Register   shall

thereby    acquire    an    indefeasible    right

notwithstanding  the infirmity  of  his  author's

title."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Sir, a leaflet published by Her

Majesty's  Land  Registry in the  United  Kingdom

explained  that the Registration of Title  "gives

finality".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Register will afford conclusive proof of

the ownership of land, by an instrument called  a

Certificate of Title. The difference between  the

Title Register and the present Deeds Register  is

the  difference  between  the  positive  and  the

negative. The Registration of Deeds Ordinance, in

effect, says, "If you do not register your  deed,

it  will  be bad." The Land Titles Bill says,  in

effect, "If you do register your deed, it will be

good." Between the economic consequences of these

two effects, there is a wide gulf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages to Government and to statutory

bodies  of having readily accessible evidence  of

the  ownership of land are obvious, but the major

benefit  will  be  enjoyed  directly  by  private

owners  and purchasers. The public at large  will

also derive an indirect benefit; because when any

necessary activity in the life of a community  is

performed  at less expense and in less time  than

it has hitherto taken, a change must react to the

advantage   of  the  overall  economy   of   that

community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken, incidentally to

the improvement in the system of registration,  to

modernise  certain aspects of the Law of  Property

generally,  as,  for instance,  that  relating  to

mortgages. I do not propose to go into the details

of  the Bill as these are dealt with at length  in

the Objects and Reasons attached to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not, of course, possible, Sir, to

introduce  a new system like this overnight.  The

intention  is that the present Register  of  Deeds

and  the  new Register of Title shall continue  to

exist  side by side until the former is ultimately

absorbed  in  the  latter.  The  function  of  the

Register of Deeds will be to feed and gradually to

transfer its substance into the new Register until

the old one can be safely laid to rest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough, Sir, to convince

hon. Members that this long overdue measure, which

will  bring  great  benefits  to  the  people   of

Singapore,  should not suffer any  further  delay,

but should be proceeded with at once and it is  my

intention,  Sir,  immediately  after  the   Second

Reading  to commit the Bill to a Select Committee.

I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Bill before us, beyond question, is a complex one.

Even  if it is not controversial in principle,  it

is  certainly so in regard to several details  and

in the interpretation of many of its clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a Bill which, in particular, needs the

skill  and  experience of conveyancing lawyers  to

examine  and,  if need be, amend. It is  therefore

quite  clear that this Bill, in order to become  a

satisfactory and more or less watertight piece  of

legislation,  needs  to  be  sent  to   a   Select

Committee of this House. We welcome the fact  that

this  step  is  being taken, and we  are  glad  to

support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<div align="center"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, under Standing Order No. 48, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee

with  the  Speaker as Chairman and members  to  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee

with  the  Speaker as Chairman and members  to  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LAND ACQUISITION (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second   time."   Sir,  this  is   a   short   and

straightforward  Bill. It is a temporary  measure,

which  the  Government intends to replace  at  the

earliest  possible date by comprehensive permanent

legislation designed to freeze the values  of  all

immovable property. Government has already secured

the  services of an expert from Australia who will

advise it on the introduction of such legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, it is a matter of urgency that

the  interim  legislation now under  consideration

should  be  enacted in order to make possible  the

publication of the Master Plan for which there  is

provision  in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance.

This  Plan  has now been lying idle for two  years

owing to the reluctance of the previous Government

to enact legislation for the stabilisation of land

values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government will not tolerate any further

delay  and intends to see to it that the  Plan  is

published  at  the earliest possible  opportunity.

There  is a growing public demand that this  Plan,

which  will  vitally affect forward  planning  not

only by Government but also by private developers,

should be brought into the open. The effect  of  a

comprehensive  Master  Plan,  covering  the  whole

island, will be to sterilise some areas for  green

belts,  to  allocate  some  for  agriculture   and

channel  development into certain districts.  This

will mean that some land will depreciate in value,

while  other  land  will have  its  value  greatly

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Government comes to acquire land in

development,  it will find that the  planning  for

which  it is responsible has put prices up against

itself. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



to avoid this that prices must be pegged to a date

before  values  start shifting from  one  area  to

another.  Compensation for land to be acquired  by

Government must be related to a date prior to  the

publication of the Master Plan. Clause  2  of  the

Bill  is designed to peg prices to the 22nd  April

1955,  the  date  on  which the  Government  first

announced   its   intention  to   introduce   such

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 seek to give the Governor in

Council  power  to acquire land for  comprehensive

development as new or satellite towns. Doubts have

been   expressed   in   the  past   whether   such

acquisitions could properly be carried  out  under

the Land Acquisition Ordinance (Chapter 128).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two further matters to which I should

like  to  refer. It has been suggested to me  that

legislation of this nature is likely  to  hit  the

small   man   hardest  of  all.  Well,   Sir,   my

information is, and this has been confirmed  by  a

leading estate agent in the local Press, that  the

majority  of  landowners in Singapore are  wealthy

men.  However,  if  any cases are  brought  to  my

notice in which it can be shown that a smallholder

is  likely to suffer hardship as a result of  this

legislation, I assure hon. Members that  his  case

will be given special consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this: the fear has been

expressed  that this Bill, if it becomes  law,  is

likely to prove a hindrance to private development

and may even bring it to a standstill. It has been

said  that no private developer will buy  land  in

future  for  residential or industrial development

because he cannot be certain that Government  will

not  take  this land away from him at  the  pegged

price.  The  answer  to that,  Sir,  is  that  the

publication  of  the  Master Plan  should  quickly

dispel  any uncertainty that may be felt  on  this

account  since  the Plan will indicate  what  land

will be required for public development. And, as I

have  said  before, Sir, the main object  of  this

Bill is to make possible the early publication  of

the Master Plan. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to speak, not merely as a Member  of  the

Opposition  whose  duty is to  oppose,  but  as  a

responsible  Member of this House anxious  to  see

that the development of Singapore under the Master

Plan will be for the benefit of all the people and

not  at  the  expense  or to the  detriment  of  a

section of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-war development of Singapore has

proceeded  at a tremendous pace, and  none  of  us

question the fact that such development without  a

Master Plan would lead to chaotic conditions which

would  be  impossible  to solve  within  the  next

hundred years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept Sir George Pepler's idea that Singapore

should  have satellite towns all over the  island,

consisting  of  industrial and  residential  areas

surrounded  by green belts, so that  workers  will

not have to spend many hours each day going to and

from  their place of employment. We do not  think,

however,   that  Sir  George  Pepler   has,   paid

sufficient attention to the financial aspect,  nor

has  he  shown that it is necessary to freeze  the

price  of  land to stabilise its value.  In  fact,

similar   legislation  in   England   has   proved

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed Bill is an improvement on the last

one  in  that it fixes land values for the purpose

of  the Master Plan as on the 22nd of April, 1955,

and  does  not take advantage of any drop  in  the

price of land after that date. Secondly, it  is  a

temporary  measure for five years only instead  of

for   an  indefinite  period.  The  previous  Bill

brought in by the last Government was committed to

a   Select   Committee  which  produced   a   very

interesting  report,  with three  members  of  the

Committee for the Bill and three against; but this

Bill has died a natural death with the election of

the new Government. Undoubtedly it was this report

that  has  produced the two improvements mentioned

by  me. If so much improvement has occurred  after

one  report,  is  it not possible to  put  further

thought  on this matter and avoid the freezing  of

the price of land?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask that Members of this House for

the time being forget election pledges and look at

this matter with an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



open mind. Everyone is agreed that speculation  in

land  and fortunes made as a result of the  Master

Plan  should be prevented at all costs.  With  the

knowledge that this Government is prepared even to

prevent  the  operation of the law of  supply  and

demand,  he would be a very daring man  who  would

today indulge in operation of land values at  this

juncture.  In any case, it would be very  easy  to

prevent this, and all that is required is  a  Bill

to provide that any increase in the value of land,

either  as  a result of the Master Plan  or  as  a

result of the development by and at the expense of

Government, shall not be added to the market value

of  the land if acquired for public purposes. With

this  protection,  there will  no  longer  be  any

necessity for secrecy to be attached to the Master

Plan.  By  implication, the public  already  knows

that  the  Master Plan has been in  operation  for

some  time,  as  plans for development  have  been

turned  down  in  the  last year  or  two  without

reasons  being given. I can see no reason why  the

Master Plan cannot be published forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That freezing of land values is impractical is

clearly  shown  by  what has happened  in  England

during  the last ten years. In 1944, the Town  and

Country  Planning Act froze land  values  for  the

purpose  of compulsory purchase as at the 31st  of

March,  1939. This became more and more unrealistic

and  was  finally  abandoned  when  the  Town  and

Country  Planning  Act of 1947 was  passed.  Under

this   Act,   a   most  complicated   system   was

established  by which the State in  fact  acquired

the  development  value in all  land,  and  anyone

wishing  to  develop his land would  have  to  pay

towards a fund the difference between its value in

its  existing state and the developed value of his

land. For example, when farmland is approved as  a

satellite town, then he has to pay the sum of £300

million set aside to meet all claims of owners  of

land,  which  has  to  be  restricted  in  use  or

development. Much trouble and litigation arose out

of this law, as a result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



of  which the Town and Country Planning  Act  of

1953   abolished  the  development   charges   and

postponed  payment  out of the £300  million,  and

published  a  White Paper stating that  Government

proposed  to bring fresh legislation  to  use  the

value  of  land fixed under the 1947  Act  as  the

upper   limit   for  compensation   for   planning

restrictions as and when development  of  land  is

prevented  or severely restricted. So far,  to  my

knowledge, no new legislation has been  passed  in

England. Therefore, the position in Great  Britain

is  that  there is no restriction on the value  of

land  today.  But there is a suggested restriction

on  the limit of compensation payable based on the

potential use of the land in 1947.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we not therefore profit by the mistake

made  in England and follow the latest legislation

instead of rushing into the same position she  was

in  in  1944?  Even  with all the  goodwill  of  a

Socialist Government in providing compensation for

those  whose land has to be necessarily restricted

in  usage  under nation-wide planning, the  scheme

was  not  a  success. How can we succeed  when  no

thought   has  been  given  under  this   proposed

legislation,  not  only to large  owners,  but  to

owners of small plots of land?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular case comes to my mind. Two years

ago,  a fire destroyed about 50 huts built on  two

acres  of  land  at the junction of  Aljunied  and

MacPherson Roads. The owner of this piece of land,

who  inherited it from his father, was a poor  man

and  his house, together with all the huts on this

land, was wiped out. He was getting a ground  rent

of  $250. That has completely gone, and he is  now

living  in  a little shed built with the  remnants

salvaged  from  the  fire  and  roofed  over  with

flattened  kerosene tins. He has  tried  to  build

huts and even to lease this land for building low-cost  houses, but his application has always  been

turned  down.  Perhaps the Chief Minister  at  his

next Meet-the-People meeting can help him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the case of others who have invested

their  savings  in  some piece of  land  and  have

mortgaged  it.  So far, investment  in  immoveable

property has been the soundest investment when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



value  of money depreciates. When their  land  is

sterilised under the Master Plan, they  will  not

only  have  to  pay  interest,  but  also  annual

assessment  based on 5 per cent of  the  purchase

price.  Are  such people not entitled to  relief?

They  are now faced with having to part with land

at  its frozen value, though they might have paid

a   much  higher  price  for  it,  plus  loss  of

interest,  and payment of assessment. It  is  not

true  that only rich owners are affected by  this

legislation.   There  are   many   thousands   of

smallholders who are vitally affected and whom it

is your duty, sitting on the Government Bench, as

well as ours to protect. I submit that as soon as

land  is  prevented or severely  restricted  from

development, it should be acquired by  Government

and compensation paid therefore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Chief Minister announced in the

newspapers - and  he  has  been  supported  by  the

Minister for Local Government, Lands and  Housing

(Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) today - that he

has engaged an expert from Australia and that  he

intends  to bring a total freeze Bill which  will

freeze  the  value  of  all immoveable  property,

including  houses built thereon. Such  statements

made   before  full  investigation  as   to   the

workability  of  total freeze  in  Singapore  are

bound  to  scare  away investment,  and  I  would

commend to him the wise words of the Secretary of

State  for the Colonies: "Do not spoil the future

of  this great place by scaring away capital  and

investment." Now that he has got his way  by  the

concession granted to him of 'shall' reading  for

'may'  in  the  constitution, we hope  the  Chief

Minister  will settle down to work and clear  the

cloud  of  uncertainty that  has  gathered  as  a

result  of the series of crises during the  short

life  of  this Assembly. If he does  not  produce

shocks and unholy marriages, we promise we  shall

not produce any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say total freeze is unworkable because I have

been  reliably  informed that  freezing  of  land

values in Australia



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall)</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Cannot the Member for Paya

Lebar  (Mr  Lim Koon Teck) stick to  the  point,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are now, on the Land Acquisition

(Temporary  Provisions) Bill. We  are  not  on  a

total  freeze  Bill. Will the hon. Member  please

keep to the Bill before the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Very well, Sir. I would also

point  out  that since the liberation some  7,000

families in Singapore have put their savings into

home ownership, and about 6,000 of these families

have   mortgaged  their  homes  to  the  building

societies, insurance companies or banks, and  are

paying  instalments instead of rents so  that  in

ten  or  twelve years they will be  the  absolute

owners of their homes, free from mortgage.  These

people are the salt of the earth, as they have  a

stake in the country and will support a wise  and

stable  government against the forces of anarchy.

Are  these  people to be penalised by having  the

value  of their holdings fixed at a certain price

should they be unfortunate to have to sell  their

homes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facts and figures have more than once been

published  showing that Government  will  not  be

able  to  cope with the houses required  for  the

normal  increase of the population by birth,  let

alone that back-log required for those living  in

the  slums. I suggest that we should not  in  any

way  discourage people who want to  help  in  the

development of housing for those who  can  afford

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this is a measure restricting the

right  of free trade, a cornerstone laid  by  Sir

Stamford  Raffles when he founded  Singapore,  on

which depends the prosperity of this city, as  we

know  it today. This is a measure recently  tried

and  discarded  in Great Britain. It  savours  of

measures  shielded by curtains, Iron,  Bamboo  or

Paper,  in that the development of the  State  is

made  at  the expense of a section of the public,

consisting not only of owners of large pieces  of

land,  but small pieces of land as well. It seeks

to  prevent owners of property from obtaining the

benefit of any development under the Master  Plan

but does not make any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



provision  for  owners of land whose  property  is

sterilised.  What  is  required  is  not  a  hasty

temporary measure, but a full comprehensive scheme

so  that the planned development of Singapore  can

be  carried out for the benefit of all and not  at

the  expense  of  one section  of  the  community,

without creating uncertainty and fear in the minds

of   potential   owners  of  homes   and   persons

interested  in  building houses  for  people  with

modest  incomes,  or  in building  new  factories.

Unless  their confidence in the future is assured,

the Master Plan will remain merely as a Plan to be

carried  out  by  Government  alone,  without  the

co-operation of the people who are in a position to

help in the development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give notice that I intend to move, after

the Second Reading, that this Bill be committed to

a  Select Committee with the object of producing a

comprehensive scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

measure, which the Member for Paya Lebar damns  as

a  hasty  temporary one, has been, it is true,  in

the  making  for only two years. I can  appreciate

that the group, which seeks and needs 24 hours  to

say 'Thank you', finds considerable difficulty  in

considering any measure sufficiently mature  which

has  only  taken  two  years  of  thought.  I  can

appreciate  that  this group,  which  asks  us  to

settle   down  to  work,  should  quite  logically

suggest that if one report improves a Bill, let us

sit  down  and produce another report,  and  after

that  another  report, and maybe  another  report,

Sir,  and  so  on ad infinitum, for  a  Bill  that

consists of four short clauses!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fascinating, Sir, to consider this speech,

peppered with inconsistencies, coming from an hon.

Member who, speaking on behalf of his Party,  says

that   it  is  his  duty,  as  a  Member  of   the

Opposition, to oppose - a fallacious theory  out  of

which I hope one day he will educate himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested that we should

slavishly  follow what England does. Now,  I  have

the  greatest  admiration for  many  of  England's

institutions and traditions of which not the least

is this very Assembly; but I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



suggest   that  we  have  problems  and  we   have

conditions  which  are  perhaps  just   a   little

different  from England, such as, for  example,  a

little island, an island of no more than about  90

square miles -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> 200 square

miles!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> 200 square miles! But I

think  you  will find that out of that  there  are

only 90 which can be utilised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Check your figures from your

Annual Report! Sir, I say in this small island  we

have  to support 1,200,000 people, and I trust  it

is  acknowledged  that  these  are,  human  beings

entitled   to  reasonable  homes  and   reasonable

accommodation,  both in earning  their  livelihood

and in their family life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar, speaking for the

investment  class,  says that immoveable  property

has been the soundest investment that we have ever

had.  Sir,  my  late father, for whom  I  had  the

highest regard at all times, used to tell me  that

in  Singapore  there were two  things  which  were

certain to go up. One was a balloon, and the other

was the price of land. I would ask you to look  no

further  than  my own home. In 1932 this  plot  of

land,  on  which  I  rent a house,  was  sold  for

$12,500. In 1939, without finding any gold  there,

that plot of land with the same house was sold for

$37,500 - only  three  times. In  1954,  I  had  the

temerity  to  suggest to my landlady  that  I  was

interested in purchasing the house. I was told  it

would  cost  a quarter of a million dollars!  What

had  been  done  to  that land? Neither  gold  nor

silver nor anything else was found there! But what

had  happened,  Sir, was that our  population  had

increased, and all a landowner has to do  in  this

country is to sit on his bottom, sit on his  title

deeds,  and  the price will go up! No  man  has  a

right  to hold society and posterity up to  ransom

to  satisfy his extraordinary lust and  greed  for

wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the price of land in this

territory  is something that is quite unbelievable

until you examine the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



evidence.  I  would  be only  too  happy  if  the

investors  were satisfied with a law, which  gave

them  a  five, or six per cent return; but,  Sir,

on  the  basis  of what we know has  occurred  in

this   territory,  landowners  expect  an  annual

return  of approximately 100 per cent.  It  is  a

very  modest return for these pathetic  gentlemen

for  whom  we weep today! In England, Sir,  there

is  enough  land  to satisfy  the  needs  of  its

population. In Singapore there is not,  and  what

there  is must be reasonably rationed; and in  so

far as this Government has any power, it will  be

reasonably  rationed,  and  there  will   be   no

crocodile  tears for those who have  indulged  in

such  fantastic exploitation of the  basic  needs

of humanity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation in England is of a totally

different character from that which we  seek.  It

is  true  that  we  ultimately  seek  a  complete

property  freeze as of the 22nd of  April,  1955.

Full  notice  of that has already been  given  in

His  Excellency's  speech on  that  date,  and  I

merely  repeat  it  by way of confirmation.  This

present   measure,  however,  is  a  modest   and

temporary  one that says, 'We will  take  nothing

from  you that you have got today. What the price

is  today, that you will receive; and if you have

made  any  improvements to your property  and  we

should require it for a public purpose, you  will

receive  the  full price. But we will  no  longer

accept   the  position  that,  because   of   the

pressure   of   population  and  the   consequent

pressure  of  demand which is  far  greater  than

supply,  you  should be able to  hold  us  up  to

ransom  and  demand  fantastic  profits  year  by

year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read, I think it was in March last, of a

very  prescient  gentleman who bought  some  land

near  Paya Lebar for $100,000. That was in  1954,

Sir,  and in 1955 he made the Government pay  him

$400,000 for the same piece of land! That is  the

type  of  gentleman for whom the Member for  Paya

Lebar  weeps, and asks us to join in mourning  as

we  kill  this body of speculators.  Let  us  get

this  clear: The red herring of the small man  is

nothing  but  a  red  herring.  Under  the   Land Acquisition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



Bill  that is before you, there can be no question

of  our  wanting  to  take  the  homes  that  have

recently  been built, and that are being owned  by

the  small man. Those homes have been approved  by

the  Singapore Improvement Trust and form part  of

our  development schemes, and it comes  ill,  Sir,

perhaps it was unintended, that this House  should

be  misled into thinking that this Bill could ever

cover  any question of acquisition of those  newly

built  houses. This Bill is intended  to  make  it

possible for Government in the name of the  people

to  take such lands for roads, for public building

as  may be necessary, in order to fulfil the needs

of  the people, without having to pay through  its

nose,  without  having to pay such fantastic  sums

that  Government, like the people of this country,

will be no longer able to utilise the land for its

primary purpose - the purpose of serving the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar asks us: but what

about  the  poor man who has to pay  his  mortgage

interest?  But  that  poor man,  Sir,  if  he  has

utilised  his  land  for the appropriate  purpose,

will  be  earning enough income to  pay  for  that

interest. We are not depriving him of any means of

earning his income. We are merely depriving him of

the  right to hold the people up to ransom. It  is

suggested that this is a restriction of the  right

of  free trade. This is a restriction of the right

to  highway robbery in which the people, for  whom

you weep, Sir, have been indulging for the last 50

years. I can but regret that the hon. Member,  who

considers  himself a responsible  Member  of  this

House, should find it possible to attack a Bill so

eminently  reasonable and so absolutely  necessary

for the welfare of the common man.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  Bill seeks to freeze the value of  lands  in

Singapore,  and is the third attempt made  by  the

Government of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first attempt was made in 1949. It was by a

Bill called the Singapore Development Bill, clause

212 (1) (a) of which attempted to freeze the value

of  land  acquired by Government from 1st December, 1949.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore, Sir, be allowed to quote the

opinion of very learned and responsible persons on

the  principle of freezing land values?  I  quote,

Sir, with your permission:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sub-section fixes the value of land for

the  purpose  of determining compensation  at  its

market  value on the 1st December, 1949, with  the

addition   of  the  value  of  certain   permitted

improvements. The object of this, we are told,  is

to  protect  "the  public"  against  inflation  of

values  in  land  dealings.  The  expression  "the

public" for this purpose means-"

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have it. Mr Chief Minister, what

is your point?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> My point, Sir, is that the

you see, Sir, that I should be given the right  to reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the Member for Telok Ayer is about

to  quote  something  which  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  said  sometime  ago.  Whether  that   is

"personal  conduct" or not I do not know.  I  have

not  heard what the hon. Member is going to quote;

but  if  it  is  a quotation which  perhaps  needs

explanation  by  the Hon. the Chief  Minister,  he

will  certainly be allowed a chance of  explaining

what he said on some other occasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.

There  is  nothing in what I say  about  "personal

conduct".  It  is only the valuable opinion  of  a

learned  gentleman  by  the  name  of  Mr  D.  S.

Marshall  that  I am quoting on a  very  important

subject - the freezing of land values in  Singapore.

I  am glad, and I want to hear - because my mind  is

quite open on -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member please continue

with his speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. To continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is desirable to protect these people against

undue  inflation of land values. We  are  doubtful

whether their interests are sufficiently protected

by  the sub-section as drafted. Although there may

be  a balance of probability that land values will

tend  to rise in Singapore so that the Board would

get land for less than its market value, there  is

at least a possibility that land values will fall.

There  is  no doubt that Singapore has experienced

since  the Liberation a prosperity that cannot  be

expected  to last forever. When this comes  to  an

end, it may have an adverse effect on land values.

If so what would the Board do? Purchase at a price

above the market? Abandon or delay development? Or

would  it  persuade the Government  to  amend  the

Ordinance  so as to reduce the value at  which  it

compulsorily  acquires land? Almost certainly,  it

would  adopt the last of these courses. Owners  of

property  are  entitled to proper  protection  and

this section appears to us to introduce a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



and    iniquitous   principle   whereby    partial

confiscation  is  cloaked by fixing  an  arbitrary

date of valuation for compensation which does  not

take  into consideration normal changes in  market

values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are bound to be cases where injustice will

result from the adoption of 1st December, 1949,  as

the  date  for  fixing market values.  There  have

already,   to   our   personal   knowledge,   been

transactions since that date at prices  in  excess

of those ruling on 1st December, 1949.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also draw attention to widespread

stagnation  in  land dealing, and consequently  in

private land development that must result from the

attempt  in  the  Development Board  Ordinance  to

freeze  land values at the level they had  reached

at  1st December, 1949. If land values are left  to

be  determined by the market, they may  go  up  or

they may go down: the one thing that is certain is

that they will not remain stationary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose in a free market land values would have

gone  up;  what  is the effect of  the  Ordinance?

People owning land that is acquired by the  Board

have  part  of their property expropriated.  Apart

from   the  manifest  injustice  of  this  another

consequence  ensues: people who might have  bought

land for private development, fear that if they do

so  the Board may prefer to develop it, and in the

process of acquiring it, inflict a loss on them of

the  difference between the market  value  at  the

date of acquisition and the value at 1st December,

1949. In short, people who might benefit Singapore

by  private development of land are deterred  from

doing  so.  We have already reached the conclusion

that  the  housing targets of the Board cannot  be

financed unless private builders are permitted and

are   given   every   possible  encouragement   to

undertake a large share of the work. It  is  clear

from  what we have said above that the attempt  to

freeze  land  values will tend  to  deter  private

builders  from  taking part  in  the  project.  We

consider  that  the  protection  of  the   Board's

operations  would  be achieved by  providing  that

land  is  to be acquired by the Board at its  fair

market  value  at  the date of  acquisition,  such

value  not to include any appreciation,  which  is

attributable only to the operations of the  Board.

In other words, landowners should receive the fair

market   value   of  their  land   excluding   any

extortionate increase arising from anticipation of

development by the Board. It may be difficult  but

it  should  be impossible to determine  such  fair

market values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions as to the value at which land is

acquired   would   result  in  the   Board   doing

practically  all  the future developments  of  the

Island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it impracticable for the citizens of a

free  country  to use their vision and  energy  in

developing  that  country, and to  assume  that  a

monopoly  of  these qualities is  possessed  by  a

handful  of  officials, is  not  only  unjust  but

absurd."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, this opinion has been

delivered by a body of learned persons whose names

I  have  already  quoted, Sir. It  will  be  most

interesting to hear what the Chief Minister has to

say  about  the  opinion  expressed  by  Mr D. S.

Marshall. My mind is quite open, and I would  like

to hear it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

hon.  Members here present no doubt are  aware  of

considerable public feelings against the  proposed

Land  Acquisition (Temporary Provisions) Bill  now

before  this  House. I would state at the  outset,

that   my  Party  is  not  opposed  to  "enforced"

acquisition  of  land  or property  by  Government

strictly  for public purpose, but will be  opposed

to such acquisition by Government for "commercial"

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of enforced acquisition by

Government  of  land for public  purpose,  a  Land

Acquisition   Ordinance  already   has   been   in

existence  for many years. The proposed Bill,  now

before this House, neither repeals nor amends  any

part  of the Ordinance, and the provisions are  in

part repugnant to the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, clause 3 of the proposed Bill

enables  acquisition by Government for a new  town

site. This is not for a public purpose. It enables

the Government to acquire land for the purpose  of

reselling it to private ownership in part or as  a

whole. Clause 3 further enables the Government  to

obtain  what  is in fact a statutory opinion  over

the  land to be acquired, but does not require the

Government to proceed with the acquisition nor  to

pay  for the land until the same is eventually and

actually  acquired.  Under such  circumstances,  a

piece of land may be rendered useless to the owner

as long as such option continues. This, I suggest,

is unjust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill, it is claimed, is necessary

in   order  to  enable  the  Master  Plan  to   be

implemented, but I am of the opinion that this  is

not  the case. In the first place, the Bill is  in

no  way  restricted in its scope to  dealing  only

with  those  cases in which the Master Plan  comes

into  question. In the second place, it should  be

asked what the real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



problems are which should be considered so far  as

the  Master  Plan  is  concerned.  These  may   be

summarised under three headings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To defeat speculation,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To prevent the public from having to pay

the landowner compensation for any "windfall"

which might accrue to him as a result of the

publishing of the zoning provisions of the Master Plan, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To ensure that in dealing with points (1) and (2), no injustice is inflicted upon the landowner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point (1) is already provided for by the

existing  legislation and it does not require  the

present  Bill to meet it. Point (2) is one,  which

could  be  easily  dealt  with  more  fairly   and

equitably  by a different form of legislation.  In

this  regard,  reference is made to  the  Minority

Report  published  by the Select Committee,  which

was  appointed  to  consider the Land  Acquisition

(Amendment No. 3) Bill, 1953. After reviewing  the

whole  problem,  three unofficial members  of  the

Committee  made  alternative  suggestions,   which

appear  to  be  fairer and more satisfactory  than

those,  proposed in the present Bill.  As  regards

point  (3),  it may be pointed out that,  if  land

values  rise during the next five years  for  some

reason  unconnected  with  the  Master  Plan,  the

landowner whose property is to be acquired is  not

going  to receive the fair value for his property.

It  is therefore extremely probable that the  Bill

will  result in serious injustice, which could  be

avoided by some alternative form of legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if it is the intention of Government to

freeze  values  of  land which  comes  within  the

Master Plan, it would be fairer and more just that

only values of such land should be frozen and  not

every   inch  of  the  entire  island!   In   this

connection,  it should be possible to publish  the

Master Plan simultaneously with the implementation

of  the  Ordinance.  It is difficult  to  see  any

justification  in freezing values of  property  or

properties which are not required by Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed Bill, certain points require

explanation and clarification. Under clause 2 (f),

"capital value" of buildings and improvements  is,

I  suggest, not capable of interpretation. Does it

mean  cost  or  a number of years purchase?  There

should be a definition to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, under the same sub-clause of the same

clause,  the phrase "buildings bona fide  erected"

sounds  nonsensical. Perhaps the draftsman has  in

mind some provisions similar to those contained in

section 25 (2) (a) of the existing Ordinance!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the true value of land is always bound

to fluctuate according to the operation of the law

of  supply  and demand, to the economic  condition

from  time to time, and to the true value  of  the

country's  currency. These natural processes  have

nothing whatever to do with the provision  of  any

Master  Plan, which may be produced by Government.

Any  attempt  to disregard them can  only  result,

over  such  a  lengthy period of  five  years,  in

producing highly unrealistic, artificial  "values"

for the lands affected. In the long run, this will

not  be  in  the  public interest and  will  cause

serious injustice. Furthermore, the effect of  the

proposed Bill may seriously discourage investments

in  land and landed properties. This, in fact,  is

already apparent in the recent lack of interest in

real estate investments after the announcement  of

the proposed legislation. Perhaps more careful and

exhaustive  consideration may  be  given  in  this

matter as a whole or at least improvements to  the

Bill itself should be made before legislation  may

be adopted.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I rise to

support the Bill. This Bill, Sir, has a very  long

history.  In  October  1953  my  hon.  Friend  the

Attorney-General  (Mr  E. J.  Davies)  introduced

into   the   then  Legislative  Council   a   Land

Acquisition (Amendment No. 3) Bill, the object  of

which was to stabilise land values and to effect a

few  minor  amendments to the original  Ordinance,

and  to  enable  the Master Plan to be  published.

Before the Second Reading of this Bill took place,

it  was referred to a Select Committee. For  about

nine months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



this  Committee  deliberated  on  this  Bill,  and

finally,  on  the  27th of July,  1954,  made  its

Report. It was not unanimous as was expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My attempt in December last year to force the

Bill  through all its remaining stages during  the

life  of the then Legislative Council failed,  and

the  then Government felt that the Bill should  be

passed  on  to  the  newly-elected  Government  of

Singapore which would have by then a clear mandate

from  the  people on the future of land policy  in

Singapore. Soon after the election, Sir, the newly

elected  Government made it quite  clear  that  it

would  seek  additional powers for the acquisition

of  land  for public purposes, and powers for  the

freezing of values of immoveable property. It also

declared  that  it was the firm intention  of  the

Government  to ensure that land was  used  in  the

best interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed glad, Sir that the first step

towards  this  process  has  now  begun  and   the

Government  has  now translated  its  policy  into

action. It is my considered view, Sir, that it  is

our  duty  to take urgent steps to make  provision

for the housing not only of the homeless of today,

who  live in extremely unhappy circumstances,  but

of  the  expected  increase in population  in  the

coming  years. We will be doing a great disservice

to   the  people  of  this  territory  if  we  are

complacent of our duty in this direction. The land

of the Colony is limited in amount, and on it must

be  found  suitable  space  for  such  major  land

projects    as   housing,   industry,   education,

agriculture, recreation and communications,  etc.,

for  our rapidly growing population. There can  be

no matter of more importance to the inhabitants of

Singapore than the land upon which they live, work

and  have their recreation, and the policy  should

be  so framed as to secure that each piece of land

is  used in a manner which will best serve various

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vested interests are apt to object to this Bill,

as  they have done in the past. They are  only  a

handful. Their objection is not unnatural as their

personal interests are involved, but I am sure,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  that all those who believe in Singapore  and

have consideration for the thousands of their less

fortunate  fellow citizens, who are  landless  and

are compelled by circumstances to live piled up in

hovels,  will  sacrifice their personal  interests

for  the  happiness of the community as  a  whole.

After all, all lands belong to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition (Temporary Provisions)

Bill, which is now the subject of discussion, aims

at  stabilising  land values in  the  Colony.  The

method  adopted is identical with that adopted  in

very  many  other  countries in  implementing  any

planning  scheme of this kind that we  have  here,

that  is, fixing the value of land at a date prior

to  the publication of that Master Plan. There may

be  an interregnum between the publication of  the

Master Plan and the time acquisition is necessary,

during  which land may change hands several  times

at  a  rocketing  price, and the aim  here  is  to

prevent  this  tendency. An upper price  limit  is

necessary in order to prevent exploitation at  the

expense  of the community on the land planned  for

development  in  accordance  with  the  needs  and

requirements  of the community. Sir, stabilisation

of  land  values is a prerequisite  to  successful

town and country planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan, Sir, is flexible and is subject

to  revision every five years. The fact  that  the

duration of the proposed legislation is also  five

years  should satisfy those objectors who  believe

that  the fixing of land values should not be  for

an  unlimited period. The directions to the Courts

in  determining the amount of compensation  to  be

awarded  and  the considerations  to  be  accepted

must,  I  think,  assure the  landlords  that  the

Government is not being unfair to their interests.

In  fact,  the  terms of compensation  are  indeed

liberal.  I am sure, Sir, that the landlords  will

realise  that it is essential that every piece  of

land  should  be  put  to  the  best  use  in  the

interests of the community, and that it cannot  be

treated  as an ordinary marketable commodity.  The

earlier  we give consent to this Bill, the  better

it  is  for our country and the people. I do hope,

Sir,  that  although some people might  object  to

this Bill, they will live to realise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



that  the implementation of this Master Plan  will

give  them  the joy and inspiration  of  seeing  a

happy and prosperous Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill under

consideration,   in   my   opinion,   is   not   a

satisfactory Bill because it does not provide  for

what everyone agrees needs to be provided. What is

needed, as my hon. Friend here has said, is a Bill

to  provide  that  any  increase  in  land  values

arising  from the Master Plan, or from development

by  and at the expense of Government, shall not be

added to the market value of land if acquired  for

public purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a simple Bill of this sort were introduced,

it   would  be  legislation  of  a  practical  and

realistic  kind, but the whole principle  of  this

Bill  is  entirely  different.  Under  this  Bill,

persons owning land, whether they be rich or poor,

are going to have burdened on them the cost of the

future  development of land and the  rest  of  the

community  is going to benefit. What is more,  can

the  Minister offer any guarantee that  this  Bill

will  not  result in more land deals  beneath  the

counter  than above it, with the effect of causing

more contempt than respect for the law? If he can,

I might be more willing to support him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in his speech in this House last

April,  said  that land-freezing  legislation  was

necessary if the Government is to keep its  pledge

of "improving the standard of living of the poorer

classes  and providing them with adequate low-cost

housing".  These  sentiments are well  understood,

but  what about the poor smallholders of land  and

the  effect  of this Bill upon them? How  can  you

draw  the line between the poor and the more well-to-do and give special consideration in some cases

without creating invidious distinctions in others?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to various clauses of the Bill, I wish

to make a few comments. Firstly, this is a Bill to

stabilise the value of land. This surely is really

a  misnomer. You cannot, in point of fact, fix the

value  of land. Land must always get more valuable

or  less valuable according to circumstances.  You

can  only, if you insist, fix its price,  but  can

control of price any more than rent control stamp



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



out  the  tea  money  racket? Leaving  terminology

aside, we should like to know under clause  2  (a)

whether  Government will pay  the  22nd  of  April

value of land even if the price has dropped lower,

and  the  events of the past four months  have  in

many  cases produced this situation. If Government

does this, paying more for the acquisition of land

than  the  current  value, public  money  will  be

wasted.  To avoid such waste, are we then to  find

the Government rushing through an amending Bill to

amend the 22nd of April date -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Wait till then!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - to a date more favourable to

them?  Such a situation breeds so much uncertainty

that  there  will be no dealings in land  whatever

and  there will not merely be a freeze in land but

a  deep  freeze.  I hope that we can  expect  some

explanation from the Minister on this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, under clause 2 (a), let me quote an

example  of  a person owning a piece of  land  who

dies, say, in August 1956. The trustees pay estate

duty on his property based on values prevailing in

August 1956, at, say, $3 a square foot. Before the

trustees  can dispose of this property, Government

acquires  it,  compensation  payable  under   this

Ordinance  being based on $2 a square foot,  being

the  market value on the 22nd of April, 1955.  Will

Government   refund   the  death   duty   on   the

difference, namely a dollar a square foot?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (f) seems to be most unsatisfactorily

drafted.  What  is  meant by "the  actual  capital

value"?  Is  this the actual cost at the  time  of

building,  without taking into  account  the  fact

that building costs can rise? And what is meant by

"bona  fide erected"? All buildings are bona  fide

erected in the sense that they are approved  first

by  the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust,  the  City

Council  or  the  Rural Board. But  if  Government

means  that owners might make improvements in  the

hope of getting better compensation at the time of

acquisition, this, I submit, is nonsense, because,

in  view  of the provision "less an allowance  for

depreciation", nobody is going to erect a $20,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



house  on land likely to be acquired if he  is  to

get only, say, $18,000 for it a short while later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this same clause 2 (f), what happens to

the  owner of a low-lying piece of ground who bona

fide has started earth-filling operations prior to

the 22nd of April 1955? Supposing $25,000 worth of

filling  has  been done before this date  and  the

balance  of  $10,000 afterwards. If the Government

acquires  this property in October 1955,  will  he

receive compensation for the $25,000 spent  before

the 22nd of April?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to clause 3, we find that Government will

be  able to acquire any area of land it pleases by

designating  such an area "as a  site  for  a  new

town". This gives the Government exceedingly  wide

powers  and makes all ownership of land  insecure.

And  governments have been known to  change  their

minds  before  now. Are we to see large  areas  of

land  acquired for new towns at the 22nd of  April

price,  plans later abandoned, and the  land  sold

again at a much enhanced price?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to another point, concerning the making-up of private roads. There are many owners - some

quite  poor  owners - who are frontagers on  private

roads  shortly  to be made up and  taken  over  as

public roads. These frontagers have to pay for the

making-up of their roads. They will also  have  to

pay  extra  assessment once the road is completed.

The annual value will increase as each new amenity

is   brought   within   their   reach,   such   as

electricity,  water  or  sewerage.  Despite   this

increased  valuation  and  extra  expenditure   on

rates,  will  the Government still  acquire  their

properties at the 22nd of April market value? Will

this  not  be  a  case of great  hardship,  indeed

injustice,  to  numbers of by no means  well-to-do

people living on private roads?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said, I hope, enough to show that

this  is  not a very desirable Bill in its present

form - vague, full of loopholes, made all  the  more

undesirable  if  it is to be pushed  through  this

House  without  proper  consideration.  I  repeat,

nobody wants to see speculation arising or special

advantage gained as a result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



of  the publication of the Master Plan; but a much

simpler  Bill than the present one is all that  is

needed  to  see  that this is  prevented,  and  to

prevent  an  otherwise inevitable black-market  in

land transactions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer

(Mr R. Jumabhoy) in his speech just now said that

this  is  the  third time that the Government  has

tried  to impose a Land Freeze Bill on the public.

It  is utter nonsense, Sir. This is the first time

that this Government is introducing a Bill in  the

interests  of the public. The two other times,  in

1949  and 1953, I think - I may be wrong, but anyway

those  are  the years - were attempts made  by  past

administrations, and they were frustrated  because

of  the  presence of the so-called representatives

of   the  people,  as  represented  by  the  Party

opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer in his speech read out

a  statement  attributed to Mr  D.  S.  Marshall,

together with a few other names. I will follow his

style,  and will therefore read newspaper  reports

in  connection with what Mr Marshall said  before

Mr  Marshall ever thought of even contesting  the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday Standard of January 31, 1954 - there was

no thought of election in his mind then:



<br><div align="center"><b>"LAND-OWNERS' PROFITS WOULD SHOCK THE DEVIL!</b></div><br>



<br><div align="center"><b>Marshall backs Acquisition Bill</b></div><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The history of profits made by landowners over

the  past  50  years  and the exclusion  of  small

income groups from possession, or even rental,  of

a  bit  of roof will 'shock the conscience of  the

Devil'  charged  Mr D. S. Marshall,  a  prominent

member  of  the Singapore Ratepayers'  Association

yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Championing land acquisition, Mr Marshall said

that  the attack on the Colony's Bill was  not  by

small  landlords, but "exclusively by  individuals

and  groups owning land by the hundreds  of  acres

and houses by the dozen and who utilised such land

exclusively for personal profit."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing I wish to make clear to the

public  is  that  this  Bill  does  not  seek   to

stabilise  land  values.  All  it  seeks   is   to

stabilise the price, which Government will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



have  to pay for land which it may acquire in  the

future for public purposes", he pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall emphasised that transactions

between private individuals and organisations were

not affected. "The Master Plan", he said, "will be

providing  satellite  towns to  'siphon'  off  the

dreadful overcrowding in the city." He added  that

for  these satellite towns Government must acquire

land for roads, schools, police stations, swimming

pools,  civic  centres  and  other  amenities.  If

Government had to pay the increased price  brought

about  by  the publication of the Master Plan  and

the   pressure  of  increasing  population,  these

satellite    towns   would    be    rendered    an

impossibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Mr Marshall explained, sought to pay

the  maximum price of October 1953, which, in  his

opinion,  was a very high price indeed. "Where  is

the  confiscation?  Where is  the  suffering?"  he

asked.  He added, "The Bill is timid. It does  not

go  anywhere near far enough. There should  be  an

immediate  overall freezing of all land values  so

that human beings of today and of posterity may be

able  to  afford  a bit of roof over  their  heads

without  having to pay ransom to owners  of  land,

not  by 100 per cent but by thousands and tens  of

thousand per cent."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall then explained his stand in the

Singapore  Ratepayers'  Association.  "I  was   in

Kuantan when the Association, on an urgent 48-hour

notice,  called  an  emergency  meeting  to   seek

approval of a memorandum to the Colonial Secretary

in  respect  of  the Land Acquisition  Bill."  Mr

Marshall   immediately  sent  the  Association   a

telegram in which he expressed disapproval of  any

condemnation  of  the principle of  freezing  land

values.  "With a rapidly growing population  in  a

limited   area",  the  telegram  stated,  "healthy

development  required restrictions on  uninhibited

exploitation  by land-owners. There is  no  sacred

right  to hold posterity up to highway robbery  in

return  for  the  opportunity  of  a  roof.   When

requested to weep for land-owners look back  fifty

years and their swollen profits look forward fifty

years   and   the  growing  legions  of   wretched

homeless", the telegram added.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting of the Singapore Ratepayers'

Association  held  on  November  11,  1953, by  a

majority vote decided to condemn the Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in reply, Sir, to what the Member for

Telok  Ayer has said in connection with the  stand

of  Mr Marshall on the Land Freeze Bill. I  would

like,  Sir, with your permission to quote extracts

from  a  joint memorandum to the Chairman  of  the

Select Committee of the Legislative Council on the

Acquisition of Land (Amendment No. 3) Bill,  1953,

in  which Mr Marshall is a signatory. I  find  it

necessary because this is in reply to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



attack from the Member for Telok Ayer  -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order, Mr R. Jumabhoy?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I never attacked anyone. I

only asked the opinion of Mr Marshall now as  the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim Yew Hock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he attacked

by insinuation. In a memorandum to the Chairman of

the Select Committee on the Acquisition of Land

(Amendment No. 3) Bill, 1953, Mr Marshall stated

the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have followed the controversy over the

principle introduced by Section 9 of the Bill, and

are  all  too  conscious of some of the  one-sided

representations made to you by interested  parties

whose occupation it is to make profits out of land

and who could, and did, give considerable time and

spend money on legal advice and representation  to

present their sectional view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of us is a domiciled British subject keenly

interested in the welfare of this Colony and  with

no  axe whatever to grind in the matter now before

you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We view the provisions of this Bill against the

background of certain basic factors: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Colony is a very small island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There is living on this small Island a

population  of  more  than 1,100,000,  and  it  is

reliably anticipated that this population will  be

doubled by internal expansion in 20 years, so that

in  that  period we have to find room for  another

1,100,000  people  in  the  limited  area  at  our

disposal  after  making  provisions  for   defence

requirements, catchment areas, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) This intensive internal increase of

population  within  so  limited  a  space  is,  we

believe, a phenomenon unparalleled elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The price of land during the past 50 years

principally  as  a  result  of  the  pressure   of

increasing population has risen fantastically, and

landlords have reaped and are reaping profits  out

of  all proportion to even commercial concepts  of

reasonable returns on capital outlay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objection to the principle as such of

profit  making  on  however  large  a  scale,  and

rejoice  with whoever discovers gold  and  diamond

mines,   or   wins  a  lottery,  or  perfects   an

invention,  but where uninhibited exploitation  of

the  law  of  supply  and demand  precludes  human

beings from utilising, basic necessities of  life,

then, in our view,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



such   uninhibited  exploitation  for  prohibitive

profits  is  a  public evil, and such  anti-social

conduct should be controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) It is apparent to us that the conduct of

landowners   in  exploiting  to  its  utmost   the

considerable  demand for land due to  pressure  of

population   is  directly  responsible   for   the

horrible  state  that exists in certain  areas  in

this  Colony of a thousand human beings  per  acre

piled  up in wretched cloth cubicles. Such conduct

is   also   directly  responsible  for  the   very

unhealthy  position that exists of only a  handful

of  domiciled  persons owning their own  homes  in

this Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The doctrine of freedom of action of

individuals   is   accepted  by  all   responsible

persons, including the objectors to this Bill,  as

being limited within the framework of the good  of

the  whole;  and  we  have at all  times  had  the

protection of the Courts in the enforcement of the

Criminal  Law to prevent the freedom of action  of

the  individual from being exercised in  abuse  of

the good of the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectors to this Bill, however, seem to

consider  that  the  principle  of  limitation  of

freedom of action within the framework of the good

of  the  whole is not applicable to the realms  of

commercial   economics   and   particularly    not

applicable to landowners who seemingly  have  some

sacred  right  to freedom of action  in  unimpeded

exploitation irrespective of the detriment to  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot accept this contention, nor do we

believe   has  it  ever  been  accepted   by   any

Government  at  any  time in the  history  of  the

world,  and  it  is  our hope  to  prove  in  this

memorandum, that such alleged right to uninhibited

exploitation should not be permitted to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) It is our considered view that it is the

duty  of responsible Government in this Colony  to

take  urgent  steps to-day to make provisions  for

the  housing, not only of the homeless  of  to-day

who  live  piled up in foetid hovels, but  of  the

anticipated increase of population in the next  20

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) We sincerely believe that the possession of

a  home and a place to work in is one of the basic

needs  of  a  human  being, and an  economy  which

requires human beings to live and work in wretched

circumstances, which the objectors  to  this  Bill

would  not  permit their dogs to be subjected  to,

will  create  antagonistic rebellious  anti-social

elements.  The  potential danger of not  providing

housing  for  the  population is  very  great  and

especially for the type of persons who  object  to

this  Bill. It is unfortunate they cannot see,  in

their  own personal interests, that, there  should

be some limitation to the uninhibited exploitation

which  is  the dragon's teeth they sow  and  which

will  reap  for them and the rest of  the  country

grave retribution in the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer to appeal to you on the wider basis of

elementary justice to human beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Within this view of the needs of the

domiciled  people  of this country,  the  aim  and

effect of the Bill is extremely limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we understand it the Government, in common

with  all  persons with any acquaintance  of  land

values, is satisfied that there will inevitably be

a  considerable increase in the price of land  due

to increase of population in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we understand that there is a

Master Plan for the development of this Island, to

relieve the dreadful pressure of the homeless  for

housing,  and  that the publication of  this  Plan

awaits the coming into force of the provisions  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We furthermore understand the Government is

satisfied  that  the  publication  of  this   Plan

showing  areas required for particular development

will  immediately  affect  land  values.  This  is

strenuously denied - "



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I think the Minister

has  possibly said quite enough in explanation  of

the  memorandum that was read, unless, of  course,

he  is adopting those views as his own opinion  on

this particular Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I share the same opinion, Sir;

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is the last sentence, Sir



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" - This is strenuously denied by the objectors,

but  we  accept  it  as  logical  and  empirically

valid."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as late as January and

February  of  1954,  before  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  ever thought of contesting the election,

he  already  held  such views.  Now  that  we  are

returned to serve the people as a Labour Coalition

Government, we were returned with a mandate to see

that  the  Land Acquisition (Temporary Provisions)

Bill becomes law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have this morning heard from the Opposition

Members their views that although they support the

Bill, because they feel that they cannot object to

the Bill, they raise various points which make one

think  that  their support for the  Bill  is  just

sheer  nonsense. The Member for Telok  Ayer,  Sir,

has said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



that  two  attempts  failed.  These  two  attempts

failed  because  of  similar  tactics  adopted  by

members  of  the  same Party during  the  previous

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has, in his reply to

the  Member  for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon  Teck),

covered almost every objection that can be  raised

against  this Bill. Are we to look after the  poor

and needy, or are we to look after the handful  of

rich  landowners who do nothing but suck from  the

poor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some 2,000

years ago or more there was in China a utilitarian

philosopher  called Ho Kuan-tze, and  I  recollect

one  of  his sayings which seems to me  highly  in

point  in this debate. He said, "Seek nothing  for

yourself.  Only  what is for the general  good  is

permissible." If we apply this to land policy,  it

will  have most far-reaching effects; and  it  has

been applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, you can say that there has been

through  recorded history a struggle  between  the

powers  that  sought to treat land  as  the  basic

necessity  for  human life and therefore  a  thing

which  must be shared equally and fairly, and  the

people  who say that land is a basic necessity  of

life, and we will grab it and exploit our position

and  compel people to pay the maximum rent for  it

that  we  can extract. That has been  a  long  and

historical struggle, and you will find  traces  of

it  in  the  laws of England. The original  theory

there was that land was held in trust, not for the

purpose of private profit exploitation, but when a

man  had  proved himself to be a good  and  worthy

servant  of the King, he then received a grant  of

land  which was held in trust in relation  to  his

past  and  future services. He was  not  there  to

exploit  the  land, but to use it as  a  means  of

service.  You can find the same idea in  my  small

reading  in the subject in India and in Egypt,  in

China   and  in  the  Western  European  countries

generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that land is not a proper commodity

for  trade  at  all. I know that  Members  of  the

Opposition  will very much resent that view.  They

feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is a highly proper commodity  for  trade

because   it  is  extremely  profitable.   It   is

profitable to the individual, but it is disastrous

to  the  community. I expect nearly  everybody  in

this  Chamber knows what a traffic block  is,  and

the whole basis of our traffic blocks in Singapore

is    uncoordinated   development    by    private

individuals  on  the basis of profit.  Instead  of

having  your streets developed as traffic arteries

down  which  traffic flows, they are developed  as

trading  centres in which people  are  seeking  to

exploit preferential positions; and as a result of

that  attempt  at exploitation, you  have  streets

obstructed  and  blocked,  and  it  is   extremely

difficult for vehicles to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same sort of way, I expect many of you

look  at  your  consolidated bills from  the  City

Council,  and  say,  'Well,  that  is  an  awfully

expensive bill.' It would be a great deal  cheaper

if  the  town  had  been  planned  as  an  overall

development instead of being developed by  private

enterprise  for private profit. The cost  of  your

City Council, both in its capital cost and in  its

recurrent  expenditure, derives very largely  from

having  to  lay their underground pipes  and  that

kind  of  thing  through  a  maze  of  ill-planned

streets and unco-ordinated development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had some pitiful words about the

hardship of the man who owns a little bit of land.

In  many  cases, it may be true, and the Hon. the

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing

is  perfectly aware of it. He has referred to  the

possibility  of  there being hard  cases  of  that

kind,   and   has  said  they  will  get   special

treatment. But I would like to point out  to  hon.

Members  opposite that a small piece of  land  can

still  be extremely valuable. A piece of land  the

size of a badminton court down in this part of the

town  will have a much greater value in the market

than  a  very large area of land in the middle  of

the  Sahara desert. It is not the size of the land

that  necessarily produces its exploitable  value,

but it is its position. When files come across  my

desk in my office, I am continually seeing how the

overall  development, one service or  another,  is

held up by the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



somebody  is  sitting on a piece of  land  and  he

cannot  be  moved; and when you want to move  him,

you  find that somebody else is sitting on another

piece of land and you cannot move A to B because B

will  not  get  to  C.  The  public  interest   is

continually  obstructed by people  who  have  some

sort of tenancy right; they just sit there and you

cannot  move them out. It is absolutely essential,

if  you  are  going  to get development  that  can

possibly  cope  with  a population  coming  up  to

2,000,000,  that you should have very wide  powers

indeed - powers  both to secure land when  necessary

and  see  that  the  small  man  does  not  suffer

hardship  as  a result. When you have to  transfer

the  small man from one piece of land in order  to

get a new road, you may have to put him on another

piece of land. You are not going to pay some  rich

landlord  a very large sum before you can transfer

your squatters there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede), I think, said

that he did not object to the principle that there

should be no profit made out of increases in value

arising  from  the Master Plan,  but  he  did  not

apparently object to people making profits out  of

a rise in population. A population increase is the

essential  thing  that will  produce  higher  land

values,  and the man who makes profit out of  that

factor  is  like  a fireman who  would  refuse  to

rescue  a  baby from a fire until he had extracted

the  last  possible dollar from the parents  as  a

sort of reward. The situation is that we are going

to   have  an  increasing  slum  population,   and

everything  that  blocks the provision  of  proper

homes  for these people is a horrible exploitation

of the misery of hundreds of thousands of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other points which he raised which I

think  perhaps could be dealt with more profitably

in  the  Committee stage of the Bill, but  he  did

note    various    complications   which    arise,

particularly  from  the  bad  inheritance  of  the

past - private roads for example. There are  private

roads  in  Singapore that are a shocking blot  and

disgrace,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



not to the Government or the City Council, but  to

the  landlords.  Very often, they managed  to  get

through  ill-co-ordinated  plans  and  they   also

managed  to  get  people to buy  a  house  in  the

expectation of a road going through, and they left

the  road  as  a morass instead. They did  nothing

about it. I do not think, therefore, that you  can

rightly  raise the bad practices of the  past  and

say,  because  these  foolish  complications  have

risen  up  through the errors of the past,  proper

planning for the future cannot be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one final quotation that I will make,

not  from 2,000 years ago, but from I think it  is

at  the end of 1950 or the beginning of 1951. I do

not  recollect  the  date  perfectly,  but  I   do

recollect  the  words.  It was  a  United  Nations

Commission  that  came to this happy  island,  and

they remarked, when they left: "Singapore is being

strangled  in an iron ring of landlords and  land-owners": and it is that iron ring that has  to  be

broken.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I  expected  opposition  from  the  Benches

opposite me, particularly from the Members of  the

Progressive Party. I have always maintained,  Sir,

that apart from representing themselves, they also

represent that section of the community, which has

always thought of themselves more than they  think

of others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us today, Sir, was published

almost  two  months ago, but no attempt  was  made

either by the Members of the Progressive Party  or

the  Democratic  Party, or  for  that  matter  any

representative of the land trade in Singapore,  to

submit their opinions and their criticisms to  me.

As  I  see it, Sir, their action today is  nothing

short  of an attempt to stifle this Bill, just  as

their  predecessors in the previous administration

had  stifled  other Bills that would have  brought

great  benefit to the vast majority of the  people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I propose to commit the Bill to a

Committee of this House, I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



intend to reply point by point to the objections

raised by the Opposition. These will be dealt with

in the Committee stage if they are brought up again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not

know  whether I can open my remarks by saying  how

welcome it is to see you in that seat!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Thank you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I shall have to take up a great

deal  of the time of the House with this Bill.  It

is  simple  and  non-contentious,  and  thoroughly

amiable  in  character. It derives from  the  fact

that  we  have  on the streets of  Singapore  some

50,000 or 60,000 deadly weapons which people take

around  with them and from time to time kill  each

other with. These are the motorcars, and whilst it

is  perhaps fair enough that one adult should kill

another  with  his  motorcar,  it  is  right  that

children should be protected if they can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to ensure that, where

you have numbers of children moving at fixed times

across  the road, there should be adequate control

to  ensure that they are protected. As a  motorist

myself,  I  think that motorists also will  derive

some  protection,  and they will  no  longer  have

miniature Belles of St. Trinian's trotting  across

the  road  in  front of their wheels  and  scaring

their hearts into their mouths!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third advantage to be derived from the Bill is

that  it  will  set free some of our  hard-working

Police Force from tedious and onerous duties which

are  not really part of their job, and which  will

enable  them to devote themselves more effectively

to policing this city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need say more about this Bill,

Mr  Deputy Speaker, except that I will  certainly

welcome   any   suggestions  or  improvements   or

amendments,  which can be brought  to  it  in  the

Committee stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  do  not rise to criticise the Bill.  This

legislation is long overdue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice, however, in the Objects and Reasons

attached to this Bill the following sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An estimate of the probable cost of the scheme

would be subject to a wide margin of error but, on

the  basis of present plans, it is expected to  be

of the order of $55,000 per year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very interesting as far as it goes, but

is  it not an innovation to introduce this type of

information   in  the  Objects  and  Reasons?   It

certainly is not an object, nor is it a reason.  I

suspect it is an interloper! [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

this House has a happy faculty of denoting support

by  keeping silent! I notice that nobody wishes to

speak,  and  I feel that this occasion should  not

pass  without an expression of appreciation for  a

Bill  that  has been suggested to have  been  long

overdue,  and one, which would be very helpful,  I

feel, to the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the minor criticism indicated by the

hon.   Mr  Sutherland,  it  was  put  in  because

Government  was  of  the view  that  perhaps  hon.

Members  would wish to know how much this  service

would  cost, and however worth while  it  may  be,

they  may want to balance it against the  cost  to

the  people. I quite agree that from the  purist's

point  of  view,  it is neither an  object  nor  a

reason,  but  it is information which  we  thought

might  be  helpful  to  hon. Members  in  deciding

whether they would wish to support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the Bill is a  good  one  and  the

Government  Benches  must  be  congratulated   for

bringing this along, but I would like to have  one

point  of  information. Under  this  Bill,  school

children  are  now authorised to do traffic  duty.

That  would  be  the  duty  of  regular  paid  men

employed by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that people who are in the service of the

Government  should  receive  compensation  if  any

misfortune  should occur to them while  performing

their  duty.  I do not say that it is likely  that

school  children would be mowed down by cars,  but

there is always this possibi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



lity when doing traffic duty. For that reason, Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I would like to know whether

the   Minister  for  Communications  has  provided

compensation for such an eventuality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it

would  perhaps be quite right if I gave  the  hon.

Mr  Sutherland what the details of  this  $55,000

are  approximately. If anybody wants to know them,

he  can  get them any time he wants to.  It  is  a

matter  of  top-boots and coats and  things  like

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of compensation: if a patrol is

knocked  down  by  a  car,  compensation  is   not

included  in the Bill most certainly, but  as  the

person  would  normally be a Government  employee,

presumably there will be adequate arrangements  to

meet this eventuality. This can be looked into. It

does not affect the principle of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not envisaged that traffic patrols should

be school children, though it would, of course, be

possible. The wording is "person". In fact, it  is

more likely that fairly elderly people who are not

up  to  heavy work and could still earn  a  useful

little  addition to their income  in  their  spare

time,  and probably people who are living anywhere

near  the  schools, who could have an  opportunity

for this employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Singapore  sends  fraternal  greetings  and  good

wishes to the Federal Legislative Council and the

people of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dawn of this new era in the political

history  of  the separated parts of this  Malayan

territory   we   of  the  Singapore   Legislative

Assembly look forward to the closest co-operation

and  co-ordination  with the Federal  Legislative

Councillors in building up a Malayan outlook  and

loyalty and in the achievement of our common aims

for freedom, economic security and social welfare

of  the peoples of this territory, and extend  to

our  brothers across the Straits our good  wishes

for their success in the way ahead."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 31st of August, 1955, is a day of great

rejoicing for our brothers across the Straits.  On

that  day, by the inaugural meeting of the Federal

Legislative  Council, a new era  will  dawn  which

must     inevitably    culminate    in    complete

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the Federation, by their massive

voting attendance unparalleled, in so far as I  am

aware,  in any other democratic country, by  their

unique   unity   and   their   intransigent   non-communalism, have dramatically demonstrated  their

inflexible will to independence and their capacity

for independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day of rejoicing, Sir, for the people of

the   Federation  is  a  day  of  inspiration  and

rejoicing for us. Whatever misunderstandings there

may  be  today  or  tomorrow - and misunderstandings

there can be even between loving brothers - our fate

in  Singapore is inextricably woven with  that  of

the Federation, and I would not have it otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I know of the policy of Her Majesty's

Government,  I  believe that  the  Federation  and

Singapore   will  march  together  towards   self-government   and   together   we   will    achieve independence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two territories, joined by a short

causeway, are a geographical, economic and  ethnic

entity.  Political  unity  is  essential  for  our

mutual welfare. In so far as lies in my power, the

door  on  this  side will remain permanently  wide

open for the achievement of a political unity that

alone can make possible real independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every stage of our political development in

Singapore, I envisage the closest and friendliest

co-operation and co-ordination in all  aspects  of

major  policy and legislation between us, because,

to  the extent, Sir, that we drift apart, to  that

extent shall we be weakened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Federal Legislative Councillors, on

behalf of my colleagues and myself, I say you have

our warm and sincere good wishes and our boundless

goodwill. To the Federation I say 'Merdeka!'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has already

explained  to us how the political development  of

Singapore and of the Federation of Malaya is woven

in  such  a  pattern that we must  march  together

towards  self-government and towards independence.

It  is therefore most fitting that, when they have

the  inaugural meeting on the 31st of  August,  we

should  send  fraternal greetings to our  brothers

across the Straits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I, on

behalf  of  my  Party and myself,  would  like  to

associate  ourselves with this motion. Indeed,  we

send to the Federation our best greetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a big step forward. The Federation of

Malaya  is  now  embarking on the  road  to  self-government. We know that the Federation Government

will  lead  the people on to peace and prosperity,

and  we  hope, and with it our prayer,  that  from

this  constitutional step they will  work  towards

self-government and independence.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Southern Islands):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand to

support the motion of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



Chief  Minister.  This is the first  time  in  the

history of Malaya that elections have taken place.

We wish them every success and may they proceed on

the  road towards independence justly proud of the

inheritance of all free countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> I should

like  to  take this opportunity, on behalf  of  my

Party,  to  associate myself  with  all  the  kind

things that have been said in this Assembly on the

occasion  of the inaugural meeting of the  Federal

Legislative Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today on the threshold of events leading

to  self-government  and  independence,  and  look

forward  to  closer co-operation with the  Federal

Legislative Council on matters of common  interest

to both territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party wishes the Federal Legislative Council

every  success in its future and associates itself

with  the  greetings that have  been  extended  by

Members  of  this  Assembly to their  friends  and

colleagues in the Federal Legislative Council.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   wish  to  associate  myself  with   the

sentiments  expressed  by the  Chief  Minister  in

extending  the hand of friendship to  the  Federal

Legislative Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As leader of the Alliance in Singapore, I take

great  pride  in the fact that the composition  of

the Federal Legislative Council is symbolic of the

understanding  the peoples of the Federation  have

in  their  elected representatives.  I  wish  them

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and the Federation of Malaya are on

the  threshold  of a new era, an era  fruitful  of

prospects of self-government and independence.  My

only  hope  is  that some day  in  the  very  near

future,  we in this Assembly may be able to  stand

and   extend  and  receive  greetings   from   the

Federation  of  Malaya  as  free  and  independent

nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  allow  me to associate my Party  and  myself

with this motion. The people of the Federation  of

Malaya  and the people of Singapore are more  than

brothers. They are part of the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



body.  Our common goal is independence. Therefore,

the victory of the people of the Federation is our

victory.  Without them, independence for Singapore

is impossible.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I, on behalf of the workers  of  the

Naval  Base  and  the people of  Sembawang,  fully

associate  ourselves with this  motion  which  has

just been moved by the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I must say it is in some ways inadequate,

nobody can believe that Singapore is not a part of

Malaya. We are only separated because of a  tricky

history.  Many of us look forward to the day  when

our  country  will  be  united  and  free.  It  is

regrettable that this aspiration of the people  is

not  included  in  the message. I  think  that  we

should,  in  our message, express our  desire  for

unity  and not just for co-operation only.  It  is

inadequate  just  to  extend  our  hands  in   co-

operation  across the Straits of Johore.  What  we

really  want is that the Straits of Johore  should

cease  to be a political boundary. This is  surely

one of the important objectives towards which both

the  Legislatures should work. What more opportune

moment  can we get to state this than the occasion

of the inauguration of the Federal Legislature?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should

like  to associate myself warmly with this message

of goodwill and greetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very nearly 21 years since I first came to

this  country  as a very young and shy  man,  and,

since  that time. I may say that I have made  very

many  friends  amongst  the  generous  and  kindly

people  of Malaya, that I have set down  my  roots

and have established myself as a Malayan, and that

I  look  forward with great happiness to the  most

fruitful  co-operation and ultimate  unity  between

the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that our message, however, should

carry   the  word  'unity'  as  though   we   were

attempting to give directions to the Federation. I

do  not  need  to talk in terms of  which  is  the

senior partner, I hope, on an occasion like this;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



but they are, anyhow, a larger geographical entity

with a very much larger population. It is not  for

us  to convey to them any implied directions as to

what  should be done. That is a matter  for  their

good  judgment  and  ours,  working  in  brotherly

harmony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not

intended to speak on this motion but, in case  any

silence  might  be interpreted as  disapproval,  I

should  like  to say that I, too, as  a  nominated

Independent,  associate myself with  this  motion,

with  particular emphasis on the phrase  'economic

security'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let  no one imagine that since I am speaking

last  in  my  Party,  it is  a  case  of  backseat

driving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support, in the warmest possible terms, the

greetings  that  we  are sending  to  the  Federal

Legislative  Council. It is an historic  occasion,

because,   with  this  Council,  a  new  political

situation of intense interest opens up. It  is  in

the  Federation  more than in Singapore  that  the

final    battle    between   the   British,    the

nationalists, and the Communists will  be  fought,

and won, or lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is comforting to us here to remember that,

whatever  mistakes we may have made and may  make,

they  will  not  be fatal. A very  far  from  weak

British   administration  is  manipulating,   very

delicately  and  very skilfully,  the  upsurge  of

nationalism that has caused the emotional  fervour

which  nationalism means today in  Malaya,  as  it

indeed  means  in  every  part  of  Asia.  It   is

negotiating with skill between the U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-M.I.C.  Alliance,  which has taken  over  part  of

constituted authority, and the armed forces  of  a

militant Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next three months are exciting because

they are potent with decisive developments. Is the

shooting going to go on? Is it going to stop?  If

it  stops,  what then? These are questions,  which

every  one  of  us asks ourselves. These  are  the

questions  which will decide not only  how  Malaya

goes,  but  how  Singapore goes in the  next  four

years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister of the Federation is a very

different  man  from  our  own  illustrious  Chief

Minister. He is a much more quiet and a much  more

amiable  gentleman.  He is a  gentleman  in  every

sense  of the word. As one historian on the Malays

has  said:  'Nature's perfect gentlemen'.  Of  the

Tunku, speaking for myself, I would say: 'He is  a

perfect gentleman.' And he has got, what I am sure

our  Chief Minister must envy him, an enormous and

efficient  Party machine. He has got the undoubted

support - and no one challenges that - of  some  three

million Malays in the Federation -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And Chinese!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and Chinese -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And Indians!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and Indians, and it is

important and exciting to see how things will turn

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we should send them not

just  our  warm  and heartfelt  greetings  but  an

assurance  that,  in their fight for  'Merdeka' - an

independent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya -  we

are solidly behind them.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of

my  Party,  I  would sincerely like  to  associate

ourselves  with this motion and gladly extend  our

warmest  greetings  to  our  brothers  across  the

Straits.  Once  again,  we congratulate  them  for

their unique success in the recent elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to, nemine

contradicente.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Speaker do convey to Mr Speaker of the

Federal  Legislative Council the following message

of  greetings  and good wishes for  the  inaugural

meeting of the Federal Legislative Council:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this historic occasion, the Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MESSAGE OF APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE TO MALCOLM MACDONALD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

privilege  today once more to give  expression  to

the voice of the people and, in this instance,  to

express   the  appreciation  of  the   people   of

Singapore for what Malcolm MacDonald has  been  to

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confess, Mr Speaker, I find it most difficult

and    embarrassing    to    praise    a    friend

publicly - particularly  if  that  friend  is  still

alive  and  walking on his hands. When  perplexed,

Sir, I usually seek the counsel of precedent but I

have,  in  this instance, been unable to find  any

guide. The Clerk of the Assembly, very learned  in

the  lore of Parliaments, has assured me  that  he

knows of no instance in which a Parliament has  so

honoured  a  man who is alive and a  man  who  has

never  been a Member of the Legislature that seeks

to  honour him. But if the motion is unique, it is

because the man is unique, Sir, and his uniqueness

lies  in this - that he is a warm human being  whose

humanity has transcended the pomp and the ceremony

of  his  exalted  position,  and  has  melted  the

icicles  of  protocol that traditionally  surround

the Sons of Heaven who rule us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find, Sir that I have referred in my motion to

Malcolm  MacDonald.  This  is  not  because  I  am

unaware that he has been a Secretary of State  for

the  Colonies,  and  a Privy  Councillor,  and  is

therefore  a right honourable; nor am  I  unaware,

Sir,   that   he   is   Her   Majesty's   foremost

representative  in  this territory  and  therefore

entitled  to  the honorific of Excellency.  It  is

simply  because  to us in Singapore,  the  man  is

immeasura-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



bly  greater than all his richly deserved honours.

When  he received the Freedom of the City - I  think

it  was last week - Malcolm MacDonald threatened  to

exercise the privilege of a birthday boy by coming

in  his  birthday suit. And it is in his  birthday

suit  as  plain  Malcolm MacDonald  that  we  have

enjoyed knowing him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 9½ years, this man has been with us, holding

the  highest office in the territory and  yet, he

has   been   at   all  times  the  humblest,   the

friendliest,  the  most  courteous  of   all   the

expatriates. It does seem a little unfair to refer

to  him  as  an expatriate, for if any  man  is  a

universalist, Malcolm MacDonald is certainly  one.

Despite  the  twinge of nostalgia  with  which  he

might  greet the call of the bagpipes,  he  is  at

home  everywhere, because he loves  human  beings,

and  differences  of  colour  and  differences  of

custom merely make them more interesting to a  man

big  enough to love all humanity. Sir, it is as  a

man  who  loves his fellow-men and who  recognises

the  equal  brotherhood of all human  beings  that

Malcolm MacDonald has succeeded in being a one-man

civilising  factor  of  colonial  rule   in   this

territory  at  a crucial stage of our development.

As the most delightful speaker we have ever known;

as an ardent supporter of our national sport; as a

judicious and generous patron of our artists; as a

gay   friend,  a  wise  counsellor  and   a   most

unconventional   ambassador,   he   has   been   a

refreshing humanising force in an era of hidebound

officialdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political activities of this laughing

diplomat,  as  the Straits Times so happily  calls

him,  are  the well-kept secrets of Phoenix  Park,

but  I  have had glimpses of this man, so much  at

home  in a bevy of lovely women, working arduously

and  tirelessly through long hours at  affairs  of

state. I believe, and I say this in all sincerity,

that  his  efforts have been consistently directed

to  help us to stand on our own feet - a free and  a

happy  people. I am satisfied, Sir,  that  in  the

recent constitutional crisis, his experience,  his

wisdom  and  his love for the people of Singapore,

were  material  factors in  assisting  us  in  our

legitimate aspirations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this man on the eve of his departure to wider

pastures, I ask that this Assembly, in the name of

the  people  of  Singapore, should  say:  "Malcolm

MacDonald, it has been good knowing you - Selamat Jalan and Selamat Kembali!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we the members of the Singapore Legislative Assembly, on behalf of the people of Singapore,

do  place  on record in the following  terms  our

recognition  of the unique services  rendered  to

Singapore   by  Malcolm  MacDonald  as  Governor-General,  and  then  as Commissioner-General  for

the United Kingdom in South-East Asia: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holding the highest office among Her Majesty's

representatives in South-East  Asia,  you  have

interpreted your duty to represent Her  Majesty

not  only  to  Governments and with Governments

but  to  the  people,  and  we  the  people  of

Singapore have been impressed by your wide  and

warm sympathies and sincere friendliness as you

move freely among us. You have appreciated  the

liberating  and creative forces  of  democratic

nationalism  in Asia, and have understood  that

democracy  in  practice  among  us  means   its

interpretation in the distinctive way  of  life

of  each of the peoples of South-East Asia, and

in  this  way  you have forged  lasting  links

between  the democratic traditions of East  and

West. We believe your influence has always been

to build our self-confidence and the confidence

of  others  in us which has helped  speed  our

political  advance. We are deeply grateful  for

your  understanding  and  friendliness  to  the

people  of  this territory, and  your  constant

readiness  to give us advice and assistance  in

matters  great and small. Not only are you  the

first of Her Majesty's representatives but  the

first  among those who have shown understanding

of  the people of this territory and our needs,

and  the first in helpfulness in achieving  our

legitimate aspirations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that Mr Speaker do convey to His

Excellency  this  message of our appreciation  and

gratitude  and our best wishes for his success  in

his high post in India, our great neighbour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

pleasure  and the pleasure of my Party to  second

this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malcolm MacDonald has been a friend to all. He

has  admitted in many gatherings that his  friends

are not only those with high and big coats on, but

also  those  without any shirts on  them!  Indeed,

Sir, to consider other people his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



friends  is  one thing, but he has been considered

by  all  concerned  as their friend.  We  witness,

before  his departure, many parties given  in  his

honour,  and you have to book in advance  or  else

you  may not get a date. Higher circles have their

say;  trade unionists call him 'the greatest trade

unionist'; youth movements with their little  boys

and  girls  have always looked towards  him  as  a

friend  and he has always been their very  sincere

friend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malcolm MacDonald, in contrast to a few

expatriates,  I  should say,  is  about  the  best

Britisher we have known in recent times.  I  think

he is a shining example of what a Britisher should

be.  I therefore, Sir, take pleasure to second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir that must

have  been  the longest of all the messages  which

you  have  recently been asked by  this  House  to

carry to various persons and parties. In so far as

we  are  being asked to wish Mr Malcolm MacDonald

well  in  his  new post in India, we join  in  the

valedictions  which, by local  custom,  accompany

the   departure  of  popular  British   officials.

Sometimes   even   more  so,  these   valedictions

accompany  the  departure  of  unpopular   British

officials.  But Mr MacDonald need have  no  fears

under which category he falls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had this motion confined its eulogies to a

recital of the charm and grace with which he moved

amongst the Asians, it would have had a completely

smooth  passage in this House. It is to his credit

that he bore the burden of empire without the  air

of  a  tin  god,  moving disdainfully  amongst  we

benighted  heathens. He took the stuffing  out  of

the  stuffed  shirts,  a  felony  for  which  many

members  of  the  Tanglin  Club  have  not   quite

forgiven  him.  Much to the dismay  of  the  white

aristocrats,   he  started  to  break   down   the

barriers,  which  kept  the heaven-born  in  their

place - the Putney-born and the London-born - and  the

Asians  in  theirs.  As I said,  had  this  motion

confined   itself   to   this   aspect   of    his

contributions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



to  Malaya  and to South-East Asia, it would  have

had our unanimous blessings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, we are also

being  asked,  if  I may read  the  words  of  the

motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"on behalf of the people of Singapore, do place

on  record  our  appreciation"  of  the  political

activities of the right honourable Gentleman,  His

Excellency the Commissioner-General for the United

Kingdom  in  SouthEast  Asia - the  instrument  of

British foreign policy in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party thinks it is unfair, both to the people

of  Singapore and to the Commissioner-General,  to

link  up a message of goodwill with an unnecessary

endorsement  of British foreign policy  in  SouthEast  Asia. It may be that the Government has  its

reasons for approving the political activities  of

Phoenix Park. The Government is entitled  to  its

opinion.  But there are other opinions.  There  is

the opinion of the People's Action Party shared by

a not inconsiderable portion of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we all want to convey to His Excellency

our   best  wishes,  we  cannot  place  on  record

something with which we profoundly disagree.  This

motion  attributes to the Commissioner-General  an

appreciation, if I may read it from  the  text  of

the motion, of "the liberating and creative forces

of  democratic  nationalism in Asia."  This  is  a

claim,  Sir, which I feel the Commissioner-General

would be the first to repudiate as having erred on

the  side of effusiveness. Such an assertion might

pass  in an after-dinner speech when sentiment  is

what  matters. But when something is to be put  on

record  in  this  Assembly, and  after  ten  days'

notice  has been given of the terms of the motion,

we  feel a greater degree of objectivity would not

be uncalled for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government's appreciation, through

its  political  representative, of the  liberating

and  creative forces of democratic nationalism  in

Asia  has  not been all it could and  should  have

been, and indeed can yet still be. I am willing to

concede that, as a person, Mr MacDonald may  have

appreciated these things differently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of His Majesty the Emperor Bao

Dai,   whom  Mr  MacDonald,  on  behalf  of   Her

Majesty's Government, recently had to present as a

great  Vietnamese patriot who was  going  to  save

Indo-China from Communism for democracy. The  only

thing  that  that gentleman has saved is  himself,

and  I  understand  he is now languishing  in  the

casinos  on the French Riviera. I had the singular

experience  of  being  present  at  a  Press  club

luncheon  when  His Excellency, on behalf  of  Her

Majesty's Government, described this same  monarch

as  "His  Majesty  the  Emperor  Bao  Dai - a  great

statesman,  cool, calculating and  courageous".  A

short  while  later,  when  the  Communists   were

sweeping down from North Vietnam and the patriotic

Emperor  had  packed up his extensive luggage  and

left  the  country even before the French quitted,

it  occurred  to me that an alliteration,  equally

euphonious  but  more accurate in describing  that

gentleman,  would  have been cold, calculating  and

callous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in so far as this motion

appears  to seek approval - I would like to be  very

fair  to  the Hon. the Chief Minister - for  British

foreign policy in South-East Asia, we must  record

our complete dissent. We disagree with the policy

which  Phoenix  Park  has  been  responsible   for

executing  in this part of the world. We  disagree

with  the support of the French for Bao Dai which

has led to the Communist victory in Indo-China. We

disagree  with  the  creation  of  Bangkok  as   a

military base in S.E.A.T.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion also propounds another thesis of

doubtful political validity. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe your influence has always been to

build  our  self-confidence and the confidence  of

others  in us which has helped speed our political

advance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking for the P.A.P., at no time has the

Commissioner-General given us self-confidence, nor

has  he  strengthened the support of our followers

in our Party -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, he is not indeed! The

P.A.P. draws its inspiration from the people  and

its  self-confidence is the confidence that comes

out of conviction. We cannot -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on, Mr Lee. Order, Mr Thomas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted

to  you  for protecting me from an attack  by  the

Hon. the  Minister for Communications but  if  he

would make his interruptions more audible, I would

be -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, I am protecting order in

this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I submit. If there are Parties in this House

which  feel that it is necessary to confess to  an

appreciation   of   the   services   which    the

Commissioner-General has rendered them,  then,  of

course, they must make their own appreciations and

pay their own respects. We have at no time, in the

words  of  the  motion again, sought  "advice  and

assistance in matters great and small". Sir, it is

the  fortunate position of my Party in not  having

to  bother  about small matters such  as  the  one

about the four Assistant Ministers. We do not have

to  seek advice on matters big and small. But,  of

course,  it may be that some acknowledgments  must

be made by those who are indebted to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel confident that Mr Malcolm MacDonald, who

more  than  any one Britisher, I should think,  in

Malaya  believes  in  a  self-reliant  and   self-respecting Malaya, would be the last to censure  us

for this affirmation of our independence and self-reliance.  He  would understand why  the  People's

Action  Party,  or,  for that  matter,  any  self-respecting  nationalist Party cannot subscribe  to such a statement. In any case, as our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



Chief Minister has publicly pointed out just  now,

it would have been most embarrassing for him if we

were publicly to put on record our thanks for  his

having  given  the P.A.P. advice and assistance.  It

might jeopardise his somewhat delicate position -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The P.A.P. is not the people

of Singapore! [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the wording

of  this motion has made it impossible for  us  to

give it our unqualified assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> More shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Had it been confined to Malcolm

MacDonald the man, we would have joined in without

reservation.  He,  more  than  any  other  British

official,  is loved by all the men and nearly  all

the  women  in  Malaya. He, more  than  any  other

British official, has never allowed the people  to

forget  that  a  high British official  is  human.

Indeed, it was only recently at a dinner with  the

gentlewomen  of  the  Chinese Ladies'  Association

that he went on record as saying that he would  be

quite  happy if all the husbands there left  their

wives  and  that he stayed on with the ladies  for

breakfast!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, in so far as this motion

records   our  personal  esteem  for  Mr  Malcolm

MacDonald, the man, we endorse it whole-heartedly,

but  we cannot endorse the policy of Her Majesty's

Government  in South-East Asia for  which  he  has

been the political instrument.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are all

aware of Mr MacDonald's qualities as a gentleman,

and  his  reputation  as a  gentleman  has  spread

widely throughout South-East Asia. If this was  an

occasion   for  wishing  him  farewell  in   other

surroundings,  I  would  have  no  hesitation   in

associating myself with the kind things that  have

been said of him today; but we are now speaking on

a  motion before this House and I, for one, do not

believe  that it is quite proper in this place  to

eulogise Mr MacDonald in the terms of the  motion

before this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that Mr MacDonald has always

been   right  in  his  political  judgment.  About

political  events in this country, if I  might  be

pardoned for using an expression, which is better

used  elsewhere, Mr MacDonald has, in my opinion,

on   many  occasions,  backed  the  wrong   horse.

Political  events in this country have not  turned

out  as Mr MacDonald would have liked, and  I  am

sure  that he would be the first person  to  admit

this. I say again that if this was an occasion  to

wish him God-speed in other circumstances, I would

be  only too glad to join in the kind things  that

have been said of him. I am, however, not prepared

to  associate myself or my Party with  the  motion

before this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it gives me great pleasure  to  rise

to  support  the motion of the Chief Minister.  In

doing  so, I am sure I will also have the  support

of  many of the hon. Members of the Opposition and

even  the  members of the public in the Strangers'

Gallery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No praise for Mr MacDonald is high enough. The

good  work  that he has done in Malaya and  South-East  Asia  is  known throughout  the  length  and

breadth not only of Malaya but all over the world.

He is liked by one and all, rich and poor, and the

continuous  stream of functions in his  honour  is

evidence of his popularity with all the people  of

Malaya and which the P.A.P. cannot deny.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  associate  myself with  the  motion  put

before the House by the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr MacDonald, during his stay here for the last

9½  years,  has endeared himself to the hearts  of

the  people, whether they be rich or poor. He  has

never   let  stand  between  him  and  the  people

barriers  of class, or creed, or race, or  colour,

or  even  for that matter, of station of life.  He

has always broken down such barriers. He has never

stood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



on  false dignity. He has always come out and  met

the people as a human being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has been an ambassador of goodwill and

friendship, and no better proof of the success and

appreciation of his work can be found than in  the

unanimous voice that was raised about three  years

back  when it was thought that he was about to  be

transferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot, Sir, always keep a good thing to

oneself  and today we are reconciled to having  to

lose  him,  but I must say that we feel  sorry  to

lose him..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diplomat, Sir, I must say that he is one of

those  few high British officials who have  really

understood  the aspirations of today's nationalist

Asia,  and I think he has done the best he can  to

help us to achieve our goal of self-government and

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about his personal qualifications, a lot

has  been  said but there are three words  in  the

English language which express emotionally a great

deal more than an expression in detail, and I will

end,  Sir, with those three words - that  he  is  a

'jolly good fellow'!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanjong

Pagar,  though  he  did not name  me,  undoubtedly

included me in the stuffed shirts of Tanglin  Club

of  which I am admittedly a member, although it is

not  my  constituency. There are many  people  who

like  bush shirts and open shirts but I personally

like being as well-dressed as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am happy to say that Mr MacDonald

happens also to be my personal friend and I am one

of  his  greatest  admirers. Many Britishers  have

asked  the  question - I have heard  them  ask  many

times - 'What  does Mr MacDonald do?' I  think  the

answer is contained in the Chief Minister's motion

and, in my opinion, there is no exaggeration in it

at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  fully associate myself with  the  remarks

made  by the previous speakers with the exception,

of  course, of the Members for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr

Lee  Kuan Yew) and Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh  Chew

Chua)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the qualities of His Excellency

expressed  by the previous speakers, he  has  made

much effort in improving the conditions of service

of  the  civilian workers in the Armed  Forces  in

Singapore. As an ex-President of the Federation of

Services  Union,  I  have  known  that,  on   many

occasions,   he   had  been  very  successful   in

negotiations  between employers and  employees  of

the  Services,  and  on  behalf  of  the  civilian

workers of the three Services, I wish to place  on

record   the   appreciation  of  Mr   MacDonald's

services  and wish him every success  in  his  new

appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I attended a lunch

party  today  in which Mr MacDonald spoke  and  a

vote  of  thanks was proposed. It is the  vote  of

thanks  that  I wish to refer to, because  it  was

wrong in my opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was described as an empire builder comparable

to  Stamford  Raffles. I do  not  deny  him  equal

status with Stamford Raffles, or greater, but I do

not  personally  regard him as an empire  builder,

and when the Member for Tanjong Pagar referred  to

Mr  MacDonald  as  having  borne  the  burden  of

empire,  I thought we were falling back into  days

which  are  really  past already.  'Empire'  is  a

concept,  which is collapsing all around  us  and

there  is  one empire-building force in the  world

today  and  that, I am afraid, is building  itself

fairly  fast  and has its centre  in  Moscow.  The

other   empires  are  not  expanding;   they   are

contracting and they are going into liquidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot feel that it is right to describe Mr

Malcolm MacDonald as an empire builder. I think it

is  much  more  appropriate to call  him  a  world

builder,  one  who has sincerely attempted  to  do

something for the world in which he lives and  not

for the country to which he belongs. It is because

of  that  feeling about him that I have personally

thought that this was a sound and right motion  to

support.  We  do not always want to  infuse  party

politics into this Chamber and though I could make

some wounding remarks if I wanted to, I also -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Please do.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Please



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I thought it was rather far-fetched for the Member for Tanjong Pagar to make

this  firm  assumption that MacDonald the  man  is

also a sort of Whitehall in himself. No doubt  he

has  to carry out the policies of Whitehall,  just

as  the Member for Tanjong Pagar has to carry  out

the policies decided for him by the members of the

People's  Action  Party. He has  not  much  option

about  it. He has to do as he is told but I  think

we  can further say this: whilst I have not a very

high  opinion  of  the policies adopted  by  Great

Britain  or  by  the U.S.A. in this  part  of  the

world -  and  I associate myself largely  with  the

views that the hon. Member has expressed - whatever

we  may  think of British foreign policy  in  this

part  of  the world, I think one thing is certain: it  would have been a great deal worse without Mr

Malcolm MacDonald. I think we can also say,  as  a

compliment  to the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  that

the policies of the P.A.P. would have been a great

deal worse without Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I cannot help but feel a

little   sorry,   Sir,  for  a  people   who   are

congenitally incapable of saying 'Thank  you'  and

having  the courage to say 'No'. I think  we  will

have  to invent a word which will suit the  warped

and  tortuous  mentality which has been  displayed

across the floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it was not perhaps a

desire  to  display erudition in foreign politics

which  brought  about  these  fireworks  from  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar. I must confess that,  as

I  heard him, he seemed to me to know a great deal

more   about  Bao  Dai  than  about  the   English

language, because nowhere in this motion is  there

any  question  of asserting concurrence  with  the

policy  of  Her Majesty's Government in Bao  Dai's

territory;  and where we express appreciation  for

his  influence  in building up our confidence  and

the confidence of others in us, the protest of the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar comes from  this  basic

confusion - that he thinks the P.A.P. is the  people

of Singapore. Sir, may we tell him a simple truth:

that  the people of Singapore are far greater than

the  P.A.P.,  and the 'us' is not the P.A.P. but  the

people of Singapore. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



has   influenced,  I  am  satisfied,  the  Foreign

Office,  the Colonial Office - the people in  whose

hands,  to  some  extent, lies our  destiny - to  an

appreciation  of our capacity and our  desire  for

political  freedom. His activities have been  very

considerable in so far as this particular area  is

concerned  and I believe they have  at  all  times

been for our good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I felt more than a little chagrined

that a motion of this nature should meet with what

seems    to    be - if   you   will   forgive    the

phrase - somewhat   churlish  opposition,   but   on

reconsideration, Sir, I believe that, on  balance,

the  views  of the other Members of the House  are

heightened   by   the  depths  to   which   wilful

misunderstanding has proved itself capable in this

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate, for myself and my Party and the

people  of  Singapore,  our appreciation  and  our

gratitude for the presence of Malcolm MacDonald in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we the members of the Singapore Legislative

Assembly, on behalf of the people of Singapore, do

place  on  record  in  the  following  terms   our

recognition  of  the unique services  rendered  to

Singapore   by  Malcolm  MacDonald  as   Governor-General, and then as Commissioner-General for  the United Kingdom in South-East Asia: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holding the highest office among Her Majesty's

representatives  in  South-East  Asia, you  have

interpreted  your duty to represent  Her  Majesty

not  only to Governments and with Governments but

to  the  people, and we the people  of  Singapore

have   been  impressed  by  your  wide  and  warm

sympathies and sincere friendliness as you  moved

freely   among  us.  You  have  appreciated   the

liberating  and  creative  forces  of  democratic

nationalism  in  Asia, and have  understood  that

democracy   in  practice  among  us   means   its

interpretation in the distinctive way of life  of

each  of the peoples of South-East Asia,  and  in

this  way  you have forged lasting links  between

the  democratic traditions of East and  West.  We

believe  your influence has always been to  build

our  self-confidence and the confidence of others

in  us,  which  has  helped speed  our  political

advance,   We  are  deeply  grateful   for   your

understanding and friendliness to the  people  of

this  territory, and your constant  readiness  to

give  us  advice and assistance in matters  great

and  small.  Not only are you the  first  of  Her

Majesty's  representatives but  the  first  among

those  who have shown understanding of the people

of this territory and our needs, and the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



in   helpfulness  in  achieving  our   legitimate

aspirations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that Mr Speaker do convey to His Excellency

this message of our appreciation and gratitude and

our  best wishes for his success in his high  post

in India, our great neighbour.

<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I move the motion standing  in  my

name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with

subsection  (3)  of  section 3  of  the  Emergency

Regulations Ordinance, 1948 (No. 17 of  1948),  as

amended  by  the Emergency Regulations (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1948  (No.  39  of  1948),   and   the

Emergency Regulations (Amendment) Ordinance,  1951

(No.  9  of 1951), adopts the Proclamation made  by

the  Governor in Council on the 16th day of  July,

1955  and published as Notification No. S  199  in

the  Gazette Supplement No. 58 of 22nd July, 1955,

as  contained in Sessional Paper No.  S.L.  23  of

1955,  prolonging for a further  period  of  three

months commencing the 22nd day of July, 1955, the

period  specified in the Proclamation of Emergency

made  on  the 21st day of April, 1955, and published

as   Notification  No.  S  113  in   the   Gazette

Supplement No. 30 of 21st April, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of this motion is to ask this House

to  approve the Proclamation made by the  Governor

in  Council on July the 16th last, which  extended

for a further period of three months from July the

22nd  the  period of Emergency and so continue  in

force  for that further three months the Emergency

Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It so happened. Sir, that the last two or three

sittings  of  this House have been preoccupied  by

other  more  exciting and probably more  important

matters than this motion to continue in force  the

Emergency Regulations. So it is nearly four months

this  afternoon  since my hon.  Friend  the  Chief

Minister  last  moved  a similar  motion  in  this

Assembly.  When he did so last April, he  promised

that, within the next three months, the Government

would  exhaustively investigate whether there  was

any   necessity  for  continuing  the   state   of

Emergency and, even if that should be so,  whether

there   was  any  necessity  for  continuing   the

Emergency  Regulations as a  whole.  He  undertook

that,  within  three months, the Government  would

make a clear declaration of policy on this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, much has happened since the day when

that promise was made. Almost at the time that  it

was   being  made,  there  were  forces  at  work,

inflaming the passions of decent ordinary  workers

and inciting students to agitation, the result  of

which was that in May, we had ugly riots and  four

deaths. The Government then was faced with a  very

real  and  pressing  Emergency.  Far  from  making

progress  in  our  examination  of  the  Emergency

Regulations and the need for them, we were obliged

to  come  to this House to get approval to restore

to  the Commissioner of Police the power to impose

a curfew, the power which we had ourselves revoked

only   three   weeks  previously.   Against   that

background  of  a  most dangerous  threat  to  the

public  security of Singapore, our examination  of

the Emergency Regulations became unreal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in June, we hoped that law and order and

the innate decency and good sense of the people of

Singapore had prevailed over those evil influences

which  seek to create disorder and violence  here;

but again, we found ourselves faced with a serious

threat  to  the  well-being of this  island  in  a

general  strike.  Once more, we had  to  face  the

grave   responsibility  of  ensuring  the   public

safety - the   primary   responsibility    of    any

government - the responsibility of seeing  that  its

citizens  can  go  about  their  lawful  occasions

without  danger to life and property  and  without

risk of mob violence. In speaking in this Assembly

towards  the end of June, the Chief Minister  gave

an  account of the measures which the Government,

under  his leadership, felt that it was  right  to

take to safeguard the situation then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having thus overcome these two threats to law

and  order  and the whole fabric of our Government

here,  we  were able then to turn to the  task  of

reviewing the Emergency Regulations and  the  need

for  them,  and  as I think hon. Members  will  be

aware  from  public statements which have  already

been made, we have reached a firm decision on  the

policy which we consider it is our duty to follow.

Our policy is to embody in new legislation such of

the  provisions  and the powers of  the  Emergency

Regulations as we consider to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



needed  for  the good government of Singapore.  We

have  decided our policy and we have  carried  out

the  bulk of the work necessary to put that policy

into  execution.  At  the  last  sitting  of  this

Assembly, we introduced seven Bills, and in  those

seven  Bills  will be found the  majority  of  the

provisions  and powers which, in the view  of  the

Government,   are   required   in   the    present

circumstances   here   in   Singapore.   As   this

legislation  is enacted, we shall then  allow  the

present  Emergency  Regulations  to  pass  out  of

force.  In  this way, I very much hope  that  this

will be the last time that I shall have to move in

this  Assembly this motion asking for an extension

of  the period of the Emergency Regulations. Much,

of course, will depend on the progress that we can

make  in  this  Assembly in dealing with  the  new

legislation, which is already before you and with

at  least one more important Bill, which we  shall

be  introducing.  That  is  the  Bill  for  Social

Security  Registration which  we  shall  ask  this

Assembly  to  enact, and we shall then  allow  the

present  provisions in the Emergency  Regulations,

providing for registration and identity cards,  to

lapse.  If  we  can get this legislation  enacted,

then the Emergency Regulations will lapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me probable that this House will

wish  to  give  its attention mainly  to  our  new

legislation  and that this motion  today,  seeking

approval   for  the  extension  of  the  Emergency

Regulations while we consider the new legislation,

has  become, shall I say, of less burning interest

than it usually is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think perhaps, Sir, the House will wish me to

give  some  brief account of the extent to  which,

during  the  period since I last  spoke,  we  have

found  it  necessary to make use of the powers  of

arrest    and    detention   in   the    Emergency

Regulations - those  being the powers  which  arouse

the   greatest   controversy,  and  very   rightly

naturally  arouse the greatest repugnance  amongst

us  all.  When I last spoke, Sir, I reported  that

during  1954, we had made 69 Detention Orders  and

that  during the first three months of this  year,

we  had  made 17. During the second three  months,

that is from the middle of April to the middle  of

July, again. 13 Detention Orders were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



made  and  in the next month which has since  gone

by, a further 4. So the total number of Detention

Orders in the four-month period I am now reviewing

comes  to  17.  Of those 17, 4 persons  have  been

convicted  in  court,  and one  more  is  awaiting

trial.  Three have since been released subject  to

certain conditions of residence, and one has  been

released  unconditionally, leaving 8  persons  who

are  held  now  in  custody  purely  on  Detention

Orders.  I hope, Sir, that when those figures  are

considered in the light of the very serious events

which  have  taken  place  during  the  last  four

months,  this Assembly will agree with me  when  I

say that the Government has exercised these powers

with restraint and with judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, on this side of the House, fully share the

repugnance that all people feel to having to  keep

a  person in custody without bringing him to trial

in  an open court under the ordinary procedure  of

the  law,  but  I  do  submit,  Sir,  that  as   a

Government,   we  have  to  weigh   against   that

repugnance  our  bounden  duty  to  safeguard  the

public peace and the welfare of the state, and  on

that  issue, I am quite clear that the  Government

has  discharged its responsibility  with  complete

integrity. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second the motion and reserve the right to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Government  will  insist that  I  speak  for  five

minutes  before  I am interrupted,  or  else  keep

silent  for ever more, I must rise to say my  piece

on behalf of the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief Secretary has

pointed  out  that what we will  quarrel,  or  may

quarrel,  about is no longer or will no longer  be

the  Emergency Regulations. As he has pointed out,

some Bills or series of Bills have been tabled  in

this House. Before I proceed may I, on a point  of

information,  ask  him when  we  could  expect  to

receive copies of these Bills?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will take that, Mr Chief

Minister. These Bills are in the process of  being

printed, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and as soon as they are

ready, they will be sent out to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could we be

given  an indication as to when we would be  given

the first opportunity to study them?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I can only inform hon. Members that

the proofs have not come back to us, so that all I

can  say  is  that  it will be  done  as  soon  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Quantitatively, Sir, in point

of  time,  what would "as soon as possible"  mean?

Qualitatively, I can appreciate the fact that  the

printers  will  be  rushed as quickly  as  we  can

expect  them to be rushed as Government  servants.

It  would  be of assistance in this debate  if  we

could  know  when we would be able to discuss  the

changes that are being proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, I

will answer that question. It is proposed that the

Second  Reading  will take place on  the  21st  of

September.  Now, the Bills were tabled  last  week

and,  in  the normal course, I think it will  take

about  ten days for the Printer to return them  to

you - they  are  in your hands and  no  longer  with

Government - and  for  you  to  distribute  them  to

Members.  So,  if they are given to  us,  say,  in

three  days' time, we shall have more  than  three

weeks to study them for the Second Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, Sir, I do not propose to

lose  my right to speak tomorrow, and I do not  at

the  same  time  wish unnecessarily to  filibuster

this   House.  I  would  say  this  to  the  Chief

Minister - that if we want to be unkind, which  is

not  always, we could point out the delay that all

this  amending legislation has taken. In the first

sitting of this Assembly, when we had the privilege

of  the Chief Minister moving an extension of  the

Emergency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations, he promised us that when he came

back  again  here in three months' time - that  is,

in  July - we would have those amendments. This  is August and we still have not got them -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You have got them -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Yes, it is quite

obvious, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief

Minister is always quite right. But I am  sure  we

are  equally quite right because we are  quite  in

the  dark  as to what he proposes to do  until  we

receive  copies of these Bills. Until  we  receive

them,  we do not know whether we shall be able  to

congratulate him and to wish him well -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Wait till the 21st of

September!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - or perhaps -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Moment of

interruption. Debate to be resumed, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Tomorrow, Sir, at 10 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining items on the Order Paper read and

ordered for the next day.
