<div align="center"><b>SHOP ASSISTANTS EMPLOYMENT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to the Second

Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving the Second Reading of the Clerks

Employment  Bill  yesterday, I had  already  covered

most of the ground in respect of this Bill. I cannot

think that hon. Members need to be convinced of  the

need for legislation to protect shop assistants.  As

a  class of worker, they have never been very  vocal

in  demanding this or that. Nevertheless, Sir, since

assuming  office  as  Minister for  Labour,  I  have

received  a  steady  stream  of  letters  from  shop

assistants  outlining  their grievances  and  asking

that  some sort of protective legislation be devised

to  assist  them.  These  grievances,  Sir,  can  be

summarised  very  simply: that  their  contracts  of

service  are  so vague that they never know  exactly

what   rights  they  have  under  them;  that  their

employers make all sorts of deductions from their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>

salaries,  especially when they wish to  resign  and

they have asked that their wages be settled in full;

that  their  wages are seldom paid  regularly;  that

their  hours of work are too long; and that holidays

or  sick  leave are grudgingly given. And they  have

asked  particularly, Sir, that they should be  given

the  right to have their complaints settled  in  the

Labour  Court. All these grievances will be  removed

when the Bill before this House becomes law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to include

earlier legislation for shop assistants, namely, the

Weekly  Holidays Ordinance and the  Seats  for  Shop

Assistants Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's intention to commit this

Bill  to  a  Select Committee and any comments  that

hon.  Members may have on this Bill will, of course,

be  fully  considered by the Select  Committee  when

appointed. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure this Charter

of  Rights  for shop assistants will be hailed  with

satisfaction by shop assistants all over  Singapore.

It  is  common knowledge, Sir, that shop  assistants

are  being made to work at present from anything  up

to 9 to 12 hours a day; in some cases up to 13 hours

a  day.  Consequently they get very little time  off

for  healthy  recreation or relaxation.  This  Bill,

Sir,  seeks  to  limit  the working  hours  of  shop

assistants to 8 or, in certain cases, to 9  hours  a

day  at contracted wages, and the maximum fixed  per

week is 44 hours in normal cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also seeks to uplift the status of

shop  assistants  in Singapore  from  that  of  mere

machines, used for profit earning for employers,  to

that of human beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, as also the Clerks Employment Bill

which  had  its  Second Reading yesterday,  goes  to

prove that the Labour Front Coalition Government  is

continuously  seeking  to  better  the  lot  of  the

working   class,  and  no  matter  what  amount   of

propaganda  is  made  by  certain  Members  of   the

Opposition who seek



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



to  set  themselves up as champions of  the  working

class, I am sure this fact will not go into hiding.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

only two points I wish to make. The first refers  to

clause 37 (1)  on the subject of an additional  half-day   holiday  for  shop  assistants,  theatre   and

restaurant  employees. There is often a considerable

difference  between  the hours of  working  of  shop

assistants and restaurant employees, the latter,  in

some  cases, working either wholly or mainly in  the

evenings. In this sub-clause, therefore, in  line  3

on page 11 of the Bill the words,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"every shop assistant employed therein shall be

allowed  in each week an additional holiday  of  one

half-day commencing at such hour in the afternoon as

may be fixed by the Minister",



<br><br>may  mean,  unless the words "in the afternoon"  are

omitted,  that  some restaurant employees  will  get

another  full  day's holiday per week instead  of  a

half  holiday, which I do not think is the intention

of this Bill. This is a matter which will have to be

looked into further in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I must draw the attention of the

Minister  once again to clauses 48 to  50  regarding

the  very wide powers given to inspectors. Yesterday

I  questioned, in respect of similar clauses in  the

Clerks  Employment Bill, the need in  clause  48  to

"enter  without previous notice at any hour  of  the

day  or  night  any  place where he  has  reason  to

believe any shop assistant is employed". And I  also

queried  the omission in clause 50 (a)  of a  proviso

to  be  found in section 9 (2)  of the present Weekly

Holidays   Ordinance  that  "no  person   shall   be

compellable to answer any question if the answer may

tend directly or indirectly to incriminate". Sir,  I

asked  the  Hon. the Chief Minister to  justify  the

very  wide  powers  being given  to  inspectors  and

yesterday he omitted to give me a reply. I hope that

he will do so today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  point  out to the Member for Tanglin that clauses 48 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

50  were  taken from the Labour Ordinance which  was

approved  in the previous session of the Legislative

Assembly? The operation of these two sections in the

Labour  Ordinance has been done in a very  fair  and

just manner and no complaints have been received  by

the  Government  in regard to any unjust  operation.

But  in view of the representations made by the hon.

Member,  the  points which he has  raised  will,  of

course,  be duly considered by Government in  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Shop Assistants Employment Bill be

referred  to a Select Committee with Mr Speaker  as

Chairman and such Members as may be nominated by the

Committee of Selection.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Shop Assistants Employment Bill be

referred  to a Select Committee with Mr Speaker  as

Chairman and such Members as may be nominated by the

Committee of Selection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I also move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Shop  and Office Employees Bill in the last  Session

of   the  Legislative  Assembly,  as  contained   in

Sessional  Paper No. L.A. 6 of 1956, be referred  to

the   Select   Committee  on  the  Shop   Assistants

Employment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I explained yesterday the reason for this

motion. It is to enable the Select Committee  to  be

appointed  to  have the benefit of the deliberations

of that Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Shop  and Office Employees Bill in the last  Session

of   the  Legislative  Assembly,  as  contained   in

Sessional  Paper No. L.A. 6 of 1956, be referred  to

the   Select   Committee  on  the  Shop   Assistants

Employment Bill.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Continuation in force)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)   of  section  1 of the Control  of  Imports  and

Exports  Ordinance (Chapter 214), resolves that  the

aforesaid  Ordinance shall continue in force  for  a

further period of one year commencing on the 8th day

of December, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on five previous occasions this Ordinance has

come  up  before the Legislature of this colony  for

its  continuance and has been approved each time for

a  period of one year. My motion now seeks to extend

the  continuance  of this Ordinance  for  a  further

period  of  one  year as from the 8th  of  December,

1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance gives the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  powers  to  make  orders  prohibiting  the

import  and export of goods. However, let me  assure

Members that, in keeping with our free trade policy,

these powers are used very sparingly, and except for

a  comparatively  narrow  field,  most  imports  are

placed  on the open general licence and exports  are

freely  licensed.  The powers of  control,  however,

come in useful in regulating imports for balance  of

payment   reasons,  especially  from   hard-currency

areas,  but here again all essential and many  semi-essential goods are licensed freely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers also provide a useful check for

purposes  of disease control in connection with  the

import of plants, animals and meats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will recall that these  powers  were

used a few months ago to prohibit the importation of

pin-tables and similar amusement machines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the export field the powers under this

Ordinance are used to keep a check on the export  of

strategic  materials and essential  items  in  short

supply in Singapore. At present, controls on exports

are  very  few in number. It is, however,  necessary

for the Minister to have such powers of control, and

the  Trade  Advisory Council agrees with this  view.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

receiving  the assurance of the Minister that  these

powers will be used sparingly and with the advice of

the  Trade  Advisory Council, I am not opposing  the

motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I read a rather alarming report about

rubber  exports to China. A trade mission  has  left

for China from Singapore and the Federation, and has

concluded  deals in rubber for export to  China.  If

the  report  in the Press is correct - that Government

requires  a  guarantee from the exporter  that  this

rubber will not be used for war purposes - how is  the

exporter to know how that commodity will be used  in

China? It is impossible for an exporter here to give

any guarantee or surety. On the other hand, Sir, all

these  years  rubber has been exported  through  the

United Kingdom to Russia. Then why is this guarantee

required from exporters that the rubber exported  to

China  will not be used for war purposes? As I  have

said, it is impossible for exporters to know to what

uses  the  rubber will be put. I hope the Government

will  not  try and put obstacles in the  export  and

import trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, the Member for

Telok  Ayer says that he will not oppose this motion

because  I have said that these powers will be  used

sparingly and with the advice of the Trade  Advisory

Council.  Sir, that is not correct. I have not  said

that  these powers will be used with the  advice  of

the  Trade  Advisory  Council. The  discretion  lies

solely  with  the Minister, Sir, and no Minister  is

going  to  give  up that discretion  if  he  has  to

exercise it for the benefit of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to refer the hon.

Member to section 4 (2)  of the Ordinance which says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any order made by the Minister under this section

shall  as soon as possible after the making  thereof

be  laid before the Legislative Assembly and  if  at

the  next meeting of the Legislative Assembly  after

the  order is laid before it a resolution is  passed

annulling  the order or any part thereof  the  whole

order  or such part thereof as the case may be shall

thenceforth  be  void but without prejudice  to  the

validity of anything previously done thereunder."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, Sir, any hon. Member dislikes any order made

by  the  Minister, he has the right to move a motion

annulling  the order that the Minister has  made  at

the  next sitting of the Assembly when it is tabled.

However,  Sir, in normal matters we do  consult  the

Trade  Advisory Council, but it is not an  assurance

that I can give as a matter of right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also raised the point about

Government  demanding a guarantee  that  the  rubber

exported to China will not be used for war purposes.

Sir,  I  am  sure that hon. Members will agree  that

this  Government can take a bit of credit for trying

to  get  the ban on rubber exports to China removed.

Sir,  in keeping with the requirements of the United

Nations  Organisation, we have to get statements  as

to  the end uses of the rubber that is being shipped

to  China. It is not a guarantee, in the real  sense

of  a guarantee, from a shipper. It is a requirement

that  the  shipper should give us the  name  of  the

ultimate  user and the purpose for which the  rubber

is  going there. He need not specifically state that

it  is going for tyre manufacture or something  like

that,  so  long as he states that it is going  there

for  a  purpose which is peaceful, and not connected

with the production of war materials and so on. Sir,

it  is not a guarantee in the form that we hold  the

shipper  responsible  for  the  guarantee,  but,  of

course,  if  it  is  found  that  the  shipper   has

purposely  made a false declaration, then there  are

penalties laid out in the Control of Imports and  Exports Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)   of  section  1 of the Control  of  Imports  and

Exports  Ordinance (Chapter 214), resolves that  the

aforesaid Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



shall continue in force for a further period of  one

year commencing on the 8th day of December, 1956.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move the motion standing  in

my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with section 4 of

the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246), approves the

reclamation  by  Messrs.  John  I.  Thornycroft  and

Company Limited as agents of the Government, at  the

expense of the said Messrs. John I. Thorny-croft and

Company  Limited and subject to an indemnity  to  be

previously  given  by  the  said  Messrs.  John   I.

Thornycroft  and Company Limited to  the  Government

against all claims in any manner arising out  of  or

in  connection  with such reclamation  or  the  work

thereof, and subject to such other conditions as the

Governor  may  impose,  of  that  portion   of   the

foreshore   and  sea-bed  containing  an   area   of

approximately 20,000 square feet adjoining Lot  571-1,  Mukim XXV, at Tanjong Rhu as delineated on plans

which  have been approved by the Director of  Public

Works   and  are  deposited  at  the  Land   Office,

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is the result of an application by

Messrs. John I. Thornycroft and Company Limited  for

permission to reclaim part of the foreshore and sea-bed  adjacent  to  and north of  their  shipyard  at

Tanjong  Rhu.  The company proposes to  construct  a

slipway  and  sea-wall on the seaward side  of  this

reclamation.  Under  section  4  of  the  Foreshores

Ordinance,  no  reclamation  can  be  made  of   the

foreshore  or sea-bed without the sanction  of  this

Assembly. The object of this motion is to  give  the

requisite authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessee will act as agents for the Government

in  making  the reclamation, and the usual indemnity

will be taken. When the reclamation is complete, the

land  will  become Crown land and a  lease  will  be

issued to the company. Sir, I beg to move.

Secretary what this $10 token vote is required for?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The $10 token vote under Head 5, Sir, is

required   to  authorise  the  payment  of   revised

different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The authority of the Legislature, Sir,

is  required  for  any payment of public  funds  for

which  provision  is not made in the  Estimates.  In

this case, we are introducing a new salary scale for

the  General  Clerical Service and for what  is  now

called the Higher Clerical Service. Where funds  are

available,  we  ask  for a token vote  to  authorise

payment from the savings available. If funds are not

available, we ask for the provision required to meet

the  charge  for the year. In this particular  case,

authority  is  required to make  payment  under  two

items  under Personal Emolument - one for the  General

Clerical  Service  and  the  other  for  the  Higher

Clerical Service - which explains the $20 token vote.

<div align="center"><b>ARRESTS OF TRADE UNION AND CIVIC LEADERS AND DISSOLUTION OF SOCIETIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  motion which stands in my name  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is gravely concerned over the

recent arrests of trade union and civic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



leaders  and  the dissolution of two societies,  and

deplores  the  arbitrary manner of the  Government's

action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this motion was tabled, a number of

developments  have taken place which  have  made  my

motion  out  of date. There has been the dissolution

of  the Chinese Middle School Students Union and the

arrest  and  detention  under  the  Public  Security

Ordinance  of  the President of the  Chinese  Middle

School  Students Union and of an Executive Committee

member of the People's Action Party, who is also  an

Assistant Secretary of the Shop and Factory  Workers

Union.  However,  the substance  of  this  challenge

against the action of the Government is the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we debated the Governor's Address on 5th

September, and gave this Government a unanimous vote

of  confidence because it was going to call an  All-Party  conference  to  plan  tactics  for  the  next

Merdeka talks and to plan tactics in case the  talks

failed,  few  of us realised that, in  fact,  a  new

phase had opened in the political life of Singapore.

We  did  not know then that there had been a radical

change in the policy and methods of the Labour Front

Coalition Government. The first sign of that radical

change  was the arrest, under banishment orders,  of

six  prominent trade union and civic leaders on 18th

September,  followed on the 19th by the  dissolution

of the Women's Federation and the Chinese Brass Gong

Musical Society. There was not the slightest pretext

for  any of these arbitrary acts. It came out of the

blue. However, we gave the Government the benefit of

the doubt. Perhaps they might not have intended this

as  an  act of provocation. But an emergency sitting

of  the  Legislative Assembly asked for by my  Party

was  firmly refused. Before the next sitting of  the

Assembly, the Government had moved again, this  time

against  the  Chinese Middle School Students  Union,

and  a  day  before the Assembly  was  due  to  sit,

against  a  Committee member of the People's  Action

Party.  We  might have doubted before whether  these

acts  were  those of wild suppression or  calculated

provocation, but there is very little doubt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



now  in  our  minds  as  to  what  the  Government's

intentions  are.  It is clear that there  must  have

been  months  of deliberate and calculated  planning

for this great purge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old phase ended when the former Chief Minister

departed   for   Cathay,  seeking  inspiration   and

knowledge   probably  to  return  with  tales   more

wondrous  than  those  of  Marco  Polo.  After   his

resignation on 7th June, the Chief Ministership  was

on  the 8th June taken over by the Member for  Havelock,  who  said that his was a caretaker government

whose  only function was to carry on till  the  next

Merdeka talks. It is quite clear now that, from  the

time  the former Chief Minister left Singapore,  all

talk  of  the  caretaker nature of  this  Government

ceased. In fact, it culminated with a declaration in

last  month's debate that the Government was  not  a

caretaker  one. The Government had decided  that  it

was  going to take care of itself. Unable to compete

with  the  vigorous and militant movements that  the

last  general  elections had set into  motion,  they

knew  that  they faced certain defeat  in  the  next

elections.  They have no organisation,  no  core  of

party  workers  and  party cadres,  no  intellectual

content  in their Party. At least let this  be  said

for  the  last Chief Minister: he believed that  all

these handicaps, and the lack of organisation, could

be   overcome  by  the  sheer  force  of  a  dynamic

personality, widely publicised, and that if  he  got

Merdeka,  then he was confident he could beat  rival

organisations.  Unfortunately,  he   did   not   get

Merdeka, but it saved him the discomfiture of having

that illusion shattered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Chief Minister is a much more prosaic,

mundane and matter-of-fact man. He is more like  his

Ministers. He knew that this was not the way to win,

and  that  even if he wanted to do it he could  not.

But he was a plotter. He could plan, and he took  us

all for a ride! But to plot, you must have people to

plot  with,  people  with the  sinews  to  give  you

strength  where you lack the strength. So inevitably

they became embroiled with their colonial masters as

fellow conspirators to use the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



instruments which their colonial masters had  forged

over  the  years  to maintain their rule  over  this

colonial territory. But, of course, to conceal  this

they  boldly stepped forward in front. Once embarked

on  this  course of suppression, defeat at the  next

polls  becomes an absolute certainty  instead  of  a

mere  probability,  unless all  Opposition  rallying

points   are   destroyed  to  ensure  no   organised

challenge  at  the  next elections.  Having  already

exposed their designs thus far, it was idle for them

to  go back and pretend that they were just innocent

good Democrats led astray by the British. Theirs was

an irrevocable decision, a decision which has set in

train  events the end of which we may not  know  for

some  time.  But  with  all the  mass  meetings  and

rallies  which are being held and in which they  are

being denounced in no uncertain terms, and the  mass

signature campaigns and a few other methods of  mass

publicity and education, they are being reduced from

"colonial stooges" to "running dogs"-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member, I think, is

now embarking on unparliamentary language. The words

"stooges"  and "running dogs" cannot, of course,  be

used  in  this Assembly with reference  to  Members.

Further  I would like to draw the attention of  hon.

Members to Standing Order 31 (6)  which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Member shall impute improper motives to any

other Member."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar is inclined to make

direct  imputations.  I  do  not  put  it  past  the

ingenuity  of  the  hon.  Member  to  make  indirect

imputations which perhaps may be in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I was

misunderstood.  I was not calling my hon. opponents

on the other side either colonial stooges or running

dogs.  I  was reporting what was being said  at  the

mass meetings. I will always refer to them with  the

greatest  of respect in this House, but  I  have  to

inform  them that this is what they are being called

at a series of mass meetings all over the town.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who cares?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Who cares? Before this mass

protest  is  over, I am quite sure, as  far  as  the

masses  are  concerned, my hon. opponents  will  be

reduced to traitorous vermin, as indeed, I am  told,

all right-thinking people already know they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one way for survival now, and that

is  to  suppress  the  organisations  that  are  the

instruments  of this exposure and either  banish  or

detain  the key men working these organisations - from

brass gong musical societies and women's federations

to  students unions, on to art associations,  on  to

societies  for the promotion of brotherly  love  and

societies for the scratching of each other's  backs,

and,  finally, if necessary, trade unions, and  even

political Parties. Of course, if only a good  excuse

could  be  found, it might be possible to deal  with

some  of  the  trade  unions  organised  by  hostile

militant groups. It might be too blatant an  act  at

this  moment  to move directly against the  People's

Action Party and remove it from peaceful competition

in  the next elections, particularly if it has  been

correct,  constitutional and proper in its  actions.

But  take  away  all the supports,  all  the  ground

organisations  that  sustain  the  People's   Action

Party, and then you will have removed the sinews  of

the  Party. Then you might even allow that Party  to

compete and hobble along in the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are happy at this? I do not say that my hon.

opponents  on  the  other  side  are  seeking  these

allies, but they are getting these allies. The first

to  congratulate them was no less a person than  the

Secretary of State for the Colonies himself, the Rt.

Hon. Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 3, from London:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Rt. Hon. Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd, in a broadcast

last  night on Malaya, said that the Communist snake

has  been  scotched but not killed. In  an  all-over

review of progress in the Commonwealth, the Colonial

Secretary  said: 'We shall soon see  an  independent

Malaya   within  the  Commonwealth.  Here,   as   in

Singapore,  courageous and competent  Ministers  are

facing up to their problems in this vital corner  of

the free world.' "



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



The  last  time he paid a compliment  to  the  Chief

Minister  of  Singapore, as a very intelligent  man,

the  right honourable gentleman had reason to regret

it subsequently, particularly on the day the Merdeka

talks  broke  down  in London.  And  look  what  has

happened to the Chief Minister who received so  deep

a  compliment from his master! But they knew that it

was  a foolish thing to have said, and the next day,

when  the  Colonial  Office was asked  whether  they

approved   of  their  minions  in  Singapore,   they

declined to comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London, September 24: U.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Colonial Office firmly declined any comment on

Singapore. It was explained that there could  be  no

official  reaction to what is regarded purely  as  a

matter  of  local  politics and  that  comment  from

London was neither desirable nor useful."



<br><br>The  right  honourable gentleman  should  have  been

wiser  to  do  that from the beginning,  instead  of

giving such a generous bouquet to the hon. gentlemen

opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the ex-Servicemen's Association.

They  had  a luncheon. Then there was the Bishop  of

Singapore. Then there was Mr Clayton, President  of

the  European Chamber of Commerce that calls  itself

the   Singapore  Chamber  of  Commerce.   Then   the

Americans - they had to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington, September 25: U.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standard headline - Lim's anti-Red stand, Americans

are impressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American officials said yesterday they had been

considerably impressed by the determined efforts  of

Singapore's energetic Chief Minister, Lim Yew  Hock,

to  wipe  out  the  Communist  influence  which  has

plagued  the  colony in recent years. They  will  be

watching  closely to see whether Lim  Yew  Hock  can

sustain   the   momentum  of  this   drive   against

subversive elements which have fomented unrest  and,

at times, bloodshed in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Department officials were impressed by the

Singapore  Government's sudden arrest of seven  pro-Communist   workers   and   the   Chief   Minister's

subsequent emphatic rejection of protest against the

action.  However,  it  is  not  expected  that   the

powerful subversive elements in Singapore will  give

in  without a struggle, and there is great  interest

in  what moves they may make in an effort to  regain

face.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American officials hope that Lim Yew Hock and

his  Government  will be able  to  maintain  their

campaign to rid the labour and education fields of

trouble-making elements."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be outdone, the Aussies came in.



<br><br><div align="center">"Aussies praise Mr Lim</div>

<br><br><div align="center">Sydney, October 1: Reuter.</div>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For Australians the most heartening news from

Asia  for  many a long moon has been the  vigorous

action  taken  against  Communist  subversion   by

Singapore  Government,' the Sydney Morning  Herald

said  today,  and  declared in an editorial:  `The

Chief Minister of Singapore has made it abundantly

plain  that he won't have anything to do with  New

China.  Mr Lim Yew Hock has acted with a boldness

and  resolution which has astonished  his  friends

and  confounded  his critics.' The newspaper  said:

`For a Chinese Minister in a substantially Chinese

community it was courageous indeed.' "



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that there has been no

local support for the Hon. the Chief Minister.  He

had the T.U.C. come out and support him. But if  I

may  quote the comment of my friend and colleague,

my  backseat driver, the General Secretary of  the

Shop   and   Factory   Workers   Union,   "It   is

meaningless.  It  is like South  Korea  supporting

Formosa. It is beneath comment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then yesterday we read of a 15-man delegation

representing 150 organisations and 150,000  people

in  Singapore  coming  to the  Chief  Minister  to

pledge their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear indeed! They were

led  by  Mr  Chua Hoe Ann, the man  who  led  the

overseas  Chinese delegation to Formosa to  pledge

the support of the overseas Chinese for Chiang Kai-shek  in  his fight to regain the Chinese mainland

against the lawfully constituted Government of the

People's  Republic of China. In a  P.R.O. release

dated 2nd October, the Government was disingenuous

enough  to publish a list of the 150 organisations

which  this  15-man  delegation  was  supposed  to

represent.  Amongst them - I do not  wish  to  smear

organisations with one broad brush - there are  good

organisations  like the Singapore  Bank  Employees

Union, for whom sometimes I acted as adviser,  and

the Army Civil Service Union, in which I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



some  friends as officers. But let us look at  the

majority of these 150 organisations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The O.C. Kindergarten. What is the O.C.

Kindergarten? Are all the little toddling  infants

in this Kindergarten counted in the 150,000?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tong Tat Library. Is every person who reads

a  book   from this library accounted for in  the

150,000?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The G.G. Association. What is it all about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hwa Keow Jin Ai Sia, the Koon Teok Siah - a

motley  collection of semi-defunct  organisations.

The people have never heard of them before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by all means let us fight propaganda by

counter propaganda. That is part of the democratic

process.  If  your  opponents  start  a  signature

campaign,  you start one. That is commendable.  If

your  opponents say they represent 50,000  people,

you  get  15 people to come and say they represent

150,000.  But let us do it intelligently.  Let  us

not make a mockery and a farce of this thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the end of all this? Repression, Sir, is

a  habit  that grows. I am told it is like  making

love - it  is  always easier the  second  time!  The

first  time  there may be pangs of  conscience,  a

sense  of guilt. But once embarked on this course,

with  constant repetition, you get more  and  more

brazen  in  the  attack and in the  scope  of  the

attack.  First, the conscience is disturbed  by  a

sense  of  guilt. You attack only those whom  your

Special  Branch can definitely say are Communists.

They  have no proof except what X told Z who  told

Alpha  who told Beta who told the Special  Branch.

Then you attack those whom your Special Branch say

are  actively  sympathising with and  helping  the

Communists,  although  they  are  not   Communists

themselves.  Then  you  attack  those  whom   your

Special   Branch  say,  although  they   are   not

Communists  or  fellow travellers, yet,  by  their

intransigent opposition to any collaboration  with

colonialism, they encourage the spirit  of  revolt

and  weaken  constituted  authority  and  thereby,

according  to the Special Branch, they are  aiding

the Communists. Then finally, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



you  have  gone that far, you attack all  those  who

oppose you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repression is an easy substitute for hard work and

organisation.  To compete with a rival organisation,

you  have  to win mass support, to help  the  people

solve  their  problems  of living.  But  instead  of

building up an organisation, it is much easier  just

to  have  a  collection of friends  to  contest  the

elections, with no organisation. Then, by  a  fluke,

you  may  find yourself in power. You take over  the

organisation  of the colonial power, the  government

machinery,    the    instruments    of    policy - the

administration, the police, broadcasting and all the

"gimmicks" of a modern colonial State. Then you  use

this  machinery with the connivance and  concurrence

of    your    colonial   masters    against    rival

organisations.  It  is easier than  building  up  an

organisation of your own. All you have to do  is  to

dissolve  organisations and societies and banish  or

detain the key political workers in these societies.

Then   miraculously  everything  is   tranquil   and

quiet - on  the surface. Then an intimidated Press - and

some   sections  of  the  Press  here  do  not  need

intimidation   because  they  have   very   friendly

owners - the Press and the Government-controlled radio

together can regularly sing your praises and  slowly

and  steadily the people are made to forget the evil

things  that  have already been done.  Or  if  these

things  are referred to again, they are conveniently

distorted,  and  distorted  with  impunity,  because

there will be no opposition to contradict it. It has

happened  before in Asia. It happened in  China  and

Indo-China. First, you knock out your opponents  who

compete  with  you, peacefully and constitutionally,

because  they are more vigorous, because you  cannot

compete with them, because they are better organised

than  you are. When everything becomes peaceful  and

tranquil,  complacency  sets  in,  and  degeneration

begins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front Organising Secretary went to the

inaugural  ceremony of the Women's Federation  where

he  made a fighting speech. He said: "We must  fight

against  corruption, all forms  of  corruption,  not

just   anti-yellow   culture."   He   termed   moral

corruption "the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



appeals of the fleshpots of life". He said, "We must

fight   against   political   corruption.   Physical

corruption",  he said, "is a weapon  which  you  use

against your opponent by threatening either his life

or  the  liberty of his person." That, he said,  was

undemocratic and bad. The Communists were the people

who  engaged  in such forms of physical  corruption,

and  he  condemned them. He said also that  we  must

fight  economic  corruption,  bribery  and  all  the

rottenness of things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indo-China and China, once they crushed the

open  stimulus, that challenge to them  to  increase

their  efficiency,  they slumped and  slowly  became

decadent  and  corrupt. They went to seed.  Finally,

the  organisation on which they depended to maintain

themselves  in  power, the machinery of  government,

also  sank. By their example, the Civil Service went

to  seed.  They  became corrupt and  degenerate.  No

initiative,  no  imagination.  Instead  of  becoming

instruments to implement the policies and solve  the

economic  and  social problems of the  people,  they

became   instruments  of  petty  oppression.  Slowly

cracks began to appear on the edifice of government,

until  finally the whole structure collapsed as  the

underground    opposition,    which     had     been

strengthening,  rose up and struck  down  all  these

institutions  which  the  people  had  regarded   as

instruments  of their oppression and had  recognised

as  the  reason  for  their misery  and  misfortune.

Finally  the whole world of these men in power  came

to  an end, a dismal and a disgraceful end. Then  if

they  were unlucky, according to the American Press,

they  might get buried alive. Or they might get hung

up  in some market place, where the people would  go

and publicly curse them to their grave, egged on  by

fanatical  party  tyrants. But if they  were  lucky,

then they fled to some convenient island. There,  if

they could win or retain the support of their former

masters and collaborators, like Chiang Kai-shek  and

his  cronies,  they could continue to  live  in  the

comfort and ease to which they had grown accustomed,

sustained  and supported by the Americans and,  what

is most important, protected by them and the Seventh

Fleet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish unduly to depress my opponents on

the  other  side of the House. They have  about  one

chance in a million of success with this instrument.

If  they  could  suppress  with  the  fanatical  and

religious  belief that God and right  are  on  their

side - just  as  we are told the Communists  sometimes

believe  that  God and right are on their  side  and

they  suppress their opponents - then, with a  stifled

Opposition,  they  could  perhaps  strengthen  their

organisation and translate their political  theories

and  beliefs  into action and give  the  people  the

better  life  that they seek. But they can  only  do

this  if  they  have  a  core  of  men  of  ability,

integrity  and courage, men imbued with high  ideals

and  convictions,  driving forward  with  relentless

zeal and energy derived from their convictions. They

need  a  whole team of men who can methodically  and

systematically  plan to bring about your  prosperous

egalitarian   society.  Then  you  can   allow   the

Communists   to  come  back  and  compete   in   the

elections, after you have strengthened yourself  and

removed your economic and social ills to that  point

where  you feel fairly confident that you  have  the

people,  if  not on your side, at least not  against

you.  But  to  do this in Malaya, you will  have  to

fight  and  subdue those groups and interests  which

have  come out to support you initially because they

believe  you  have come out to protect their  vested

interests - all your Chambers of Commerce. Let me read

to  the  Chief Minister what his action has done  to

the share market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straits Times, September 24, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lim's Policy Boosts Shares



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again last week the strength of the Singapore

Share  Market was centred in the industrial  section

which was very steady.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increased volume of business was written in this

section particularly for investment purposes and  by

those  buying in because they feel some of the  crop

of  dividends due towards the end of the  year  will

show healthy improvements."



<br><br>Then  it goes on to analyse how throughout the  week

there was growing confidence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason for the renewed strength of industries,

which  have taken months to pick up the millions  of

dollars slashed from their market value in April and

May last year, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



the  firm  stand  being taken by the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government  against  subversion  and  its   rational

approach to internal self government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Three cheers! Three cheers for

all  the  shareholders  and  all  the  directors  of

companies!  Three cheers for the Singapore  Standard

which, on 24th September, 1956, said:



<div align="center">"Shares Firm On Renewed Confidence Increased Trading During This Week</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align="center">By a Market Correspondent.</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan share markets, which have provided an

accurate  barometer of political events,  last  week

reacted  to  the  recent Government  action  against

'subversive' elements, resulting in a firm trend."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the allies whom you will collect with

you on this road to perdition. These are the men you

will  have to fight and subdue if you want to  carry

out  your  economic policies and  bring  about  your

egalitarian  society. Can you fight these  men  when

you  depend  upon them for your support?  And  chief

amongst  these  are  the British, their  influential

investors  with friends in Parliament.  Does  anyone

believe  now,  after Nasser and  the  Suez  Canal - if

anyone   believed  it  before - that  with  a  Britain

fighting for survival as a world power by hanging on

to  her vital strategic interests (rubber, tin, gold

dollars),  that she will allow these vital  economic

interests  to be subordinated to a higher  political

interest;  to allow you to take over her rubber  and

tin  earnings  in  order  that  you  can  raise  the

standard of living of the people in this country, in

order  that  you can save it for democracy  in  this

vital  corner of the free world? Does anybody  doubt

what  would happen to any government in Malaya  with

such a British Government, with troops right in  the

country  and  not in some Cyprus island hundreds  of

miles away?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I may be wrong. It may be that there might

be  a  radical change of policy on the part  of  the

British  Government, a change of heart  because  Mr

Gaitskell is different from Mr Eden, and will allow

higher   political  motives  to  over-ride   selfish

economic motives. I may be wrong, too, about my hon.

opponents on the other side of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps they are men of ability and integrity,  with

the  courage of their convictions and tireless  zeal

born  of  these convictions. I was glad to hear  the

other  day  that  some  have  even  taken  to  youth

leadership  instead of lounging in hotel  bars!  But

that  is  not a sufficient basis to start  a  social

revolution. There is a revolution on in  Malaya  and

there are two ways to meet it. The first, is to meet

it  militarily  and  suppress it  by  force - and  the

British  have  been doing it for  eight  years.  The

second  is to control and regulate it. If the  other

side  is  prepared to compete and put forward  their

ideas  and theories in a peaceful and constitutional

manner, then they would give you the impetus to  put

your house in order, to compete. And if you fail and

they succeed, because they are better organised  and

have  worked better, then you have only yourself  to

blame  if  you lose, provided, as I have said,  they

fight  in a peaceful and constitutional manner.  But

out  of  the blue the Government has moved to strike

them down. It is the road to perdition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am asking the House to do is formally to

deplore these arbitrary actions. But this motion  in

substance  is  a  condemnation  of  the  policy   of

suppression on which this Government has embarked, a

policy  of suppression without any pretext, done  so

blatantly  and so crudely that they will  lose  even

the  Social Democrats to the other side,  that  they

will  lose the intellectuals to the other side. They

will  lose the people with a conscience and  with  a

sense of fair play and decency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the result of these moves will

be  in  the immediate future. That depends upon  the

plans  of  the  Council of Ministers, or  perhaps  a

faction  of the Council of Ministers. But I do  know

that if this policy of indiscriminate suppression is

pursued, the ultimate result perhaps in 8 years,  or

perhaps  in  10  years if that long, is  a  foregone

conclusion. It has happened before in Asia and it is

going  to  happen  here again unless  we  learn  the

lesson from what has happened elsewhere in Asia. How

long  can  you depend on the support of  those  whom

eventually you must fight, because your economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



interests  conflict with theirs? How  long  can  you

keep  bottled up a sense of grievance and discontent

because  of social and economic injustices?  If  the

one  chance in a million works out, then no man will

cheer this Government more than I will. Perhaps,  in

fact, they have a sense of mission in life, and  all

these  things  are done in the belief that  God  and

right  are  on their side, that they are  doing  bad

things for a good cause, that, eventually, they will

do good things for a good cause when conditions have

been put right. But as I see it, bad things for some

bogus  good  cause will lead to more bad things  for

even  worse causes, until slowly the whole structure

of this society will crumble into dust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my hon. opponents on the other side to

weigh  the odds carefully, and not follow  what  the

Special  Branch tells them, because they are  police

experts,  they are the Sherlock Holmes who  pick  up

the   threads   and  build  up  their  theories   of

subversive  activity. Many of them do not understand

what  this  is about. I am not saying  that  if  one

understands  it, then one necessarily  has  all  the

answers to it. But one is more likely to be able  to

meet  the problem in the right way. This is a  fight

in  Asia,  a  fight of ideas, a fight for  a  better

life. Whoever organises better and provides a better

life  for the people gets the support of the people.

I agree with the hon. Gentlemen opposite that if any

act is done to overthrow a government by force, that

act  must  be  suppressed. But if  we  say  that  we

believe in democracy, if we say that the fabric of a

democratic society is one which allows the free play

of   ideas,  which  avoids  revolution  by  violence

because revolution by peaceful methods of persuasion

is  allowed, then, in the name of all the gods  that

we  have  in  this country, give that  free  play  a

chance  to work within the constitutional framework.

If   you   do  not,  then  you  will  face  outright

opposition, an armed revolt, and eventually an armed

victory.  Then  the  whole  social  fabric  of  this

society will collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion. The

only  reason  the Chief Minister has given  for  the

recent    arrests   and   dissolution    of    three

organisations  is  that  they  were  "in  the   best

interests  of  the  people".  That  phrase  is  very

familiar to the people of Singapore. They have heard

it  many  times  in  the past  from  the  mouths  of

colonial  officials who wanted to  justify  colonial

acts  of repression. The people of India heard  this

phrase  from the mouths of British imperial viceroys

who  tried to persuade them that 150 years of  cruel

British exploitation and repression of the people of

lndia was "in the best interests of the people". The

people  of  Indonesia had also bee n told  by  their

former  Dutch colonial masters that Dutch repression

was  "in the best interests of the people".  So  did

the people of Indo-China hear it from the mouths  of

the  French colonialists. The same phrase was  taken

up  by  Asian  Quislings who tried  to  justify  the

suppression  instigated by their  colonial  backseat

drivers. And it is the bitter fate of the people  of

Singapore  to  hear this phrase of colonial  Fascist

double-talk  from  the mouth of  the  elected  Chief

Minister. The Chief Minister can only show that  his

action  is really in the interests of the people  by

proving his charges against the arrested persons  by

democratic processes in a fair public trial. He  has

refused to do this. He has chosen instead to repeat,

like  a  well-trained  colonial  parrot,  that   the

Government's  actions are "in the best interests  of

the people".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has claimed, Sir, that he has

acted  solely in accordance with the law. What  law?

The repressive laws of colonialism! One of the first

things  that a leader who claims to guide the people

to  Merdeka  should  do is to safeguard  the  people

against  the use of repressive colonial legislation.

That  is  what Nehru did in India and  he  spent  11

years in British prisons for doing so. That is  also

what  Sukarno did in Indonesia. But that is not what

our Chief Minister does. Instead of fighting the use

of  repressive colonial laws, he himself  uses  them

against  his  own  people. The  Chief  Minister  has

denied that he has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



made a private agreement with Mr Lennox-Boyd behind

the  `backs  of  the people of Singapore.  In  other

words,  he denies that the recent arbitrary  arrests

and   the   dissolution  of  peaceful  and  lawfully

constituted societies form part of the price he  has

agreed  to  pay to the Colonial Office for  spurious

constitutional  concessions  at  the  next   Merdeka

talks.  But  the  whole pattern of his  Government's

policy  since he took office makes it difficult  for

the people of Singapore to accept his denial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., Sir, has consistently striven to unite

all anti-colonial forces in Singapore so that at the

next Merdeka talks we can present a solid and united

front  to  the  Colonial Office. We have  repeatedly

called for a Merdeka convention of all anti-colonial

forces  in Singapore. But some people have  got  the

impression,  by  the  way  the  Chief  Minister  has

started   to   attack   anti-colonial   groups   and

individuals,  that  the next Merdeka  convention  of

anti-colonial forces will only be held inside Changi

Prison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Middle Road Group of Trade Unions

has  also consistently striven in the past  year  to

achieve  unity  in the trade union  movement.  These

efforts,  too,  have  been sabotaged  by  the  Chief

Minister's  American friends in the I.C.F.T.U. like

Mr George Weaver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sought the unity of all anti-colonial forces in

Singapore because we knew that this was the only way

to ensure success at the next Merdeka talks. We gave

the  Chief Minister a vote of confidence because  we

hoped he would do the right thing to prepare for the

next  Merdeka  talks.  We expected  that  those  who

sincerely  wanted  Merdeka  would  take   steps   to

strengthen the forces of Merdeka - the anti-colonial

groups,  organisations and individuals of Singapore;

but  the  Chief Minister seemed bent on a policy  of

destroying the very basis of Merdeka, the democratic

and    constitutional   anti-colonial   forces    of

Singapore.  His Government struck off  the  register

seven  Chinese school teachers without  proving  any

charges  against them. Then came the arrest  of  Tan

Lay  Boon,  a prominent trade unionist. Again  there

was  no attempt to produce any concrete evidence  to

justify the arrest. Then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



suddenly on the 18th and 19th of September came  the

outrage against democratic liberties and freedom  of

association.  Seven  persons,  including   prominent

trade  unionists and leaders of civic organisations,

were  arrested  under  banishment  orders  and   one

detained  under  the Public Security Ordinance.  The

Women's  Federation  and  the  Chinese  Brass   Gong

Musical  Society  were  dissolved.  Meanwhile,   the

permanent  colonial  officials in  the  Ministry  of

Education, aided by the internal security boys, were

preparing the Minister for Education to suppress the

students'  movement;  and  on  the  24th  came   the

Minister   for  Education's  bellicose  announcement

banning the Chinese Middle School Students Union. On

the night of 3rd October, Soon Loh Boon, Chairman of

the  Students' Union, was detained. On the following

morning  Mr  Chia  Ek Tian, one  of  our  Assistant

Secretaries  in  the Union, was also  detained.  Our

challenge to the Chief Minister to produce  concrete

evidence  to prove the charges against the  arrested

persons   and  the  dissolved  societies  has   been

arrogantly   turned   down.  Only   vague   alarmist

allegations  of Communism and Communist  inspiration

have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the statements made by the Minister for

Education   make  even  the  witch-hunting   Senator

McCarthy  of  America look reasonable  and  slightly

more   educated  in  comparison.  At  least  Senator

McCarthy  never  carried  the  logic  of  his  anti-Communism  to  the same extent as our  Minister  for

Education.  According to our Minister for Education,

the  collective study groups among Chinese  students

are Communist, because the Communists also have such

study  groups. By this logic, study group  movements

throughout the world must be Communist. The  Chinese

Communists eat rice. Our Minister for Education also

sometimes  eats rice. Therefore, he too  must  be  a

Communist!  Englishmen prefer  their  tea  at4  p.m.

Asians  who drink their tea at 4 p.m. are  therefore

Englishmen! Americans drive about in American  cars.

Harry Lee also drives an American car.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  Harry Lee is an American! Self-criticism

is  practised  by the Communists. Therefore,  nobody

must  criticise himself! We must all pretend  to  be

saints. Truly we have a wonderfully educated  person

in  our  Minister for Education! His logic is simply

shattering. It has already completely shattered  him

in the eyes of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hysterical allegations, systematic propagation of

anti-Communist  hysteria - such  are  the   typical

methods  employed  by  anti-progressive  and   anti-democratic  forces the world over. The only  way  to

expose  these methods is to demand again  and  again

for  the  proof  of these allegations by  democratic

process in an open court of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the Hon. the Chief Minister to prove

the  charges  against the arrested persons  and  the

organisations  concerned by  democratic  process  in

open  court, or else be branded forever as a  witch-hunting  politician who is playing the  Devil's  own

game  with the destinies of the people of Singapore.

I  challenge  him to deny that he  has  not  made  a

shameful backdoor deal with Mr Lennox-Boyd and  the

Colonial  Office  to  feed the constitutional  anti-colonial forces of Singapore to the gaping  jaws  of

colonial  repression in return for  a  sham  Merdeka

which will be safe for colonial vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was responsible for the arrests? The Press

quotes  the  Chief Minister as saying that  colonial

officials  were not responsible for the arrests  but

that   he  and  the  other  elected  Ministers  were

responsible  for  the decision taken.  Whom  is  the

Chief Minister trying to bluff? Everybody knows that

internal   security  is  controlled  by  the   Chief

Secretary  who sits beside him and that  the  recent

repressive measures could therefore only  have  been

taken  on the initiative and instigation of colonial

officials. How loyal of the Chief Minister  to  keep

out  of public sight his colonial back-seat drivers!

He  will, no doubt, be included in the next  Queen's

Birthday  Honours List! But the people  elected  him

not   to  protect  colonial  officials  from  public

censure  but  to  protect  the  people  against  the

actions of colonial officials.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister proudly talks about "My

Government"!  Whom is he trying to bluff?  Everybody

knows   that  under  the  Rendel  Constitution   the

Colonial  Office controls all the key positions  and

retains  ultimate control. If the elected  Ministers

think   that   the  present  Government   is   their

Government, why reopen the next Merdeka  talks?  Has

the   Chief  Minister  and  his  elected  colleagues

forgotten   so  quickly  that  the  previous   Chief

Minister  declared that the Rendel Constitution  was

unworkable,  a  point of view with which  they  then

agreed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has declared that the people of

Singapore   support   the   Government's   acts   of

repression.  I challenge him to have the  moral  and

political  courage to put that statement  to  strict

proof  thereof. Let him organise a public referendum

of  the  electorate of Singapore and let him promise

to  treat the result of the referendum as a vote  of

confidence  in  his Government. We  say  with  every

confidence that the vast majority of the  people  of

Singapore  will declare against him. I have  already

challenged the Chief Minister to go back to his  own

constituency  in  Havelock.  He  knows  what  their

verdict will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, who actually supports the Chief

Minister in his acts of repression? The public  have

not  failed  to  note that the Straits  Times,  that

mouthpiece  of  British  vested  interests  in  this

country  and  purveyor of cheap  sensationalism  and

hysterical, unreasoning anti-Communism, regards  the

Chief  Minister as a great hero. The Chief  Minister

has  been described by this paper as "A Man  with  a

Mission"  and  "The  Man  who  rose  to  the  hour".

Politically, Sir, I would be terribly embarrassed if

this British-owned paper ever said a good word about

me  or  my colleagues. We think that it is perfectly

natural   for  a  paper  like  the  Straits   Times,

representing reactionary colonial vested  interests,

to  blast the P.A.P. and Middle Road every day as  a

matter of religious duty. We would be very surprised

if  it  did not, for it is our declared aim to bring

to  an  end the political dominion of British vested

interests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore. The Straits Times only favours  those

who,  in its opinion, are playing the colonial game,

and  the  Straits  Times has become an  enthusiastic

supporter of the Chief Minister. Further comment  is

unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Press reports, our Chief Minister has

also  become  a hero in the eyes of Washington.  All

Asia knows that Washington is cold to the Nehrus and

Sukarnos  and  Nassers, but in our  Chief  Minister,

Washington apparently sees a new Syngman Rhee, or  a

new  Chiang  Kai-shek in the making. The  people  of

Singapore  cannot be proud that their elected  Chief

Minister should find himself in the company  of  the

friends   of  these  discredited  stool-pigeons   of

foreign   imperialisms  in  Asia.  Does  the   Chief

Minister  have  any doubt that the  people  of  this

country  would very much prefer him  to  be  in  the

illustrious  company of great Asian liberators  like

Nehru,  Sukarno and Nasser? But to be worthy of  the

company of a Nehru, our Chief Minister would have to

be  prepared  to  go  to jail fighting  against  the

colonial  repression of his people.  But  our  Chief

Minister  has  chosen, unlike Nehru,  to  become  an

instrument  of  colonial  repression  of  democratic

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has threatened the anti-colonial forces in Singapore that he will make

further arbitrary arrests if necessary. He is making

a  fatal and suicidal political blunder if he thinks

that   he  can  cow  the  anti-colonial  people   of

Singapore into submission. We are not afraid. We are

not   frightened  of  such  threats.  We   are   not

frightened because the genuine anti-colonial Merdeka

forces  of  Singapore  are not  confined  to  a  few

individuals.  The Merdeka movement has  struck  deep

roots in the hearts and minds of people of all races

and  all  classes. A hundred Hon. Mr Lim Yew  Hocks

cannot destroy this movement. A hundred Hon. Mr Lim

Yew  Hocks will only find their political graves  in

trying  to  destroy  this  invincible  movement  for

freedom and democratic rights for the people of this

country. This movement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



is  an  organic  part of the mighty current  of  the

Asian  revolution. The greatest military  powers  of

the  Western  world have had to retreat before  this

invincible current, and the Hon. Mr Lim Yew Hock is

nothing in comparison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask

the  elected  Members  of  this  House  to  consider

carefully before they vote on this motion,  for  the

people  who elected us are watching us very closely.

How  we  vote and what we say is going to  determine

our political future. We must say clearly which side

we  are on - on the side of the people of Singapore in

the  fight for democratic rights, or on the side  of

ill-concealed  colonial  repression.  I   also   ask

Members  not  to  be  diverted  by  what  the  Chief

Minister will say to this motion. I can tell them in

advance what he will say. He will cry Communism.  He

will  quote  reports from his political advisers  in

the  Special  Branch.  But I  will  guarantee  this:

whatever  the Chief Minister might say, he will  not

offer to prove his charges by democratic process  in

an  open  court, and because of this, what  he  says

will possess no value at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also call the attention of elected Members

of this Assembly to a resolution of the Civil Rights

Convention  in  which  were  represented  106  trade

unions  and other public organisations, representing

in  all  about  200,000 people. This Convention  has

asked  our Assemblymen to make the following demands

to the Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That all the arrested persons be either given

a fair public trial or be unconditionally released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That an impartial public tribunal be appointed

to  go  into  the  charges made  against  the  three

dissolved  societies, and that if the Government  is

not  prepared  to  do this, the  ban  on  all  these

organisations be immediately lifted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) That Government give an assurance to the

public  that  no further arbitrary arrests  will  be

made   and   that   freedom   of   association   and

constitutional  organisation  will  be  scrupulously

respected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) That the Labour Front Coalition Government

will  strive,  by all possible means, to  strengthen

and   consolidate  the  unity  of  all  genuine  and

constitutional anti-colonial forces in Singapore  as

an  essential  pre-requisite to the success  of  the

next Merdeka talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just and democratic demands. We elected

Members of this Assembly can only ignore them at our

political peril.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last warning to the Chief Minister. My Party

and  my Union have already said that we will use all

possible   peaceful  and  constitutional  means   to

protest  against Government's action, and the  Chief

Minister has assured a delegation from my Union that

he  will  afford  every facility  for  peaceful  and

constitutional  protest.  I  shall  hold  the  Chief

Minister to his promise for his own good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

move an amendment to the motion before the House.  I

submit copies of this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Chief Minister please read

his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to leave out all the words after the word 'House'

to  the  end  of  the Question and  to  add  instead

thereof  the  following words, 'takes  note  of  the

recent  arrests of six persons under the  Banishment

Ordinance  and one person under the Preservation  of

Public Security Ordinance and the dissolution of two

societies, and welcomes the strong action  taken  by

the   Government  against  subversive  elements   in

Singapore.' "



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of Chief Minister's amendment distributed

to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amended

motion, therefore, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House takes note of the recent arrests

of  six  persons under the Banishment Ordinance  and

one person under the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



the  dissolution of two societies, and welcomes  the

strong   action  taken  by  the  Government  against

subversive elements in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had made it clear in the Press that the

Government   would  justify  its   actions   against

subversive      elements     and     Communist-front

organisations  at this sitting of the Assembly,  and

this  debate, Sir, will give an opportunity  to  the

people  of Singapore to have a clear picture of  the

political ideology of the various political  Parties

represented in this Assembly and of each  and  every

Assemblyman. And I move my amendment in the  fullest

confidence that it will receive the full support  of

all  Members  who sincerely believe in and  practise

democracy. This Government does not care to have the

support of those who claim to love Singapore, to owe

loyalty  to Singapore, and yet are doing their  very

best  to destroy the security and well-being of  the

people  of Singapore. This Government does not  care

to  have  the support of such people. It  is  better

that  such Assemblymen declare themselves  here  and

now  so  that the people of Singapore can know  them

for what they are and not what they pretend to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government ordered the arrests of six persons

under  the Banishment Ordinance and one person under

the  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,  and

the  dissolution  of  two organisations;  and  these

orders  were  executed on the 18th and the  19th  of

September. Since then, one further organisation  has

been  dissolved  and  two other  persons  have  been

arrested  under the Preservation of Public  Security

Ordinance.  The arrests were ordered on the  grounds

that  the persons concerned had been taking part  in

subversive  activities which definitely are  not  in

the  best  interests and security of the  people  of

Singapore;   and   the   three  organisations   were

dissolved  because the Government is satisfied  that

they were Communist-front organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some people have quite rightly

asked  me  why the Government should have  found  it

necessary to take this action when there is apparent

peace  and quiet in Singapore. May I add, Sir,  that

the Government has channels of information which are

not normally at the disposal of the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



public?  They are not aware that this is a dangerous

quiet.  They  are not aware that there  has  been  a

change   in  Communist  strategy.  There  has   been

intensive penetration into a wide field of otherwise

laudable  activities which is building up a position

of  a powerful force that threatens the whole future

of  democratic government. The aim is to control the

masses  through  united front,  of  workers  through

trade unions, of youth through students' unions,  of

peasants  through farmers' associations, and  attap-dwellers'   associations,  of   the   intelligentsia

through     teachers,    literary    and    cultural

organisations,   of   women  through   the   women's

federation, and of political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was confronted with this growing

menace  when it took office last June, but no action

was  taken because we were biding our time and  were

gathering  more  and  more news intelligence  before

launching on our campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, Sir, the Government faced its first

Assembly   sitting,  and  on  the  debate   on   the

Governor's  Address  I made it  very  clear  to  the

Assembly, among other things, the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I was personally not anxious to become Chief

Minister, and still am not anxious, but that I  took

on  this  office,  an  onerous  and  difficult  job,

because I sincerely believed that it was required of

me and that I had the confidence of the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This Government, I repeat, is not a caretaker

Government  in the accepted sense of the word.  This

Government is a caretaker Government in  so  far  as

its life is concerned. During its life the machinery

of  government will be in full swing, and whether we

govern wisely or not time will tell; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I assured hon. Members that during the

intervening  period  before  the  reopening  of  the

constitutional talks in London, this Government will

do everything in its power to bring about a state of

affairs  that will not only be conducive to  success

but  also  in  the best interests of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, was gratified to receive a

unanimous vote of confidence, and this has  made  us

more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



aware of our duty to the people of Singapore. In the

discharge of this sacred duty, my colleagues  and  I

are  determined to stop the corruption of the people

of  Singapore  by  what  is a  vast  secret  society

working  for  Communist  domination.  As  I   stated

earlier,  this  Government  is  satisfied  that  the

Women's  Federation, the Chinese Brass Gong  Musical

Society  and  the  Singapore Chinese  Middle  School

Students'    Union   have   become   Communist-front

organisations. They have, therefore, been  dissolved

and  those  who  perverted these otherwise  laudable

associations  to make them instruments of  Communism

must be checked and, if necessary, removed from  our

midst.   Hence   the  arrests  for  banishment   and

detention. I would like, Sir, to assure hon. Members

that  this action was taken only after very  lengthy

and  serious  consideration, and once this  decision

has been taken, the Government intends to pursue  relentlessly its action against subversive activities.

The  interests, the security and the welfare of  the

people of Singapore demand this of us, and we  shall

not fail them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the distortion of

facts  by  our  opponents, I find  it  necessary  to

repeat  in this Assembly that the decision  to  take

this  action  against subversive activities  in  the

best interests of the people of Singapore rests with

the  elected  Ministers. Although  the  question  of

internal  security is in the portfolio of the  Chief

Secretary, the question of policy does not lie  with

him.  It lies with the Council of Ministers  and  if

the elected Government, which is in the majority  in

the  Council,  does  not  subscribe  to  any  policy

regarding internal security, the Chief Secretary  is

powerless to enforce it. My colleagues and  I,  Sir,

therefore  accept  full  responsibility   for   this

action.  We  stand firm in our resolve and  we  face

squarely any criticism, and even any abuse  that  is

being  hurled  at  us.  Do not therefore  blame  the

colonial officials. Put the blame where it  is  due,

if  we  are  indeed blameworthy. Do  not  blame  the

police and the Special Branch, for they are there to

execute the orders of the Council of Ministers,  and

I  would  like  to take this opportunity  to  pay  a

tribute  to  their loyalty and to their devotion  to

duty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



And  because I categorically stated that the elected

Ministers   accepted   full   responsibility,    our

opponents were therefore deprived of the pleasure of

hurling their abuse at the officials. They therefore

directed their vile epithets at me, and called me  a

"colonial  stooge". Sir, the very mention  of  these

words  recalls to my mind the meeting  which  I  had

with representatives of seven organisations who came

to  see  me  in  connection  with  the  Government's

action.   At  that  meeting,  Sir,  after  listening

patiently   to  their  representations   and   after

answering the points raised by them, I turned  round

to  their  leader and asked whether by  a  statement

which  he had made earlier he implied that I  was  a

colonial  stooge. Silence. Silence. I repeated  this

question  three times and after much hesitation  and

whispered  consultation he turned round  to  me  and

replied,  "I  must consult our members."  These  so-called  champions of democracy have  to  have  their

thinking done for them! For nearly nine years have I

served  the  people of Singapore in the  Legislative

Council  and in this Assembly, and I would therefore

leave it to the public to form their own judgment. I

can  say  with  a  clear conscience  that  I  am  no

colonial  stooge.  And my answer to  my  friends  is

"Thank God, I am no Communist stooge!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that since this  Government

took  strong action against subversive elements,  my

colleague  the  Minister for Education  and  I  have

received a number of death threats. Both of us  have

declared  that we are not deterred by these threats.

I   repeat:   this  Government  intends   to   fight

subversive  elements to the bitter  end.  I  am  not

saying this with any sense of bravado. No, Sir. I am

saying  this with all solemnity, for it is a  solemn

task  that this Government has set out to do - to wipe

out  subversive activities in the best interests  of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against these death threats, Sir, I am glad to

say that I have received a greater number of letters

of  congratulations and wholehearted support - not the

142 organisations referred to - but these are from men

who signed their names.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Looking for a job!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No! And I have already written

to them, Sir, thanking them for their support  for

our   action,  and  I  would  like  to   take   this

opportunity of thanking them once again  and  giving

them the appreciation of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Hon. Members will have read in the Press of the

two  interviews which I had given to representatives

of  the  so-called Middle Road group, and I  do  not

therefore  propose to weary them  with  an  account.

Suffice  it  to say that they protested against  our

action which was in the best interests of the people

of  Singapore. Hon. Members will also have  read  in

the  Press of my receiving a delegation representing

142 organisations. This has been touched upon by  my

hon.  Friend the Member for Tanjong Pagar. They came

to  me,  Sir,  and  handed to me signed  pledges  of

support  of our action against subversive  elements.

They came to me of their own accord. Because of  the

pledges that I had received, I took sustenance  from

their support and I have assured them, too, that the

Government will carry on the fight to rid  Singapore

of subversive elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I received a letter from an

organisation,  loosely described  as  the  Singapore

Trade  Unions  Working Committee,  which  claims  to

represent  95 trade unions. My office  asked  for  a

list  of  the names of the 95 trade unions which  it

alleges  to claim, but to-date this information  has

not  been  supplied. This is most  significant,  and

hon. Members can draw their own conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these arrested persons have been described by

their  comrades  as civic leaders and  champions  of

Merdeka.  Six of these persons are not  local  born.

They  owe  their  loyalty elsewhere.  The  remaining

three  persons, while local born, have been  engaged

in  subversive activities aimed at the overthrow  of

democratic  government. Merdeka indeed! Merdeka  for

whom?  This  is  indeed a classic  example  of  that

specious and contemptible device - the greater the lie

the greater the chance of it being put over.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



The  people  of  Singapore desire to be  masters  of

their own fate and have no intention of changing one

master for another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chia Ek Tian, Sir, was arrested on 2nd October

under  the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance

as  the Government has good reasons to believe  that

he  is  involved in subversive activities.  Chia  Ek

Tian is the Secretary of the Bukit Panjang Branch of

the Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union. He  is

also a member of the Central Committee of the P.A.P.

Representatives of the P.A.P. came to  see  me  last

Tuesday  and I assured them that the action was  not

directed against the P.A.P. but because of  Chia  Ek

Tian's  individual activities. The P.A.P. issued  a

statement to the Press, and I quote therefrom:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That an executive member of a rival constitutional

political  party could be arrested and detained  for

two weeks pending a police report reflects the grave

threat  to personal rights and liberties under  this

Government.   The   harassing  of  one's   political

opponents  by  these extraordinary powers  negatives

the  claim  that  the  Government  is  fighting   to

establish democracy in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the P.A.P. suggest, Sir, that the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance should not

be  applied  to  any  executive member  of  a  rival

constitutional political Party, even  though  he  is

found  to  be  taking part in subversion?  Does  the

P.A.P. suggest that such executive member should  be

given  free rein in his subversive activities  which

are  detrimental to the security and  well-being  of

the  people of Singapore? This Government, as I have

said  many  a  time,  intends  to  put  an  end   to

subversive  activities of all persons, whoever  they

may  be,  even  if they are members  of  the  Labour

Front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me repeat, Sir, that Chia Ek Tian was not

arrested  because he is an executive member  of  the

P.A.P.,  but  because of his individual  activities.

But  the  fact  that he is a member of  the  Central

Committee of the P.A.P., that he is the Secretary of

the  Bukit  Panjang Branch of the Singapore  Factory

and  Shop  Workers  Union, is an indication  to  the

public of the extent to which infiltration has taken

place in these two organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this subject, Sir, I would like to repeat

my  assurance to the workers of Singapore  that  the

Government's  action  is in  no  way  aimed  at  the

legitimate activities of democratic trade unions and

trade unionists. The Government's policy has already

been  and  will always be to support and assist  all

democratic trade unions. I would therefore  ask  the

workers  of  Singapore  not  to  be  misled  by  the

malicious   lies  of  the  so-called  champions   of

Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government desires to express the

gratitude  of  the  people  of  Singapore   to   the

Federation  Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman,  for

his   strong  support  of  the  Government's  action

against subversive elements. Knowing the Tunku as  I

do,  Sir,  I  am  sure he will render Singapore  all

possible assistance when called upon to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no government can abdicate its

duty  to  protect  its citizens and  it  is  in  the

execution of this duty that the Banishment Ordinance

is  invoked against these six persons who  were  not

born  in  Singapore. These persons are enjoying  our

hospitality,   and  yet  they  were   planning   and

conniving  in subversive activities with'  the  sole

intention  of disrupting and destroying our  way  of

life. To allow them to stay with the knowledge  that

the  Government  has of their vile activities  would

amount  to  condoning their evil work and  betraying

the  trust the people of Singapore have imposed upon

elected leaders and their elected Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight the evil in our midst it is absolutely

essential to use the special powers conferred on the

Government  by  the  Banishment  Ordinance  and  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.  I  would

like  to assure hon. Members that these powers  will

only  be  used where my colleagues and I  are  fully

satisfied  that  they  are  necessary  in  the  best

interests  of  the  people  of  Singapore.  We  will

exercise  them  with  the utmost circumspection  and

with  the  keenest  sense of responsibility  to  the

individual  as well as to the State,  and  to  prove

this,  Sir, I give the following figures of  arrests

under  the Banishment Ordinance and the Preservation

of Public Security Ordinance:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders of banishment issued between 26th April, 1955, and 18th September, 1956, that is, from the

time  of the first sitting of the last session  till 18th September, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For subversive activities - 17. This includes the

six  arrests made on 18th September, 1956. The other

11  are  made up as follows: nine, after conviction;

two,   without  conviction;  one,  after  banishment

enquiry; and one, an Advisory case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminal cases - 40.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total - 57, including the six, for the period

between 26th April, 1955, and 18th September, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of persons arrested and detained under the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  from  the

date of the Ordinance (21st October, 1955), nearly a

year ago, to 18th September, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total detention orders made - 24, made up as

follows: four convicted; five released on suspension

order; five have departed; one was released; one  is

at  the Rehabilitation Centre; eight still detained.

In addition, one direction order was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures, Sir, clearly illustrate that the

Government   gives   very   serious   consideration,

examines  every  case  on  its  individual  merits,

before issuing any order for arrest under these  two

Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been alleged by the Member for Bukit

Timah  that  the  action which this  Government  has

taken against subversive elements is the result of a

deal which I had made with the Colonial Office. This

allegation is utterly ridiculus and is just  another

artifice designed to distort real conditions and the

real  sentiments of the great majority of the people

of  Singapore.  Is  he suggesting that  the  elected

Government must stand by tamely and take  no  action

to  protect the security of the people of Singapore?

The  primary duty of this Government, and indeed  of

any  government, is to provide for  the  safety  and

security of the people of Singapore, and it  is  not

going to deviate from this duty. We either govern or

we do not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to pay tribute to the public for

remaining calm throughout these trying days. I would

like  to  appeal to them to take heart and  to  join

forces  to  put an end to this evil that is  in  our

midst. With their support and their cooperation, the

work which the Government has set out to do will  be

made much easier and surer of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee)</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Obviously the Minister

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of Amendment resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second  the  amendment moved by the Hon. the  Chief

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, we heard from the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) a forecast of what  is  to

happen  in the next elections, a forecast reinforced

by  a  series  of quotations of what the  masses  of

right-thinking people are thinking. I  am  surprised

that  a  man,  who has such a fine  command  of  the

English language as he has, should have descended to

that  abuse  of  the language - that double  talk  for

which  the Communists are responsible. He speaks  of

"masses"  when  he  really  means  "minorities".  He

speaks  of  "right-thinking people"  when  he  means

people  whose  ability to think for  themselves  has

been  killed by the insistent brain-washing to which

they have been subjected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar ridiculed the support

which the Government has received for its action. He

condemns some of the associations because he has not

heard  of  them.  He has not heard of  them  because

picked men have been doing the hearing for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



him. Is not his Party always claiming the support of

so   many  hundreds  of  associations  and  so  many

thousands of supporters and members? But can he deny

that  many of the members of these associations  are

so  because they have been intimidated into joining?

Thousands  are  counted over and over again  because

they are members of many different associations. How

many  members of the Middle Schools Students' Union,

for  instance, are members also of the multitude  of

the  so-called Old Boys' Association,  Old  Boys  of

Primary   Schools  and  of  the  various   so-called

cultural societies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one part of the speech made by

the Member for Tanjong Pagar this morning with which

I  agree. I refer to the part in which he touched on

the  consequences of dictatorial action. The  action

of  this Government has been taken simply and solely

to  prevent  the young and immature mind from  being

taught  how to practise the art of dictatorship  and

yet  win  the  support of weak-kneed  and  spineless

adults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also spoke of the free play of

ideas. Mr Speaker, Sir, when you have heard what  I

have to say, you will be able to judge whether there

is  any  free play of ideas in the Students'  Union,

any  free  play of ideas among these young  students

who, by their malleable nature, have had their minds

perverted  and  twisted  to think  along  the  lines

dictated  to  them by unscrupulous, cowardly  adults

who  embrace  an ideology alien to all  of  us.  The

Government,  as  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has

pointed out, will not tolerate such subversive  acts

perpetrated by aliens or local persons whose loyalty

lies  elsewhere.  You  have  only  to  look  at  the

audacity of the students who flout the law. One does

not  have  to  go far to see how our young  students

have  been  forced to do and to think. Thousands  of

our  middle school students sang Communist songs and

held   protest  meetings  in  their  classrooms   to

celebrate  Peking's  National Day.  Where  is  their

loyalty?  People talk glibly of Merdeka on  the  one

hand  while, on the other, they go out of their  way

to encourage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



would-be  voters to turn their heads to Peking,  the

New  China, Mao Tse-tung, Lenin, Krushchev,  Stalin,

and a host of other Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, hon. Members received a White Paper,

No.  Cmd.  53  of 1956, entitled "Singapore  Chinese

Middle  Schools  Students' Union". The  contents  in

this Paper are factual statements backed by concrete

proofs.  After reading it and after I have  finished

with  my  account of the reasons for the arrests  of

the  students and teachers connected with subversion

and  the grounds on which the Government has decided

to  ban  the  Students' Union, I am sure  that  hon.

Members  will  have  no doubts  whatsoever  of  the

justifiable  and  wise action taken  by  Government.

Before  I  do so, I would like to draw the attention

of  hon. Members to a few factual statements printed

on page 1 of the White Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1951, the Central Bureau of the Malayan

Communist  Party issued a directive on the  "Party's

Urgent Tasks", one of which was defined in this way:





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center">Cultural Working Personnel.</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town organisations must train up working

personnel,  particularly  young  cultural   working

personnel,  to  send out to operate  in  the  rural

areas.  To  this end it is very necessary  for  the

Party  to  be active among Middle School  Students,

and  this  aspect  of our work  must  be  completed

satisfactorily.



<br><br>Similarly,  in a later M.C.P. directive  dated  11th

June, 1956, it was laid down that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of winning over the school children is

very   important   and  must  not  be   overlooked. Especially  in  circumstances where  the  enemy  is

stronger  than we are, the work of winning  support

from   school  children  and  organising  them   to

struggle    is   more   important   than   military

activities.



<br><br>Clearly  the  schools  were a target  for  Communist

exploitation   as   another   instrument   for   the

achievement of power by the M.C.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement was made in 1955 by a Chinese Middle

School  student who was an official of the Singapore

Chinese  Middle Schools Students' Union and  at  the

same  time  an under-cover agent for the  M.C.P.  He

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage the Government was about to permit

registration  (of  the  Singapore  Chinese   Middle Schools Students' Union) under the conditions  that

students   should  not  take  part   in   political

activities  or  interfere  with  labour   disputes. Representatives   of   the  Preparatory   Committee

refused  to  accept  this  proviso  and  this   was

considered   by  the  Party  Organisation   to   be

stupid... The Union should accept such conditions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



outwardly  but  carry on with political  activities

afterwards ...The decision to register the Union with

the  proviso  was  undoubtedly made  by  the  Party Organisation and accepted by the S.C.M.S.S.U."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to show you, Mr Speaker, in

detail how the activities of the Union have followed

unmistakably  the Communist pattern. The  difficulty

has  been, not to find supporting evidence,  but  to

decide  what  to  select from the enormous  mass  of

material  obtained  from papers published,  speeches

made and actions taken by officials of the Union and

by  leaders of the Communist countries whose stooges

they have been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided to dissolve the Union

because  its activities were incompatible  with  the

peace and good order of this colony, and because  it

was  being  used for purposes which conflicted  with

its  objects or rules as entered in the Register  of

Societies. The grounds for the first charge are that

the Union had become a Communist-front organisation,

that  it  had  been penetrated by  elements  of  the

M.C.P., and that it had used intimidatory methods to

oppose  Government policy and school authority;  and

for  the second, that it had persistently flouted  a

condition  in its rules that it should not take  part

in politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Communists have been for several years in

armed  revolt  against constitutional government  in

Malaya  and anyone who aids them is an enemy of  the

people.  The charges that the Union is a  Communist-front  organisation and that it has been  penetrated

by   the  M.C.P. are  therefore  exceedingly  grave

charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a Communist-front organisation? It is

simply  an  organisation which allows itself  to  be

used  for Communist purposes. It may or may not have

members  who are Communists; if it has, then  it  is

all the more dangerous because it can be manipulated

more  effectively  to  serve  Communist  ends.   The

Students'  Union has been infiltrated by the  M.C.P.

and, since its registration in October last year,  4

members  of  whom 3 were officials have  had  to  be

detained under the Preservation of Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



Security  Ordinance. In all 4 cases, the Council  of

Ministers  was  quite  satisfied  that  the   M.C.P.

connections did, in fact, exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the 3 officials handed over to the Police a

large  number of M.C.P. documents including a series

of  secret  party  publications entitled  Study,  in

which  stress was laid upon the importance of  study

to  help comrades to further the revolution; of  the

three  magic weapons - the leadership of the Communist

Party,   the   armed  struggle,   and   the   united

front - which  experience  has  shown   them   to   be

fundamentally  suited  for  use  in   the   national

liberation  movements in the colonies; of  criticism

and  self-criticism as a means to unity; and of  the

development of workers and student movements to help

the mass struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a middle school pupil was found in

possession of a series of party education  documents

entitled   "Hsueh   Hsi"   ("Study")   which    have

undoubtedly  influenced  the  methods  used  by  the

Union.   The  pupil  was  convicted  in  court   and

sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is irrefutable evidence then that the

Communists  had penetrated into the Union.  What  of

the  charge  that it had behaved in a Communist  way

and   allowed  itself  to  be  used  for   Communist

purposes?  Here there is much evidence - for  example,

of  its  close  collaboration with other  Communist-front  organisations such as the Women's  Federation

and the various so-called cultural societies; of its

use  of the well-known Communist practices of  hsueh

hsi and of criticism and self-criticism to condition

the  minds  of  its  members  to  accept  the  party

line - that  I  must deal with at much greater  length later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting and revealing to trace the

increasing  use  by  the  Union  of  all  well-tried

Communist techniques and I therefore propose to give

you, first of all, a short survey of the origins  of

the  Union, of its `struggle' for registration,  and

of    its   development   into   a   Communist-front

organisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will remember the introduction  into

this country of a scheme for National Service, which

required just a few of the army of able-bodied young

men  to  give  up an hour or two a week  to  undergo

training  principally for the Civil  Defence  Corps.

For  any young man who professed to be loyal to this

country,  this  service  should  have  been  not  a'

hardship  to  be  avoided  but  a  privilege  to  be

undertaken proudly and willingly. Yet soon after the

registration began, it became obvious that there was

increasingly  organised opposition  in  the  Chinese

Middle  Schools, and eventually a 55-man  delegation

was  appointed with the high-sounding title  of  the

"Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Students Appealing

for Exemption from National Service Delegation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That delegation eventually gave way to a

preparatory  committee which on the 9th of  October,

1954, made a Press release about the proposal to set

up  a Chinese Middle Schools Students' Union. On the

7th  of  January, 1955, the first formal application

for  the  Union  to be registered was  made  to  the

Registrar  of  Societies.  It  was  refused  on  the

grounds  that the Union would be used for  political

purposes  and  its registration would  therefore  be

against the public interest. On the 22nd of January,

a second application was made and when this also was

refused, there was violent agitation in the  Chinese

Press   and   appeals  for  support   to   all   the

organisations  of the extreme Left. At  the  end  of

March, the pupils of the middle schools organised  a

one-day  sit-down  strike  in  protest  against  the

continued  refusal  to register  the  society.  This

strike  was very much a threat to the newly  elected

Coalition  Government, which harboured  nothing  but

goodwill  to all men. I will not say that  it  could

see  no  wrong  in  anyone,  but  it  was  naturally

reluctant   to  place  any  restriction   upon   the

activities of any section of the community unless it

had  certain proof that these activities  would  be

detrimental  to  the interests of the  people  as  a

whole.  You  will, no doubt, remember the  flood  of

metaphors  about the position in the Chinese  middle

schools  at  that time. It was said,  for  instance,

that the body



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



educational was a sick child which required  careful

nursing, and although it was suggested that  a  more

fitting  analogy  would have  been  to  an  infected

patient  who  ought  to  be  isolated,  or  to   one

suffering from a rapidly spreading cancer for  which

only the surgeon's knife could provide the cure, the

Government, nevertheless, believed that  its  proper

course   was   to  give  these  young   people   the

opportunity  to show that they could be  trusted  to

work  for  the common good. Of course,  we  had  our

doubts  about  the  wisdom of registering - doubts  on

educational as well as political grounds. We thought

that authority should be vested in the principal and

teachers, perhaps with the possibility of appeal  to

the supervisor as the representative of the managers

in   matters   which  particularly  affected   their

interests. We foresaw the danger of introducing into

the  schools another body which might claim  control

over  the  pupils,  a  control  which  might  easily

conflict with the authority of those legally set  in

authority over them. It needed little imagination to

foresee  the  dangers  of  their  participation   in

politics  and  in  trade disputes. Indeed  they  had

already   given   not   only  the   Government   but

representatives  of  all Parties  in  this  Assembly

cause  to  fear  the  harm they might  do  by  their

activities  in these fields. Let me quote  from  the

Report   of  the  All-Party  Committee  on   Chinese

Education. Paragraph 86 reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whilst taking such a sympathetic approach towards

students' discussion of politics, we must beware  of

the fact that there is a danger that healthy student

activities  and  enthusiasm  could  be  misused   by

political  groups whose intentions are to use  these

student   activities   to   overthrow   a   lawfully

constituted   Government   unconstitutionally.    In

welcoming students taking an intelligent interest in

politics  since they will shortly take their  places

as  adult  members of the population,  whether  they

come  from English schools or Chinese schools, there

should,  however, be constant vigilance to see  that

any  particular form of normal student  activity  is

not  perverted by groups whose sole intention is  to

overthrow  a  lawfully  constituted  Government   by

unlawful activities."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this danger was understood, the Committee

thought  that the possibilities for good  outweighed

the possibilities for evil. Paragraph 82 of the same

Report states that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there are activities which could result in a

better   Singapore   and  in  which   the   student

participation would not

only  be welcomed, but would give them the sense  of

worthwhile  achievement, of responsibility,  and  of

valuable training in citizenship - practical duties of

building  up,  of  contributing to  security  and  a

better  way  of life, of combating disease,  poverty

and  ignorance, not of fostering feelings of  hatred

and  dissension.  They should devote  themselves  to

their  studies and make good use of the  educational

and  career  opportunities which will  presently  be

opened  to  them,  and  thus  serve  Singapore   and

Malaya."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then in paragraph 83 of the same Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We noted with deep satisfaction, whilst this

Report  was  being  finalised,  that  the  Singapore

Chinese  Students'  Union  had  been  accepted   for

registration as a Society, on stipulating  that  the

members  as a body would not participate in politics

nor  in  industrial strife of any kind.  We  endorse

this decision."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Parties therefore had their doubts, yet all

Parties   were  then  agreed  that  Government   was

justified  in  giving  the opportunity  to  do  good

before it denied the opportunity to do evil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see now how the Union responded to the

trust  reposed in them by the Government  and  other

elected  Members  of this Assembly.  The  Union  was

registered on the 6th of October, 1955. On the  very

next  day - I  repeat,  the very  next  day - the  Union

organised Victory celebrations. An outsider would no

doubt   attribute   this  to  a   natural   youthful

exuberance  and happiness. So it may have  been  for

some  of the misguided boys and girls who took part.

But  the  celebrations quickly  assumed  a  sinister

meaning.  The  victory  was attributed  not  to  the

generosity on the part of the Government but to "the

glorious  bloodshed of May the 13th and to the  sit-down  strike  of the 30th of March".  There  was  an

attack on the Public Security Bill - said to be  "more

ruthless than the Emergency Regulations" - and demands

for  the release of detainees. The Union had started

off  as  it  meant  to  continue,  with  a  flagrant

defiance of the authority of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the Union wrote to the Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce demanding their support against

the  Public  Security  Bill,  which,  they  alleged,

discriminated against the Union. Another  ten  days,

and  we  had  a speech by an official of  the  Union

saying, amongst



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



other  things, that the Public Security Bill  should

be  opposed  to  the last and that the 'No-politics'

clause was unreasonable and must be fought against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, the 11th November, they were

reminded  by the Registrar of Societies of the  'No-politics'  clause in their constitution.  With  what

effect?  At  a  meeting at the Chinese  High  School

called on the 12th, the President of the Union,  Mr

Soon  Loh  Boon, again demanded the cancellation  of

the  'No-politics'  clause and attacked  the  Public

Security  Bill. On the 13th, there was a meeting  at

the  Chung Cheng High School which not only repeated

those attacks but also resolved to send a letter  to

the  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  asking  it   to

intervene in the Singapore Traction Company  strike,

and  to  warn  the Government that the  Union  would

participate   in   political   activities   if   the

Government  did  not specify in the Public  Security

Ordinance  that students would not be arrested.  Can

you  imagine anything more arrogant, or more  likely

to lead to a reign of terror in Singapore? What is a

student?  The word is used in Singapore  loosely  to

describe  anyone from a child of four or five  going

to  his first nursery school to an adult doing post-graduate  studies  at a university.  Are  they  all,

including  these  professional young  men  in  their

middle  twenties  who appear to  find  the  role  of

agitator against the Government so profitable, to be

above  the law? I hope that hon. Members will  agree

with  me  that there are so-called students in  this

colony  whose  presence here makes it imperative  to

have  the  Public Security Ordinance. You  all  know

what  the Federation Government thinks of them,  and

that  it  has  made it quite clear that their  trips

across the Causeway are unwelcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me continue with this revealing catalogue of

the  Union's activities. On the 19th of November the

Union  replied that the warning of the Registrar  of

Societies  could not be accepted; on the 27th,  they

wrote  to  me  asking  me to intervene  in  the  bus

strike;  and  about  this time  too  they  began  to

agitate again against National Service and organised

a  mutual  help  department, one of the  objects  of

which was to help members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



the  Union  to  avoid being called up  for  service.

These,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, are the young people  who

claim  to stand in the van of the fight for Merdeka.

What  kind of Merdeka would it be which had to  rely

on such spineless material?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early December, they returned to the attack on

Government's educational policy, reinforced - on paper

at  least,  though there is, in fact, no appreciable

distinction  between them - by a number of  Old  Boys'

associations  and  by  the Arts  Society  of  Middle

School  Graduates of 1953. And the girls  came  into

the  picture again when a lorry carrying  the  Union

badge  was  laden at the Nanyang Girls  High  School

with  food which was then delivered to strikers from

the United Engineers, the Singapore Traction Company

and the Green Bus Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union was, of course, not concerned only with

educational matters and the welfare of its  members.

In  1956, it began to take a more and more prominent

role  in  political meetings organised jointly  with

organisations  not for discussion but for  political

action  and  agitation. On 3rd March, for  instance,

they  joined  with four cultural groups  to  protest

against  the banning of a concert with pro-Communist

items. On the 8th of March, the President, Soon  Loh

Boon, spoke at the gathering called to celebrate the

Communist  Women's  International  Day'.  For  this

celebration  the Union published a special  book  of

songs entitled We Want Peace which was based on  the

Communist  Peace Campaign. Most of  the  songs  were

clearly of Russian or Chinese Communist origin.  The

name  The  Great Students Union is but a  substitute

for  The  Great  Mao  Tse-tung  in  scarcely  veiled

disguise;  and The Song of the Youthful Students  is

taken  directly  from a Russian film  on  collective

farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will not weary you with a recital of all the

meetings  at  which the Union has collaborated  with

adult  organisations to launch political attacks  on

Government and to initiate or support some political

agitation or other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it went on. Almost every day something was done

or  said  which  made it clear that  the  Union  was

actively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



taking  part  in politics and in trade disputes.  If

anything, the tempo of activity increased; certainly

an   increasingly  large  number  of  pupils  became

involved many of them in the first place, no  doubt,

innocently. The Union became even more arrogant, and

did  not hesitate to "persuade" managers of schools,

principals  and  teachers  to  fall  in  with  their

wishes.  Their language became more and more  highly

coloured and exaggerated. National Service laws, for

instance,  are alleged "to have seriously threatened

the  lives  and  safety of students and  jeopardised

their chances of study"; we are told that "the foxes

are  cunning  but they cannot escape the  discerning

eyes  of  the hunters" and that "the public are  not

hoodwinked by the calumnies of the authorities"; the

President of the Union, Soon Loh Boon, demands  that

"the  bloodshed of May the 13th shall be  repaid  in

blood"; and there is more and more talk of the cruel

struggle  and  of Malaya becoming a second  Cyprus - I

repeat that: Malaya becoming a second Cyprus.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Chief Minister has already said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> All this is so familiar to

those who have had the experience of the process  of

Communist subversion elsewhere. To the normal decent

citizen of Singapore, this ranting is sickening  and

has  no  appeal. But the leaders in this conspiracy

are  addressing their words not to men and women  of

mature mind and sober judgment but to the masses  of

young people in our Chinese schools and of the  less

well-educated  workers in our fields and  factories.

These  are  their first target because they  are  so

much more vulnerable to the emotional appeals of the

demagogue and it is all the more necessary that they

should be protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the few encouraging features has been the

growth  within  the  Chinese  middle  schools  of  a

resistance  movement. This is more than  the  active

group  which  has been responsible for  distributing

anti-Communist leaflets, the members of  which  have

openly accused the Union of encroaching on their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



freedom,  defaming their character, and  threatening

their  safety. Even if we are to rely  only  on  the

evidence  of the papers published by the  Union,  it

would appear that many members have been lukewarm in

their   support,  have  been  backward   in   paying

subscriptions, have preferred the private company of

their  friends to union-organised parties, and  have

resisted  attempts  by  the Union  to  direct  their

studies  for  them.  This, not  unnaturally,  was  a

matter  of  serious  concern  to  the  Union  and  a

determined  campaign was launched to  overcome  this

opposition.  This took a number of forms,  the  most

important of which was probably the adoption of  the

well-known Communist practice of hsueh hsi.  Now  it

is  not difficult for a student of language to  give

examples  of  words which through  association  with

people  or  circumstances have acquired a completely

new significance. The words "hsueh hsi" are two such

words.  In  the  days before the  Chinese  Communist

Party  came  into power they meant quite simply  "to

study and practise".They could have been taken as  a

motto  by any school in any country anywhere in  the

world,  and  that, no doubt, is why they  have  been

taken  over by the Communist Party. For they provide

a   seemingly  innocent  cover  for  the  pernicious

methods they use to indoctrinate the young people of

the  country, to ensure that they should  all  think

with one mind and all speak with one voice - the voice

of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I try to analyse more closely the theory

and practice of hsueh hsi in Communist China, let me

give  you  just  one  quotation  to  show  how   the

Communists   themselves  use  hsueh  hsi   for   the

propagation of their doctrine. Here is Fung Man Pan,

the  Secretary  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the

Chinese Communist Youth Corps, speaking at the First

National Congress of the Youth Corps:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main task of the Youth Corps in school is to

hsueh hsi - to help and lead the students' bodies  and

organisations  in  carrying  out  extra   curricular

activities and hsueh hsi and to prevent the tendency

to  study  for  study's sake. Members of  the  Youth

Corps should hsueh hsi Marxism and Leninism and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



the  theories of these two isms. The ideology of Mao

Tse-tung should be brought to the students."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be difficult, surely, to state more

bluntly  than  this that hsueh  hsi  is  to  be  the

vehicle   for  the  propagation  of  the   Communist

philosophy and its Party line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us see how the Communists define hsueh

hsi.  The  New  Knowledge Dictionary,  published  in

China, describes it thus:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A collective hsueh hsi system includes general

theory, business or trade theory and technique  and

policies  but  it  has still to be coordinated  with

political study. There is no limitation as  to  the

number  of persons for participation, but the  ideal

is  between 8 and 15 people, and normally a meeting

is  to  he  held once a week. An outline  is  to  be

prepared first regarding measures for hsueh hsi, and

thereafter  everyone can express his or  her  views,

make  discussions and conclusions. This  is  because

this  sort  of organised hsueh hsi urges, helps  and

leads  everyone to progress in a definite direction.

At  the same time, this sort of collective hsueh hsi

organisation can be utilised to carry out  criticism

and  self criticism so that everyone can continually

rectify  the  former  bad  habits  of  being   anti-collective  liberal,  individually  heroic,  loosely

unorganised, lax and non-urgent."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read this quickly and without examining it

critically, you may be tempted to say that  you  can

see  nothing  very wrong in it. But let  us  have  a

closer look - especially at the words "organised hsueh

hsi urges, helps and leads everyone to progress in a

definite  direction".  In  what  direction?  In  the

direction  your individual conscience dictates?  Or

the direction agreed upon by the group by the method

we  know  as democratic discussion? No.  It  is  the

direction laid down by the Party line: if you do not

agree  with it, you will be persuaded (and the  word

"persuaded"  is  acquiring a meaning very  different

from  what we mean by the word) to correct your  bad

habits  and through criticism and self-criticism  to

admit the error of your ways and toe the Party line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note, too, the use of cells of small numbers of

pupils. Why should not the normal class of 40 be the

unit?  Let us see what the students themselves  have

to say:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each class is divided into 3 or 4 cells to carry

out  their  study. This will cure the bad habits  of

some  students who dare not say what they  think  in

front  of  many people. They will be able to  reveal

all their views in the cell meetings."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no escape. No individual has any right to

views  which conflict with those of the  group.  Let

him  but  try  to  defend himself and  his  fate  is

already determined. He will - let me quote - "be scorned

as  a weakling who has not the courage to admit  his

mistakes as a bad worker who is unwilling to rectify

his defects - decidedly not a leader".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at another article entitled "The

importance  of carrying out hsueh hsi  in  theories"

published  by the Union in the "Voice of  Study"  on 7th March, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the colonial society there is no freedom of

speech  and  hsueh hsi; on the contrary we  have  to

suffer  from  all kinds of persecution.  Allegations

were  placed over our heads and we were regarded  as

wild  beasts. That is why it is difficult to buy  or

find the right type of theoretical books."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have read the long-winded perversions of

truth   which  the  Union  has  issued  and  certain

sections   of   the  local  Press  have   obediently

published,  will  need  no  further  proof  of   the

absurdity of the charge that these young people have

been  denied freedom of speech. But what, I  wonder,

are  "the correct type of theoretical books"? Surely

only  two  kinds of books are banned - the  subversive

and  the  pornographic? And since these students  of

ours are so violent in their outcries against yellow

literature  there can be only one answer,  that  the

publications  denied  to them are  those  which  are

politically subversive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of hsueh hsi groups adopted from

Communist  China was first introduced into Singapore

on a significant scale during the first phase of the

"Hsueh  Hsi" propaganda week held in Chinese schools

from the 25th of February to the 3rd of March. Hsueh

Hsi  could  not  achieve its desired end  without  a

collective life, the purpose of which is to  achieve

the collective control of the minds and thoughts  of

the  pupils. Collective life forms an integral  part

of the system of collective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



Hsueh  Hsi and the collective life organised by  the

Union  at  the Teo Kim Eng Villa during which  hsueh

hsi   and  discussion  groups  were  organised   and

prepared  questionnaires  were  distributed  can  be

considered  as  a  typical  manifestation  of   this

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March, the Arts Society of the Nanyang Girls'

High School, at the instance of the Union, published

the  first  number  of the "Voice  of  Study".  This

emphasised   the   superiority  of   collective   to

individual  study,  the need to read  about  current

events,  but  only in the right kind of  newspapers,

and  the  importance of theory.  These  are  typical

quotations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In response to the call of the Chinese Middle

Schools  Students' Union, the Art  Section  of  this

school  is actively starting a study cell.  However,

in  regard  to this, a misunderstanding  has  arisen

among  the fellow-students. They feel that  a  study

cell  is  a  mere  waste of time  and  energy.  They

emphasise on the greater results to be obtained from

individual study. Hitherto our fellow-students  have

had  little experience in collective study. They are

accustomed  to  individual self-study.  However,  if

only   the  fellow-students  are  prepared  to  give

collective  study  a  trial,  they  will  understand

better the importance of collective study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collective study, it is possible to improve an

individual's   defect  in  study.  Any   doubts   or

difficulties in school lessons can be brought up for

all  to  discuss and analyse, thereby  avoiding  any

lowering  of  the  study  spirit  and  any  loss  of

confidence  in study. Since there are so  many  good

points in a study cell for collective study,  it  is

hoped   that   all  fellow-students  will   actively

participate in collective study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must daily read the newspapers which possess a

proper  standpoint and whose comments are  fair  and

just."



<br><br>And on theory, they have this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moreover theory is an important weapon with which

to  reform  our thought. It will correct a  person's

human  outlook ... We must employ the proper knowledge

of theory as a weapon with which to expose the dying

evil influence and propagate and expand the new born

power."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you see the determination to bring all into

the  fold  and  then  to set about  reforming  their

thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An essential feature of hsueh hsi is the practice

of  criticism and self-criticism which is  merely  a

polite   name   for  one  of  the  many   forms   of

intimidation   used   to  enforce   uniformity   and

unflinching obedience to the organisation. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



Union's own pronouncements on this subject are but a

reflection  of  the statements to be  found  in  the

Basic   Knowledge  Text-book  of  the  Youth  Corps,

published in Peking. Here is what it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Criticism and self-criticism are the powerful

weapons  of  the  Youth  Corps  when  educating  its

members  and the young masses with Marxism. Leninism

and the ideology of Mao Tse-tung.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who fail to understand the

importance of criticism and self-criticism. Some may

have  views of their own, but they will  not  voice

their  opinions in the meeting. They elect  to  make

little broadcast behind one's back. This is a rotten

type of liberalism. All the revolutionary youths and

corps  members  who are loyal to  the  corps  should

oppose liberalism and carry out criticism and  self-criticism."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again a message to the Second National

Congress  of the Youth Corps delivered by Liu  Shao-chi:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to consolidate their own organisation,

the  entire  body  of  members of  the  Chinese  New

Democratic Youth Corps must' learn how to manipulate

the method of criticism and self-criticism so as  to

carry  on  a struggle against all the bad  phenomena

which  are  harmful to the enterprise of the  people

and the undertaking of the Party."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union has not scrupled to use Communist

sources such as these to obtain material  for  its

own   publications.  The  paper   "Actively   launch

criticism  and self-criticism", which  was  prepared

for a series of executive vacation study classes  by

the   Directing  Sub-Committee  of  the  Union,   is

typical. The bricks of Communist ideology are there

unchanged though admittedly a little local cement is

used  to  bind them together. But all is couched  in

this new language of 'double-talk' or 'weasel words'

in  what  was  no  doubt originally  an  attempt  to

conceal its meaning. If the words are taken at their

face value, they are comparatively harmless: if they

are  translated  from double-talk to plain  English,

their sinister nature becomes apparent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone, Sir, have the slightest doubt that

this Union has been acting, at the very least, as  a

Communist-front  organisation,   that   it   is   an

organisation  designed to act as  an  instrument  of

Communist policy, an organisation whose real purpose

is  masked  behind a facade of social  ideals  which

many respectable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



people  of  progressive  views  in  Singapore  would

approve?  Though  we  have  conclusive  proof   that

several  members  of this Union were  Communists,  a

union  might  yet be a Communist front  organisation

even if it had no Communist members at all. The fact

that  there has been this direct Communist influence

within  the  Union  merely  strengthens  the   case

against it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents found on Communist members who have been

arrested  show that the general policy speeches  and

writings  of  their  Communist  masters  have   been

adopted  almost without modification.  There  is  no

doubt  whatever  in  my  mind  that  the  Hsueh  Hsi

campaign  in  Singapore  has  for  its  purpose  the

indoctrination  of  the  children  in  our   Chinese

schools   so  that  even  if  they  do  not   become

Communists,  whilst still at school,  they  will  at

least   be   so  amenable  to  persuasion   and   so

conditioned  to  sink their individuality  and  obey

orders  that  they  will  become  easy  converts  to

Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I have dealt only with the expression in

speech   or   in   writing   of   the   theory    of

indoctrination.  I  must confess  I  have  found  it

impossibly  dull  and  boring,  and  have  found  it

difficult  to  understand how the  pupils  could  be

persuaded to read or even to listen to it. They are

made  to do so partly because the doctrines  are  so

systematically and persistently put across  that  no

pupil  can avoid becoming acquainted with them,  and

partly because the approach is made through forms of

activity which are widely and immediately popular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactic are described in an interesting

document  published by the Union which  is  entitled

"Enriching Study Life and increasing Study Results".

This  paper  shows how the Communist  influence  has

penetrated  into  every aspect of school  life.  The

Union  has  become almost a separate Directorate  of

Education  within  the  middle  school  system.  Its

duties may be summarised under five headings: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To draw up working plans which must be

practicable and suitable;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To bring about unity amongst the officers of

the Union and to emphasise the positive

and creative nature of their work;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To penetrate a wide range of cultural

activities;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To co-ordinate collective studies with

recreational activities:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) To organise the collection of subscriptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will agree that it is a most comprehensive

list  which shows the very wide scope of the Union's

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain a cloak of legality for these

activities, the Union has generally sought  the  co-operation of school principals or teachers. In  this

way,  some  principals  have  been  led  to  support

activities  which  outwardly  appear  to  be  highly

desirable, but in fact are the means by which pupils

not  otherwise  interested in the  Union  have  been

caught in the net.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial approach was made over hsueh hsi.

After  all,  why should the pupils not study  harder

and  practise what they had studied? Any  headmaster

would  be  delighted to find his  pupils  expressing

their  spontaneous desire to work  together  and  to

work harder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later approaches were made in different ways at

different  schools, the opportunity being seized  as

the  occasion arose. At Nam Hwa Girls'  School,  for

instance, the principal agreed to prune the  library

of  some  light  novels which were  classed  by  the

pupils as yellow literature, and with her permission

ceremoniously   burned.  At   other   schools,   the

principals  cooperated  with  the  Union  in  making

adjustments  to  the time-table for  extracurricular

activities  so  that  the pupils  should  have  more

opportunity   to  participate  in  their   favourite

activity. This enabled them "to choose the one which

entirely  fitted in with their central  resolution".

Others  organised  class  tea-parties,  picnics  and

visits  to  the  cinema, prepared  wall  newspapers,

devised current affairs tests and fill-in-the-blanks

questionnaires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of unified direction is

continuously  stressed. "It is first necessary",  we

are told, "to put on a sound



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



basis  the  entire organisational system, to  create

lively  and  subtle working methods,  to  carry  out

resolutions  on  propaganda work,  especially  small

scale   activities  such  as  lunches,  tea-parties,

plays,  visits  to  the cinema,  swimming  parties."

There  was even a directing sub-committee to  ensure

that resolutions (especially the Central Resolution)

were thoroughly carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Propaganda was given high priority. A Union paper

entitled "Express News" was published. There was  no

escape from it, for if you refrained from reading it

yourself, you could not avoid hearing it read by the

General Affairs Officer either in class or over  the

school broadcasting system so generously put at  the

disposal  of  the  Union by the school  authorities.

Indeed,  at  Chung  Cheng  High  School,  additional

speakers were installed to cover those parts of  the

garden where 'unco-operative' pupils could find  some

respite from the insistent propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in his own home the pupil was not safe from

these  zealous  young  men,  for  parties  would  be

organised  to visit him and his parents to  persuade

them of the joys of collective activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were the teachers free from these visits of

persuasion,  though the Union appears  to  have  had

less  success  with them than with  the  pupils  and

their  parents. Nevertheless, they had  selected  36

teachers from Chung Cheng School for repeated visits

by  officers of the Union. My hon. friends will,  no

doubt,  be  aware  also  of  the  pressure  recently

brought  to  bear by the Union on the principals  of

two  schools  to dismiss two teachers who  were  not

acceptable  to  them.  Of course,  there  were  some

teachers  who  collaborated with the Union,  notably

the two deans of the Chung Cheng School against whom

banishment orders were recently made. On  the  other

hand,  many  teachers have steadfastly resisted  the

persistent pressure of the Union and they should  be

congratulated  on  having taken a stand  which  must

have called for a good deal of courage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union has not used these methods of

intimidation  only against individual  teachers  and

pupils. They have used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



similar methods perhaps even more blatantly,  as  an

instrument  of general education policy,  a  policy,

needless to say, which was directly opposed to  that

of  this  Government.  Members  of  the  Union  have

visited  nearly all the Chinese primary  schools  in

Singapore  to persuade them not to accept full  aid.

Yet  the President, Soon Loh Boon, applied specially

to  teach in a fully aided school. Hon. members  can

draw their own conclusions as to why he did this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

heard  the Minister for Education objecting to  some

Members   on  the  Opposition  side  reading   their

speeches.  For the last fifty minutes, the  Minister

was   reading   right  through  just  seconding   an

amendment.  I am not objecting to that  but  I  just

want it to be put on record.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order has been taken. It

has  occurred  to me that possibly the  Minister  is

making  too  great a reference to his notes  but  in

this  particular  debate I have,  in  fact,  been  a

little  lax and I intend to continue to be a  little

lax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir,I

have  to  refer  to  my  notes,  having  a  mass  of

quotations taken from the records of this Union.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Prepared by the Special Branch!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The material is not prepared by

the  Special  Branch  but is taken  from  the  Union

records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two notable instances of Union interference

occurred: one, at the Chui Chun School where primary

school  pupils aged between 11 and 12 were persuaded

to  stage a sit-down strike; two, at the Thye  Chung

School  where a mass demonstration with  microphones

was  staged  to  persuade the managers  to  withdraw

their  application for full aid. There  was  also  a

campaign  to  intimidate these managers to  withdraw

their  application for full aid and they also spread

unfounded  rumours that these managers had  accepted

bribes from the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for "Enriching School Life". I think you

will  agree, Sir, that this is a horrifying  picture

and  that corruption of school life would be a  much

more  suitable title. It is difficult to find  words

adequate  to  describe the depths  of  depravity  to

which  those  who  are behind these  activities  are

prepared to sink. The Communist is amoral and  quite

ruthless.  For him there is no future  life  and  no

conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end justifies the means, however revolting,

and  I  find  it difficult to imagine anything  more

vile and pernicious than the corruption of the minds

of  young  children of which I have been  trying  to

give  you a picture. Some hon. Members may  find  it

difficult  to  believe that  it  can  all  be  true.

Nevertheless,  it  is true and when  one  begins  to

analyse  these facts, I am sure one will shudder  at

the subtle and ruthless methods perpetrated by these

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other method the Union has recently

started  to  use  to  ensure that  the  thoughts  of

members are channelled in one direction. I refer  to

the  Question Papers that the Union has  set,  quite

illegally,  for  pupils  to answer.  Some  of  these

Question  Papers were given on a Friday  to  pupils.

Pupils were asked to return home and hand back those

Papers  on the following Monday. In the White  Paper

tabled  before  the  Assembly,  you  will  find  the

Appendices  attached  to it showing  the  nature  of

those  questions. At a first glance, some  of  these

questions are quite harmless and it would indeed  be

difficult  to  take  any single question  and  state

categorically    that   it   was   politically    or

educationally objectionable. There are a few  purely

factual  questions which are probably included  only

to lend a cloak of respectability to the papers; but

most  are questions which require the expression  of

an  opinion.  The  papers  are  indeed  but  another

searchlight  which can be turned on to the  mind  of

the  student, so that any deviation from the correct

path can be quickly revealed and dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That then is the picture. I have shown how the

Union  was a Communist-front organisation which  not

only  acted  as an instrument for Chinese  Communist

policy   but   had   indeed  been   infiltrated   by

Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with this evil, the Government must

have  the  support  of  every  loyal  citizen,   and

especially  of  those  parents  and  teachers  whose

immediate  problem it is to discipline  these  young

people  and  restore them to sanity.  In  the  past,

managers  and  teachers  have  been  wont  to  blame

Government's   inactivity  for  their   disciplinary

troubles.  They  have said that by  registering  the

Union,  the  Government indicated its approval,  and

though in this they were mistaken, there is yet some

justification  for  the  charge  that   Government's

decision to register the Union did indeed add to the

schools'  disciplinary troubles. Now that excuse  is

no longer valid and it is hoped that they will rally

to Government's support. The parents, too, have been

not  altogether free from blame. Many  have  allowed

their  children to get out of hand,  and  they  must

lose  no  time  in re-asserting their  authority  if

their   children  are  not  to  be  lost   to   them

altogether.  The Chief Minister has set  a  lead  in

courage and devotion to the people of Singapore. Now

is  the time for all who have the well-being of  our

young  people  at  heart to rally  at  once  to  his

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing which I must make perfectly

clear  to everyone who is concerned about the future

of  Chinese  education. The operation the Government

has had to perform to remove the cancer of Communism

from the Chinese middle schools was designed to cure

the  patient,  not to kill him. The  Government  has

repeatedly expressed its determination, as far as it

lies   in  its  power,  to  give  equal  educational

opportunity  to every child and equal  treatment  to

all  kinds of schools; and it has followed up  these

words  with  deeds. It has gone to the root  of  the

problem   by  providing  courses  of  training   and

conditions  of service for Chinese teachers  exactly

parallel to those for other teachers; it has offered

full  grant  in aid to approved Chinese  schools  on

exactly  the same conditions as those that apply  to

English  schools. If anyone dares to  say  that  the

Government   is   discriminating   against   Chinese

education  or is trying to destroy Chinese  culture,

then I throw the words back in his face. The actions

that  your  Government has taken and the  conditions

under which Government aid will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



be  given  have one important aim in common-to  keep

alive  what  is  good  and what  is  `universal'  in

Chinese art and literature. This cancer that we  are

determined to root out is evil, it is a deadly evil.

I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that not only hon. Members

in this House, but every loyal pupil and every loyal

parent  of every pupil will fight boldly and without

remission   to   eliminate  this   evil   from   our

educational system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our decision, the decision of the elected

Government of Singapore. It was a decision taken  in

the  interests  of our children in our  schools.  We

know  the heartache that the influence of the  Union

upon  their children has brought into the very  many

homes  in Singapore, and we are quite sure that  the

very   great  majority  of  parents  were  immensely

relieved when the Government at last faced up to its

responsibilities. This was no hasty decision. It was

a  decision  based  on a great mass  of  accumulated

evidence which left no doubt whatever that the Union

was  an  organisation penetrated by  Communists  and

whose  continued  existence  is  a  menace  to  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now proceed by touching upon the reasons for the

arrests  of  the  teachers. Knowing  the  importance

which  the Chinese Communist Government attaches  to

the indoctrination of school children, it can be  no

surprise  to  hon. Members that 5 of the  7  persons

arrested  on  Banishment or  Detention  Orders  were

teachers  in  Chinese schools. The grounds  for  the

arrests  are not necessarily directly or  indirectly

connected  with  their work in the schools.  Against

some  of them, there is conclusive proof that  their

activities  were  contrary to the interests  of  the

people of the colony, quite apart from the influence

they  brought to bear upon the pupils of the schools

in  which  they taught. Cheng Meng Hui and Pang  Sui

Song  were  in positions of great responsibility  in

the  Chung Cheng Main School which, as you must have

heard,  was  perhaps the most seriously affected  of

all middle schools. Chen Meng Hui was the Dean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



of  Discipline - surely an ironical title because,  as

you  all know, there had been little attempt in that

school to exert any authority which conflicted  with

the wishes of the Union.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Am I correct in saying that

there is an appeal pending by these gentlemen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I understand, Sir, that a

petition is coming to be reconsidered by the Council

of Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I must rule that this

is  in  the nature of a sub judice matter  and  that

reference  should  not be made by  the  Minister  to

those arrested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  hope  I  have not presented a picture of  Chinese

education  which  will lead you to believe  that  we

have  lost  all hope. I am well aware of  the  great

potentialities of the thousands of boys and girls in

our  middle schools who have quite honestly believed

that  they were doing the right thing. Our fight  is

not  against them, it is for them, but it is against

the   people   who  are  behind  this  campaign   of

corruption.  These  are  the  people  we  are  quite

determined to root out. Only when we have done  that

shall  we be able to work together for the  good  of

the  great  body  of  men,  women  and  children  of

Singapore  who are fundamentally kind,  sincere  and

hardworking.  It is in this belief that  I  ask  all

hon.   Members   in  this  House  to  support   this

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House is gravely concerned over the

recent arrests of trade union and civic leaders  and

the  dissolution of two societies, and deplores  the

arbitrary manner of the Government's action."



<br><br>Since when, an amendment has been moved to leave out

all  the words after the word "House" to the end and

to insert the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"takes note of the recent arrests of six persons

under  the Banishment Ordinance and one person under

the  Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance  and

the  dissolution of two societies, and welcomes  the

strong   action  taken  by  the  Government  against

subversive elements in Singapore."



<br><br>The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 6th September, this Assembly

unanimously  gave  a  vote  of  confidence  on   the

Government's policy for the coming year  and  I  was

one  of the first to note the sincerity of the  Hon.

the  Chief Minister when he proposed that motion.  I

am very glad indeed to see that my confidence in him

has not been misplaced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we have the Member for Tanjong

Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) who complained that he  and

his  Party  have been taken for a ride. How  can  he

claim  to  have been taken for a ride  when  in  the

Governor's Address, it was expressly stated that the

Government was determined to take strong  action  to

remove  threats to the public welfare and safety  of

all  the  citizens of Singapore? He might have  been

taken  for a ride, that is, taken for a ride by  the

members of his Party and of his supporters who  have

been  indulging  in all the illegal  and  subversive

activities  described to us in  this  House  by  the

Ministers or perhaps his Party members have the same

ideas and same identical interests so that they  can

not  distinguish between what is right and  what  is

wrong.  To them, their ideas and their policies  are

right; those of others are wrong. They have given  a

hint  that  in  about eight years' time,  everything

will  go their way and we have been told of the dire

things that will happen to us. It is for all  of  us

who  do  not believe in his ideas to stand  together

firmly  behind the Government when it wants to  take

strong  action  to  see  that  law  and  order   are

maintained in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It rather surprised me that even an indication of

the   rise  in  industrial  shares  in  this  market

irritated him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It did not at all. It just

amused me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> It amused him if he likes but

why should it amuse him or displease him? It goes to

show  the  return of confidence in this country  and

that  people will be prepared to invest their  money

here  to  give employment to our people.  I  suppose

that his Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



does  not  like this because its strength  is  drawn

from  unemployment,  misery and discontent  and  any

return  to confidence and foreign investment in  our

country is a menace to its ideas. What is wrong with

foreign  investment and confidence in  our  country?

What  is  happening in India, Burma  and  Indonesia?

After  these  several  years of  independence,  they

found  that they were unable to carry on  their  own

development without foreign investment and they  are

openly asking for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout last week, there have been persistent

demands  that the people who have been  detained  or

dealt with under the Banishment Ordinance be brought

before  the  Court for trial. Such  a  demand  is  a

negation of the right of Government to act under the

Banishment Ordinance and the Preservation of  Public

Security  Ordinance. These Ordinances were  approved

by  Government constituted as we are today and as we

have  received  an  assurance from  Government  that

these  acts  were only carried out  after  the  most

deliberate and serious considerations I do not think

that  any  law-abiding person should  question  that

right of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been asked to take our stand today both by

the  Hon. the Chief Minister and by the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar. Our stand is clear, we stand for  law

and order and we support the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

oppose the amendment before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am not a legal man and so I do not

understand  the complications that will  arise  from

these  arrests. I have listened to people and I  say

what the people say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the arrests, a number of my constituents

came and saw me to express their anger and dismay at

this  so  undemocratic an action.  I  have  had  the

privilege of knowing the Hon. the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for a long time and I know that when  once

he  has  decided to take an action, he  will  do  so

whether it is good or bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> But since he has taken this action,

it  is up to him to bring these people to the bar of

justice.  If you fail to do that, then you  are  the

people  who  are going to break the law because  the

law should be applied equally to both parties: those

who are governed and the governors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You speak of subversive elements. Who are those

subversive elements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of order. The hon.

Member   mentioned  that  you  spoke  of  subversive

elements  but  I did not hear you say that  in  this

House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I myself do not recollect talking

about  subversive elements, but perhaps I had better

remind  the hon. Member that his remarks should,  in

fact, be addressed to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I was referring to the Hon. the

Chief Minister who spoke of subversive elements. Who

are  these subversive elements? Who is to decide who

are  the  subversive  elements?  In  the  whole   of

political history, to the man who holds the gun, the

other   man  is  a  subversive  element.   That   is

everywhere.  Take,  for  example,  Indo-China.  When

France  was ruling North IndoChina, they  said  that

certain other people were subversive elements.  When

those  people took over, the Prince and  the  people

who  supported French rule were subversive elements.

Today,  you  are holding the gun and you are  ruling

the  people.  You  say  that  there  are  subversive

elements.  When they come to power,  they  will  say

that  you are the subversive element. So I say  that

the Hon. the Chief Minister should think it over and

choose to rule by the will of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, Sir, that the Hon. the Chief

Minister was an innocent victim in the hands of some

of  the men in his Cabinet who control the levers of

power  but  I  am not going to repeat those  charges

here. What I say is that he should rule by the  will

of  the  people  and  by  lessons  from  the  latest

historical  development like the Suez Canal  crisis.

The Suez Canal crisis has taught one lesson and that

is  that  it has united all Asian nations. There  is

also  the lesson to study that there is no place  in

Asia  for Asians who have axes to grind with  Europe

or for that matter with Washington.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, Sir, what happened to the stooges of

Indo-China  but  I do not think that  the  situation

will  arise here if we all abide by the rule of  the

law  but  if the Government takes the law  in  their

hands,  it will open an avenue for others to do  the

same  and  that was precisely what had  happened  in

Indo-China.   Indo-China  has  fought  against   the

background  of colonial slumber slowly  waking  from

the  sleep of centuries but today Asians slumber  no

more.  They  are quite alert and they are  ready  to

fight  for their rights and I hope that the colonial

Government will have a new approach to the situation

in  Singapore  because it has been said  that  these

arrests  were  made in the name  of  the  people  of

Singapore.  It  is only a pretension. These  arrests

were made in the name of British vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will end this speech with a quotation from

Mr  Alfred  Robin, the Labour spokesman on  foreign

policy of the British Parliament, when he warned the

British  Government against using force in the  Suez

Canal crisis:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember there will be a day when Asia will ring

down  an  iron  curtain against Europeans,  when  no

European will be allowed to set foot in Asia."



If  that  was  a  warning given  by  a  European  to

European adventurers, what shall I say to Asians who

lend   themselves  as  stooges  to  these   European

adventurers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not only I oppose the amendment but I declare

in  this  House  that I am supporting  the  original

motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

heard  the  tirades  of  the People's  Action  Party

accusing     Government     of     having      acted

undemocratically,   and   strong,   courageous   and

convincing answers from the Hon. the Chief  Minister

and the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the people who have resorted to subversive

measures  to  undermine our democratic institutions?

Who  are  the  people who try to take the  law  into

their own hands for their own evil purposes? Not the

Council  of  Ministers, in our view, but those  very

people whom it has been necessary for the Council of

Ministers to detain. However repugnant it is for any

government  to  use its powers of detention  without

trial - and  one  wonders  whether  the  P.A.P. would

really find it repugnant if they were in power - there

are times and occasions when such a decision has  to

be  made to protect the democratic institutions  and

the democratic way of life of 1� million people in

Singapore.  And the only way to give them protection

is  to deal summarily with a handful of persons  who

not  only  have no love for democracy  but  seek  to

destroy   it.   The  vast  majority  of  law-abiding

citizens  cannot be sacrificed to the tiny  minority

who  wish  to  flout law and order  and  to  promote

conditions of chaos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the People's Action Party

outside  this House have advanced the argument  that

the  Government's action should have been  submitted

to  a  people's referendum on the ground  that  this

Assembly is unrepresentative of the people. That  is

pure  nonsense.  It  only serves to  underline  this

group's contempt for a democratic form of government

we   have  learned  in  this  Assembly  proudly  and

successfully  to foster. The 25 elected  Members  of

this Assembly who claim to be the representatives of

the   people  were  elected  about  18  months  ago.

Whatever the People's Action Party likes to say,  we

represent  them now, and our verdict in  this  House

today is the voice of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Sir, as an elected Member of this House,

I  bring this mandate from my constituency, not from

the  residential section which is solidly behind the

Government, but from the much larger numbers of non-English-speaking people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



in  my  rural  districts. What  they  have  told  me

voluntarily  and without my having to ask  is  this:

'We want you to be firm. We are not in favour of law

and  order  being  disrupted. If drastic  action  is

needed, take it and we will back you.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps I may put this mandate which I hold

to my hon. Friends opposite in my own words and they

are  these: Be firm, be just, be vigilant; be  firm,

because  by  remaining firm in the course  you  have

taken,  you  will gather behind you immense  support

for any further measures that it may be necessary to

take  in the public interest; be just, and show your

justice  by  taking the people into your  confidence

regarding  your actions just as far as you  possibly

can;  be  vigilant, not only to see that  those  who

wish  to do evil are thwarted of their evil purposes

but  also to see that, through over-confidence,  you

do  not misuse the considerable powers entrusted  to

you  by this Assembly - an assurance which indeed  has

already been given by the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, we of the Liberal-Socialist Party say to

the  Government: Tell the people of  Singapore  that

you  intend  to  govern with firmness,  justice  and

vigilance  so  that this island can be  rid  of  the

poison which is seeping into its bloodstream. We are

fully  behind the Government in this matter, but  if

my  hon.  Friends  opposite  waver  in  firmness  or

justice  or vigilance, it is our duty and our  right

as an Opposition party to criticise any shortcomings

and to hold them to the course that they have taken.

Indeed,  if we all remain firm, I have no  cause  to

think that they will waver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister and his colleagues

bear  a heavy responsibility. We seek to share  that

responsibility  as an Opposition  Party  by  joining

them  in full and complete opposition to this motion

and in support of the admirably forthright and clear-cut amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Hon. the Chief Minister has said that  the

Ministers  on  the evidence they have are  convinced

that these people who are under arrest are guilty of

actions  that are not in the interest of the  people

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. What are these actions? Have they  broken

any of the laws of this country? If they have broken

any  laws and the Government has evidence, then  why

is the Government afraid to try these persons in the

courts  of  law? The action of the Government,  Sir,

has  made  many people in the country  believe  that

there  is  no evidence against them. There are  only

some  Police reports but the Police reports are  not

evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that we are protecting democracy. Is

there democracy in this House or in this country? In

every  democratic country, Sir, the  courts  of  law

protect the citizens from the high-handed actions of

politicians  and policemen. If this  is  true,  then

this country is not a democracy and the Government's

action has made it even less so. The Government says

that  this  is acting within the law. So did  Hitler

and all the tyrants justify their actions. They made

laws    that   justified   their   highhanded    and

deliberately repressive actions and said that  their

actions were legal. This is what our Government  has

done.  They  have  used the laws that  our  colonial

masters made and used for the purpose of getting rid

of  people.  We have set these laws against  persons

whose  only  crime  is that they disagree  with  the

Government.  Is it a serious crime to disagree  with

the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> They say that they do not have

to  prove  their  charges because these  people  are

aliens.  Are  these  people aliens?  Are  they  more

aliens  than many of those sitting around  the  Hon.

the   Chief  Minister?  Many  of  those   that   the

Government seeks to banish have spent most of  their

lives in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them, Linda Chen, was brought to this

country  when  she was five years  old.  Her  family

lives  here.  She has lived all her life  here.  She

knows  no country but this. Is she an alien? Is  she

more  an  alien than the Minister for Communications

and Works (Mr Francis Thomas)? - I am sorry he is not

here. Is she more an alien than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Seletar (Mr Nair)? For that matter,

she is more a part of this country than many who say

that  she  is an alien. If she is an alien,  then  a

very large number of the people of this country  are

aliens  and  all  of  them are in  danger  of  being

banished if they disagree with the Government.  Even

the  fact  that  some of them are  citizens  of  the

United  Kingdom  and the Colonies will  not  protect

them if they are not born here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, such injustice has been used on

the  people by the Government and yet they say  that

this is in the interest of the people. They say that

they  are convinced and that therefore there  is  no

need  to  go  to the courts of law. Are they  afraid

that  the Judges will not be convinced? When justice

is  banned by politicians and the courts of law  are

neglected, then we have the beginning of Fascism and

Fascism  does  not stop at even such arrests  or  70

arrests  or 1,000 arrests. It will go on  until  its

opponents are crushed and there is nobody to  oppose

the  will  of those who rule. Why has the Government

which represents only a minority of the people  done

this?  Some  say that this is to please the  British

Government   so   that  the  next  talks   will   be

successful. They say that the Government  is  trying

to  prove  to the British Government that  they  are

willing  and  able to do its dirty work.  There  are

others who say that this is the beginning of a  plan

to  arrest  as  many as possible of  those  who  are

opposed to the Labour Front and the British so  that

when the next elections come, the discredited Labour

Front  will have no opposition. Probably, both these

views  are true because pleasing the Colonial Office

and  smashing the anti-colonial forces are the  same

things,  making Singapore safe for the Labour  Front

and   making   Singapore  safe   for   the   British

Government.  These  are both  the  same  thing.  The

people  of  Singapore who are prepared to fight  the

British are also prepared to fight the Labour Front.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of us here

know that the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan

Yew) is a brilliant advocate and as such has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



done well in our local courts. I have practised as a

lawyer, as you yourself, Mr Speaker, know, for  the

last  25 years before the elections. The Member  for

Tanjong Pagar would therefore surely know that  with

the  legal training and practice at the local courts

that I am fully aware that banishment is one of  the

most drastic punishments which could be imposed upon

an  individual and could only be justified after one

is  fully convinced from satisfactory evidence of  a

person's activities and that the person is dangerous

and   undesirable  and  actively  participating   in

spreading pernicious ideologies. The Hon. the  Chief

Minister  and  the  other elected Members  are  also

fully  aware of the gravity of the penalty, and  the

gravity of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has stated on every occasion

and  again today in the most clear terms the  reason

for  the decision of Government in dealing with  the

persons concerned, and the banned associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has also given us a very full statement. There is not the slightest doubt in our minds and in the minds of those people who love Singapore and are interested in the welfare of Singapore that what Government has done is right. The only exceptions are naturally those groups

controlled  by "brilliantly coloured" agitators.  Is

there no better proof that what Government has  done

is right in the death threat letters received by the

Hon. the  Chief  Minister  and  the  Minister   for

Education?  Is  it  not  the  pattern  of  the   red

terrorists to threaten and instil fear and  has  not

that  pattern been followed by the blackmailers  who

said  that  they  will send representatives  to  the

Assembly to watch the stand taken by Assemblymen and

that  if Assemblymen did not vote according  to  the

dictates of Middle Road, they would be annihilated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the not infrequent attacks made by the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar, I have had  occasion  to

admire  some of his masterly speeches and  at  times

believed  in his sincerity. He has openly proclaimed

that he is not a Communist and I believe that he  is

not a Communist. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



therefore  believe that what he has said  today  was

said  with  his tongue in his cheek and  to  satisfy

that band of foreign agitators in his Party and  his

backseat drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim

Ching  Siong) to say that Mr Chia Ek  Tian  of  the

Factory   and  Shop  Workers  Union  (Bukit  Panjang

Branch) is not, and has never been, a member of  the

Malayan  Communist  Party  or  of  the  Anti-British

League - surely the Member for Bukit Timah knows  him

too well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front has stated that they would repeal

repressive laws and repressive laws will be  removed

when  Singapore is free of the dangerous  subversive

elements.  We are all pledged on this  side  of  the

House, as long as we are in power, to leave no stone

unturned  in ridding Singapore of highly undesirable

persons  and  to deal ruthlessly with  the  elements

which   endanger  the  safety  of  the  peace-loving

citizens  of Singapore and in this we are  confident

of  the support of those who love Singapore and  are

seeking a Merdeka in which Singapore can be  run  by

true and peace-loving Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to oppose the amendment made by the Hon.

the  Chief Minister this morning against the  motion

standing  in the name of my hon. Friend, the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar and leader of the People's Action

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite certain that all Members in this House

have some indication of the feelings and reaction of

the  people  in  Singapore as a consequence  of  the

recent  arbitrary  arrests and  detention  of  trade

unionists   and   other  leaders  of  organisations.

Government's action has been condemned, deplored and

severely criticised by leaders of organisations that

are   truly   representative  of  the  people.   The

Government's   action  is  a  monstrous   abuse   of

arbitrary  powers. The Labour Front  Government  has

had  occasion prior to the 1955 elections to condemn

the   arbitrary  powers  vested  in  the  hands   of

Government. We all know the details



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



and  the manner in which the Preservation of  Public

Security  Bill was enacted into law. There was  talk

then that the powers under this Ordinance would only

be used against anti-democratic forces. The Hon.the

Chief  Minister has openly stated to the public  and

to  the Press that the recent arrests of leaders  of

trade unions and other organisations had nothing  to

do with the bodies concerned. Whom does he expect to

fool?  A  few months ago, a branch chairman  of  the

Army  Civil  Service Union was arrested  soon  after

having  successfully settled an industrial  dispute.

And now the Banishment Ordinance is used in place of

the  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.  The

effect is absolutely the same. Arbitrary powers  are

used    against    trade   unionists    and    other

organisations. Three associations have been  banned.

What,  may  we  know,  are  the  reasons  for   such

undemocratic and pro-colonial measures? Why has  our

Chief  Minister started talking loud and tough after

his  visit to Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd? Has he  come  to

any form of arrangement whereby some form of Merdeka

might  be  secured? Is he preparing the  way  for  a

compromise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if undemocratic measures are going to be used

against  the  people and organisations in  order  to

satisfy  the Colonial Office, then it must  be  made

clear to the Government that such measures shall  be

resisted   to   the   very  end  by   peaceful   and

constitutional means. I must urge the Government  to

take  heed of peaceful and constitutional resistance

to  their  arbitrary  use of  powers.  Peaceful  and

constitutional resistance must be respected for,  if

they  are  not, other forms of resistance may  prove

tempting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In justification of the Government's action, the

Hon. the Chief Minister claims to have the  support

of  the  people  of  Singapore for  his  action.  He

insults  all sense of decency in the statement,  for

the  people  of  Singapore will on no  account  lend

support  to colonialism and colonial stooges.  I  am

informed,  Sir, by the Naval Base Labour Union  that

in  reply to a letter of protest against the  recent

arbitrary arrest, the Hon.the Chief Minister stated

that  the  Trades Union Congress had expressed  full

con-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



fidence in the Government. This point, Sir, was made

in  reply to the Union's assertion that the Hon. the

Chief Minister would be in great difficulty to  find

a  trade  union  that would give unqualified  public

support  to  the Government's action. The  Hon.the

Chief  Minister, of course, had waited  until  after

the  Trades Union Congress meeting to reply  to  the

Naval Base Labour Union.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.  The Naval Base Labour Union never wrote to  me

until  the support of the Trades Union Congress  was

reported in the Press. Do not distort facts.  I  can

take a lot but -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> It is true, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, it is not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> A fact is a fact.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> We all know, Sir, that

the support of the Trades Union Congress is a farce,

I  repeat "it is a farce". The Trades Union Congress

claims to represent 52,000 workers at least, so  the

Press informs us. All the major trade unions in  the

Congress - the  Army  Civil  Service  Union,  the  Air

Ministry Local Staff Union and the Singapore Harbour

Board  Staff Association - have clearly stated in  the

past  that  they  are against arbitrary  arrest  and

detention  of trade union leaders. Other members  of

the   Trades  Union  Congress  have  also  expressed

similar  views but, unfortunately, Sir, these  views

have  not  been given space or publicity in  certain

sections  of  the  Press, particularly  the  English

Press who are now cheering on our Chief Minister  to

further  acts  of  repression.  In  case  the  Chief

Minister and Members of the Government have  cheated

themselves into believing that they have  even  some

measure  of  public support, I would  urge  them  to

accept  the challenge made by the representative  of

the   Singapore  Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union

recently to the Chief Minister, the challenge  being

to  hold  another election throughout the island  of

Singapore or just in Havelock Division. That is  our

challenge  to  him  to  prove  that  he  has  public

support.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude with the remarks

that these recent arrests will go down in the annals

of   this  country's  history  as  a  great  act  of

indiscretion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

although I may sound selfish, I must confess I  have

never  felt  so  happy to be an Independent  Member,

especially on this most controversial issue. We have

heard  two  sides of the argument this morning.  One

side   charges  that  the  actions  taken   by   the

Government  have  merely been  with  the  object  of

wearing  down  the strength of the  P.A.P.,  thereby

paving  the way to victory for the Labour  Front  in

the  coming  elections. This side also  charges  the

Hon. the  Chief Minister as being a stooge  of  the

colonial  power.  On the other  hand,  we  have  the

Government  side explaining to this House  that  the

actions they have taken have been with the object of

wiping  out the Communist-front organisations.  The

Government have also charged the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar, the mover of the original motion, as being  a

Communist stooge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since Government took action in the matter, I

have  received many letters and representations from

all  walks of life saying, "You must not touch  this

question.  This  is  high  politics.  It   is   very

dangerous  if  you do. You might even endanger  your

life."  I  have also received one bit of information

concerning  an hon. Member who has been  called  the

champion  of the people. This is to the effect  that

he  also  supports  the  Government's  action,  but,

because  of his Party Whip, he has not dared  openly

to  declare his support. He is one of our  prominent

leaders. Sir, I think I am most lucky in that I  can

speak  as  an Independent Member without having  any

Party Whip to whip me to speak for the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning we have heard many words and phrases

like  "democracy", "the people", "civil  liberties",

"peaceful  democratic means", "mass  organisations",

etc. Each side selects its own evidence and the rest

of  the  hon. Members, depending on their  point  of

view,  are either pleased or dismayed. The  struggle

is  now  on  for the battle of men's  minds.  But  I

should like to say this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



Sir.  There is now no room for indifference. We  are

all in it, Sir, although in the nature of things  we

dislike  being made to think, to act or  to  support

one   group   or   the  other.  But  after   serious

consideration,  Sir, I must admit  that  I  have  to

support  the  Government's  action  which,  although

regrettable,   is  inevitable.  I  say   regrettable

because I recall the political climate that  we  had

at  the  last  sitting of this  House  which  won  a

unanimous vote of confidence for the Government. And

now  we suddenly have a storm, and a clear split  in

this  House is obvious. Although I am not  a  Labour

Front  member, Sir, I did hear candidates from  that

Party  during the last elections telling the  people

that  their Party was not happy about the Banishment

Ordinance  and  the Emergency Regulations  and  they

promised the people that if they were returned, they

would  repeal or review these two measures. But  now

the  Labour  Front finds that it has  to  use  these

unpopular and undemocratic measures in the interests

of the people. What is also regrettable is that I am

afraid that among the arrested persons there was,  I

think, at least one whom I would term as a political

scapegoat. I believe many of the real leaders of the

subversive elements are still at large. I will  take

this opportunity to quote one example of what I term

a political scapegoat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen Kwang Fung was one of those arrested. He was the Chairman of the Chinese Primary School Teachers' Union. I wonder if the Government can give me an assurance that his arrest had nothing to do with his activities in the field of Chinese education. Sir, I have personal knowledge that after

the  publication of the Government  White  Paper  on

Chinese  Education, Chinese education  circles  have

had  fears and worries over the Government's policy.

I do not know how many times I have said it - that the

Chinese are really worried over Government's  policy

on  Chinese education and their doubts and fears  up

till  now have still not been removed. Although  the

implementation  of  Government's policy  on  Chinese

education  has not gathered full force, the  Chinese

community  is still worried. If the Chinese  schools

accept the full aid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



scheme, the future of Chinese education, they  fear,

will not be secure. Although the full aid scheme has

been  in  operation for at least two  years  now,  I

think  slightly over a hundred Chinese schools  have

accepted it. Therefore recently I was approached  by

many  Chinese educational circles, and one  of  them

was  Mr Chen Kwang Fung, on how best to tackle this

problem. I felt that it was not the time for  us  to

oppose the full aid scheme. I said that the best way

to  tackle the problem was to call a meeting of  all

Chinese  school principals and management committees

to  discuss how we were going to accept the full aid

scheme  and how we were going to secure an assurance

from the Government that



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The school committees' administrative power

would not be jeopardised;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That their curriculum would not be jeopardised

too;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the opening up of classes was also not to

be limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on the question of Malayanisation of

Chinese  textbooks, we desired to seek clarification

from  the  Government on the word  "Malayanisation".

The  Chinese are afraid that the Government is going

to  use  the  opportunity  of  malayanising  Chinese

textbooks to lower their standards. They are  afraid

because, for over a year now, the Government has not

sincerely   carried  out  the  policy  of  bilingual

education.  They  feel it has now become  one-sided.

Sir,  bilingual education has already proved  to  be

successful  in  Chinese schools but not  in  English

schools. The extent of the Chinese, Malay and  Tamil

languages   taught   in  the  English   schools   is

insufficient  to  convince  the  Chinese  that   the

Government's  promise of equality in the  sphere  of

education for all races is being fulfilled.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

the hon. Member can indicate how that is relevant to

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, these remarks have been

made  because  I  think it is my duty  to  find  out

whether  Mr Chen Kwang Fung's arrest was  connected

with  the  activities of the proposed calling  of  a

Chinese school conference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I  have personal knowledge of Mr Chen  Kwang

Fung.  So, Sir, based on all the facts that  I  have

stated  above, we felt that the calling of a Chinese

school  conference was very urgent and essential  in

discussing  the Government full aid scheme.  It  was

not  a  political  manoeuvre, nor  was  the  meeting

called for political interests. We did not intend to

go round to people and say, "We must oppose the full

aid  scheme. Anything that the Government  does,  we

must oppose." We did not mean that. I convinced  Mr

Chen  Kwang  Fung  that we must hold  a  meeting  to

discuss the matter and at the same time seek certain

assurances from the Government. But we did not  call

a conference in order to oppose the Government. Sir,

I just wish to seek an assurance from the Government

that  the  arrest  of Mr Chen Kwang  Fung  was  not

connected  with  this proposal  to  hold  a  Chinese

school conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on what I have said, that it was

inevitable that Government should take the action it

did. Why inevitable? Because the extremist movement

(I  am  not a Member of the Government, so I  cannot term  it as subversive or Communist - moreover,  I  do not  know what that is) after 2nd April has terribly

jeopardised  the stability of this country.  It  has

definitely  not  done any good for the  independence

movement, and I think it should be checked in  time.

It  is  up  to the Government to do it at the  right

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to say a few worth about public

opinion. Just now we have heard one side say that it

is  doing  this  and that in the  interests  of  the

people.. But the other side says, "No, that  is  not

in  the  interests of the people." Unfortunately,  I

have to admit that the Member for Tanjong Pagar  and

the  Member sitting behind him and their  Party  are

closely  connected with the dissolved  organisations

and  the  arrested  persons. As  an  Independent,  I

should like to say that they should not claim to  be

doing things in the interests of the people when, in

fact,  they are doing them in the interests  of  the

People's  Action Party. I take this opportunity  to'

say this: If any organisations or any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



leaders   want   to   claim  themselves   as   civic

organisations or civic leaders, they should  clearly

cut  themselves away from any political connections.

These organisations should bear in mind that if they

want   to   fight   for   their   stand   as   civic

organisations,  they  should never  enter  politics.

Also,  these  civic leaders should not become  their

advisers.  Do not use these organisations for  party

interests. If there is a civic leader who  wants  to

support your Party, then invite him to enrol as your

Party  member. But these organisations  and  leaders

should not go round telling the people, "No, we  are

fighting  for all. We are fighting for  liberty  for

all.  We  are not fighting for party interests."  We

cannot    deny   the   fact   that   the   dissolved

organisations and the arrested persons were  closely

connected with a political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to tell the Government the true facts,

and  that  is, that the feelings among  the  Parties

over  this  issue  are  clearly  divided - among   the

intellectuals, between the English-educated and  the

Chinese-educated. Feelings are also divided  between

the  intelligentsia and the illiterate. Sir, I  wish

the  Government would take note that the masses have

long   been  wooed  and  controlled  by  a   certain

extremist group and this group is irresponsible  and

does  not  have the real interests of the people  of

Singapore. Therefore, the illiterate masses must  be

well  informed in the most effective way and by  the

quickest means possible. Sir, with this in  view,  I

urge  the  Government  to  make  its  actions  fully

understood by the public. I think the easiest way to

do  this is to consider releasing certain details in

the report of the findings of these arrests and,  if

possible, when these people appeal (I am very  happy

that  the  Government has accepted  their  appeals),

that  every elected Minister should sink  his  party

interests and consider every case according  to  his

conscience. I hope they will be given a fair  trial,

and  that  those  who are proved  innocent  will  be

released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also like a repeat assurance from the

Hon.the Chief Minister that his Government's recent

actions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



have  been taken in the interests of the people  and

have nothing to do with these three factors:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Party politics;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As a result of influence brought to bear by

the  Hon. the Chief Secretary, especially from  the

Special Branch;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) As a result of an inducement from the British

Colonial Secretary, Mr Lennox-Boyd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder how many times I have stressed the

importance of unity in our independence movement.  I

wonder  how  many  times  I  have  appealed  to  all

political   Party  leaders  to  sink   their   petty

grievances  and suppress their desire to play  party

politics,  at  least until after  we  have  achieved

Merdeka.  Sir, if we want to go all out for Merdeka,

let  us  try  and  remember that the word  "Merdeka"

itself  does  not come from Malaya but  is  borrowed

from Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Indonesia borrowed it from us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> So let us follow the example

of Indonesia. Let us just support one leader and one

voice  in  our  independence movement.  Look  around

Singapore  today. Different Parties  have  different

explanations for the simple word "Merdeka"  and  for

the expression "in the interests of the people".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy indeed, Sir, to see so many

political  Party  leaders  today  professing  to  be

disciples  of Mr Nehru, especially the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar. I wish that he can really succeed  in

doing  what  Mr Nehru has done for  the  people  of

India.  Mr  Nehru was not only the  leader  of  the

farmers,  the  students or the workers.  He  is  the

national  leader for all classes and  all  races  in

India. Why cannot all political Parties emulate him?

Why   be  overbearing,  petty,  class-conscious  and

incapable  of winning the confidence of the  masses?

Why  should  we  only want to make  a  leader  of  a

certain  class  or  of  a  certain  race?  I  cannot

understand this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is most disheartening to me to see such a

wide   gulf   of   misunderstanding   between    the

intelligentsia and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



masses in Singapore. I will quote one example. If  a

house is beyond repair, it must be pulled down and a

new  one put up. But if it can be repaired, why pull

it down? Countries like Russia and China, after they

had  been torn by civil strifes and because of their

low  standard of living, naturally had  to  turn  to

Marxism to help them rebuild. Political leaders, let

us  be  practical. Look around you. Singapore  today

probably enjoys the highest living standard in South-East  Asia.  Sir, to go back to my  analogy  of  the

house: if we just remove certain white and red  ants

that  are  infesting the house, it will then  become

beautiful and its foundations will remain strong. If

anyone wants to introduce extremism in Singapore,  I

term  him either a member of the elite or a  useless

genius.  Now  is  the  time for  us  to  bridge  all

misunderstandings and work as one solid united  body

aspiring  towards Merdeka. We must  learn  from  the

lessons  of India, Indonesia and Burma and  see  how

they  reaped their independence harvest. How are  we

going  to  produce leaders like Gandhi, Sukarno  and

General U Aung Sang?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> What about Lee Kuan Yew?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Give him a chance! Train him!

Hsueh   hsi!  Sir,  I  would  like  to   take   this

opportunity,  although he is not in, to  advise  the

Hon. the  Chief  Minister  that  he  must  not   be

overjoyed  and over-confident because  of  the  many

praises  that he has received from the whole  world,

especially  from  the Western bloc  and  the  United

States, for his recent actions. Sir, I wish to point

out  that although I want Singapore to be united and

to be Asia and Africa conscious, I am sure the Chief

Minister would not like to be a second Syngman  Rhee

of South Korea or a Chiang Kai-shek of Formosa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I will say why I support the

amendment  moved  by the Chief Minister.  I  confess

that  at first I did decide to move an amendment  of

my  own but not on these lines. The Chief Minister's

amendment has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



cleverly divided into two parts, the first of  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...takes note of the recent arrests of six

persons under the Banishment Ordinance and one

person under the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance and the

dissolution of two societies...".



<br><br>Sir, nobody can condemn this - that this House takes

note of these acts. The second part of his amendment

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and welcomes the strong action taken by the

Government against subversive elements in     Singapore."



<br><br>I  do not know whether any decent and right-thinking

people  can oppose the Government for taking  strong

action against subversive elements. Therefore, I beg

to support the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  should like to add my mite as  a  Nominated

Member to a debate that is essentially the pigeon of

elected Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened rather sadly to the Cassandra-like

utterances of the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew) which I am certain the outside world will

heavily  discount if ever it gets round  to  reading

them  in detail. I have the greatest admiration  for

the  gifts  of the hon. Member and I wish  that  his

prophetic  zeal could have been used  on  the  other

side;  not  the colonial side but the anti-Communist

side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the Member for Tanjong Pagar used his

device of ridiculing by reading in a particular  way

some  of  the  complimentary things said  about  the

Chief Minister in the English Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)

has   already   mentioned  the  stock  market.   The

reference  to  a  rise  in the  local  share  market

particularly  got  under his skin although  he  said

that  he  was  amused by it but he doubtless  thinks

that  the  said rise is due to the machinations  and

manipulations  of capitalist speculators.  In  fact,

the improvement in the local stock market has merely

brought the quotations for these local companies  up

to where they would normally have been if it had not

been  for the series of crises that we have  had  in

this  island over the last 18 months. This  rise  in

the stock markets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



which  the hon. Member was so contemptuous of  is  a

clear  indication that business and trade interests,

on which this island depends, and the people welcome

wholeheartedly the vigorous and courageous action of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inescapable fact is that Singapore is

divided  into two camps - Communist and anti-Communist

-  and  on one side, as plainly as the nose on one's

face,  especially a European nose, is  the  People's

Action  Party.  The  frequent  references  by  their

spokesmen  to their desire to build up a democratic,

non-Communist  Malaya are to my  mind  merely  over-protesting,   as  today's  speeches   have   clearly

indicated,  but even if their leaders are  not  true

Communists surely no one doubts but that their ranks

are  thick  with Reds. I used to give  the  People's

Action  Party  credit  for being  consistent.  Their

leaders  urged  early union with the Federation  and

warned  against the dangers of delay. Now  it  would

seem  to me they are doing everything in their power

to  keep these two territories apart. Obviously, the

Federation Government can only view with the gravest

misgivings    the   manifestations   of    Communist

activities  in this city though the fact that  these

have been brought out into the open recently may  be

a good thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly interested in some of the

points  made  by  the  Minister for  Education  this

afternoon and I must say that I learned a great deal

from  what  he  said.  It struck  me  while  he  was

speaking  that one of the most contemptible  devices

used  by  the  Communists is their  so-called  anti-yellow  culture campaign which they use  to  further

their political ends. Yellow culture, of course,  is

as  old  as time but according to the Communists  or

even  according  to  some of the  spokesmen  of  the

People's  Action  Party, it  flourishes  only  under

colonialism.  Now,  anti-yellow  culture  they   say

cannot  be  separated from the  fight  for  national

independence  and for getting rid of colonial  rule.

Only  when  Singapore has uprooted  yellow  culture,

they say, can she flourish. What rubbish! Men may be

good or evil but in the latter case, it is their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



hearts  that you have to change, not their politics.

What  is there I wonder, Mr Speaker, in dialectical

materialism  or the atheistic creed of Communism  to

change  men's  hearts  or  to  rid  their  minds  of

pornography? Yet the Communists would link the anti-yellow  movement with the Merdeka movement to  fight

for independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us have some sweet reason.

Is  not  the use of the words "struggle" and "fight"

in  the  way  they  are always  used  today  in  the

"struggle  and  fight  against  colonialism"  sense,

really a sort of euphemism in reverse? Is there  any

real  fight  or struggle? Is it still believed  that

the  wicked  Colonial Office, as distinct  from  the

British  Government,  will double-cross  Malaya  and

Singapore and refuse to grant self-government? To my

mind,  this  colony  is approaching  self-government

more rapidly than anyone here ever expected it would

do  and  it would be a far, far better thing if  all

references  to  the  so-called  evils - many  of  them

imaginary - of  a dying regime were dropped  once  and

for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References to "the people" have come up again - the

point  I  have touched on before in this House.  The

Member  for  Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)  has

said, according to what I read in the Press that the

Singapore Factory and Shop Workers' Union has 30,000

members  and this doubtless is "the people" to  whom

he  refers.  It  should be noted however  that  this

figure is only 2� per cent of the population of the

island of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the hopelessly biased Straits Times,

the  hon.  Member (Mr Lim Ching Siong) regards  the

English-language   Press   as   hostile    to    the

people - hostile  to his 2� per cent,  I  suppose - and

according to this newspaper he stated, and  I  quote

from the Straits Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I object to newspaper reports about the existence

of  an  anti-Communist group which  has  distributed

leaflets in schools."



<br><br>Surely  this reveals with the clearest of  clearness

that   the  gentleman  is  pro-Communist,  and   the

difference  between a pro-Communist and a  Communist

cannot be, to my mind, very great.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the point which was raised by the

Member  for  Tanglin (Mr Ede). The Hon. the  Chief

Minister in a speech made in this Assembly  on  25th

July,  1955,  gave  a definition of  the  people  of

Singapore.  He  was prompted to  do  so  because  of

questions  asked by me and, he said, in  giving  his

answer, to improve my political education. This  was

his definition:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people of Singapore ... are the people who are

represented   by  their  representatives   in   this Assembly,  and  in  a democracy, the  majority  view represents the view of the people."



<br><br>The  Hon. the  Chief Minister will,  no  doubt,  be pleased  to know that I gave attention to his  words

and I now offer them to the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

a sad spectacle - at least it is for me - to see one who

is  so  able and talented as the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) misdirecting his  energies

and  talent  to  attacking the Government.  And  for

what?  For  protecting the people of Singapore  from

subversion. Sir, I suggest he can better utilise his

talents and energies towards more constructive work.

It was, Sir, a touching experience to hear him speak

without conviction in his own heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as is usual with the People's Action Party

and  those that are behind them, to cloak  the  real

reasons  for Government's action, they  try  to  put

forward  the  argument  for  the  benefit  of  their

followers  that the real reason why Government  took

this  strong  action was to wipe out  opposition  so

that  the  Government could come in with a  thumping

victory in the next elections. Sir, this is a wilful

distortion of facts. Nothing is further  away  from

the minds of the Members of the Government. In fact,

we could have expected that sort of a line if we did

not have this elected Government in power but if  we

had  members of the People's Action Party  in  power

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they set themselves up as champions of

Merdeka.  Merdeka  for what and  Merdeka  for  whom?

Merdeka for that minority group who, the moment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



they   get  Merdeka,  will  set  themselves  up   as

dictators?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member stated that he would not mind it so

much  if  the  Government had a  team  of  men  with

courage,  ability and integrity to pursue their  aim

methodically. Sir, I have a suspicion  that  he  was

advocating  blind ruthlessness. I, Sir, as  one  who

believes  in  democracy, will never be  a  party  to

blind ruthlessness. Those may be the tactics that he

and  his Back-benchers employ but, Sir, a government

that  is  democratically elected, that  is,  through

democracy,   cannot  pursue  a   policy   of   blind

ruthlessness. The Government will be firm  no  doubt

in  dealing with subversion but the Government  will

act  with consideration and will consider every case

as  it has been doing, with thoroughness so that  no

person  will lose his liberty just because of  blind

ruthlessness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about the boom in the

share market and the happiness of the merchants  and

members  of the Chambers of Commerce. Sir,  what  is

wrong if happiness is expressed by the merchants and

by  members of the Chambers of Commerce? They are as

integral  a  part of our society as are the  workers

and,  Sir,  we  must remember that our workers  find

employment  as a result of the commercial activities

of these merchants. If we have Merdeka, do we want a

Merdeka where everyone has employment or do we  want

to  scare  away these merchants and then  achieve  a

Merdeka  where  there  is unemployment  and  poverty

amongst the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member pleaded for free play of ideas within

the  constitutional framework. Sir, that is  a  very

desirable idea and it should be encouraged  as  much

as  possible provided there is no hitting below  the

belt  by  both sides; but as we know the tactics  of

these  subversive elements, they work like termites.

All  of a sudden one fine day you discover that  the

very  foundations of your house have  been  attacked

and  the  house is about to tumble down.  Sir,  with

that   sort  of  subversion,  you  cannot   be   too

democratic but still the Government does give a  lot

of   consideration  to  every  individual  case.  We

thoroughly dislike,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  the  use  of  the  Banishment  Ordinance   and

detentions under the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance, and so on, but if we are to carry out the

trust  that  has  been  placed  by  the  people   of

Singapore  in  us, it is an action  that  we  cannot

escape.  We  have to do it and we have  to  be  firm

about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is afraid that at the moment we may

have  a  conscience  but that,  later  on,  as  time

progresses,  our conscience may start  thinning  out

and  in  the  end  we may end up as dictators.  What

would  have happened, Sir, if his Party had been  in

power  today?  Probably they would not have  started

with a conscience at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a popular fallacy and propaganda to

term  those who do not follow certain ideologies  as

non-Asians,  as  anti-Asians, and so  on.  In  Asia

today, you have three types of ideologies: there are

certain  lands with a Communist ideology; there  are

certain  lands  and  people who do  not  believe  in

Communism and have adopted a democratic way of life;

and  then there are others who being democratic will

not   take  sides,  like  India  and  certain  other

countries  who  are termed what is called  neutrals.

Does the Member say that all those who do not follow

the Communist ideology are not Asians?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that the people of Singapore

do  not  like the strong action that the  Government

has   taken.  But,  Sir,  who  are  the  people   of

Singapore?  If  he means to say that the  people  of

Singapore  are  only  those few thousands  that  are

represented by the People's Action Party and by  the unions  that  are behind the People's Action  Party, there  are hundreds of thousands of others  who  are not with the People's Action Party. What about them? Are  they  not the people of Singapore too?  I  say, Sir,  that  those who are with the Government  today

are in the majority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Member for Tanjong Pagar

will  realise  that it is not to the liking  of  the

Government that this action has been taken but it is

like a medicine that has got to be swallowed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



Sir, if we have a cancer in our body whether we like

it  or  not we have to undergo an operation. Doctors

do  not like to perform operations but they have got

to operate to remove the cancer and that is what our

position is today.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I  am  speaking today not only as a Minister of  the

Coalition Government but also as the leader  of  the

Alliance  in the Government. Invariably,  Sir,  when

statements  are  made by the Singapore  Factory  and

Shop Workers' Union or other organisations connected

with  the  Union  referring  to  the  Government  of

Singapore,  they  refer to it as  the  Labour  Front

Government. It is, Sir, the' Labour Front  Coalition

Government and I am proud to say that I and my Party

are  also responsible for the actions that have been

taken by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember correctly, Sir, on the 20th of

September,  soon  after the  arrests  of  the  seven

subversive  elements, six of them to be banished,  a

statement  came out from Middle Road to  the  effect

that  Government had acted unwisely because  six  of

the proposed banishees were people who were going to

fight  for the Merdeka of this island. This morning,

Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister made it very clear

that  the  proposed banishees were all born  outside

Malaya.  I say, Sir, that if anyone at all is  going

to  fight for the Merdeka of this island, it is  we,

the  people of Singapore, the citizens of Singapore,

who should fight for Merdeka and not foreigners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, and this tickles me to death.

The  Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong) - I

believe  it  was last week - when he referred  to  the

Ministers of the elected Government, he referred to

us  as colonial stooges. This morning, Sir, we  have

been  reduced  from that rank to Quislings.  Sir,  I

know  what  Quislings are. They are the  people  who

after the last war were put up against the wall  and

shot  to death, rightly or wrongly. Presumably, Sir,

when the People's Action Party comes into power, we,

the  Quislings on this side, will be put up  against

the  wall  and  shot to death, as the  Quislings  in

Europe.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede)

and  the  Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon  Teck)

have  already voiced the opinion of my Party.  I  am

just here to add a few more points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody in this world likes restrictions. Nobody in

this world likes arbitrary power to be placed in the

hands  of  anybody. In fact, if these  were  normal

times,  we  would be the first to ask Government  to

repeal  all these laws that give absolute  power  to

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past and especially during the election

campaign, many Parties, including the Labour  Front,

thought  that it would be a good move to remove  the

emergency  powers. They tried to  live  up  to  that

promise  but  however after being in government  for

some  time,  they  found that it  was  necessary  to

retain  those powers, but to retain them in  a  more

palatable  form  in the name of the Preservation  of

Public Security Ordinance. At the time of the debate

on  the  Preservation  of Public  Security  Bill,  I

believe   that  that  Bill  received  the  unanimous

approval of the House and that was the expression of

the  people about the state of affairs in Singapore.

Of  course, when Government is using it today, it is

using  the  power that is entrusted  to  it  by  the

people.  When we give certain powers to  Government,

we  expect the Government to use them, but  we  must

always ask Government to use them after very careful

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, I heard two sides of the story. I

expected to hear a very good defence put up  by  the

People's Action Party but I was really disappointed.

On  the other hand, the accounts by the Ministers on

the  opposite Benches have given me a clear picture.

As  an  Assemblyman in this House, I  am  not  in  a

position  to  look  into the  Government  files  for

details  of  why  those people were arrested  and  I

think  that  this  morning's debate  will  give  the

people of Singapore a chance to know what was really

behind  all  the arrests. In fact, one `day,  I  was

confronted with a question by the President  of  the

Federation of Women's Association, Linda  Chen.  She

came along to me and asked me to support her in  her

anti-yellow movement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



and  she  asked me these questions: "Why  do  people

accuse  me  of being a Communist? Why do people  say

that   the   anti-yellow  movement  is  a  Communist

organisation?" The answer I gave her was this,  "Ask

yourself.  As far as I am concerned, I know  nothing

about it and if you think that people are asking you

these questions, search yourself. Probably there  is

something  behind these questions." Of  course,  the

Government  this  morning gave their  reply  to  her

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, whenever an action is taken by any one Party,

there is always a great deal of suspicion by others.

This   morning,  we  heard  accusations   that   the

Government had made a pact with the Colonial Office.

This,  I think, is due to the suspicion of one Party

against  another. In fact, during the  last  Merdeka

talks, we were wrongly accused of making a pact with

the  Colonial Office when there was no truth in that

whatsoever, and I believe probably this may  be  the

same case. Having experienced false accusation once,

I  can understand the Government a little bit better

when  it  is  placed  in such a  position.  However,

whatever  the outcome, the people of Singapore  must

realise that in order to retain the greatest  amount

of  freedom, we must sacrifice a small portion of it

and leave it to the wise decision of the Government.

And to the Government, we say: So long as you use it

wisely,   carefully  and  with  a  great   deal   of

consideration, we will support such action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it seems from the P.A.P. and their supporters'

point  of  view that any opinion which differs  from

theirs must be wrong and that any reports of support

other  than  for  the  Middle  Road  group  must  be

fictitious. Because they have indulged in this  game

of  deceit so often, they are automatically  led  to

believe that other people must be doing likewise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two weeks, Sir, I have been approached

by   a  number  of  people  comprising  businessmen,

professional men, teachers, students, labourers, and

so on. Without exception, all of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



them  wished  to tell me how glad they were  of  the

Government's  action  in the  recent  detentions  of

these troublemakers. They even said, "We have a hope

now that the teachers can really teach, the students

can really study and the workmen can work peacefully

without  intimidation  and  interference  from   the

Middle  Road  group." Some people went  further  and

said,  "The  Government should detain more  and  for

those  whom we cannot deport, we are quite  prepared

to  contribute to their support in gaol."  Such  are

the opinions of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

(Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew) this morning was  that  we  are

supposed  to be a caretaker Government.  Surely,  he

does  not  think  that because we  are  a  caretaker

Government,  we  should refrain from  governing.  If

that  is  so, then what is the purpose of forming  a

Government?  We might as well hand it  over  to  the

Permanent Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the same Member was that

all  that was done by the Government to prevent  its

defeat  in the coming elections. I think we on  this

side  of the House do not regard the result  of  the

next  elections  so  important  as  the  P.A.P.   We

consider that our duty is to govern and that  if  we

govern  well,  we do not care very  much  about  the

result  of the next elections a bit but we sincerely

believe  that if we are going to carry  on  what  we

have  already started, we will be returned in  spite

of  whatever  propaganda the  P.A.P. may  put  over

against us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 9 people are detained under the Ordinances

approved by this House which were specially drawn up

to  deal  with this type of cases. To say  that  the

Government  is  undemocratic because  they  have  to

carry out duties entrusted to them is to say that we

should  close  the  Assembly and  carry  out  public

trials as we have in Communist China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I would like to ask all Members of this

House  who have the future of Singapore at heart  to

support  the  amended motion of the Hon. the  Chief

Minister to deal a blow to these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



subversive  elements which, if left unchecked,  will

definitely  lead  us  to  a similar  fate  as  other

Communist-dominated countries in this  part  of  the

world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment

moved  by the Hon. the Chief Minister appears to  me

to negative my motion. But if you are satisfied that

this  does not infringe the rules of debate in  this

Assembly, then no more need be said about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of speeches we have heard

today:  from the Government, those who are  involved

in the administration, and speeches from the Liberal-Socialist  Party Members who have been supported  so

"joyously" by Mr Sutherland. Then there were two Independents who went one each way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole tenor of the Government's speeches was

completely  negative: "They are subversive.  I  have

the  information that they are subversive. We intend

to  deal  with them firmly. We will deal  with  them

firmly. We know what we are doing and we will  march

on  to  democracy."  Then  comes  the  Minister  for

Education with his most interesting speech in  which

whole extracts of propaganda material of the Chinese

Middle  Schools Students' Union were given  a  great

deal of publicity. But the depressing thing about it

all is that none of the speakers made any attempt to

understand what this is all about. "Communism is  an

unmitigated  evil. We are determined  to  fight  it.

They  are  white ants. They are red ants.  We  shall

squash  them."  How? By locking them up?  You  might

succeed  if you could be as ruthless as Hitler.  You

get  them and put them in the gas chamber.  You  get

their  books  and you burn them. But Hitler  failed.

They  are  not  as  ruthless  as  Hitler,  not  this

Government  anyway. Not that they do  not  have  the

inclinations if given the opportunities,  but  I  do

not think they have sufficient ruthlessness of moral

character.  As  the  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing  said, he  is  somewhat  worried

because he might be put up against the wall and shot

when it is all over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I am sure you meant that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir, not if the P.A.P. wins

an  election.  If  there is going  to  be  an  armed

revolution in Malaya, then that may well happen. But

if  you  are prepared to let this revolution resolve

itself   by   peaceful  competition   and   peaceful

parliamentary and constitutional methods,  then  you

will  avoid  those  unpleasant  consequences  of   a

violent revolution. There is an astonishing blissful

ignorance of what this is all about. Does anybody in

this House believe that if they just lock up all the

trouble-makers  in all these trade  unions  and  get

voluntary  contributions  from  wealthy  people  and

architects  like the Member for Pasir  Panjang  (Mr

Wong  Foo  Nam) to feed them in gaol, that they  can

keep them locked up for ever, that one day they will

not  have  to release them? They will come out  more

fervent,  more  determined than when the  Government

put  them  in,  more  skilful in  their  methods  of

propaganda  and their tactics of violent revolution.

Assuming  that  you want to play the fair  way,  one

day,  sooner or later, you will have to say:  "Well,

everything is all right. We will let them  out."  Or

you banish them. So, many great revolutionaries were

in  exile.  Ho Chi-minh was in exile for  years  and

years. Then one day he went back to his country  and

the revolution leavened until finally the French met

the  Vietminh on the battlefield and got  themselves

destroyed.  You  can only fight  this  if  you  have

something positive. If you have your ideas. Then you

can fight to propagate those ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard with astonishment the Minister for

Education deriding this hsueh hsi method.  There  is

one   thing  about  the  Communist  which  wins   my

admiration. He picks up what is good from the  other

side.  He is not blind. If you have something  good,

he  takes it over, like "Merdeka", anything which is

good.  But  if  the Communists have something  good,

because  they have started it, you say, "No,  it  is

Communist.  We will not have it." How else  can  you

marshal  the  people  on your side  if  you  do  not

propagate  your  ideas, if you  do  not  have  news-sheets,  microphones, and workers to put  over  your

ideas  and plans that will solve the evils  of  this

society?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



Is  the Government going to sit back and say, "Look,

this  is  trouble-making and anybody who  does  this

will  upset  my  shares and then there  will  be  no

business.  Then what will happen to the workers?  We

must  stop it. We will suppress it."? They have  tried

it  in other parts of the world and they have failed

and the result was a violent revolution. Hearing the

speeches  today,  I think Lenin is right:  Bourgeois

institutions  will in the last resort use  force  to

keep down a revolution. They will not give in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of fighting a revolution. One

way  is  by peaceful competition which the democrats

all  say they believe in. "You propagate your  ideas

peacefully, persuade the people to vote for you. You

win  and you take over." That is the theory. When  I

learned  my  constitutional law I was  told  that  a

parliamentary  democracy was the acme of  perfection

of  man's  political organisations. In Britain,  for

400  years,  there have been no violent  revolutions

because one had this interplay within a system which

allowed   changes   to  take   place   by   peaceful

persuasion. If a group gets the majority  of  people

to  vote  for  them, then automatically they  assume

power.  There is continuity in the government.  They

can  introduce their legislation and bring about the

changes they desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory is that if the British Communist Party

could  put up a sufficient number of candidates  and

be able either by political persuasion or propaganda

or   other   constitutional   means   of   political

leadership to get the majority of the people to vote

for  them,  then  they  would  become  the  lawfully

constituted and elected government of the people.  I

believed that once upon a time. The Communists  were

accused  of  being evil men who believed in  violent

revolution  for the sake of violent revolution,  who

did  not want to compete peacefully and who did  not

want  to  test  one idea against another  idea.  The

whole  international  Communist  and  anti-Communist

position  has  changed with the hydrogen  bomb.  The

whole   international   Communist   philosophy    is

undergoing a radical change with de-Stalinisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



peaceful co-existence, peaceful competition. Openly,

the  Kremlin now says to European Communist Parties,

"Cooperate  with other Socialist organisations.  You

can   win  power  by  democratic  and  parliamentary

processes." And the West says, "Look, this must  be

a  great conspiracy. We must be the loser somewhere.

No, we will not co-operate. We will not allow you to

win   and  compete  in  a  democratic  parliamentary

fashion."  It  is one of those things which  depress

those who have been liberally educated because  they

assumed  that  what  they  were  told  was  honestly

believed.  Later they discover that,  in  fact,  all

those  pious  protestations  about  the  virtues  of

democracy were not quite true. Once upon a time  the

Americans said that the Russians wanted to  conquer

the  world by force. Therefore they had to  arm  and

fight  the Russians. Then one day, Moscow said,  "We

are going to disarm." And Mr Dulles said, "This  is

a great threat because I would rather have a Russian

soldier in uniform in non-productive work than in  a

factory  in  productive work because  then  he  will

compete with me economically."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world picture is undergoing a change and

little  men in Singapore do not understand  that  we

are  a  part  of  a world revolution.  This  is  the

greatest  revolution in the history of mankind.  For

the  first time in the history of man, he is  trying

to  establish an egalitarian society. I believe  the

process towards such a society is inevitable. We can

reach  it by one of two ways. We either have  it  by

peaceful   evolution  or  we  have  it  by   violent

revolution. The only difference between a democratic

Left-wing  Socialist and a Communist  is  this:  The

Communist  believes  that it is impossible  to  have

peaceful  evolution and that force is  necessary  to

crush  vested interests who will prevent a  workers'

revolution. The Socialist believes it is possible to

have peaceful evolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this policy of repression is pursued, if this

is  the  policy  in Malaya, then the Communists  are

right. There is little room for Left-wing Socialists

who   preach  social  revolution  by  constitutional

methods because those now in power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



will  not  let  the Communists win constitutionally.

The Communists cannot compete constitutionally. They

are  out  of the race. They will not let them  stand

for  elections because they are subversive.  What  I

say is this. The Government may have information  of

the  guilt of these six men. The Government may  not

have  this  information. The Special Branch  may  be

right,  the Special Branch may be wrong. But to  put

the argument at its highest for the Government, even

if,  in fact, these six men believe in Communism - the

question still remains whether they are prepared  to

compete  constitutionally and  peacefully.  If  they

have  never  done anything which is not peaceful  or

constitutional,  then you are  negating  your  whole

political  philosophy when you say, "I  will  arrest

you  because  I  think you are propagating  an  idea

which  I consider pernicious and which I propose  to

stop and prevent from spreading."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone honestly believe that by banning hsueh

hsi  and a few Chinese books it is possible to  stop

the  spread of ideas? Nehru once said that ideas are

the greatest weapons in the world since they know no

custom  barriers and national frontiers. If  you  do

not  have  equally  powerful ideas  to  make  people

believe  that what you are doing is right  and  will

bring about a better society, if you are bankrupt of

ideas  and  all  you  can say is,  "1  am  going  to

checkmate you. I will lock you up. I will break  you

up",  then  I  say  the  end result  is  a  foregone

conclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier - and I was not inciting the Labour

Front to be ruthless - that they have one chance in  a

million of making it succeed and it is this,  It  is

like building up your local industry. First you  say

to  yourself, "All right, I am too weak to  compete.

So  I  put up trade barriers, custom tariffs  and  I

build  up  my  industries."  But  can  you  do  that

forever? Does anybody believe that that is  the  way

in  which  to  build up the economy  of  a  country?

Eventually, you will have to face conditions in  the

world, not conditions just in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Liberal-Socialist Party, they are even

worse  than the Government. The leader of the Party,

the  Member for Serangoon, was reported in the Press

as  saying, when I made an application to  the  Hon.

the  Chief Minister to have an emergency sitting  of

the  Assembly:  "The Chief Minister knows  something

about it. The P.A.P. knows something about it. I  am

all  in the dark. I do not know anything about  it."

And   not  knowing  anything  about  it,  his  Party

magazine comes straight out in full support  of  the

Government,  right  or wrong,  whatever  it  is  all

about,  arrest the boys. That is the spirit. "It  is

time  for a showdown", says the editorial report  of

30th  September. That is the way they compete.  They

have got no ideas. They are politically bankrupt. If

we  say we are Socialists, and we win elections,  he

says he is also a Socialist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Mr Sutherland wondered, was I amused? I was

amused  because  Members like the  Member  for  Paya

Lebar  (Mr  Lim Koon Teck) did not understand  that

there   is   an   inherent  contradiction   in   the

Government's  position.  The  Government  today   is

rallying  around it all the reactionary forces,  all

the riff-raff, and depending on that support. Yet if

the  Government is honest in its aim of a  Socialist

society,  then it will have to subdue  these  forces

that   support  it.  Does  the  Government  honestly

believe that Mr Clayton of the European Chamber  of

Commerce upon whose support it depends will sit idly

by  if  they  move against his interests?  Why  have

industrial shares gone up? Because they now  believe

that  perhaps  for five years - maybe ten  or  fifteen

years  if  they  are  lucky and they  can  keep  the

situation under control - their enterprises are  going

to  produce profits, for all these years and not  be

confiscated. On the other hand, if the P.A.P. comes

in,  it is certain that taxation will go up.  It  is

also certain that labour costs will go up. And it is

probable  that  once their managerial and  technical

contribution is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



longer  required they might be bought out. Therefore

share prices will drop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said this morning that the Government had one

chance  in a million, and that was putting  it  very

generously.  I do not want to use Communist  phrases

like   "self-review",  but  I  ask  this  Government

honestly  to search their hearts and ask  themselves

whether  the steps they are taking are more  in  the

interest of the people or - whether they intend it  or

not - in  the interest of European investors  in  this

country?   Let  us  accept,  at  face   value,   the

protestations of the Hon. the Chief Minister that he

made  this decision himself with no promptings  from

anyone, that, in fact, the European officials  stood

by  while  six elected local Ministers decided  that

they  were going to wade in and settle things  where

the  British Army, Navy and Air Force have not  been

able so to do for the last eight years. What has the

Chief  Minister got that the British did  not  have?

Only one thing, namely, that he is an Asian and  the

people  might get confused. Because now  instead  of

the white man versus the rest, it is the rest versus

the   rest.   Then   he  gets  all  the   riff-raff,

kindergartens, libraries, etc, lining up on his side

and the men with the ideals, whatever their ultimate

political convictions, on the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody talks of the masses. The masses are

important because if you give one man one vote, then

you  have  to take him into account. But  I  shudder

when I think of the complete naivety with which they

approach the problem of revolution in Malaya. It  is

not  just  a  question  of counting  up  unions  and

associations and then saying, "I have got more on my

side." "I have been round my constituency", says the

Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede). He was elected  by  a

lot  of  European expatriates - who should never  have

been given a vote in the first place. "They tell  me

in  the rural areas that the Government's action  is

in  the right spirit and we will support you." Well,

if  they  honestly believe in this, let us  have  an

election.  I  do  not think anybody really  believes

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do know that the phoney phase is over.

These  are  men who have now taken their lives  into

their own hands. They have decided for the right  or

wrong  reasons to take this decision. If they cannot

get  the men who are prepared to organise the masses

on  their side, then how are they going to  get  the

masses  on  their  side? In every  union,  in  every

society, in every political Party, in every  office,

it  is only a small group of people who are prepared

to  undertake responsibilities, to fight and to work

for  their beliefs and ideals. They must find  these

men.   Give  them  those  beliefs,  beliefs  of   an

egalitarian democratic society. Then these men  will

fight with them and organise the masses. But if they

find only lounge-lizards, bar-lizards, and directors

of  companies  supporting  them,  who  is  going  to

organise   the  masses  on  their  behalf?   I   can

understand  a  Right-wing group  like  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party,  the  Democrats-cum-Progressives.

They are not interested in organising the masses and

raising  the standard of living. They are interested

in  more industry, more profits which they say  will

benefit  the  workers because they  will  give  more

employment. But here is a Party that believes in  an

egalitarian society. But it is taking all the  steps

which make it unlikely for an egalitarian society to

come about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning I touched lightly

on one point and perhaps Mr Sutherland may be right

on  this,  that the developments in Malaya are  such

that we will soon reach a point where you are either

Communist  or anti-Communist and that there  is  no

room  for  anybody who says, "Let us  have  peaceful

competition."  Without any pretext,  the  Government

has  dissolved organisations which are not  involved

in  any  trouble  and has locked up individuals  who

have  not  done  anything violent. This  Government

will find that there will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



be, as there was in China and in IndoChina, a flight

of   the   intellectuals   away   from   them.   And

intellectuals do matter. They may have only one vote

and  may  not matter from the point of view of  that

one  vote.  But from the point of view of organising

the  masses  and  influencing them, their  desertion

will  make  the result catastrophic. In the  end  at

best they will establish a society like South Korea.

They  have  some form of democracy. They  have  some

kind of Parliament. They even allow opposition.  But

when  the  Vice-President gets difficult  and  looks

like   giving  the  President  trouble,  the   Vice-President is shot by an unknown assassin.  They  may

establish that kind of democracy. But how  long  can

it  last, unless it is sustained by the strength  of

our own people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this Government to remember this. We may

lose  this debate because of the peculiar set-up  in

this  Assembly.  But we will never  lose  our  self-respect   by   either   wittingly   or   unwittingly

collaborating  with  those whose  interests  are  so

opposed  to  ours  that any genuine  cooperation  is

impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to support wholeheartedly the  amended

motion moved by the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party is giving its full support to the

amended  motion of the Hon. the Chief  Minister.  As

true believers of democracy, we do believe that  the

action taken by the Government in arresting the  six

persons under the Banishment Ordinance and one under

the  Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance  was

fully  scrutinised by the Council of Ministers  with

honesty,  sincerity and justice. This  morning,  the

Hon.the Chief Minister assured this House that they

had considered the matter with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



greatest  care before the arrests were  made.  I  do

believe,  Sir,  the assurance, and my  Party  and  I

fully support the Hon.the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

arising  from this long debate, there is  one  vital

question  which we must all ask ourselves  and  that

question  is:  "Is there any country  in  the  world

which  does not reserve to itself the power  to  get

rid of aliens whose actions are not conducive to the

welfare of the country?" If there is such a country,

I  shall be very sorry for the people living in that

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance  under  which certain  persons  have  been

detained,  this Ordinance was copied from a  similar

law existing in India. Asia today looks to India for

guidance.  The name of Mr Nehru has been mentioned;

we respect him; we like to take his lead and we have

taken  his  lead when we introduced the Preservation

of Public Security Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask every one to consider very

carefully, not only Members of this Assembly but all

people in Singapore who are capable of thinking  for

themselves,  the  question  whether  there  is   any

country  in  this  world that does  not  reserve  to

itself  the  right  to get rid  of  aliens  who  are

dangerous to the welfare of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."
