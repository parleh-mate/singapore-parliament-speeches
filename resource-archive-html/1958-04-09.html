Speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 4</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNOR'S SPEECH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His  Excellency the Governor (Sir William  Goode,

K.C.M.G.):</b>  Honourable Members, since  the  Second

Session  of  this First Legislative Assembly,  the

Government, in conformity with its declared  stand

for the early attainment of complete internal self-government, has with the co-operation of political

parties  represented  in this  House  achieved  an

agreement   last  year  in  London   for   a   new

Constitution.  The  Government of  Singapore  will

take over the complete internal self-government of

this  island. The Federation of Malaya will  share

responsibility in the field of internal  security.

The  United  Kingdom Government will  continue  to

discharge  her responsibilities in  the  field  of

external   relations   and   defence.   The    new

Constitution  will  give to  the  people  of  this

island  the opportunity they have sought  and  the

right  they  have  demanded to  manage  their  own

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore exists because of its trade. Under the

new  Constitution the Government of the  State  of

Singapore,  acting with the assent of  the  United

Kingdom   Government,  will  have  the  power   to

initiate and conduct matters concerning trade  and

cultural relations with other countries. There  is

provision  in  this field to extend the  scope  of

delegated  authority.  It  is  unlikely   that   a

responsible  Government interested in the  welfare

of  the  people and the prosperity of this  island

will find this agreement restrictive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, since the Second Session of this Assembly,

the   Federation  of  Malaya  has  emerged  as   a

sovereign  independent state.  The  Government  is

happy to record the continued cordial relationship

which  it  enjoys  with  the  Government  of   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes the stand that union with

the Federation is inevitable,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



and  will  direct its energies towards creating  a

climate and conditions conducive to such a union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to recommend to the

Assembly  the holding of elections for an enlarged

Assembly under the new Constitution as soon as  it

is  practically possible to do so.  The  timetable

will  depend  on the preparation and enactment  of

the   necessary  constitutional  instruments   and

legislation  as  well as any measures  which  this

Assembly  may decide to adopt in order to  improve

the  electoral  procedure. The Government  intends

that   the  agreement  with  the  United   Kingdom

Government  on  the  form  of  the  constitutional

instruments  should  be  made  by  the   All-Party

delegation  which took part in the  Constitutional

discussion last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes to hold elections for

District  Councils in the middle of this  year  at

which  some  233,000 persons will be  eligible  to

vote on a residential franchise. Besides the three

District Councils there will be a Southern Islands

Local Council for the Southern Islands composed of

an  official Chairman, three nominated members and

nine   ketua  elected  by  ballot.  The  necessary

legislation   will  be  introduced   during   this

Session. These elected Councils will take over the

functions of the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of holding civics courses for

representative groups of people from all parts  of

Singapore has proved very successful and  will  be

continued   in   order   to   promote   a   better

understanding  among  the  citizens  of  what  the

Government is doing for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue with its determined

efforts  to  combat  crime,  gangster  and  secret

society activities. Legislation will be introduced

to  increase the penalties for kidnapping  and  to

facilitate  the  work of the Police  in  combating

this menace. The increased awareness by the public

for  the  need to give all possible assistance  to

the  police  is encouraging. The Government  hopes

that this will be continued in greater measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue its vigilance in

countering Communist infiltration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



and  subversion and will not hesitate  to

take  whatever steps are required to counter  this

threat  to  the livelihood and well-being  of  the

citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain the established high

standards  of efficiency and morale of the  Police

and of the 1st Battalion of the Singapore Regiment

which is now over 400 strong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya has

decided  that its broadcasting service  should  be

run   separately  from  that  of  Singapore.   The

Government will ensure that the needs of Singapore

in   this  field  are  adequately  met  after  the

separation takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the need to offer

incentive  to capital investment in the industrial

field in the initial stages and with this in  view

is  now  preparing "pioneer industry" legislation.

Government  Departments have been  instructed  and

subsidised  Boards  have been  requested  to  give

preference to locally manufactured articles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expert from Canada under the Colombo Plan is

already  in  Malaya and will shortly carry  out  a

survey  of  the Colony's industrial potential  and

markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of an Institute of Scientific

and   Industrial  Research  in  concert  with  the

Federation of Malaya is now under discussion  with

the Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to reorganise

and  strengthen  the  industrial  section  of  the

Ministry   of  Commerce  and  Industry   and   the

possibility  of  the present Industrial  Promotion

Board actively assisting in the promotion of large

scale industries is being studied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to do everything in

its power to encourage entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion of tourism has gained considerable

impetus  during the last few months and steps  are

being  taken towards the establishment of a strong

Singapore Tourist Association.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drive to produce more home grown food will

receive further impetus when the Sembawang Station

starts  operating and the results of research  now

being carried out are made available to farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rural Development Panel to plan and execute a

comprehensive  rural development scheme  is  being

set up under the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to take all

necessary steps to increase the supply of fish and

to  assist local fishermen who are willing  to  be

trained in new methods of fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is giving considerable thought and

study to the Report of the Port Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is seeking the agreement of

neighbouring governments to a proposal to  enlarge

the area of command for local trade masters and to

the   introduction  of  a  restricted  home  trade

engineer's certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means of increasing revenue in order to meet the

mounting  cost  of  essential  social  and   other

services are being explored and all possible steps

are  being  taken  to  reduce expenditure  to  the

minimum consistent with the efficient operation of

the machinery of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps will be taken to co-ordinate the

development  plans  of  the Government,  the  City

Council and other statutory bodies in the light of

the  funds  likely  to  be available  for  capital

development in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the introduction of legislation

for  the  licensing,  control and  supervision  of

banks  is being examined in consultation with  the

Government   of  the  Federation  of  Malaya   and

discussions  on  the question of  central  banking

will continue with that Government. The Government

pledges  itself not to make any arrangement  which

might undermine confidence in the currency in  use

in Singapore or jeopardise its stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue its policy of

seeking  to  give every child the chance  to  have

primary education up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



the  age  of  14. Twenty Primary schools  are  now

being  built  and  plans are in hand  for  fifteen

more.  In  accordance  with  the  policy  of   the

Government,  these schools will be  allocated  for

Malay,   Chinese  and  English  language  teaching

according  to  the parents' choice  and  available

staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the densely populated city area, a multi-storey building at Silat Road will house three

schools  at  each session - a total  of  over  4,000

people for a single building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six new secondary schools are being built, and

two  others  will  be provided  by  conversion  of

existing  buildings.  A further  six  are  at  the

planning stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since neither funds nor staff are available for

universal secondary education, a system of evening

classes  has been introduced and will be expanded.

By this means up to 5,000 students will be able to

continue their education in Chinese or English, to

take   Government   Senior  Middle   III,   School

Certificate,  Royal Society of Arts or  commercial

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide teachers for this large programme, a

new  Teachers'  Training  College  is  planned  in

addition   to   the  one  recently  completed   at

Patterson  Road. It will provide both  Certificate

and  Normal courses in Chinese, Malay and English.

Proposals  for a Commission of Scholars to  advise

on  recognition of Nanyang University degrees  are

going   forward.  The  University  of  Malaya   is

introducing part-time training for their  teaching

diplomas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also provided improved and

expanded  means of apprenticeship training  giving

both  practical and classroom instruction  in  the

technical  skills Singapore needs, and  linked  in

appropriate cases with the new Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for the leisure of Singapore's

youthful  population, a large expansion  in  youth

clubs  and  youth  organisation is  in  hand,  and

training courses are being given in Chinese, Malay

and English. Special services, including a Borstal

and a Junior Approved School, will be provided  to

save  from  criminal life young men who have  been

led into juvenile delinquency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the Government's policy of

expanding the medical services 1,500 free hospital

beds  have  been added during the past two  years.

Buildings  for  providing 800 more  beds  are  now

under construction and it is hoped that they  will

be  completed  before  the end  of  the  year.  In

addition, the Institute of Health - a joint  project

shared by the Government, the City Council and the

University - is  due to be opened this  month.  This

will  provide training facilities for medical  and

para-medical personnel besides Maternity and Child

Welfare  and School Medical Services. The hospital

for the chronic sick is nearing completion and the

Government anticipates that its 400 beds  will  be

ready for use early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has planned to build ten Outpatient clinics, construction on the first three

of which will commence this year. The Tuberculosis

case-finding programme with the Australian Colombo

Plan assistance is scheduled to start in July this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present 78 medical staff in training

overseas,  compared with 68 in  1955.  During  the

last  two years 53 medical personnel have returned

after  their  training in overseas  countries.  In 1958,  127 scholarships, fellowships and  training

courses  have  been  made  available  for  studies

overseas or in the University of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are under construction 4,971 housing units

and 127 shops, most of which will be completed  by

the end of this year. A further programme of 3,500

ordinary  dwellings, flats and shops will  shortly

come before this House for financial approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry out future building programmes, the

Singapore Improvement Trust will be converted into

a  Development and Housing Authority and  planning

duties will be dealt with separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special housing needs of the Malays are being

provided for by expanded Malay settlements at Ayer

Gemuroh, Jalan Eunos and West Coast Road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land Clearance and Resettlement though a

difficult task has enabled progress to be made  in

public  housing and development and will  continue

on a larger scale during 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has only 225 square miles of land.

Population  at present is 6,600 per  square  mile,

and  may  by  1967  be  10,000  per  square  mile.

Consequently, long-term planning is  necessary  to

make  sure that all land is used in the  best  way

and not wasted. The Master Plan provides the basis

for  necessary control of land use.  A  Notice  of

Approval  will  soon  be  gazetted,  and  amending

legislation to the Singapore Improvement Ordinance

will  be  presented to this Assembly  during  this

Session  to  provide  means  of  implementing  the

Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Caine and Brocklehurst

Reports  have  been examined, and  the  Government

proposes to introduce during 1958 social insurance

schemes  based on contributions by both  employers

and  workers.  Such  schemes  cannot  all  operate

immediately,  but  provided  these  policies   are

steadfastly followed, workers will in a few  years

be  protected from sickness, old age, unemployment

and similar handicaps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will continue day-to-day services of public assistance and will

continue to support those voluntary agencies which

supplement the work of Government in the field  of

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amending legislation relating to the Labour,

Legal  Aid  and  the  Shop  Assistants  Employment

Ordinances  will be introduced. Fresh  legislation

to   improve   the  safety,  health  and   welfare

conditions of workmen employed in factories and to

regulate  the establishment of employment agencies

are receiving the attention of Government and will

be introduced during this Session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government pledges itself anew to safeguard

the  welfare of the people of Singapore, to  raise

their level of living and to use this last Session

towards achieving these ends.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is confident that when General

Elections are held the people and the new citizens

of  this  island  will  express  in  definite  and

unmistakable  terms  their  desire  for  a  stable

Government  which  can  and  will  act  not   only

democratically  but also responsibly - a  Government

which  will  be ever mindful of the dependence  of

this  island's economy on the trade which it  must

promote and expand and the goodwill which it  must

cultivate  to ensure that this trade and  commerce

do  not  diminish or suffer in any way - an  economy

ever   sensitive  and  responsive   to   political

conditions created within and without. The  people

will  have an opportunity at the General Elections

to bring into being a Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



capable of interpreting their desire and need

for   stability,  security  and  prosperity.  This

Government  has  endeavoured during  its  life  to

fulfil this role. When it lays down its office, it

will  take  pride in the service it has given  and

the  stewardship it is prepared to render  to  the

citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Governor's Speech, Mr

Speaker,  preceded by the Serjeant  at  Arms,  the

Clerk,  the  Clerk Assistant and the Second  Clerk

Assistant,  escorted  His Excellency  out  of  the

Chamber,   and  the  Assembly  adjourned   without

question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
