<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour whether he is

aware that many applications for Singapore

citizenship from persons, who have more than 15

years' residence here, and who have families of their

own, have been rejected; and whether the Government

will reconsider such cases and assure the persons

concerned, where applicable, that they will not be

deprived of their jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the hon. Member is fully  aware  that

length  of  residence in Singapore is  not  the  only

criterion for the grant of citizenship. The  Minister

informed  this House in May last year that  a  person

who  has the necessary residential qualification will

not  automatically be granted Singapore  citizenship,

and  he  also  indicated the policy on the  grant  of

citizenship.  This is contained in  Hansard  of  21st

May, 1968, Volume 27, No. 7, Col. 345.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Singapore citizens can still work in Singapore

if  they are drawing a basic salary of less than $750

per  month. They will have to apply for work permits.

I  can  assure  the hon. Member that it  is  not  the

intention  of Government to deprive people  of  their

jobs if they are useful to our economy.

<div align="center"><b>CITIZENSHIP</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Bilateral arrangement with Malaysia)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs   and  Minister  for  Labour,  in  order   to

alleviate  the human hardships, sufferings and  frust

rations  of  persons affected on both  sides  of  the

Causeway  and  to  bring about  better  understanding

betwen the two countries, whether the Government will

consider  a bilateral arrangement with the  Malaysian

Government whereby a citizen of one country having  a

permanent  job and at least ten years'  residence  in

the  other  be granted citizenship of the country  in

which  he  now resides on a reciprocal basis  and  in

return  for a grant of citizenship to his counterpart

with  similar  qualifications in  the  other  country

subject to such persons being willing to take up  the

citizenship of the respective countries.

<br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>

<b>and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government does not intend to vary the policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



on  the grant of citizenship which was enunciated  by

the  Minister in this House on 21st May,  1968.  By

the end of 1971, when the British completely pull out

from  Singapore, a great number of our citizens  will

become unemployed. In addition, more and more of  our

young citizens will be coming into the labour market,

thus aggravating the unemployment situation. The hon.

Member   will   agree  with  me  that   our   primary

responsibility is to our citizens. The Government can

only  consider  relaxing its present  policy  on  the

grant of citizenship when the economic effect of  the

British run-down has been resolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

when does the Parliamentary Secretary expect some  im

provement in our economy in order to vary the  policy

on the grant of citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is always our

hope that the sooner that happens, the better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Labour  has  not  fully answered my  question.  I  am

asking  about  a  reciprocal  arrangement  with   the

country  across  the  Causeway and  whether  such  an

arrangement can be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy on the

grant  of citizenship has already been enunciated  by

the  Minister in this House on several occasions, and

I  do  not  think  we need elaborate further  on  the

subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

appears that the Parliamentary Secretary is stressing

on   the  point  that  granting  citizenship  to  the

applicants might deprive Singapore citizens of  jobs.

What happens if the applicant does not seek a job  or

depend  on  one  in  Singapore? Will  the  Government

consider his application if he has the qualifications

to apply for citizenship?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, this is only a hypothetical

case and I think we can only consider each individual

case on its own merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Let us assume that I can bring

forward  a  person  with  sufficient  proof  to   the

Government.  Will  the Parliamentary  Secretary  then

give  an  assurance that this man's  application  for

citizenship will be sympathetically considered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I cannot give a categorical

answer to a hypothetical question. If the hon. Member

can  set out the particular case in writing, we shall

certainly give him a satisfactory answer.

<div align="center"><b>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORDINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Increase in benefit)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Soo Peng</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  and Minister for Labour whether he will  consider  introducing amending legislation for an upward

revision  of  the scales of benefit in the  Workmen's

Compensation Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

workmen's compensation is regarded more as substitute

income and represents partial indemnity for the  loss

of  earnings suffered by a workman as a result of  an

industrial  accident. The quantum of compensation  is

based  on  the  earnings of a workman, including  any

privilege  or  benefit  which  can  be  estimated  in

monetary terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For computation of the amount of compensation

payable, the monthly average earning for all  classes

of  adult  workers is estimated to be $200.  In  1955

when   the   Workmen's  Compensation  Ordinance   was

enacted,  such average monthly earning was  estimated

to be about $147.20 cents (based on a sample survey),

while  in  1968 it was about $180.60 cents. Therefore

the average



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



monthly earning of $200 is still equitable since  the

average  monthly  earning for workers  still  remains

below $200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for temporary disablement cases which constitute

about  90  per cent of the industrial accident  cases

reported to the Ministry, the injured workman is paid

two-thirds of his monthly earnings or $130, whichever

is  the  less.  In  some cases  employers  pay  their

injured employees full wages throughout the period of

temporary disablement, though they are not obliged to

do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we do not intend to introduce amending

legislation for an upward revision of the  scales  of

benefit. However, my Ministry will keep a close watch

on  the  situation and consider introducing  amending

legislation when the need arises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> According to the 1967 Report of the Ministry of Labour, there is an

increasing  tendency for claims to be  brought  under

common  law and not under the Ordinance. In  view  of

this,   will  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  consider

making it compulsory for all out-of-court settlements

under  common law to be approved by the Commissioner,

because some of the injured workmen are very often exploited by unscrupulous middle-men?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the need

arises  we shall surely look more carefully into  the

subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Parliamentary Secretary has admitted  that

the average income calculated since 1953 has gone  up

by  some $40 when a late review was made in 1968.  On

this   admission   itself,  does  the   Parliamentary

Secretary not feel that it is time for a revision  of

the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated

that  the injured workman is paid two-thirds  of  his

monthly earnings or $130, whichever is the less, and

I  think  that is roughly the correct figure for  the

moment.

<div align="center"><b>IDENTITY CARDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Non-acceptance of certified extract from Adopted Children Register)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

for  Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour  whether

he  is aware that a certified copy of an entry in the

Adopted Children Register issued by the Registrar  of

Births  and  Deaths  under the Adoption  of  Children

Ordinance containing a record, approved by the court,

specifying Singapore as the country of birth  of  the

adopted person is not accepted by the National  Registration  Office in support of an application for  the

red (Singapore Citizen) identity card; and if he will

clarify the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

hon.  Member seeks clarification. I must  explain  in

some  detail  the circumstances under  which  citizen

identity  cards  are, or  are  not,  issued  on  the

strength  of  a  certified extract from  the  Adopted

Children Register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an applicant produces an extract from the

Adopted Children Register issued by the Registrar  of

Births  and  Deaths, Singapore, as  directed  by  the

District  Judge in the Adoption Order, with place  of

birth shown thereon as Singapore, he is requested  to

produce a copy of the Adoption Order. Whether or  not

an   Adoption  Order  is  proof  of  one's  birth  in

Singapore  will depend on the terms of the order  and

evidence before the court making the order. If  proof

of place of birth is furnished to the satisfaction of

the court, it will be stated in the order itself.  In

such  cases, a citizen (pink) laminated identity card

will be issued. If however a birth certificate cannot

be  produced  and all that is relied  upon  to  prove

place of birth is a statutory declaration, then  this

evidence would not be conclusive evidence of place of

birth,  but  only prima facie evidence in support  of

it. In such cases, a non-citizen (blue) identity card

will be issued.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also pertinent to point out to the hon. Member

that  an Adoption Order does not go into the question

of nationality.

ascertain  from  the  Central  Provident  Fund  Board

whether the post of General Manager of the Board will

be permanently filled when the contract of employment

of the present incumbent expires on 30th April, 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

April, 1971. A decision will be made by the Board  at

about that time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I do not think it is proper to

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, are not preparations being made to see

that there is more than

one person standing by to fill that position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> There may well be many people

inside  and  outside the Board who are  qualified  to

fill  that post at the moment, but the question  does

not  arise  whether the present incumbent  should  be

replaced when the time comes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Will it not be good

from  the  Central Provident Fund Board  whether  the

contributions not on a yearly but on a monthly  basis

as practised by the Post Office Savings Bank.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Central Provident Fund Board could  set  up  the

machinery  to  calculate  the  interest  on   Central

Provident  Fund accounts on a monthly or  even  daily

basis   if  the  Ordinance  required  it,   but   the

administration  of  the  Fund  would  be  much   more

complicated  and expensive than it is at  present.  A

change  of the method in calculation would  not  make

more  interest  available  for  distribution  to  the

members  of the Fund and it is the Board's view  that

the present system is both simple and equitable.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL BUS SERVICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  what steps have been taken towards improving the

schools transport service; and (b) whether there  has

been  any response from schools to his suggestion  on

17th  December,  1968, that schools  run  school  bus

services of their own.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, various measures have

been  taken  to  improve  the transport  service  for

school   children.   A   committee,   consisting   of

representatives  from  the  Registrar   of   Vehicles

Department, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of  Education,  the  Traffic  Police,   the

Chinese  Bus  Owners'  Association  as  well  as  the

Singapore Traction Company, has been formed  to  work

for  the  improvement  of  bus  services  for  school

children. The Government has encouraged bus companies

to  operate school bus services through the offer  of

relatively  low licence fees and taxes.  Up  to  20th

March,  1969, the Changi, Hock Lee, Katong-Bedok  and

Green  Bus  Companies operated a total  of  11  buses

picking  up only school children at designated  stops

along  their usual bus routes. In addition, a  scheme

has  been  worked out to provide special bus services

for pupils who are residing in certain constituencies

but  who  are  studying outside their constituencies.

From 17th March this year, the Green Bus Company  has

been running special school buses to transport pupils

who  live  in the Bukit Panjang Constituency  to  and

from  Toh  Tuck Primary School. From I st April,  the

Hock  Lee  and  Tay  Koh Yat Bus Companies  will  run

similar  school  bus  services  for  pupils  who  are

residents  of  the  Bukit Ho Swee,  Alexandra,  Tiong

Bahru  and Queens-town Constituencies to enable  them

to  travel to Dunearn Secondary School, Dunearn  Hill

Secondary Technical School, Toh Tuck Secondary School

and Chestnut Drive Secondary School and back to their

constituencies after school hours. At the same  time,

schools  have  now been offered tax  concessions  for

school  buses they propose to operate. As  from  20th

March,  1969, 13 Government-aided schools  have  been

operating  their own school buses. A scheme  for  the

operation  of school buses by Government schools  was

introduced in February this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me mention the scheme for the registration of

vehicles  carrying  children to and  from  school  as

school  taxis on payment of reduced licence fees  and

taxes. This is to enable the Government to exercise a

measure  of control on the service provided  by  such

taxis.  A total of 1,056 school taxis were registered

up to 20th March, 1969.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of the question, Sir, under

the  scheme  for  the operation of  Schoo1  buses  by

Government  schools, each school will enter  into  an

agreement  with an individual bus owner  to  run  bus

services  for  its  own  pupils.  The  bus  will   be

registered  in  the  name  of  the  schoal  but   its

operation  and maintenance will be the responsibility

of  the bus owner. The school will make no profit out

of  the scheme and the bus owner will be expected  to

charge  a  reasonable monthly fee per pupil depending

on  distance  between  school and  home.  A  standard

agreement on which individual agreements can be based

has  been  drawn  up.  By  20th  March,  1969,  eight

individual  bus  owners  have expressed  interest  in

providing such a service.

Education  (a)  whether he is aware that  in  certain

Government  primary schools some  classes  are  still

without  teachers; (h) why there  is  a  shortage  of

teachers:  and  (c)  when  those  vacancies  will  be

filled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as far as I am aware, all  classes

in  Government primary schools are filled  either  be

regular teachers or relief teachers who arc paid on a

day-to-day  basis.  Teachers are  posted  to  primary

schools  in  accordance  with the  approved  staffing

quota.  As  second language teachers are included  in

the  quota, some schools have to make use of them  as

form  teachers. Whilst classes may be  without  first

language  teachers  as  form  teachers,  nevertheless

lessons are carried out according to the class  time-tables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second and third parts of the question,

there  is  now  a  shortage of  regular  teachers  as

vacancies  arising out of terminations, resignations,

dismissals, retirements, and increase of classes  can

only be filled in May/June 1969 when students of  the

full-time course at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



Teachers'  Training  College will  be  available  for

employment. In the meantime, all vacancies are filled

by relief teachers.

<div align="center"><b>DAILY-RATED RELIEF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what  was the number  of  daily-rated

relief teachers employed by his Ministry during 1968;

(h) what was the average period of employment of such

teachers during 1968; (c) what is the number of daily-rated teachers employed from 1st January, 1969, up to

the  latest convenient date and their average  period

of  employment; and (d) why is it necessary to employ

the  large  number of daily-rated teachers  for  long

periods.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b>

Mr Speaker. Sir, (a)  The  number  of  daily-rated  relief  teachers

employed by my Ministry during 1968 is 2,302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The period of employment of these teachers

varies.  In the case of relief teachers appointed  to

replace  permanent teachers called  up  for  National

Service,   the   period   of   employment   will   be

approximately  two years: replacements for  permanent

teachers  on maternity leave will be employed  for  a

period  of 42 days: as for replacements for permanent

teachers  who are on long medical leave  (other  than

maternity  leave),  the  period  of  employment  will

depend  on how soon the permanent teachers can resume

duty   after  niedical  leave:  as  for  replacements

filling  pure  vacancies, the  period  of  employment

depends  on  how  soon the vacancies  can  be  filled

substantively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The number of daily-rated relief teachers

employed  by  my Ministry from 1-1-69 to  18-3-69  is

1,000. Of this number, 268 have since resigned,  thus

leaving only 732 still in the service. The answer  to

what  is  the average period of employment is similar

to (b) above.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The employment of daily-rated relief teachers is

necessary on account of the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To relieve permanent teachers who have been

drafted into full-time National Service  for

a period amounting to two years or more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To relieve permanent teachers who are on

long medical leave or maternity leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To fill vacancies pending recruitment.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in 1968, 2,302 teachers

were recruited. May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary

by what criteria these teachers were recruited?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the criteria

for recruiting the relief teachers depend on the type

of  teachers  required, if a teacher is  required  to

teach  a certain subject, a relief teacher with  that

special qualification will be recruited.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Was there a selection board

constituted to select these 2,302 teachers? Did  they

have any specific qualifications as teachers? Or will

the  principals' reports on the teachers' work in the

classroom,  at  the  end  of  a  certain  period   of

teaching, be taken into consideration in renewing the

contracts of the daily-rated teachers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

appointment  of relief teachers does  not  require  a

selection  board. The work of the relief teachers  is

under  constant  review by the  principals  who  make

reports  on their performances. There is no  question

of  a renewal of contract, because no question of the

offer of a contract arises.

<div align="center"><b>ADULT EDUCATION BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Textbooks for special classes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether he is aware that there are still no

textbooks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



prescribed  for  the  special classes  of  the  Adult

Education  Board  this year, and if  he  proposes  to

prescribe them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I have to

point out that my Minister is fully aware of what  is

going  on  in the Adult Education Board. I must  also

point  out  that plans for the special  classes  were

made  towards  the end of last year. Within  a  short

period of 2½ months, after the decision to run  these

special  classes was made, the Adult Education  Board

has  successfully  launched these classes  for  5,000

students,  which  is a very outstanding  achievement.

Since  these special classes would cater for students

who  were unsuccessful more than once in the  Primary

School  Leaving Examination, it was agreed  that  the

programme  should lay emphasis on craft training  and

the  acquisition of technical skills. While there was

provision  for academic subjects, e.g., the  Language

of  instruction, Science, Mathematics and Civics, the

content  of  these  subjects  would  relate  to   the

practical  and  real-life  situation  and   not   the

abstract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syllabuses were drawn up for each subject to

indicate  the  items to be taught, the skills  to  be

developed  and the attitudes to be inculcated.  Since

the  programme was being launched for the first time,

it  was felt that the syllabuses should be considered

experimental,  to  be modified and  adjusted  in  the

light  of  actual experience gained in  the  teaching

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syllabuses drawn up covered (i) Language, (ii)

Mathematics   and   Science,   (iii)   Civics,   (iv)

Dressmaking and Tailoring, (v) Homecraft and Cookery,

(vi) Metalwork and (vii) Woodwork.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 13th January, 1969, before the classes

commenced  operations, supervisors, senior assistants

and  teachers of the special classes were briefed  on

the  objectives  of the programme and the  syllabuses

introduced to them. They were told to keep  watch  on

the  applicability of the topics chosen and  to  note

particularly   any   possible  shortcoming   in   the

syllabuses. All syllabuses are to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



be reviewed and, if necessary, revised for the second

term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the syllabuses were being tested, it was

thought   unwise  to  prescribe  textbooks  for   the

students.  However,  teachers were  required  to  use

certain  textbooks for their own use in the classroom

situation  in  order  to provide  a  control  of  the

testing  period. For certain subjects, teachers  drew

from  several  textbooks to find  the  most  suitable

material.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 29th March, every syllabus had undergone the

planned  testing and evaluation process under  actual

operational    conditions    and    was    redesigned

accordingly.  At the present moment,  the  syllabuses

are  being studied for detail and accuracy. With  the

issue  of the revised syllabuses in the second  term.

all  the  students attending these  classes  will  be

required   to   buy  certain  textbooks   which   are

considered to meet the requirements of the programme.

The  period of being without textbooks is thus coming

to an end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Sembawang should be assured

that  there  are  certain merits in  not  prescribing

textbooks, because teaching in such a situation would

become pupil-orientated and not textbook-orientated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary

Secretary referred to the outstanding achievements of

the  Adult  Education Board. However, the  fact  that

there were no textbooks after the classes were opened

was  a  shortcoming  and not an achievement.  Another

point is that the lack of textbooks would lead  to  a

great deal of inconvenience both to the teachers  and

the pupils. I am not quite satisfied with his reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, can we have your

supplementary question, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Parliamentary Secretary has not said when  the  books

will be ready for the pupils.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a supplementary question,

<div align="center"><b>PIRATE TAXI-DRIVERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Legalisation of status)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether he will take steps to legalise

the  status of pirate taxi-drivers if he thinks  that

those  drivers  are  performing  a  necessary  social

function.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

The  question raised by the Member for Bukit  Panjang

is  not a new one. On the 14th May, 1968, during  the

debate on the President's Speech, I mentioned that  I

was  fully aware of the pirate taxi problem  and  the

economic effects on the bus and taxi operators if the

pirate  taxis were to be legalised. I had  then  also

stated that to legalise pirate taxis is equivalent to

suggesting  the legalisation of smuggling activities.

I have not changed my view since.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that pirate taxis, though running illegally,

are performing a form of social function in providing

an  element of public transport service. But they are

performing this function at the expense of  the  law-abiding  licensed taxis and the bus  companies.  They

are able to operate at a much lower cost because they

pay   less   tax,   incur  very  little   maintenance

expenditure and pay no insurance cover for  passenger

liability.  Thus,  they offer an  unhealthy  type  of

competition  to  the  licensed  operators  which   is

harmful  to  our long-term planning for  an  improved

public transport service in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August last year, I established a Transport

Advisory  Board with the objective of  improving  the

present  inadequacy of public transport services  and

am   glad  to  say  that  modest  progress  has  been

achieved. To date, there has been an increase  of  80

new  buses  operating on the road and more new  buses

are  expected in the near future. As the adequacy and

efficiency of the public transport services  improve,

there  should be a consequent decrease in the  number

of pirate taxis running on the road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as it is virtually impossible to get licensed taxis

during peak traffic hours in Singapore, does the

Minister not think that an easy way of solving this

problem would be to allow more licensed taxis to ply

on the roads?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I can assure the Member for

Bukit  Panjang  that  this matter  is  under  serious

consideration by the Transport Advisory Board, I  do

not  think there is any easy way out. We hope to find

a  reasonable solution. May I, therefore, ask him  to

be  patient enough to wait for the recommendations to

be considered by me at a later stage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

can  the Minister for Communications say how many  of

the  80  new  buses belong to the Singapore  Traction

Company?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a supplementary

<div align="center"><b>BRIDGES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of legislation for compulsory use)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Inche

Abdul Aziz Karim -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To ask the Minister for Communications if he

will  consider  introducing legislation  to  make  it

compulsory   for  pedestrians,  who  are   within   a

reasonable  distance on either side of  a  pedestrian

overhead bridge, to use the overhead bridge to  cross

the road.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Abdul Aziz Karim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Question No. 13.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

consider  it  desirable to introduce  legislation  to

compel  pedestrians  to  use overhead  bridges  where

these are available.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunately true that, although Government

has  spent  quite a large sum of money  -  almost  $½

million  as  explained by my colleague, the  Minister

for  Law  and  National  Development,  yesterday   in

erecting  a number of such overhead bridges  for  the

safety  of  pedestrians  to cross  busy  roads,  many

through sheer laziness still choose to tempt the gods

and  risk life and limb by running across busy  roads

instead of using overhead bridges. To discourage such

ill-advised  actions,  our  Public  Works  Department

have, wherever possible, erected railings along  road

dividers, so that pedestrians are thus forced to  use

overhead bridges. I think this is as far as we can go

in  the matter, as to legislate in a matter like this

would be somewhat repressive.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC TRANSPORT SERVICE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Measures to improve)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  if he will inform the  House  of  the

measures  taken  and  to  be  taken  to  improve  the

adequacy  and  efficiency  of  the  public  transport

service and to reduce vehicular traffic congestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure

the Member for Thomson that Government is giving deep

thought  and consideration as to how best to  improve

and   resolve   the  public  transport   service   of

Singapore,  including  the problem  of  reduction  of

traffic  congestion.  This is being  tackled  at  two

levels, long term and short term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the long-term solution, a United Nations

team  of experts is already working closely with  the

State and City Planning Department in our Ministry of

Law  and National Development, on the possibility  of

constructing  a mass rapid transit system  for  Singa

pore  by  the  early  1970s, the cost  of  which,  if

approved,  would involve an expenditure of  not  less

than nine figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for short-term measures:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Our Public Works Department has over the last

few years, particularly during 1968, carried out a

large number of road projects, e.g.,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) construction of new roads,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) widening and improvement of existing roads

and road junctions,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) building of 21 overhead pedestrian bridges

and another 10 for this year,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) introduction of one-way traffic systems,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) and four fly-overs, now under construction,

should be completed within this year, namely :-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whitley/Thomson/ Jalan Toa Payoh,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Southern access to Toa Payoh new Town,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Northern access to Toa Payoh new Town,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Fort Canning/Oxley Rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Transport Advisory Board, which was set up

in  August 1968, submitted an interim Report to me at

the end of January this year, with recommendations on

the following subjects, namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) queueing at bus stops,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) printing of schedules showing bus routes,

service intervals, etc.,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) compulsory wearing of crash helmets,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) special taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now studying these recommendations and will

make a suitable announcement as soon as I am able  to

decide  how  much and how far the recommendations  of

the Transport Advisory Board can be accepted and when

they can be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Our Registrar of Vehicles has recently

instructed bus companies to replace old and  obsolete

buses, as well as to purchase additional new buses to

augment  their  present  fleets.  As  a  result,  bus

companies have placed orders for about 300 buses with

local assemblers. With the recent lifting of the curb

on  import licensing and quota restrictions on  buses

by our Ministry of Finance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



we can look forward to an improved bus service in the

years ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

visited  Kuala  Lumpur from the 5th  to  the  7th  of

January for informal discussions with him on "matters

of   common   interest,  particularly  the   problems

surrounding Malaysia-Singapore Airlines".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can now be disclosed that amongst the matters

discussed  were two outstanding issues pertaining  to

the  terms and conditions of appointment of Mr David

Craig,  Senior  General Manager of  British  Overseas

Airways  Corporation, as Managing  Director  of  MSA.

which appointment was confirmed by the MSA Board with

effect from 1st April, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although clause 7 of the Agreement on MSA entered

into with the Malaysian Government on 14th May, 1966,

states  that "Both parties recognise that  MSA  shall

continue  to operate on the basis of sound commercial

principles".  I regret to say that the Singapore  Gov

ernment had to express "no confidence" in the  former

management  of MSA. This was made known  at  the  MSA

Board  meeting held on 27th August, 1968, as a result

of which the General Manager (Mr K. R. Hamilton) had

to  tender in his resignation, which became effective

on 10th October, 1968. Since then, three other senior

officials have also resigned:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the Secretary (Mr G. Fernandez), with effect

from 31st December, 1968:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Accounts Manager (Mr S. N. Houghton), with

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the Legal Officer (Mr Sathi V. Kandiah), to

take effect from 31st May, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reasonable confidence in stating that under

the  new  management,  MSA can be  made  commercially

viable in the near future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn:</b> Question No. 17.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st

January,  1969,  there  were 4,373  applications  for

telephones  on the waiting list, because of  shortage

of spare lines and exchange equipment. However, it is

expected  that  about 3,000 or 65  per  cent  of  the

applicants will be able to get service by the  middle

of   this  year.  Installations  for  the  remainder,

however,  will take much longer. In certain  isolated

areas, it would be uneconomical to meet their demand,

e.g., it  would  cost  half-a-million  dollars   to

provide telephones to 60 applicants who are living in

the  Choa  Chu Kang, Woodlands Road/Mandai Road  and

Sungei Kadut areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated that in recent years, the demand

for  telephones  has far exceeded  expectations.  For

1967,  although the planned expansion rate was  fixed

at  8  per cent, the actual rate achieved was 13  per

cent.  For 1968, although the planned expansion  rate

was  raised to 12 per cent, the actual rate  achieved

exceeded  14  per  cent.  The  Board  has, therefore

decided  on a four-year crash programme of  expansion

for  1969-72 to meet the ever-increasing demand  for

telephones.  It has already submitted an  application

for  a  second loan with the International  Bank  for

Reconstruction and Development.

to 20,000, within the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our training ship "Singapore" is only able to

produce  about 500 trained seamen each year, it  will

be  recalled  that  on 23rd December,  1968,  at  the

Second  Reading  of  the Bill to amend  the  Seamen's

Registry  Board, we introduced a crash programme  for

"on-the-job training on board ships", with Government

prepared to pay a subsidy to foreign ship-owners,  of

the  equivalent of $35 per month for every  Singapore

citizen  trainee  serving on board  their  ships.  To

date,  160  are already under the scheme and  another

190,  making a total of 350, are waiting to be signed

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other proposals under active

consideration  by  my Ministry for the  expansion  of

training  facilities for seamen, and  these  will  be

announced when ready.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  must  thank  the   Minister   for

Communications  for  giving me  a  very  satisfactory

reply.  We  know  that  there are  numerous  shipping

companies  which  are registered in Singapore.  These

shipping companies should be requested to get rid  of

the  foreign seamen they employ and replace them with

Singapore  seamen. By doing so, we will  be  able  to

solve our unemployment problem to a certain extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there are many other methods of

training   these  seamen.  For  example,  a   Chinese

businessman begins his career as an apprentice  doing

odd  jobs. So we should train our seamen on the  same

basis.  We  should  request  these  foreign  shipping

companies  to take on a few apprentices from  amongst

our  citizens to do odd jobs in the ship. There  need

not  be any formal training in the beginning, because

instructors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



have to be employed and this involves paying them

salaries. It is therefore a good idea for apprentices

to begin training in a shipping company first.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE PUBLISHED BOOKS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Printing in Hong Kong)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Culture whether he is aware that some books published

in  Singapore  are printed in Hong Kong,  a  practice

which  is  not  conducive to the development  of  the

printing industry in Singapore; and what steps he has

taken or proposes to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Ministry is aware  that  some

books published in Singapore are printed in Hong Kong

and,   for  that  matter,  in  Malaysia,  Japan   and

elsewhere.  Out of a total of 529 books published  in

Singapore  in 1968, 429 were printed in the Republic.

Of the 100 books printed outside the country, 87 were

printed in West Malaysia, 12 in Hong Kong and one  in

the Philippines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to those local publications printed in

West Malaysia, most of them are textbooks and are for

Malaysian  clientele. Many of these  publishers  have

offices in Singapore as well as in Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of those publications printed in Hong

Kong, the percentage is relatively low (about 2.3 per

cent  only), and the local printing industry may  not

therefore be badly affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although steps may be taken to introduce legislation

to   make  it  compulsory  for  books  published   in

Singapore  to be printed only in the Republic  and/or

put   up   tariffs  to  protect  the  local  printing

profession, it is not considered advisable  to  adopt

this   type   of  negative  measures.  Depending   on

legislation and tariffs alone is not the  right  kind

of  approach  to help solve the problems  facing  the

local  printing industry or the Republic as a  whole.

That  will not improve the situation. These  measures

may,  on  the  contrary, increase the burden  on  our

readers  and  particularly on  the  parents  who  buy

textbooks   and  other  reference  books  for   their

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the percentage of local publications

printed  in Singapore is comparatively high and  does

not  appear to warrant any protective measures in the

form  of  legislation, tariffs, etc, for our printing

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive measures should be, I think, to assist

the local printers to build an efficient industry  so

that  they can keep abreast with the modern  printing

world. Although Singapore compares favourably in book

printing  with  other Asian countries,  our  printers

still have to modernise so that they are capable  not

only   of  meeting  local  demands,  but  also   more

important, of breaking into the international market.

To this end, a Printing Industry Advisory Council was

formed  towards the end of 1967 to advise and  assist

in   formulating  development  programmes   for   the

printing industry in Singapore. Steps have also  been

taken to set up a school of printing in Singapore  to

help provide a constant and regular supply of trained

and skilled workers to the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the printers themselves can also play an

important role in solving some of the problems facing

their   profession.  There  are  about  220  printing

presses  in  Singapore. The vast  majority  of  these

firms are small, under-capitalised family businesses,

resulting in too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



many machines chasing too few jobs and giving rise to

cut-throat   competition  which  also   affects   the

business   of   bigger  printers.  If  the   printers

themselves will try a new approach by amalgamating on

a  mutually advantageous basis, perhaps they  may  be

able  to  achieve a breakthrough to great  potentials

and  will  be  in a better position to  compete  with

foreign printers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question [8th

April,  1969],  "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, before I resume, I would like to stress

that I oppose strongly the liberalisation of the  law

on  abortion  for  many reasons. But  yesterday,  the

press  and  radio gave the impression that I  support

this  Bill. So I must make my correction  now  and  I

hope  that you, Mr Speaker, will first allow  me  to

correct this impression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few minutes before the adjournment

yesterday,  I  was  talking  about  the   fact   that

Singapore's population explosion problem was attended

to  by  the former Minister for Health who tried  his

best to promote family planning and, as a result, the

birth rate has been decreasing year by year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics of the Kandang Kerbau

Maternity  Hospital,  we can  see  that  there  is  a

decrease  in  the birth rate. We can, therefore,  say

for  certain  that family planning has been  a  great

success, and we can boast about it to the world.  But

today  the Minister for Health is bringing up a  Bill

to  liberalise the law on abortion. This may prove  a

bit  too much in the circumstances. There is no doubt

that  the  Minister, before bringing  up  this  Bill,

carried out extensive investigations and incorporated

many  suggestions from various quarters in the  Bill.

The   Bill  provides  that  certain  conditions   and

requirements  must be fulfilled before  a  woman  can

apply  for  abortion.  This merely  demonstrates  the

democratic  spirit of the People's  Action  Party  in

seeking  public opinion and cannot be taken  to  mean

that there is merit in the liberalisation of the  law

on abortion. That is the true picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Minister, on the Second

Reading  of the Bill, gave various reasons to support

it.  But  I  am not able to accept them. I feel  that

many  of  the  reasons  advanced  need  more  careful

consideration. What is more important is that we must

be   very   careful  and  always  watchful  for   the

undesirable  consequences  and  reactions  that  will

follow if the Bill is passed. They are as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Psychological reaction. Married couples who

have  been  generally successful in  family  planning

will  no  longer worry about the unfavourable  circum

stances  of  having  a  baby in  view  of  the  ready

facilities  for  abortion. They will thus  resolutely

give  up  resorting  to the troublesome  practice  of

using  contraceptives, such as the taking  of  pills,

using  intra-uterine  devices,  condoms,  diaphragms,

jellies,  etc.,  in order to enjoy  the  pleasure  of

sexual intercourse. At the back of their minds is the

thought  that  if there is any conception,  safe  and

easy  abortion facilities will be available to  solve

their  problem. Women who have been quite  successful

in  family  planning if their financial circumstances

are bad and they cannot maintain their livelihood  if

they  are  to  have more children need  not  continue

their  way of life as before, because they can resort

to the practice of abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The degeneration of social morality. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in this metropolitan  city  of  ours,

there  are  undeniably  groups  of  wanton  pleasure-seeking   vagabonds,  male  and  female,  and   other

numerous innocent, passionate and energetic youths to

whom romance and petting are the social vogue. If the

law  on  abortion is liberalised, the flood-gates  of

sexual  promiscuity will be opened. Such people  will

indulge  in licentious behaviour and incest.  When  a

woman  becomes pregnant, she will take  advantage  of

the  provisions of the Bill and tell the  authorities

that  her  pregnancy has come about because of  rape.

When people ask, "You are not married. How is it that

you  are  pregnant?", she can reply that  it  is  the

result  of  rape. Instances of false  allegations  of

rape, which might arise as a result of the Bill, will

cause  the  degeneration of social morality  and  the

decadence  of  our social order. We  shudder  at  the

thought of such undesirable consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister mentioned the circumstances

of   those  who  have  been  taking  family  planning

guidance.  But  he forgot one point.  Those  who  are

receiving family planning guidance are married women.

Those who are not married are quite a different  lot.

Family



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



planning  is meant only for married couples  and  not

for teenagers. If an 18-or 19-year old unmarried girl

is   misled   by  this  Abortion  Bill  and   becomes

licentious  in her behaviour, I shudder to  think  of

the consequences in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On humanitarian grounds. Sir, I have no

intention to argue with the Minister as to whether  a

conceptus is a foetus or an embryo or a ball of flesh

and blood or what-not. But verily I would stress that

it is truly and unmistakably a body with life.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned that shortly after its formation, the foetus is still not a human being. It is considered something like a fertilised egg. A man may perhaps be compared to a fertilised egg in another form. But do we so nonchalantly destroy an egg - even a chicken egg?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister gave a lot of reasons yesterday in support of the Bill, but many of them are not acceptable. From an analysis of the Chinese character for yin, namely, conceptus or pregnancy, it is composed of two parts. There are two characters, "being" and "child". That is to say, the conceptus is

a child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days (even at the present time) there

were cases where people were so poor and hard pressed

that   they  had  to  sell  their  children  to  keep

themselves alive. One would never imagine that today,

in  an age of science and space technology, there can

be  people  who will legislate to enable  parents  to

kill their children in order to live. What a pity and

a  calamity. Where is the sense of humanity? For  the

three  reasons I have advanced, I oppose the  passage

of this Bill.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  in  recent years, the question of  liberalising

abortion  laws  i;  a  familiar  one  in  progressive

societies.  Many  other  nations,  both  within   and

without the non-Communist bloc, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



faced  the question. In a very broad sense, the  pros

and  cons for liberalisation of abortion have  become

classical  arguments,  having  been  developed   with

increasing sophistication with the passage  of  time.

The   significant   point  to  note   is   that   the

protagonists of liberal reforms have, as a whole, won

the day, as can be testified by the increasing number

of nations that have legalized abortion, with varying

degrees of liberalism, and by not one nation that has

liberalized abortion taking retrogressive steps  into

the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rough sense, the controversy on the

liberalization  of  abortion laws parallels  that  on

birth control. Regarding the latter, at least it  can

be  said  that  those who stood in  the  way  of  the

principle of voluntary parenthood are being consigned

relentlessly  into  the dustbin of history, although

the  lid  is  occasionally lifted. The rough  analogy

with   contraception   is  of  interest,   as   early

opposition  to  this  was  fierce,  often  expressing

itself in prediction of moral decay, the collapse  of

stable  society, and even the killing of life itself.

Today,  contraception is accented and respectable  in

many narts of the world, and it is a tribute to  the

healthy  pragmatism of the people of  Sinzapore  that

they have come to take contraception as a normal  way

of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot foresee such a future for abortion, and,

in  any  case,  it has been stressed  time  and  time

again,  and it has been ignored time and time  again,

that   the   purpose  of  the  Abortion  Bill   under

discussion   is  not  to  substitute   abortion   for

contraceptive  planned  parenthood.  Availability  of

contraceptives renders reliance on the unpleasant and

relatively  expensive device of an  abortion  unneces

sary,  and, therefore, unlikely. As the Minister  for

Health  succinctly  pointed out in the  parliamentary

session  yesterday,  the reason for  introducing  the

Abortion Bill is to deal with the problem of unwanted

pregnancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Punggol - I do not think he is

here  at  the moment. Oh yes, I am very  glad  he  is

back. He had asked whether there is any need for such

a  Bill. There has been no public clamour for it,  he

said, and I think,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



with  obvious passion and conviction. Yet,  it  is  a

matter of history that abortion has been practised as

long  as organised society has existed. It is also  a

universal  occurrence.  An  authoritative  survey  of

cross-cultural data revealed that -  and  here  I  am

quoting - "there is every indication that abortion is

an  absolutely universal phenomenon, and that  it  is

impossible  even  to  construct an  imaginary  social

system  in  which no woman would ever feel  at  least

impelled  to  abort." The quotation  is  from  George

Devereaux's   A  Study  of  Abortion   in   Primitive

Societies,  New York: Julian Press, 1954,  page  161.

The  main  reason for liberalizing abortion  laws  in

other  countries has been patent unenforceability  of

the  law  against  it. It may be  argued,  and  quite

relevantly,  that the experience of  other  countries

need  not be the reason for our having a more liberal

Abortion  Bill. But the central question  is:  do  we

have an abortion problem? The answer is definitely in

the affirmative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because induced abortion is illegal, a statutory

crime,  in  fact,  in Singapore, it is  difficult  to

gather adequate information on the subject; and,  for

that  matter,  anywhere in the  world  where  induced

abortion is a crime. There is only one study  on  the

subject, mentioned several times by the Minister  for

Health.  This is Dr Lee Yong Kiat's The Non-Clinical

Aspects  of  Induced Abortion in  Singapore.  He  has

estimated that Singapore has annually 5,000  criminal

abortions, a figure that clearly suggests we  have  a

problem   of   dealing  with  women   with   unwanted

pregnancies. Dr Lee Yong Kiat concluded in  page  48

that  "when  a woman is desperate enough to  want  an

induced  abortion,  she  will  ignore  whatever   her

religion  teaches.  Religion does  not  play  such  a

decisive  role  as economic and social  factors."  If

there  he  a  lack  of  clamour for  a  more  liberal

abortion  law in Singapore, it is simply  because  of

the intimidating effects of the existing law. Dr Lee

Yong  Kiat's observations are worth quoting  for  the

edification  of  those who equate the  absence  of  a

clamour for reform with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



the  lack of demand for it. He writes in page  79  of

his work:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When a patient dies as a result of a criminal

abortion,   the  Coroner  is  informed   and   police

investigations and a Coroner's inquiry take place. In

the majority of cases, the matter ends there with the

Coroner  passing  a  few caustic remarks  about  abor

tionists and the evils of criminal abortion,  because

women  are  willing  to  go to their  graves  without

divulging  the  names  of  the  abortionists  .  .  .

Patients co-operating with the doctors and police are

the  exception rather than the rule. The reasons  for

this are obvious:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The patients are grateful and loyal to this

particular person who has 'helped' them in their hour

of need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, they may need the services of the

abortionist again in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Fear of prosecution. Under the present law they

are  liable to prosecution, at least in theory.  They

are  told this by the abortionist, and are warned  to

keep silent for their own sakes.'



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can we expect a public clamour for a reformed Abortion Bill when women, whose misplaced confidence in the abortionists has been rewarded with death, are willing to risk the possible consequences of eternal punishment in the next world rather than inform against them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also made certain

observations which require refutation.  He  cited  an

authority  on  the dangers of abortion. The  Minister

for  Health, in a written answer to a question  about

the  fatality  rate of abortion cases,  had  made  it

patently clear that abortions carried out for medical

reasons  in  the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital  are  safe.

Indeed,  the experience in Singapore is supported  by

that of other countries. I quote from Loren G. Stern:

"Abortion:  Reform  and  the  Law"  [The  Journal  of

Criminal  Law,  Criminology and Police Science,  Vol.

59, No. 1, March, 1968, page 88].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Russian experience with legalized abortion

between  1922 and 1936 yielded statistics  indicating

the  mortality rate among pregnant Russian women  was

less  than  001 per cent. In Sweden, where there  are

about 5,000 legal abortions per year, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



fatality rate among pregnant women is about 0.04  per

cent.  This rate is lower than those mortality  rates

operative  in  both  the United States  and  England.

Studies  of Japan, which legalized abortion in  1948,

and  those  Eastern European countries which  provide

statistics  indicate that physical after  effects  of

abortion   are  rare  and  the  mortality   rate   is

'exceedingly low'. Based on these scientific studies,

it  is evident that abortion under optimum conditions

involves  little risk to the life or  health  of  the

woman.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol also made the point that it

is  unnecessary to employ abortion as another adjunct

to  family  planning on account  of  the  success  of

contraception. It is conceivable that in a  situation

where   the   use  of  contraception  is   completely

effective,  resort  to abortion is  unnecessary.  The

reality  is  that  we  are  nowhere  near  completely

effective use of contraception in all sectors of  our

society. It is among the poor sections that  we  have

not  eliminated all the situations in which  abortion

will  be  required. It is among them that the  demand

for  induced abortions seems to be greatest,  for  an

additional  child born into an already  large  family

means   automatically  a  reduction  of  an   already

pitifully  inadequate income. It means more  hardship

for  all in the family. It is the poor who resort  to

the  unskilled  operators because they cannot  afford

the  price demanded by the qualified doctors who make

a  living out of human misery. It is they who  suffer

the injuries of badly induced abortions and end up in

hospitals.  The  rich  have no  problems  of  finding

someone   to  perform  the  operation  under  aseptic

conditions, either within or without Singapore. As  a

socialist Government, we cannot permit a situation to

exist  where  the  opportunities for  abortion  under

aseptic  conditions  and proper  surgical  skill  are

unequal,  and definitely to the disadvantage  of  the

poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has rightly pointed out that

the  Abortion  Bill  will not eliminate  the  illegal

abortionist,  but not for the reason  given  by  him.

This  must be the price that society must pay  for  a

Bill that does not provide for abortion on demand. It

will be noted that there is a great deal of public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



misunderstanding that the Abortion Bill provides  for

abortion on demand, which it assuredly does  not.  If

it  were the intention to have abortion on demand, it

would  be  scarcely necessary for  the  Minister  for

Health   to  introduce  a  Bill  with  a  controlling

administrative mechanism. One cannot predict that the

present Bill will lead to a situation of abortion  on

demand in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attitudes change, and if public opinion changes in

favour of abortion on demand in the years ahead, then

it  is  the  responsibility of another Parliament  to

decide  what it should do to satisfy public  opinion.

In  any  case, it is also equally possible  that  the

Abortion  Bill may itself be obsolete in the  future.

Let  me  quote  pages 70 to 71 of a very  stimulating

book by Robert

E.     Cooke,  The  Terrible  Choice:  The   Abortion

Dilemma:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are now in various stages of development

several possible methods of preventing or aborting  a

pregnancy after intercourse through the use of pills.

It  is  believed already possible to do this  through

taking  a series of high-dosage hormone pills  for  a

few  days, within a few days after intercourse. There

may  well  be developed what is referred  to  as  the

"morning-after" pill, a pill which if taken within  a

few  hours  after intercourse prevents the fertilized

ovum  from  being implanted in the uterus. There  may

also  be  developed a pill which,  if  taken  on  the

twenty-eight day of each menstrual cycle, can  end  a

pregnancy begun during a cycle.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pills are considered likely to be of general

use  in  future,  and  when this  occurs,  the  law's

ability  to control will diminish as abortion returns

to the realm of private decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also condemned the socio-economic arguments for abortion. I fully appreciate

and  respect his concern for the foetus, but I cannot

but  note  a  singular lack of compassion  for  human

suffering,  and the social consequences  of  bringing

forth   unwanted  children,  mentally  retarded   and

physically defective children. Unfortunately, we have

no  major  studies  of  the  family  and  social  con

sequences of unwanted children in Singapore.  We  can

only  rely on the experience of other societies where

such studies have been made to provide a clue to what

are the likely consequences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



My  view  is that the consequences are likely  to  be

similar.  In  a  public lecture at the University  of

California,  at  Berkeley, Professor  Garrett  Hardin

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Is it good that a woman who does not want a child

should bear one? An abundant literature in psychology

and  sociology proves that the unwanted  child  is  a

social danger. Unwanted children are more likely than

others to grow up in psychologically unhealthy homes;

they   are   more  likely  than  others   to   become

delinquents, and as John Bowlby has pointed out, when

they become parents, they are more likely than others

to  be  poor  parents themselves, and  breed  another

generation  of unwanted children. This is  a  vicious

circle  if  ever  there  was one.  This  is  what  an

engineer would call positive feedback: it is  ruinous

to the social system.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrying the argument of general social welfare

further, Professor Hardin also said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The consequences of an abortion are mostly strictly

limited  in  time:  the consequences  of  ill-advised

parenthood  are paid for by society for  decades  and

even generations.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol has called

for a new slogan: "Every  child a protected child". I share his concern

for  the  need to protect children, but I  say,  Sir,

every  child will be a protected child if every child

is a wanted child.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Hear,

hear!



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> This is the compelling reality

of life, here and everywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, Sir, also would have a

defective child born into this world. There are  many

men  in  more prominent positions in the world,  with

the  authority  of  experience and  knowledge  behind

them,  who think quite differently. In reviewing  the

abortion laws in the State of Illinois, Dr Potts,  a

Chicago pediatric surgeon, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Having for so many years spent much of my time in

trying   surgically  to  correct  serious  congenital

defects  in the newborn, having witnessed the anguish

of  the parents confronted with the problem of caring

for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



malformed   child,  having  seen  the  burden   these

children  carry into adult life, I can come  only  to

one  conclusion.  I would advise  that  the  laws  be

changed to legalize abortion for such specific  cases

only.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Louis L. Mann went further on the subject.

"Failing to prevent such births," he declared, "would

be nothing short of sin."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol. Mr Speaker, Sir, would also

want  to compel a woman who is pregnant as the result

of  rape and incest to go through with her pregnancy.

Yet  it  is  a hard reality of social life that  both

rape  and incest are repugnant to our society as they

should  be.  For such situations, society imposes  an

everlasting  stigma on the woman and the  child,  the

product  of an unnatural relationship. I believe  the

child of an incestuous relationship in Singapore  can

never be legitimized, and experience and common sense

point to the unlikely legitimation of the child  born

of  rape. I ask of Members of this House, in whom the

public  expect compassion and justice besides  common

sense,  I  ask of them, is it reasonable to for-ce  a

woman to bear a child whose creation is the result of

a  relationship with a man she probably does not know

nor  will ever want to know? Then, Sir, there are the

cases of girls impregnated as the result of statutory

rape.  Are  we to punish them for the rest  of  their

lives,  when it is the presumption of law  that  they

are  too  immature to know the nature of their  acts,

and  then, after they become pregnant, force them  to

face    the   consequences   of   motherhood?   Basic

humanitarian  instincts alone compel the legalization

of  abortion  for  rape and incest cases.  We  cannot

punish  the  child nor the mother for the actions  of

others  at  whose  hands she has already  suffered  a

major traumatic experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, Mr Speaker, Sir, is deeply

concerned  with  the legal rights of the  foetus.  On

this  subject,  there is a wide range of  views  even

among  religious groups. Suffice it for me  to  quote

the Bishop of Exeter in the House of Lords debates in

Britain. He had declared his support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



for  abortion  where  the  interests  of  the  mother

vitally  required  it.  He pointed  out  that  it  is

possible to say that the foetus, the unborn baby,  is

not  a member of the human race in the ordinary sense

of those words, but it has a potentiality of becoming

so.  He  concluded, and here I quote  his  lordship's

words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But since the foetus has only this potentiality of

humanity which is not yet fully real, because  it  is

in  the  process of turning that which  is  potential

into that which is real, the rights of the mother who

has  already passed from the potential to  the  real,

and  who is on any showing a full member of the human

race,  take precedence over those of her unborn baby.

So  where  there  is  a direct and unavoidable  clash

between the interests of the mother and of her unborn

baby, the mother takes precedence over the baby.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is anything that is clear about the issue of abortion, it is that it is a complex and, often, an emotionally charged issue. This is because it is the potential of the human foetus which concerns us. Unless interfered with, this foetus will have the potential to develop into

another human being like ourselves. It is this  poten

tiality that has moved society to set abortion  apart

from  other surgical procedures. Because of  "respect

for  life",  in  religious and  non-religious  terms,

since it is the only life we have or know of, we  are

likely  to  have widely different views on  abortion.

When  does life begin after sexual intercourse?  This

question  has  been argued from time immemorial,  and

from  civilization to civilization, and there  is  no

universally acceptable answer, and the likelihood  is

that  there will be none. Religious views  about  the

foetus  based on doctrine cannot be proved or refuted

as  they  are based on beliefs incapable of empirical

demonstration.   Despite   its   recent   spectacular

advances,  science  can give us no  answer.  At  each

stage  of  development, the foetus has the  potential

for  further development, and even the most  accurate

knowledge of the foetus cannot answer what value each

stage  of development has for society, for the mother

or   father,   or  in  religious  terms,   for   God.

Nevertheless, as legislators, we must make a decision

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



we  cannot  abdicate  our responsibility  to  find  a

solution   to  the  problem  of  unwanted  pregnancy.

Whatever  our religious bias and faith, whatever  our

ethical and humanistic values, it is proper for us to

recognise that we are the elected representatives  of

men on earth, and not the earthly representatives  of

our  faith  in  Parliament. Even among the  Christian

churches,  there  is no unanimity  of  views  on  the

liberalisation  of  abortion laws even  in  Christian

countries. I believe, Sir, it is correct to say  that

in  the  United States, even members of the  Catholic

Church  hierarchy  - and here I am quoting  Loren  G.

Stern again, at pages 90 to 91 of the same article  -

"do  not  believe  that it is the Church's  place  to

impose  its  moral  beliefs  upon  the  rest  of  the

population through criminal statutes." He went on  to

cite  a letter by Cardinal Cushing, and I would  like

to quote a portion of the letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is nothing in Catholic teaching which

suggests  that Catholics should write into civil  law

the  prescriptions of Church Law, or in any other way

force  the observance of Catholic doctrine on others.

Catholics  have no right to do this . . .  while  we

should make every effort to see the law upholds human

rights and values and reflects the moral consensus of

the  community  we should not look  upon  it-  as  an

opportunity  for  promoting  specifically   religious

teachings,  especially when this may be offensive  to

some citizens.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abortion Bill under discussion should cause no

conflict  of  conscience, as it  does  not  coerce  a

pregnant mother to have an abortion or a doctor  with

strong  views on the subject to perform it. Catholics

and others who do not want to avail themselves of the

liberalised  abortion  law  are  certainly  under  no

obligation  to  do  so.  There remains  the  delicate

question  of an emergency when a Catholic doctor  has

to weigh the fear of excommunication with his duty as

a  doctor  to his patient. It seems clear to  me  his

duty  is to his patient, and the true answer  to  his

dilemma will not be found on this earth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Abortion Bill is not a mandatory

piece  of  legislation.  It  imposes   no obligation in conflict

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



the  religious  views  of  those  it  covers.  It  is

essentially  a  permissive law, and  can  accommodate

both  those with diverse religious beliefs, the  non-believers,  and  the  humanists.  The  Abortion  Bill

subjects  none  to the will of others.  This  is  the

nature  of  religious freedom and tolerance  we  must

strive  for  in  our multi-racial and multi-religious

society.  If we cannot support the Bill on  religious

and  other grounds of faith, we should not  deny  the

right  to such a Bill to those who have the need  for

it.  We  are,  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  not  showing  any

disrespect for life. It is because we have a  respect

for  life, and the quality of life on this earth that

I  believe is the moral justification for this  Bill.

We  cannot eliminate human misery on earth. At least,

we  can try to reduce it, especially for those  whose

likely  prospect in life can be summed up as follows:

"born  in  poverty, reared in poverty, and doomed  to

poverty".  Human misery may have a value for  certain

religions. I think it has none for us, whose  primary

responsibility is to improve the prospect and quality

of human life on earth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of medical concern has changed from

century  to  century.  Today, it  embraces  not  only

disease and death but health as well. The modern  con

cept of health is that of a positive state of general

well-being,  and not just an absence of disease.  The

World Health Organization has described health as  "a

state of complete physical, mental, arid social well-being,  and  not  merely the absence  of  disease  or

infirmity". And on the way in which we vote  on  this

Bill  will  the  world judge us on our humanity,  our

breadth  of  vision  and intellectual  horizons,  our

capacity for compassion and for tolerance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a

permissive  Abortion  Bill will  promote  immorality.

Yet, the experience of other nations and the study of

Dr Lee Yong Kiat all have shown that the majority of

women  who go for induced abortions are married women

whose primary concern is the quality of life,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



and  respect  of  it,  among  the  members  of  their

families.  It rests upon the woman to make the  final

decision  to  abort,  and one must  presume  she  has

weighed her decisions against her relations with  her

husband, her family, and her religious faith. This is

her  fundamental right which I hope  the  House  will

accept,  and  which  only  she  alone  can  exercise,

hopefully, to her own happiness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...leave her to heaven,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prick and sting her.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Shakespeare: Hamlet, Act I, Scene V).



<br><br>Finally,  no

human  wisdom  can define an Abortion  Bill  that  is

perfect. It is commendable that provision is made for

the  review  of  the Bill before the House  within  a

comparatively short time.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  my view, the Abortion Bill has been introduced on

two main grounds. Firstly, to control effectively the

growth  of our population and, secondly, to stop  the

increase or existence of illegal abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of population control, it i5 my view

that  in  so far as a small nation like Singapore  is

concerned, such a Bill is very important because  we

lack  natural  resources and we have a population  of

two million. Both in terms of our economy and the  un

employment  problem,  we are shouldering  very  heavy

responsibilities. At the present moment, about 60,000

of  our  citizens  are in a state of unemployment  or

under-employment. Furthermore, we have to look  after

our  citizens in the fields of health, education  and

social  welfare.  Therefore,  we  must  stress   that

effective  control  of  population  growth  is   very

important in Singapore. We must make sure that  every

child  in  Singapore is a healthy child and a  wanted

child.  We must also ensure that every child  in  our

society will have a place in the sun.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved a certain measure of success in

family  planning and, in this respect, the  Singapore

Government  should be congratulated on its foresight.

As  a  matter of fact, when family planning was first

introduced in Singapore, views were expressed against

it.  Sir,  had  it not been for the adamant  attitude

adopted by our Government, our population growth rate

would  have been about 40 per 1,000 and, as a result,

our  population by now would have been at  least  2.5

million  instead  of two million.  So,  on  the  same

basis,  the Singapore Government is trying to  effect

better  control  over the growth  of  population  and

this,  in  my  view, is in keeping with our  national

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government is now encouraging the people to have small families with, at the most, three children in a family. This is not only beneficial to the individual family but also conducive to a better state of social well-being. According to statistics, many illegal abortions are

done  in  Singapore, amounting to at least 500  cases

per annum, and the women involved will eventually  go

to  the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital for assistance  when

their  lives  are  in  danger.  We  must  take  every

possible  step  to  prevent  the  recurrence  or  the

worsening of this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some people will say that this Bill will lower the standard of morality. I thin-k the people who hold this view are too passionate and incapable of making a cool and calculating analysis of the situation. If they open their eyes and look around the world, they will change their attitude. We

can  see  that thousands and thousands of people  are

dying  because  of war, starvation and  malnutrition,

and many thousands are on the brink of starvation. In

my  view, it is a sin for human society to allow such

misery  to  continue to exist.  It  is,  in  fact,  a

tragedy  for human society to be in such a state.  We

must  not allow these things to happen. We must  take

positive  steps to prevent an occurrence  of  such  a

state  of  affairs. We must effectively  control  our

population growth. We must stress that in this  Bill,

abortion is performed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



on  a  voluntary basis. It is not compulsory at  all,

and  people  can, on religious grounds  or  for  some

other reason, very well refuse to accept abortion  if

they  so  choose.  In  addition,  there  are  certain

conditions - I can see at least four of them - to  be

satisfied  before  an  abortion  can  be  authorised.

Firstly, that continued pregnancy will endanger life;

secondly,  financial hardship does  not  justify  the

continuance of pregnancy; thirdly, the doctor must be

satisfied that there is a risk that the child  to  be

born  will  be abnormal; and, fourthly, the pregnancy

is  the result of rape, incest or intercourse with an

insane or feeble-minded person. Because of these four

safeguards,  the  present  social  order  and   moral

standards can and will still be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature of this Bill is that there is a

provision for its review within five years,  so  that

whatever defects there might be will be corrected  in

due  course. In short, this Bill is based on national

interest  and  has  been carefully drafted.  It  will

bring about social progress and promote human welfare

as  well  as  economic development. In the  long-term

interest,  the  Bill is a good one. It  will  advance

human welfare. For all these reasons, I fully support

this Bill.



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, ever since the Abortion Bill  had  its

First  Reading in Parliament, it has stimulated  keen

discussion  in  our society. Members of  the  public,

whether   from  medical,  religious  or   educational

circles, have come out with various views on it, both

divergent and controversial. This can be said  to  be

the first time that any Bill introduced in Parliament

by  the  present Government has been keenly discussed

outside Parliament. This spirit of taking part in the

study  of  a  Bill  introduced by  Parliament  really

merits  our  encouragement. This is  just  where  the

precious spirit of our democratic system lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, when we debate this Bill in Parliament, we

have naturally taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



note of such public views. Whether or not the law  on

abortion should be liberalised is certainly a  highly

controversial  question. This must necessarily  arise

in  a great metropolis. Singapore has reached a stage

in its development where its population growth cannot

be allowed to increase without a check.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister spent much time and trouble

in this House quoting extensive references in support

of  his arguments for this Bill. We, of course,  have

taken note of the good intentions of the Minister  in

introducing  it. In view of the fact  that  our  land

area  is  limited  and our population  is  increasing

continuously, we must, therefore, ensure that  babies

born  will  become useful elements in our society  in

the  future  and  not become scums and  a  burden  to

society. Moreover, in view of the prevailing practice

of  illegal  abortions  which have  caused  traumatic

damage  and harm to ignorant women, we must legislate

to  correct the situation. But the Minister seems  to

see  only  one side of the question and has neglected

to see the other side. It is fortunate that there are

already  some  countries  in  the  world  which  have

introduced  a  law  to  liberalise  abortions.  Their

actual implementation and result can serve as lessons

for our reference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question that merits the reconsideration

of  the Minister is whether the liberalisation of the

law on abortion will actually solve our problems. The

second  question  is, when the  law  on  abortion  is

liberalised, what effect will it have on our society?

In  fact,  in  recent  years,  as  a  result  of  the

successful  implementation of  family  planning,  the

rate  of  our  population growth has been effectively

checked. According to statistics based on the present

trend  of a decreasing rate of population growth,  by

1971 the rate of births will be only 17 per 1,000. We

should    actually   strengthen   our   efforts    in

implementing  family  planning  and  not  allow   the

liberalisation of the law on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



abortion  to defeat or weaken the practice of  family

planning.  The  reason  is  very  simple.  Once   the

liberalisation law on abortion is passed, women  will

generally be less keen on family planning. They  will

have the idea that if they do not want the baby,  the

foetus can easily be aborted. If their application is

not   approved   by  the  Termination  of   Pregnancy

Authorisation  Board, they can still go  for  illegal

abortions.  As  the Minister has admitted,  legalised

abortions may not displace illegal abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries where the law on abortion has been

liberalised,  such  as  Sweden,  America  and  Japan,

abortion  is regarded as an ordinary domestic  chore,

as the Member for Punggol pointed out yesterday. Many

women have had three or four experiences in abortion.

They  substitute abortion for family  planning.  They

take  abortion as a means of population control. What

is  more,  in  these  countries  there  are  tens  of

thousands  of  bastards  born  every  year  of  unwed

mothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we deem, like many other scholars, that the moment the foetus is formed inside the mother's womb it is a human life, then abortion will virtually amount to the taking of life. I think the Minister for Health has no intention of making himself the number one executioner by legislation

killing  a life which is absolutely unable to  defend

itself  inside  the mother's body. Moreover,  in  the

United  Nations  Code  of Children's  Rights,  it  is

stated  that  a child should be given adequate  legal

protection   before  and  after   its   birth.   This

illustrates the fact that before a child is  born  it

should  also  have its human rights.  Human  life  is

sacrosanct  and inviolable. The process of  evolution

from  the  primeval  age  to  the  present  state  of

civilisation has been long and arduous.  The  concept

of  the  absolute sacredness of human life  has  also

been  established through a similar arduous  process.

These are the fruits of civilisation and should on no

account be easily allowed to be damaged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the law on abortion is liberalised, it will

mean  that life can easily be killed. Human life will

then  become as valueless as a piece of waste  paper.

What  is  even  worse  is  that  it  may  shake   the

foundation  upon  which mankind  has  maintained  its

social order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the law on abortion is liberalised, one of the

obvious  consequences  will be  the  degeneration  of

social behaviour. This can be evinced from the social

behaviour  of those countries which have  liberalised

the  law on abortion. Legalised abortion will  easily

be  misunderstood  by people. They  will  think  that

pregnancy  does  not matter. After  all,  it  can  be

aborted  at  will. Thus it will lead to a licentious,

laissez-aller relationship between the male  and  the

female.  Libertines and promiscuous women  will  give

full  vent  to their feelings. In such circumstances,

will  the Minister for Health be able to ensure  that

impressionable  youths will not be uninhibitedly  and

wantonly  more  unscrupulous in their  behaviour  and

that  the  standard  of  social  morality  will   not

deteriorate?  On the one hand, we are  determined  to

build  a  rugged society, but, on the other hand,  we

are  indirectly encouraging a libertine  relationship

between the male and the female and thus allow social

morality  to degenerate. Is it not contradictory  and

ironical?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a free thinker. The views I have put

forward   have   emanated   from   my   conscientious

rationalisation,   although  some   of   the   points

expressed  therein  might inevitably  be  similar  to

those expressed by others. Finally, I sincerely  hope

that  the Minister for Health will reconsider whether

there is an imperative need to bring up this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Second Reading resumed.



<br><br>5.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose the Abortion Bill

because  it is conducive to the moral degradation  of

our  women folk and encourages members of the  public

to   indulge   in  licentiousness  and  adultery.   I

understand that the family planning scheme at present

being carried out is already opening the way for  our

unmarried  girls  and  widows to  commit  fornication

since  they believe they can avoid becoming  pregnant

by  means  of family planning contraceptive aids  now

readily available. If this Bill is passed and if they

become  pregnant through the failure of contraceptive

aids,  then  they  can  resort  to  abortion  without

difficulty.  Do  we really wish to involve  ourselves

and  be  a party to such a state of affairs?  In  all

earnestness, we ought to be on guard against anything

that may impair the good name of the Republic. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



instead here we are trying to push through this  Bill

which,  if passed, will only encourage all manner  of

despicable practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religion of Islam prohibits abortion as an act

that is contrary to the will of God. It is a cardinal

and  unforgivable sin because it is regarded as being

tantamount to killing, even if the foetus has not yet

assumed  human  form. Abortion is a  despicable  act.

Besides,  it  serves  to  encourage  fornication  and

adultery  and  leads  to moral  degradation,  thereby

tarnishing  the  good  name  of  our  Republic.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, I oppose this Bill.



<br><br>5.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Health  Minister,  in his long  and  devastating

speech  yesterday, said that it was  the  fundamental

right  of  a woman to have an abortion if the  family

circumstances  are not right for  the  birth  of  the

child.  According to him, the issue  is  simple  - the

right  of an individual to have a choice to abort  an

unwanted  pregnancy under specified conditions,  just

as  it  is the right of every human being to enjoy  a

meaningful  life, a right to liberty and a  right  to

privacy.   To  me,  all  these  sounded  like   pious

protestations of the other extreme view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask, if we are to legislate a law in order to

give  an individual the right to abortion, the  right

to  liberty, and the right to privacy, are we also to

legislate a law in future to ensure the right  of  an

individual or a group of

individuals  to  watch  a  blue  film  in  their  own

residence without being harassed by the police, since

values  have become not abiding but conditional?  Are

we  also to legislate a law to ensure the right of an

individual  to  take away his own life by  committing

suicide  if  that individual feels that life  has  no

longer any meaning and any future for him? This could

perhaps  be extended further by a pronouncement  that

all  persons who are liabilities to the state  should

do society a favour by eliminating themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Minister presented to the House six case

studies of illegal abortions and he did not spare  us

the sordid details of the traumatic experience of the

patients concerned. He went further and mentioned the

case  of a Roman Catholic housewife. I would like  to

tell  the  Minister that, in the case  of  the  Roman

Catholic  housewife,  if she had  only  followed  the

teachings of her religion, she would not have in  the

first  place  resorted to the illegal  abortion,  and

thus  she  would  have spared herself  the  traumatic

experience. However, the point that I would  like  to

bring  out  is this. Is it a right line  of  argument

that  we  should  take, when  we  say  that  we  must

legislate  the liberalisation of the law on  abortion

in  order  to  enable our women folk  the  individual

right  to  have  an unwanted pregnancy aborted?  This

line   of   argument,  if  applied  in  a   different

situation, can also present the case for the state to

legislate a law for legalised suicide and to  provide

facilities for individuals wishing to commit  suicide

to have the facilities of a gas chamber - seeing that

this  is a much easier way of taking one's life  than

to   resort  to  various  hideous  forms  of  killing

oneself.  We could as well present to this House  the

traumatic experience of many individuals who had made

unsuccessful attempts at suicide. But to  suggest  at

this juncture that the state legislates such a law to

this  effect will bring upon myself strong criticisms

from  the  Health Minister and I might be accused  of

being mischievous. But there is a parallel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would think that the right way to help someone

who  wants  to take away his own life is to  persuade

the person to abandon the idea and help him to see  a

future,  a  hope  and a more courageous  way  out  of

whatever  difficulties that he faces.  Similarly,  it

would  be equally logical to say that for an unwanted

pregnancy, we must try to find ways and means to make

mothers  learn  to  want  the  unwelcomed  pregnancy.

Surely it is not right for the state to help them get

rid  of an unwanted pregnancy just as it is not right

for the state to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



an  individual get rid of his own life,  although  it

may  be  argued  that every individual  has  his  own

right, even the right to take away his own life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, it is dangerous to invoke such noble

terms as the right of individuals, the right to  this

and  the  right  to  that. I  think  the  fundamental

principle  behind  a good law is that  the  law  must

generally concern itself with the general welfare  of

the  public, even if such a law may encroach upon the

rights of a minority group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welfare of a community must involve public order

and  civil peace; the security of the young, the weak

and the handicapped; the maintenance of the decencies

of  public  behaviour,  the protection  of  life  and

property.  To  me the liberalisation of  the  law  on

abortion will work against the general welfare of the

community,  particularly when it will  infringe  upon

certain  moral  values of the Singapore  society.  In

Singapore,  we  respect and value certain  human  and

moral  values. The present Government has  not  shown

itself  up to now in favour of a permissive  society.

Its  marriage legislation and its concern over  porno

graphic   films,   in   its   emphasis   on    social

responsibility, it has striven to improve the  social

and the moral standards of the people. I am sure this

can  be  undone to a certain extent by  the  move  to

liberalise the law on abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Minister, in moving the Bill to be read a

Second  time,  has  proceeded to demolish  objections

that   might  be  anticipated  from  this  House   on

religious  grounds as well as ethical, moral,  social

and   medical   grounds.  In  the  course   of   such

refutation,  he expressed his view that  abortion  is

not murder. Elsewhere in his speech, the Minister has

levelled  religious objections to legalised  abortion

as being based on concepts which have sprung from the

middle ages and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implied tenor of the Minister's arguments is

that  the  proponents of the Bill are  favoured  with

crystal-clear  and  rational  understanding  of   the

concept of life and the concept of laws pertaining to

the preservation of life. It is only unfortunate that

in the course of his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



lengthy  speech the Minister has lost the  thread  of

his own arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the very basis of the laws of the Republic

governing  abortion is as outdated and as  irrational

as  the  Minister  sincerely  believes,  a  pertinent

question  may be asked why the Minister is sponsoring

a  Bill  which,  in effect, seeks tn  perpetuate  the

concept that abortion is intrinsically wrong and that

the  procreative organs of a human  being  are  of  a

special  category meriting distinctive  treatment  in

relation  to the other organs and parts of the  human

body.  Such an inference is to be clearly drawn  from

the  fact  that the Bill is designated to reform  and

liberalise  the  law of abortion in  Singapore  -  in

other   words,   to   make   less   restrictive   the

circumstances  in which an abortion  may  be  legally

performed. In contrast, the Minister has not found it

necessary to enact similar legislation to govern  the

removal  of  an  excrescence on the brain,  liver  or

kidney  or  even  a portion of the  organ  itself  by

competent medical personnel. The very fact  that  the

removal  of  a foetus, which the Minister regards  as

nothing more than a piece of living organism, must be

made  the  subject of a special piece of  legislation

with  innumerable safeguards, is a strong  indication

that  the  proponents of the Bill are  not  clear  in

their conscience that an operation for the removal of

foetus  can  be  considered  to  be  like  any  other

operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sordid details and nebulous arguments have been used

to  cover up the mental confusion and uneasiness that

are  inherent  in the concept of life underlying  the

sponsorship  of  the  Bill.  An  instance   of   such

arguments  is  the contention that  the  present  law

gives  rise  to  a serious conflict for  the  doctor,

between the duty to serve the patient and the duty to

obey  the  law. With all due respect to the Minister,

who has been a distinguished legal practitioner, I am

of  the view that there is no such conflict. The duty

of  a  doctor  to serve his patient has  always  been

conditioned  and  determined by his medical  training

and  the  Hippocratic oath. It is my contention  that

any law governing would only serve, as it does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



at  present,  to  restrict the scope within  which  a

doctor  can  exercise  his discretion  to  serve  his

patient in the best interest of the patient. I  would

have  thought  that the Minister should have  pursued

his  fundamental contention - namely, that abortion  is

desirable  and  necessary  in  the  context  of   the

Republic - to  its  logical  conclusion  by  repealing

sections  312  to 316 and 511 of the Penal  Code  and

enacting henceforth that abortion is an offence  only

if  it is performed by medically unqualified persons.

Otherwise,  if  abortion is not intrinsically  wrong,

why  should  members of such a responsible profession

be  made  subject to petty, harassing  man-made  laws

pertaining to abortion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also a strong objection to the portion of the

Minister's  speech relating to clause  10  (3)  which

provides that a doctor can be compelled to perform an

abortion   against  his  conscience.   The   Minister

justified  the invasion of a person's  right  to  act

legitimately  according  to  his  own  conscience  by

saying  that  the legal duty to preserve  life  over-rides  all  religious dogmas and beliefs. I  wish  to

point out that in countries such as the United States

of America and the United Kingdom, even when they are

engaged in a struggle of life and death, they do  not

compel  their  citizens against their  conscience  to

carry out their legal duty to kill in defence of  the

state  of which they are citizens. But where abortion

is  concerned, the Minister is prepared to uphold the

right  of  a  woman  who,  in  accordance  with   her

conscience, demands an abortion, even at the  expense

of  the  right of the doctor to refuse to perform  or

assist in an abortion against his conscience. Thus an

irony may arise later that while our police force  is

not  efficient  enough to enforce the  observance  of

laws  relating to criminal abortion as  the  Minister

admits,  there would be no difficulty in  prosecuting

doctors,  particularly those in  government  service,

for refusing to perform abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already in existence at present a law

permitting abortion to be carried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



out  on  the grounds that such an action is necessary

to  save a woman's life, and today before this  House

is  a  Bill intended to reform and to liberalise this

law.  One  notable  feature  of  this  Bill  is   the

extension of the law to permit abortion to be carried

out  on social and economic grounds, and this feature

to which I am referring is embodied in clause 5, sub-clause (2) (b) . This sub-clause, judging from the way

the  term  "environment" is defined,  makes  abortion

readily  available  to a substantial  number  of  our

women  folk  who would be able to have  abortion  for

their   unwanted   foetus   under   the   cover    of

environmental circumstances. This sub-clause will, in

practice, virtually allow abortion on demand  by  the

persons  concerned. The underlying principle of  this

sub-clause  represents  a  radical  change   of   the

attitude  of  the  Government towards  abortion,  and

perhaps  constitutes  the  main  reason  behind   the

Government's move to liberalise the law  relating  to

abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government's intention to liberalise the

law  on abortion was first made known, it came  as  a

complete  surprise  to  the public  especially  since

there  does  not  seem  to have been  any  widespread

public  clamour  for a change in the present  law  on

abortion.   Naturally  there   were   strong   public

reactions  to  the  Bill, even  though  it  would  be

granted that there was also a favourable response  to

it.  But  it appears to me that there seems  to  have

been  more  adverse than favourable response  to  the

Government's  intention.  The  Health  Minister   may

disagree  with me here. One section of the  community

which  is greatly opposed to the Bill is the  medical

profession itself. The Singapore Medical Association,

which  is  the  spokesman for  Singapore  doctors  in

matters  relating  to  their profession,  is  divided

among  itself towards the proposed Bill  before  this

House.  One  would  gather the impression  that  many

doctors  have strong objections, founded  on  medical

grounds,  against the liberalisation of the  abortion

law,  and I suggest that due consideration and weight

be given to their objections since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



they  are  most qualified to comment on  the  medical

aspects  of  abortion. The objection of many  doctors

against  liberalising the law on abortion is  on  the

ground that every operation for abortion carries with

it  definite risks endangering the patient's life and

health.  It will seem unreasonable for the Government

to ignore such an important objection since this is a

matter  of  life and death. Medical science  has  not

advanced to such a stage as to ensure absolute safety

for  the patient undergoing abortion, no matter  what

safeguards  are  taken. An element  of  risk  to  the

patient's life and health is always present. I do not

find  the  reasons  behind the Government's  proposal

compelling  enough  to  make  us  ignore   the   risk

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point of view to consider if we

want  to  liberalise  the law  on  abortion.  If  the

abortion  law  is  liberalised, and the  practice  of

abortion becomes widespread and "respectable", so  to

speak,  it would lead to a loss of respect for  human

life.  True,  there  has been much  controversy  over

whether  the foetus can be considered to be  a  human

being. But whatever differences of views there may be

as  to  the  true nature of the foetus, one  must  at

least accept that the foetus should not be treated as

mere  waste-matter to be disposed of as circumstances

require. Many eminent doctors hold the view that life

is  present in full potentiality from the  moment  of

conception   and   that  there   are   no   intrinsic

differences between the foetus at conception  and  at

birth  -  the  only differences being  the  stage  of

development. If our own convenience is put before our

respect  for  a  human life which is  not  yet  fully

developed, there is reason to fear that this attitude

will  spread.  In  other words,  once  we  allow  the

destruction of human life on the grounds that  it  is

not  completely  human, then we  leave  the  way  for

others  to  argue  what constitutes  complete  "human

life".  Once we start to value human beings according

to  their  worth to the society, our attention  would

then be directed to those persons without whom  our

society might be considered better off. We may  start

to think in terms of getting rid of the aged,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



the  incurably sick, the deformed and so  on.  Surely

this is not the kind of society we desire and the way

by which we want our society to evolve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, the objections to reforming and

liberalising   the  abortion  law  on   medical   and

humanitarian grounds are very valid no matter what my

good friend, the Minister for Health, may say. Let us

now  examine some of the reasons advanced by him  for

the  proposed changes of the abortion law as embodied

in  the  Bill.  One  reason  seems  to  be  that  the

Government  wants to make abortion available  as  the

ultimate  method  of  population control  when  other

methods  of  family  planning  have  failed.  Another

reason  may  be that the Government wants  to  ensure

that the Republic is not burdened with the care of un

wanted  babies. The third reason may be that  through

liberalising  the  law  on abortion,  the  Government

hopes  to get rid of the unqualified quacks  now  per

forming illegal abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears at this juncture necessary to ask two

pertinent   questions.  First,  will   the   proposed

Abortion  Bill  achieve  the  desired  results?  And,

secondly,  if so, will the harm done be greater  than

the good achieved? In my opinion, the probable answer

to  the  above two questions is that it  is  possible

that  the Government might achieve partially some  of

the  desired results at the price of seeing more harm

done than good achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If abortion is resorted to as an ultimate means of

population control when other family planning methods

have  failed, then it will either be rarely  resorted

to  -  in  which  case  it will make  no  significant

difference to the overall population - or it will  be

something widespread - in which case it is a very bad

means  of  birth control, because it is dangerous  to

the  health of the woman and, also, because  it  only

solves the problem for a short time, especially  when

a  woman  can  become pregnant again within  a  short

period after abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore appear that the logical step to

take  in planning population control would be to step

up our national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



campaign  on  family  planning and  to  increase  the

effectiveness  and efficiency of our family  planning

machinery,  to enable a sizable number of  our  women

population  to  take advantage of the facilities  and

advice of our national family planning board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper on Family Planning of September

1965 the Government stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If our Family Planning Plan succeeds, the present

crude birth rate of over 30 per thousand in Singapore

could  be reduced to around 20 per thousand and  with

our  death  rate  remaining constant around  six  per

thousand,  Singapore's net increase in population  in

the  1970's  could be brought down to around  15  per

thousand  - which will bring Singapore in  line  with

prevailing rates of population increase applicable to

prosperous and advanced countries elsewhere.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1966 and 1967 Annual Reports of the Singapore

Family  Planning and Population Board  indicate  that

our national family planning programmes have achieved

a  significant reduction in our annual  birth  rates,

and can become effective means of population control.

This  was  achieved  despite the  fact  that  a  vast

majority  of  the  women population  have  not  taken

advantage of the facilities and advice of the  Family

Planning  programmes.  As improvements  are  made  to

extend  the services of the Singapore Family Planning

and Population Board to reach a greater number of the

women population in Singapore, I would expect to  see

a further drop in the annual birth-rate in Singapore.

Surely,  the logical step for the Government to  take

at this juncture should be to develop the services of

the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board to

such an extent as to reach the maximum number of  our

women  population  to achieve a significant  drop  in

annual  birth-rate rather than for the Government  to

introduce measures to liberalise the law on  abortion

as an effective means to plan our population control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In talking about population control, I do not think

it  is  out  of place for me here to point  out  that

sometimes  under-population can hamper  the  economic

development and progress of a country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



While  I  do not see that under-population will  ever

become a problem that we have to face, I do not  also

see  over-population becoming an over-riding  problem

that  we  have to face in our efforts to bring  about

the  economic  progress and advancement  of  our  two

million  citizens. In Singapore today, while we  talk

of unemployment of so many thousands on the one hand,

we  also find ourselves faced with the problem  of  a

skilled labour shortage on the other hand. We  cannot

hope  to expand industrially at a desired rate if  we

lack  the skilled labour and the technocrats  to  man

and run our factories. The problem, therefore, is not

one  of  number. The problem is how do  we  plan  and

train   our  manpower  resources  according  to   our

national needs. If today, by a miracle, we can  train

the   unemployed   to  become  skilled   labour   and

technocrats,  then  we can ensure for  ourselves  the

success in our industrial expansion and progress  and

solve  our  unemployment  problem.  Desirable  though

population  control may be for planning our  economic

progress  and  advancement, it does  not  necessarily

mean  that  we  must reduce the number of  births  to

zero.  A  certain  number of births is  necessary  to

maintain  our population at its prevailing  level.  A

liberal abortion law which permits all babies  to  be

killed  before they are born, theoretically speaking,

will  serve to defeat the very purpose for which  the

Bill was proposed - to ensure the continuing survival

of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in his speech also pointed out that the

central  purpose  of the Bill may be  to  ensure  the

quality of the life of children born in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Not "may be".



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> All right. And that every child

will be a wanted child. I think he is attempting  the

impossible.  Assuming that abortions  may  be  freely

available in Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is always good to aspire to

an ideal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> - I wonder how he can ensure

the  quality of children born in future.  There  will

always be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



children who are sickly, retarded or deformed.  There

will always be children who are not up to the quality

mentioned  by the Minister. What are we  to  do  with

them? Are we to consider them as unwanted children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Government hopes to get rid of

the   illegal  or  the  unqualified  quacks   through

liberalisation  of  the law on abortion.  This  again

cannot  be achieved as long as there are stipulations

restricting the circumstances under which an abortion

may  be legally permitted. Women who cannot meet  the

stipulations will continue to seek illegal abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all that I have said, I feel that this is

not  the  proper time for the Government to introduce

legislation to liberalise the law on abortion. It  is

to  be  hoped  that  such a move  will  never  become

necessary in Singapore. I therefore strongly urge the

Government to withdraw the Abortion Bill in the light

of what I have said.



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in full support  of

the  Abortion  Bill  now before  this  House.  It  is

necessary  for  purpose of record to state  that  the

Government's  decision  to introduce  this  piece  of

progressive legislation to legalise and to liberalise

abortion was taken nearly two years ago, when  I  was

then  in  charge of the Ministry of Health.  A  great

deal   of   time,  thought  and  consideration   has,

therefore,  been given to the drafting of this  Bill,

as  we  are  fully aware of the highly  controversial

nature of the legislation to be enacted, and the  hue

and  cry that will be raised by those holding  strong

religious views on the subject, as well as those  who

are   sincere,   conscientious  objectors.   We   are

confident,  however,,  that  genuine  opposition  and

resistance  to  this  Bill  forms  only  a  minority,

although vocal and somewhat vociferous in nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are practising parliamentary democracy in

Singapore, it is important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



to ensure that those in opposition to the Bill should

be heard ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> But not

seen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is the responsibility of the

Minister for Defence. And this has been going on  for

nearly  20  months,  ever since it  became  known  in

August  1967  that it was Government's  intention  to

introduce this legislation in Parliament. It must  be

remembered,  however, that the large  majority,  espe

cially  the  women folk who will benefit  under  this

Bill  and who are, I am sure, in full agreement  with

the  principles of the Bill, prefer to remain  silent

on it. As the saying goes, silence means consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first recall, briefly, the background of how

this  Bill  came into being. I can assure this  House

that  the  liberalisation of the law on abortion  for

Singapore  is no flash-in-the-pan idea, just  to  hit

the  headlines, but a sober, measured, deliberate and

ultimate step for the full emancipation of our women.

We  passed the Women's Charter of 1961 which gives to

our  women  (other  than those who subscribe  to  the

Muslim faith) equality of status and security through

the one-man, one-wife law.

<br><br>5.42 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no longer chattels to be trifled with but

equal  partners in a marriage. In my view, the  right

of a woman to decide whether or not she is to bear  a

child  can  only be guaranteed if it is made  "legal"

for her, of her own free will, to undergo an abortion

if  she so decides. Indeed, we would fail in our aim,

that  of  giving our women folk who, after all,  form

one-half of the human race living on this earth, full

equality  in  the eyes of the law if we do  not  pass

this Bill to give her the right to decide whether  or

not  to have another baby. Having a baby is something

no  man can ever understand because, physically,  man

is  incapable of bearing children. Man  does  not  go

through the profound



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



experience  of  childbirth and the attendant  mother-love  of tending and caring for the young till it  is

able  to  look after itself, after years of laborious

care,  pain  and  sorrow. As men,  we  tend  to  talk

somewhat  lightly about the pangs of childbirth.  How

many  of us fathers who are not medical doctors  like

yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, have watched their

wives  at  childbirth?  I  have.  It  is  only  after

watching  a  mother going through such an  experience

that  one  can understand the problem of the unwanted

child  to the woman - not the man. Mother-love is  so

strong and powerful and yet she chooses to abort.  It

goes  against her very nature to do it. But when  she

does  make  that  decision, it must have  been  under

great  provocation. Having an abortion is no  picnic.

It  is  not  fun.  It is painful. It is  a  traumatic

experience, as mentioned by the hon. Member, and  the

woman  who  decides on an abortion does not  come  to

such  a decision lightly. I, therefore say, that when

a  woman decides on an abortion, the least we can  do

for her is not to make it harder for her by labelling

it as "illegal" and thus make her desperate enough to

do  something furtive and, worse still, to  go  under

the  counter, with all the attendant dangers that  go

with  illegal  activities, to  get  what  she  wants,

despite the fear, the risks that are being taken  and

the  rapacious  swindle that goes  on  by  those  who

profit out of it, just because of the existence of an

antiquated law which, far from protecting women,  has

made them victims of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Japan, which introduced legalised abortion in

1948  as  a  population control measure  long  before

family  planning  came  into  the  picture,   we   in

Singapore, on the other hand, are fortunate to have a

successful mass family planning programme  in  action

before  contemplating the introduction of  a  law  to

liberalise  abortion. This is therefore no  desperate

measure  to  control population growth in  Singapore.

The  success of the first three years, 1966 to  1968,

of   our  Five-Year  Family  Planning  programme  has

already brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



down  the  natural rate of increase of our population

by  over  six  points,  i.e.,  from  24.4  per  1,000

population  in 1965, the year before the introduction

of  the  Five-Year Plan, to 18.2 per 1,000 population

in 1968. This is a most satisfactory position indeed,

and a record, probably unequalled elsewhere, for such

good results within the short space of three years of

an action programme.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who ask, since our family planning

programme  is  so successful, why then introduce  the

controversial  issue  of  liberalising  the  law   on

abortion?  Is  this  necessary?  The  answer   is   a

categorical  yes.  Once  the  principle   of   family

planning is accepted, i.e., that not every sex  union

must   automatically  result  in  a  conception   and

thereafter  the  birth of a child,  it  automatically

follows  that  legalised abortion  for  contraceptive

failures  must be conceded to, and that is what  this

Abortion Bill aims to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who practise family planning, and they

must  include  many Members in this House  and  those

outside   this  House,  must  know  how  easily   con

traceptive  failures can arise, whatever  the  method

used - be it the rhythm method, which is reported  to

have  as high a failure rate as 75 per cent - a  most

unreliable  method indeed, and other methods  like  a

tear  in  the condom, whether through age  or  faulty

manufacture,  or  vaginal cream which  has  gone  off

because  of time or temperature or being inadequately

spread  out,  or forgetting to take the contraceptive

pill   for  one  occasion,  or  impatience  or  over-zealousness on the part of one or both partners. I do

not think I need go further into the subject. But  it

is  patently clear that contraceptive failures  occur

inevitably,  sometime  and somehow,  with  the  woman

missing  her next menstrual period - the  first  sure

sign that conception has taken place. What then?  Why

do    we   practise   family   planning?   In   these

circumstances, I say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



the woman who decides to have an abortion should feel

free  to  seek this remedy, and not be made  to  feel

like a criminal and an outcast of society for wanting

to commit a so-called illegal act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter should be treated as if an "accident"

had  occurred, just as we would treat cases that come

to  the  Emergency  Unit of our General  Hospital  at

present.  It is then the duty of Government  to  have

the   best   facilities  available  to  rectify   the

"accident"  which has arisen and to heal  and  repair

any damage that may have been caused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, the Minister for Health, said

yesterday in his speech, it is possible for those who

are  rich and able to pay the price for abortions  to

be  performed  legally under the guise of  dilatation

and  curettage (i.e., dilatation of the neck  of  the

womb).  That is what abortion is. But because of  the

so-called  ethics practised in the medical profession

that  of  secrecy between doctor and patient  -  very

little  comes  out  unless a fatality  or  a  scandal

occurs. So you hear very little about it. But  it  is

going  on.  It  must  be  said  for  the  profession,

however,  that most doctors will not be  prepared  to

perform   abortions  under  the  present  Jaw,   but,

unfortunately,  many doctors are painfully  aware  of

the   unsavoury   "goings-on"  of   some   of   their

compatriots who have less scruples and are performing

these  supposedly "illegal" abortions, raking in  the

money and exploiting the desperation of many women in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now read out a relevant paragraph of the

White  Paper mentioned by my Friend across the  Floor

on  Family Planning (Command Paper 22 of 1965), which

was published on 27th September, 1965, paragraph 8.2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Purpose of 5-Year Plan



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be forgotten that many women in

desperation   over  innumerable  child-bearing,   are

resorting  to  illegal abortion as a way  out.  Every

year  nearly  500  patients  are  being  admitted  to

Kandang   Kerbau   Maternity  Hospital   in   serious

condition,  and their cases are clinically  diagnosed

as  being  "abortions with sepsis", and  these  could

well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



have  been  the  result of unsuccessful  attempts  at

induced abortion. It is estimated that for every  one

who  is  hospitalised there may be as  many  as  five

going  undetected. This yearly tragedy  of  suffering

and   exploitation  of  thousands  of   women   which

sometimes result in death must be stopped!'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us put a stop to these malpractices by

making  it  legal for our women to have abortions  if

they  so desire. Let us not have one law for the rich

and  another for the middle class and the  poor,  who

resort  to  all kinds of dangerous forms  of  induced

abortions just because they cannot afford to pay  the

high  sum and the price for a "legal" abortion to  be

performed in the aseptic conditions of a private well-equipped clinic or hospital under the present law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I so confident that only the minority oppose

the  liberalising  of  the law  on  abortion?  Taking

family  planning  as the cue, when  implementing  the

Five-Year Mass Family Planning programme in  1966,  a

senior   official  of  the  Health  Ministry   (since

retired)  in the Maternal and Child Health Department

asked:  "What  are we to do with staff  (doctors  and

nurses)  who  are  opposed  to  family  planning   on

religious  grounds?" My answer was a  straightforward

administrative one. "Ask them to put in writing  that

they wish to be excused from family planning work  on

religious grounds and we can then transfer  them  out

to  other  sections in the Ministry - we do not  sack

them  where  their  religious scruples  need  not  be

embarrassed." The result was a request  for  transfer

by  only two members of the staff (one doctor and one

nurse) out of a staff of hundreds. That is all!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who oppose this Bill, we simply say no one

is  being  compelled to have abortions. The  affected

woman  has to decide, of her own free will, that  she

wants it. No one is going to force her to do it.  She

has  to come to that conclusion herself. The decision

is  something for her to make. So if you must  oppose

this  Bill,  you  are  at  liberty  not  to  have  an

abortion. Have your baby, it is yours to have and  to

hold, but please leave others alone and do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



not  interfere with the wishes of others who  want  a

legal abortion. Do not stand in their way. Stay  off!

Just as we respect the views of those who differ,  so

should  they respect the views of others who want  to

have  legal  abortions  and to exercise  their  legal

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I say a vote to liberalise the law on

abortion  is  a vote for progressive legislation  and

for the full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



emancipation of our women. If Members have to

disagree on this Bill, the least they can do is to

abstain from voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><i>Wednesday, 9th April, 1969</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question for Oral Answer stood on the Order Paper of 9th April, 1969 :-



<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION COURTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Abolition)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b>: To ask the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour whether

he proposes to abolish one or both Industrial

Arbitration Courts."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order No. 20 (2) , the Minister

for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour supplied

the following answer: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. "The Honourable Member is aware that the

Industrial Arbitration Court is set up under the

Industrial Relations Ordinance (No. 20 of 1960).

Section 3 (1) of the Industrial Relations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  provides that there shall be one  or  more

Industrial Arbitration Courts to be presided over  by

a  President  or Deputy President to be appointed  by

the  President  of Singapore in accordance  with  the

advice of the Prime Minister. If we are going  to  do

away  with the Industrial Arbitration Court, we  will

also  have  to do away with the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance,  1960,  and this the Government  does  not

intend to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Honourable Member is aware that at present there

are  two  Industrial Arbitration Courts  and  whether

there  should  be  one or two such  Courts,  or  even

three, is dependent on the number of cases that  have

to  be dealt with. Provision, however, is made in the 1969

Estimates   for  two  Industrial   Arbitration

Courts."
