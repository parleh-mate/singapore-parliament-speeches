<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL LIBRARY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Retention)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  why  the Urban Redevelopment Authority  has  not

seen fit to reply to public suggestions on ways in which  the

existing National Library can be retained.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume by "public suggestions" Mr Simon

Tay   is  referring  to  the  alternative  proposal  for  the

Singapore Management University campus that was submitted  by

Mr Tay Kheng Soon.  If that is the case, then perhaps, before

I  reply to the Question, may I, by way of background,  trace

the history of the National Library issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the possibility of the National Library building

being removed was first made public in 1988 when the URA  was

formulating  the  Civic District Master  Plan.  URA  held  an

exhibition  on  the  draft Master  Plan  for  the  Civic  and

Cultural  District which was the area around the  Bras  Basah

Park  area  in  April  1988. This was followed  by  a  public

dialogue  in May 1988 between the then Minister for  National

Development,  Mr S. Dhanabalan, and professional  bodies  and

members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was general support for the removal of the

National Library building to open up the view of Fort Canning

Hill from the Bras Basah area. There was another proposal  to

realign  Stamford  Road behind National Museum  so  that  the

National  Museum would be better integrated with  Bras  Basah

Park.  This  would also entail the demolition of the  library

building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public feedback led to further studies by URA and

the former PWD on how to better integrate the land parcels in

the  area  to  create a more pedestrian friendly environment.

Several  options were explored, including depressing Stamford

Road, providing an alternative at-grade alignment behind  the

National  Museum  and a tunnel through the National  Library.

The only feasible option

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>

was the tunnel option, and this was subsequently incorporated

into  the  Master Plan for the Civic District.  The finalised

Master  Plan  was completed and exhibited to  the  public  in

February 1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1998, SMU announced that it would build its

campus  in the Bras Basah area.  There was a series of  Forum

page letters in the newspapers and direct suggestions to  URA

following the announcement.  URA responded to these  letters,

and explained the plans to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1999, SMU chaired a public symposium on the

physical development of its campus.  Issues such as  why  SMU

was  located in Bras Basah Park, and the need to  remove  the

National   Library  building  were  addressed  by   the   URA

representative  at  the symposium.  URA  also  explained  the

issues   to   the  press,  and  the  press  published   these

explanations on 20th March.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th January this year, SMU chaired a technical

workshop  to obtain feedback from architectural professionals

on  three  alternative  proposals  put  up  by  SMU's  master

planners.   At  the workshop, Mr Tay objected  to  the  plans

which  proposed buildings on Bras Basah Park, and the removal

of  the National Library building.  He subsequently called  a

press  conference on 24th January to present his  alternative

proposal for the SMU campus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA did not participate in Mr Tay's press conference

because it was not invited.  Neither could it respond to  the

proposal  then as it had not received a formal proposal  from

Mr Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay wrote to the Prime Minister about his proposal on

31st January 2000.  The Prime Minister then referred it to my

Ministry for evaluation. Subsequently, I met with Mr  Tay  on

two  occasions to better understand his plan.  On the  second

occasion,  I  asked  Mr  Tay to present  it  to  my  Ministry

officials with URA and LTA present to give their professional

inputs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry made an assessment of Mr Tay's and URA's

plans and I replied to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>

Prime  Minister  on  28th February.  I am informed  that  the

Prime  Minister's Office has replied to Mr Tay.  Sir, I  have

the  Prime  Minister's permission to release both letters  to

the  public.  May I circulate both letters to Members of  the

House  for  their information. [Copies of letters distributed

to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer Members of the House to my letter to

the Prime Minister dated 28th February?  In particular, may I

read part of the letter starting from paragraph 3:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Tay's proposal and URA's guidelines differ over two

fundamental  issues.  The first issue is the  extent  of  the

open  space  in  the Bras Basah area.  The  second  issue  is

whether  the  existing National Library  building  should  be

retained.



Mr Tay Kheng Soon's Proposal



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay feels that the Bras Basah Park should be kept as

a  large open space with completely open views from the roads

and  unblocked  by  buildings, in order  to  retain  what  he

perceives  to  be a crucial element in the mental  map  which

Singaporeans have of the city.  He thus proposes to create  a

sunken   park  below  street  level,  reflecting  pool,   and

waterfall; and to replace the current foliage with structured

rows  of  palm trees to give this area a sense of  monumental

scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sunken park would restrict pedestrian

movement between the various buildings at street level as the

public would have to walk around the edges of the park to get

to  buildings on the other side.  Since the MRT tunnels under

the  sunken park would limit the usable area, Mr Tay proposes

to  meet SMU's floor space requirements via clusters of  tall

buildings  of  up to 15 storeys at the foot of Fort  Canning.

These  tall buildings would not be in keeping with  the  low-rise  character of the Civic District with its many  historic

buildings.   It would also block the views to  and  from  the

Fort Canning Hill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay agrees that the National Library building lacks

architectural  merit.  However, he feels  strongly  that  the

Library  should  be preserved for historical and  sentimental

reasons.  To avoid the Library, he proposes that the new road

tunnel  run alongside the current Stamford Road for a stretch

and then dive down under it.  This plan requires a long, deep

trench,  flanked  by  one-metre high  parapet  walls,  to  be

created  in front of the National Library up to the  entrance

of the National Museum.  This will severely mar the landscape

of  the  area  and restrict pedestrian movement between  Bras

Basah Park and the National Museum area.



URA's Planning Guidelines



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA's plan for this area recognises the importance of

retaining an open space and the visual connection between the

Singapore  Arts Museum and the National Museum.  By  allowing

SMU's buildings and some public facilities to be built on the

park, the plan seeks to encourage better public usage of  the

park.   Capping  the  height  of buildings  around  the  Fort

Canning Hill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>

area to around 4 to 5 storeys will maintain the character  of

the Civic District and protect the view to and from the hill.

The   addition  of  low-rise  institutional  buildings  would

further enhance the civic quality of the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realignment of the existing Stamford Road and the

building of the tunnel through Fort Canning Hill provides the

most  direct route for traffic moving from Marina Centre  and

the  Central  Business  District to Orchard  Road,  and  thus

siphons traffic away from the Bras Basah area, making it more

pleasant  for  pedestrians.  It will provide  SMU  with  more

regular  land parcels to work with.  However, this  alignment

requires the removal of the National Library building.



MND's Assessment



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, Mr Tay's and URA's plans seek to achieve

different  planning  intentions, with very  different  start-points.   We  need to decide between a plan which provides  a

large  unshaded  open  space and retention  of  the  National

Library  building  and one which seeks to bring  more  public

activity  into the centre of the area.  With the former,  the

trade-off is a poorer road network, a tunnel which  cuts  the

area  into two and high rise buildings in an essentially low-rise environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND clearly prefers URA's plan as it is more people-friendly, facilitates better pedestrian flow and preserves

the ambience and environment of the important Civic District.

It  also  allows SMU greater flexibility to plan the area  to

meet  their  requirements.  URA's plan  brings  about  better

coherence  in  the cluster of buildings for SMU  in  that  it

facilitates pedestrian traffic throughout the cluster without

being  subdivided by a Stamford Road which will  carry  heavy

and fast vehicular traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND acknowledges that some members of the public are in

favour  of retaining the National Library building.  However,

the Preservation of Monuments Board and the National Heritage

Board  have  assessed that there are insufficient  merits  to

preserve the building.  Nevertheless, PMB will look into  how

the  social  memory  of the building of the  library  can  be

captured  and  commemorated.  We will also encourage  SMU  to

incorporate  in  the  design of its buildings  features  that

would help Singaporeans evoke memories of the Library."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the issue of the

National  Library has been extensively discussed and debated,

both  publicly and privately, not once, not twice,  but  many

times,  by  way  of public dialogues, symposiums,  workshops,

letters  to  the press and private consultations since  1988,

and  now this debate in the House.  So my view is that  there

is  no question that URA or any other relevant authority  has

not seen fit to reply to public suggestions on this issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I begin by thanking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister for his full reply and welcoming the  steps  in

meeting  the  architect, Mr Tay Kheng Soon.  May  I  ask  the

Minister:  will  he not consider further public  process  and

attempt for dialogue with the public in general, in the sense

that meeting with an individual architect is not the same  as

meeting other people who might feel that the Library  or  the

Park is worth saving?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in the chronology of events that I

narrated just now, it is quite obvious that there have been a

lot  of  public  dialogues and discussions on  not  only  the

subject of the National Library, whether it can and should be

retained,  but  also  the  general discussion  on  the  whole

environment of the area.  In this particular case, there  was

a   very   specific  alternative  proposal.   This   specific

alternative proposal entailed a technical alternative, ie, to

realign  the  tunnel.   There was  also  a  general  proposal

regarding  the  ambience  of  the  area  as  it  pertains  to

retaining  the Park.  I have met  the proponent  of  the  new

plan,  Mr  Tay Kheng Soon, not once, but twice.  I wanted  to

understand what was the rationale for the proposal and why he

proposed  it this way. I also wanted, at the second  meeting,

to  evaluate the technical feasibility of it.  So this  is  a

very  specific proposal which has to be dealt with, responded

to and evaluated in a very specific manner.  There have been,

as the Member would agree, a lot of dialogues and discussions

on  the  generalities  of the proposal, whether  the  Library

should  be  retained, the historical merits of retaining  the

Library  as  opposed to the perceived lack  of  architectural

merit and so on and so forth.  I do not think there is a need

now  for us to reopen the debate again, especially when there

is  on  the  table  a very specific alternative  proposal.  I

thought  it  was proper for us to evaluate and  look  at  the

alternative proposal seriously, and we have done this.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

really good in architectural details.  But what I would  like

to ask the Minister is:  why is the National Library not kept

in  view of strong public sentiments and there are a  lot  of

debate and views on it?  Is a cost issue involved?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of

keeping  or  not  keeping the National Library  was  not  the

starting  point of the discussion.  As I recounted just  now,

when  the Masterplan for the area was done in 1988, the whole

question of upgrading and improving the ambience of the  area

and  turning  it into a civic and cultural district  was  the

objective  of  the  exercise.  The removal  of  the  National

Library,  at that time, was felt desirable because  it  would

open  up  the vista to the Fort Canning Hill.  That  was  the

starting  point  of the process. And at that time,  many  who

participated  in  the  dialogue  session,  from  reading  the

minutes  of  the discussions and newspaper reports,  did  not

feel  very  strongly about the library. In fact, many  agreed

with the idea of removing the library in order, as I said, to

completely  open up the whole area to show off  Fort  Canning

Hill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to that, there was also the question of how

we could improve the transportation network and this involved

the building of a tunnel.  In fact, this idea of a tunnel, of

an alternative road, came from the public dialogue itself.  I

believe   it  was  a  proposal  from  one  of  the   industry

participants in the dialogue. Studies were made  and  it  was

felt that that was the best alignment for the tunnel and that

also required the removal of the library.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the library had very strong architectural, historical

or  sentimental value, and if the Preservation  of  Monuments

Board  and the National Heritage Board had so classified  it,

we would have had  to look at alternative plans.  But in this

particular case, these authorities were consulted and it  was

the  general  consensus at that time that there was  no  such

strong  merit.   And  indeed, many architects  had  come  out

publicly  to  say that there is also no architectural  merit.

So  there  is  no question of us setting out to demolish  the

library  but,  in the overall scheme of things,  the  general

appearance and ambience of the area can obviously  be  better

enhanced if we are able to remove the library.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do acknowledge that there are many people who feel

very  strongly  about  the library  and  I  understand  their

feelings why

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>

they  feel this way.  I must admit that I too have very  fond

memories  of  the library and the area because I studied  for

six  years there. I was in St. Joseph's Institution from 1960

to 1966 and I remember spending many hours in the library and

in  the park.  But I also remember that there were many other

old buildings in the area.  There was the Catholic Centre,  a

Bakers'  Bakery next door, bookshops in the area and  a  bus-stop just outside the cathedral.  It was actually more than a

bus-stop, as SJI boys and RI boys would testify, because that

was  the  meeting place where you went there not to  catch  a

bus,  but  also  to catch the attention of somebody  special.

That  is  what  many  of  us who had  studied  in  that  area

remember.   The  library is part and parcel of  that  general

sentiment and ambience of the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think our memories are more than just of physical

buildings. They are also memories of the environment  of  the

area, the hustle and bustle of that area, the youthful energy

and  exuberance  of  the area.  Many of those  buildings  are

gone.   The Catholic Centre is gone, Bakers' Bakery is  gone,

the  bus-stop  is gone.  The park, which was the  old  school

field,  is now deserted and quiet most of the time. And  yet,

if  you ask me whether those memories are still there, I say,

"Yes.  They are still there."  To me, it is not just a matter

of  keeping  physical buildings.  It is also  trying  to  re-capture the spirit of the area, of the past. And when I  look

at  the plans for the area, with SMU coming into the area and

the  new  campus being located in the area, I feel tremendous

excitement  because I think this is going to bring  back  the

old  spirit of the area.  It is going to bring back life into

that  very important part of the city.  It is going  to  make

that area once again throb with life and energy.  That to  me

is  probably  as  important, if not, more so than  the  whole

debate  of keeping the park open or the need for us  to  keep

the library.  And this is how I would like to see people view

this new plan, to look at it in this perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met Mr Tay, I asked him why did he feel so

strongly  about  retaining the library  building  because  in

1988, he actually supported the removal of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>

National  Library building. He told me he was  involved  with

the  National  Museum  at that time and the  National  Museum

wanted  to  expand and one of the ways to expand  it  was  to

remove  the National Library.  I think he did not  feel  very

strongly about the National Library then.  I asked him,  "Why

have  you changed your mind?"  He said that he had discovered

new historical facts about the library and he referred me  to

one  of the poems which one of the young people sent to  him.

It  was  a poem by Edwin Thumboo.  He gave me a copy.  It  is

called  "The  National Library, Singapore" written  by  Edwin

Thumboo, and one of the lines in that poem said, "To preserve

the past, ensure the future."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Mr Tay, the library is more than just a library. It

is  an  icon, a symbol. If you knock it down, you would  have

knocked away the past.  If you preserve it, you preserve  the

past  and  therefore you ensure the future. After looking  at

his  plans and looking at the whole redevelopment of the area

with  SMU coming in, I thought to myself that perhaps another

interpretation of what Mr Edwin Thumboo wrote - "Preserve the

past,  ensure  the future" -  would be to actually  redevelop

the  area along the lines that have been proposed.  And  what

better way to preserve the past and ensure the future than to

bring  life back into the city, to bring back what was  there

in  the  past,  the atmosphere, the hustle  and  bustle,  the

throbbing  energy and vitality, thousands of  young  men  and

women  going about their work, going to class, hanging around

in  the  public  spaces in between classes.  I  thought  that

really  is  something which is in keeping with the sentiments

expressed  because, by doing so, you are not just  preserving

the  past,  but  you  do  so  in  a  way  which  provides  an

opportunity,  an  environment,  an  institution  which   will

benefit many generations of Singaporeans to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to Members of this House and to the

public,  please look at the plans when they are  produced  by

SMU  and the planners that have been commissioned by  SMU  to

redevelop  the  area, to bring life back into  the  area,  to

bring back the past and give us a wonderful new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>

institution  which  will  cater  to  future  generations   of

Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think many of us would

share  an interest in the Minister's exciting vision  of  the

street life.  May I move to the question about the principles

of  consultation. The Minister has said that there seem to be

more  public sentiments now for preserving the building  and,

secondly,  he has mentioned Mr Tay Kheng Soon, the architect,

wrote  directly to the Prime Minister's office.   May  I  ask

whether  there  are some general principles or  circumstances

that  his  Ministry  would look at when considering  possible

change of plans?  And secondly, may I ask whether there is  a

formal  or  regular route for any such suggestions  from  the

public rather than everyone writing to the Prime Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, consultation is not something that

we have suddenly discovered,  that we have seen the light and

now  we  have  public consultation. If we look at  the  track

record  of  the  Government, not just my Ministry  but  other

Ministries, there have been extensive public consultations in

many,  many  areas.  In this particular area  alone,  I  went

through in quite great detail the degree of consultation that

took  place more than 10 years ago, when the first  plan  for

the  Civic  District was mooted. It was not just a plan  that

was  put  up.  There  was  an extensive  series  of  dialogue

sessions  chaired by the Minister himself. And  arising  from

those dialogue sessions, there were a whole series of studies

that were done. It was only in 1992 that the final plans were

publicised and put into the public domain as a result of four

years   of   consultation  and  studies.   And   even   then,

thereafter,  when  SMU was given the mandate  to  locate  its

campus in that area, I am given to understand that there  was

also  a  series  of  dialogues that  were  carried  out  with

industry professionals, architects and members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a specific proposal came to us, we looked at it

very  seriously  because  the people  who  were  behind  this

proposal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>

were serious people.  They put up serious proposals, spent  a

lot  of  time,  money and effort in putting  them  up  and  I

thought   this  was  worth  considering.   There   are   many

suggestions that unfortunately are not so serious.  In  fact,

some of them are frivolous.  I think those do not deserve the

kind of attention that serious proposals deserve. This is the

process  that we have followed. Indeed, the Concept  Plan  is

going  to  be reviewed this year and next year.  My  Ministry

intends  to  hold  a series of discussions and  consultations

with  the  public on a broad basis and, after that,  we  will

take  in  the  people's  views and inputs  and  finalise  the

Concept Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not follow that every single idea or input that

comes  to  us  can or will be accepted.  I think  the  Member

himself would agree that it is not possible for us to do  so.

And  it is this very nature of consultation which gives  rise

to  this result. Some ideas we may take in and some ideas  we

may  not take in, or we may not take in any ideas at all. But

that  does  not,  in  any  way,  suggest  that  there  is  no

consultation.   If you ask me if there is a specific  formula

or  process, the answer is no. There are many channels  open.

First  of  all,  there  is  a  proactive  approach  that  the

Government  takes in terms of major plans and policies.  Then

there  is  the iterative process of feedback and  discussion,

back  and forth, and there are other channels such as private

communications.   My Ministry meets with the industry  bodies

on   a  regular  basis,  with  the  Singapore  Institute   of

Architects, with individual architects, engineers and so  on.

At  each and every meeting, there is opportunity for dialogue

and  discussion.   And this is the whole  purpose  of  having

these  meetings.   So,  there are  many  different  channels,

including  writing directly to the Prime Minister.   I  think

the  Prime  Minister receives many letters on this  and  many

other issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the right way to go about it? What is

consultation  all about?  I think it is about  giving  people

who  are affected by the plans which, in this case, means all

Singaporeans, a chance to have a say in the plans before they

are finalised. As a result, if we may have missed something,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>

if  we do,  hopefully this will be taken care of. At the very

least,  they would have had greater ownership of  the  plans.

And  I hope the Member would agree that this is what we  have

done in this particular case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs how

his  Ministry  assesses  registered groups  which  have  been

endorses the decision made by that government or carries  out

a separate assessment to come to an independent decision.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the

Government,  being  a  secular body, is  not  concerned  with

act  against  legally registered groups merely  because  they

have been labelled as "cults".  We are concerned only if  the

activities of a group contravene our laws, or are prejudicial

to  national security or interests, public peace, welfare  or

good  order  in  Singapore.  We would act  against  any  such

group, regardless of whether it has been branded a "cult"  by

other governments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Falungong group is

registered in Singapore as the Falun Buddha Society.  As long

as  they  do not, like I said, breach the law or do  anything

that  is  against public law and order, their activities  can

continue in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I understand that an

incident   happened  in  Sentosa,  where  Falungong   members

distributed some pamphlets and they were arrested.  I do  not

know  whether  this  is true.  Would the  Minister  of  State

clarify on what happened?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I am not aware of such an

incident.  Certainly, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>

general principle is that if anyone breaches the law, he will

be dealt with according to the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, what is Government's stand on

the practice of Falungong?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I have said, Falungong

they  do not do anything that is unlawful or against the law,

they will be allowed to continue.

<div align="center"><b>BROTHELS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a)

what  is  his Ministry's stance on brothels; and (b)  whether

the number of such establishments is on the rise.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, prostitution is not an offence under our laws.

However,  soliciting  is an offence under  the  Miscellaneous

Offences  Act.   Singapore  is not  the  only  country  where

prostitution  is  not  an  offence.   Many  other   developed

countries also adopt the same position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments around the world through the ages have tried

to  eradicate prostitution and brothels, but without success.

The  Ministry  of Home Affairs has thus adopted  a  pragmatic

approach  to  the  problem,  by  confining  prostitution   to

traditional red light areas, and through enforcement  against

prostitutes who solicit in public, and pimps who force  women

into prostitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of Police's enforcement actions, the level

of vice activities in Singapore is under control.

<div align="center"><b>LEARNING OF MALAY LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  if he will consider making  the  learning  of

Malay  Language mandatory but non-examinable in all  schools;

and  (b) whether he will encourage this at the primary school

level.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

the Government has adopted a bilingual language policy in our

schools.  English is the main medium of instruction.  English

is  our  common working language and is also the language  of

global  business, commerce and technology.  Each  student  is

also  required to learn his mother tongue to provide   direct

access  to  our cultural heritage in order to strengthen  our

values,  roots and sense of identity.  This bilingual  policy

is essential for our nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also encourage students who are linguistically

inclined  and able to cope to study a third language.   Malay

Language is one of the languages that these students can  opt

to  study as a third language.  They do so in their secondary

school  years  when they are more mature and can  decide  for

themselves what their interests are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning two languages from Primary One onwards is

already a challenge for our students.  Such views have  often

been  expressed  by  Members of this House  also.   From  our

experience,  going  beyond this to  learning  more  than  two

languages will be academically very challenging and demanding

for  the large majority of our students.  It is not realistic

and is too heavy a burden to the majority of the students  if

the learning of a third language is made mandatory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, schools, which have the resources and where

there  is a demand, may consider organising language  classes

as  an optional enrichment programme for their pupils who are

able to cope with the additional learning load.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, does the Minister mean

that  students can have an optional Malay language  class  at

primary school level?  He was talking about Malay language in

secondary  school.  I am asking for the introduction  of  the

language  at  primary level.  Can schools be  allowed  to  do

that?  And can they be allowed to recruit their own teachers?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I have said that schools, which

have  the resources and where there is a demand, can consider

organising   language  classes  as  an  optional   enrichment

programme  for  their pupils who are able to  cope  with  the

for primary school students, in my view.

<div align="center"><b>SELF-HELP GROUPS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Benchmarks)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  (a) whether there is a need to assist  self-help

groups  to set benchmarks and to increase their effectiveness

in  dealing with social issues; (b) how effective  they  have

been  in helping to deal with juvenile problems; and (c) what

are   the   statistics  of  juveniles   being   admitted   to

institutions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, the self-help groups have their own goals

which  they  set  for themselves, and these  goals  serve  as

benchmarks for improvements.  This is because each  self-help

group will know what is required for their own community, and

they know what is realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mendaki, for example, measures the impact of its

contribution  against  the  academic  performance  of   Malay

students  at PSLE and 'O' level examinations.  The  CDAC  has

committees  involving independent researchers, some  of  whom

are  from  the universities, and they regularly  review  each

programme  to ensure that they serve the needs of the  target

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for juvenile problems, they are complex and there are

various  causes.   Self-help  groups  cannot  address   these

problems  on  their  own.  Together  with  various  VWOs  and

Ministries,  these self-help groups tackle the problems  with

programmes  which  can  reach out to  both  the  parents  and

guardians  of these juveniles.  Mendaki, for example,  has  a

Youth Development Programme which serves both the students in

schools  and school leavers.  The CDAC has tuition programmes

which also aim to involve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>

and  interest the family in the student's progress.   And  by

addressing  the  educational needs of these  less  advantaged

members  of  the  communities and also concentrating  on  the

training  of  the workers, the self-help groups intervene  at

the  level  where  intervention can  have  the  earliest  and

greatest impact, ie, upstream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the number of juveniles being admitted to

institutions, the Singapore Boys' Home and  Toa Payoh  Girls'

Home have an average of 220 admissions per year, from 1997 to

1999.   These numbers have remained fairly constant over  the

years.  The number of admissions of juvenile delinquents  and

those  beyond  parental control (BPC cases) to  the  juvenile

institutions run by the voluntary welfare organisations  has,

in  fact,  decreased from 170 in 1997 to 97 in  1999.   These

institutions  include Gracehaven, Pertapis Centre  for  Women

and  Girls, Muhammadiyah Welfare Home and Pertapis Children's

Home.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, the self-help groups were originally

set  up  to  assist the youths who were having problems  with

their  studies.  What is the scope of expanding the self-help

groups  into  umbrella bodies to reach out further  into  the

communities?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, indeed, they have been doing

these  programmes incrementally.  Mendaki, for  example,  has

gone  into  the FSC business, as it were, together with  some

other  institutional  members.  So far,  I  think  they  have

opened  two family service centres.  In other words, they  do

go  into  these areas too.  As I have said, the main  concern

for  Mendaki,  the  CDAC and for the rest  of  the  self-help

groups  is  the  educational performance of the  communities.

And  they  hope  to  improve  the respective  communities  by

addressing the problems upstream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government  for the financial year 1st April,  2000  to  31st

March, 2001.".  -  [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.12 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this   year's  Government  Budget  is  underpinned   by   the

remarkable recovery of the Singapore economy.  We are glad to

hear  from  the  Finance Minister that  the  Asian  financial

crisis is largely behind us.  Everyone could heave a sigh  of

relief.  Because it was not so long ago that during the  off-Budget  measures announced in June 1998, that  we  were  very

concerned about a protracted U-shaped or, as the Deputy Prime

Minister  said,  W-shaped, and a drawn out regional  economic

crisis  that could last 2-4 years.  The sufferings, not  just

to  us, but also to the people in our neighbouring countries,

would be unthinkable.  Anyhow, we are all extremely glad that

against  all  expectations, Singapore achieved a dramatic  V-shaped recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more remarkable is the fact that the

Government  FY99 Budget is expected to attain  a  surplus  of

$3.2  billion,  as  against  an originally  estimated  budget

deficit  of  $5.1 billion.  This is a gigantic turnaround  of

$8.3 billion.  While on the one hand, we wish to commend  the

Government, and the Finance Minister in particular,  for this

very  positive  turnaround, on the other  hand,  we  wish  to

better  understand two things.  One is the  reason  for  this

discrepancy for the huge budgetary miscalculation, and  hence

whether  the  budget  induced belt-tightening  measures  were

unnecessary  pains  for the people and the  local  companies.

The   second  point  is  whether,  after  achieving  such   a

remarkable  positive budget surplus, more could  be  done  to

reward the people and companies who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>

have rallied so solidly behind the Government at the time  of

the economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that for this year's Budget, the press had

been  hard  put to pin a label or tag for this  Budget.   The

Straits  Times  has been kind in calling it a "something  for

everyone" budget.  But have not all past years' budgets  been

something  for  everyone?  I think the best  description  for

this  year's Budget is that it is an e-Budget.  It is  an  e-Budget  not  just because of its strong biasness  towards  e-commerce,  but  it also caters to the elderly,  entrepreneurs

and ESOP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I call it an e-Budget because it is an

economical Budget, ie, a Budget that is economical in  giving

away just about enough, without being too extravagant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has achieved a sterling performance

in  the  management of the economy and the  fast  turnaround.

The fact that we could achieve a budget surplus in FY99 as we

were   barely   emerging  from  the   crisis   is   extremely

commendable, as I said earlier.  However, for this year, I am

disappointed  that  with  such a good  surplus,  the  Finance

Minister  has  decided to so quickly roll  back  the  set  of

economic recovery measures, and has not given enough  goodies

to   reward  the  people  for  suffering  through  the   belt

tightening   situation.   Essentially,  I   feel   that   the

Government  could  have retained the  bulk  of  the  economic

recovery measures for another year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that during the off-Budget debate in June 1998,

we had likened the Finance Minister, our good Doctor Hu, to a

medical  doctor  who was dispensing medication  to  the  sick

patient  (the Singapore economy) which was suffering  from  a

serious  bout  of  flu.   The  medications  were  the  budget

recovery  measures.   It seems to me now  that  just  as  the

patient  is  beginning to show signs of  recovery,  the  good

doctor has decided to roll back the medications.  Has he  cut

back  on the salubrious good doses of antibiotics and  pills?

Is this wise?  Are we pulling back too quickly?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern is that the patient (which

is  the Singapore economy) is just beginning to enjoy a sharp

and  good  recovery, and then the course of medical treatment

is  quickly cut back. Would the recovery spatter?  Should  we

be  consistent in going through the full course  of  recovery

measures,  which are originally meant to be over  two  years?

In  fact,  why not add more vitamins and beneficial herbs  to

further  strengthen the patient, and be doubly sure  that  he

becomes  strong and robust, and can run even faster ahead  in

the race?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in looking at the package of recovery Budget

measures  announced,  I feel that the Government  should  not

have removed the 10% corporate tax rebate for companies.  The

10%  savings  on  corporate tax would  be  very  helpful  for

companies  to  further  fund their capital  expenditures  for

automation, IT spending, streamlining and restructuring.   To

reward  the  individuals  in  accepting  the  belt-tightening

measures,  I would have thought that they should be  rewarded

by  keeping  the 10% personal income tax rebate,  instead  of

cutting down to 5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is apt to call this Budget an e-Budget. As we

move  into  the  new millennium, there is a need  to  prepare

Singapore  to  participate  more  deeply  in  the  New  World

Economic  structure.  The world is changing so fast that  the

recovery,  and a sustained growth for that matter, cannot  be

taken for granted.  The point is that with the advent of  new

technologies, telecommunications and the World Wide  Web,  or

commonly  called  the  Internet, the world  is  changing  and

coming together at a very fast pace.  The essence is to be e-relevant,  and  not become irrelevant.  If Singapore  becomes

irrelevant in the new world order, we will surely fall by the

wayside and wither.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should be made to understand that in the

new world order, we are no longer competing amongst ourselves

in  Singapore,  or  just against our neighbouring  countries.

Because of technological and communication advances,  we  are

forced  now  to compete with the best in the  world.   If  we

cannot compete against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>

the  best  in  the  world,  we will become  irrelevant.   For

example, the DBS Bank is no longer competing with other local

banks, but against MayBank, HSBC, BNP and Citigroup and other

premium  banks in the world.  Our NOL and SIA have to compete

worldwide.  Even our small traders and retailers are not just

competing against other local retailers and traders, but have

to  face  up  against  the retailers  and  traders  in  other

countries.   Ultimately,  in fact,  they  will  be  competing

against the e-commerce virtual companies, like Amazon.com and

e-Bay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, people choose not only which is the best and

cheapest retail store to shop, but also which is the best and

cheapest  country to shop.  As a country, we have to  compete

against other countries as the best place for our people  and

foreign  professionals  to  live and  raise  their  children.

People  also  have  many choices as to where  to  park  their

money.    Singapore,   because  of  our   inherent   domestic

constraints,  has lost its gloss as the best place  to  shop.

We  also cannot lay claim to be the best place to live.   But

we  must  continue to be a place where investors are prepared

to  put their money, and local and foreign professionals find

conducive to work in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of the New World Economy, Singapore

and Singaporeans have to stay relevant.  The Budget therefore

has  to  address  two  key imperatives.   One  is  to  devote

sufficient  funds,  effort and attention to  build  Singapore

into  an  advanced knowledge-based economy that  can  compete

with  the  rest of the world, and the second is how to  mould

and build up our local people and capabilities which, infused

with the right measure of foreign abilities, would be able to

measure  up  against the best in the world.   Our  Government

leaders,  including  PM, SM, DPM and  other  Ministers,  have

spoken   recently  in  their  speeches  to  embrace  IT,   be

enterprising,  be  risk  taking and  facing  up  to  the  new

challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On account of the fact that we need to compete globally,

I  am  disappointed that the Budget measures  fall  short  of

giving a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>

shot  in  the arm for our companies and individuals  to  help

them to prepare and propel them into the IT age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and reputed to be

the richest man in the world, in his book called Business@the

speed  of  Thought, said that in the digital technology  age,

business  in  the years 2000s will depend on velocity.   That

is,  success depends on how quickly businesses are conducted.

Thus, he means business is at the speed of thought, which  is

at  the speed of light.  Speed itself is a strategy.  A  good

example  is  the recent saga of the sale of Cable &  Wireless

Hong  Kong  Telecom (HKT).  Among the many factors, including

political, I feel that Pacific Century CyberWorks has won the

deal because of the speed with which they could react to  the

news  that  this company is available for sale and that  they

could  make  decisions very fast.  Hence, speed is important.

Anyway,  let us leave this saga of the Cable & Wireless  Hong

Kong Telecom to another avenue for debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying earlier, I feel that the Government

Budget could have been bolder, speedier and more generous  to

help propel Singapore into the IT age.  At the corporate  and

individual  levels,  the Budget could  have  been  bolder  in

giving encouragement and incentives to those who dare to take

risks.  If the risk-takers who started ventures failed,  they

could be encouraged to start again.  For those who succeeded,

they should be richly rewarded.  Moreover, in the process  of

carrying out their ventures, we should review and ensure that

the  Government  agencies  and Government  regulators  should

facilitate rather than put obstacles in their paths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more companies to embrace IT technologies

and  invest in new ventures, I would like to suggest that the

Finance Minister could look into the following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, group offsetting of operating losses. The

Government  has  been hesitant to allow group  offsetting  of

subsidiary  losses  because of the concern  over  abuses  and

leakages.  This is understandable.  However, I feel  that  in

the case of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>

genuine  desire to venture into a new business,  the  company

which  is  taking a huge risk can be allowed to offset  their

share  of  the losses in the subsidiary ventures against  the

profits in the other main businesses.  If operating losses of

new ventures can be allowed, a company's risk adversity would

be  reduced.  If the Government is concerned about  giving  a

blanket  group  offsetting approval,  then  approval  can  be

granted  on  a  selective industry basis.  For example,  such

group offsetting could be considered for approved investments

in IT and e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, give pioneer status for start-up ventures. As

in  the  early  years  of  Singapore's economic  development,

pioneer status was given liberally to new companies so as  to

stimulate industrial development.  I think the same  approach

can  be  taken  for start-up companies in the new  pioneering

fields  such as IT and e-commerce.  They are pioneers  indeed

in  an  unknown and fast moving environment of the IT and  e-space.  They have to move at the speed of thought and compete

against the best in the world, such as their counterparts  in

the  Silicon  Valley in the USA, or other  similar  start-ups

that  are  sprouting  in other parts of the  world,  such  as

Canada, Europe, India and even China.  I wish to suggest that

these  start-up companies in Singapore can be given  5  years

pioneer tax-free status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above two incentives are meant to work hand in hand

to  encourage a proliferation of start-up companies and build

up a sizeable pool of financial backers.  Many of these start-ups,  perhaps  as high as 90%, will not make  money  or  even

survive  to  enjoy  their first 5 years of  tax-free  status.

However, for those technopreneurs and their financial backers

who  succeed,  they will be hugely rewarded.   And  Singapore

will  benefit,  because we have managed, in the  process,  to

become e-relevant, instead of irrelevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this widespread, I would call it,

"broadband"approach is better than a selective guarded "arrow

band" approach,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>

because  of  the  uncertainty of  technological  changes  and

velocity  of  such changes.  We do not know  for  sure  which

companies,  whether  a  large GLC or a small  start-up,  will

have  the  ideas,  responsiveness,  drive  or  creativity  to

succeed.  Therefore, by encouraging as many as possible start-up  companies  to  be  formed,  and  give  them  the  correct

incentives  and  environment, hopefully, some  of  them  will

succeed.  Even those who have failed are not lost, since  the

entire  process  will   help  propagate  an  environment   in

Singapore  of  technopreneurship and risk  taking,  something

which  both  our  PM  and SM have said is sorely  lacking  in

Singapore. For those who succeed, they will become  our  hero

stories.  In Singapore, we are also in dire shortage of  home

grown  success stories.  The only often-quoted one is Mr  Sim

Wong Hoo of Creative Technology.  I feel we need more of such

success  stories,  as they are plentiful  in  the  USA,  like

Stephen  Case  of AOL, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com and  Lawrence

Ellison of Oracles, or Masayoshi Son of Softbank in Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is tax relief or double taxation allowances

for  IT  expenditures.  As a move to encourage  companies  to

adopt  IT  systems and re-engineering of their businesses,  I

would  like  to  propose that the Finance  Minister  consider

giving tax reliefs or double taxation allowance for companies

which want to spend money to purchase IT equipment that  will

improve  their  productivity or efficiency.   This  incentive

will be particularly important to SMEs which are usually  not

IT oriented, and do not have the in-house technical expertise

to help them push into the IT environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, personal income tax reliefs for purchase of

computers.   As I said earlier, I feel strongly that  as  the

Government  has  achieved  a  substantial  surplus  of   $3.2

billion,  it  could have been more generous in rewarding  the

citizens.   Of course, the $250 CPF top-up payment  into  the

individual's CPF account is a very appreciated  gesture.   In

addition,  I  would  like  to  propose  that  the  Government

consider giving a tax relief of, say, perhaps $500 a year  to

all citizens who purchase a personal computer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective is to encourage all citizens, whether

young  or  old, to purchase a personal computer (PC).   I  am

very  pleased to read about Government's intention to  commit

$25 million over three years to provide used PCs to the lower

income group, as announced by Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, the Minister

for  Communications  and Information Technology,  last  week.

However,  I think that the used PCs scheme may not be  enough

to  reach all the households in the lower income group.  Some

people  may  not be interested in using used PCs.   They  may

think  that  it is too slow or it may not have  the  advanced

features  to excite them.  My proposal, which is to  give  an

incentive of personal income tax relief to purchase new  PCs,

will serve as a meaningful gesture and a supplementary scheme

to  this  MCIT scheme.  This will be particularly  meaningful

to  the  middle and lower income groups to encourage  working

adults  to  purchase PCs, whether for use at home or  in  the

office.  For those who are not paying personal income tax, an

alternative  scheme  can  be  devised,  whether   the   local

constituency's grassroots organisations, such as the Citizens

Consultative Committees (CCCs) can become the channel through

which the Government can give out a grant of, say, $200  each

to encourage the lower income groups to buy PCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to propose that, so as to

promote   a  wider  spread  of  IT  and  computer  education,

especially  for  the adult or older population,  the  Finance

Minister encourage adults to attend self-improvement computer

courses.   Again, personal income tax relief  of,  say,  $500

each   can  be  given  for  attendance  at  computer  courses

conducted by approved educational companies.  Similarly,  for

those  people  of  the  lower income group  who  do  not  pay

personal  income  tax,  grants can  be  given  to  designated

grassroots organisations such as the CCCs to conduct computer

courses,  where  the  lower  income  persons  can  attend  at

discounted rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is suggested that Government funds be used to

foster  knowledge  technology,  e-commerce  talent  pool  and

skills,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>

and  prepare our economy for the global stage, we  must  also

devote  money, effort and attention to build and enhance  our

local capabilities.  Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am referring to

how to assist our SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wish to promote a pool of companies and

individuals to compete against the best in the world, we must

not  forget  that  there  is the main  body  of  the  working

population  and the SMEs which employ them who need  help  to

change  and  adapt to the new economy.  These  SMEs  need  to

understand the technological changes in the market place, how

they can restructure or adapt, and how their owners, managers

and   employees  can  be  trained  or  retrained  to   remain

employable.  This is how to remain e-relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, some sectors of the economy

are  not  fully  out  of the woods yet.  These  sectors  will

continue  to need assistance.  They are the retail,  tourism,

construction and trade sectors.  They may think some  of  the

budgetary measures could mean that their recovery process may

slow  down  or  take longer.  I would like to appeal  to  the

Minister to look into industry specific measures that can  be

implemented  to  continue to assist these  sectors  that  are

lagging  behind in the recovery.  This could be  achieved  by

the  Finance  as  well  as the Trade and Industry  Ministries

calling  for separate meetings with representatives of  these

sectors, so that their problems can be studied in depth,  and

appropriate assistance given when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the local small and medium enterprises (SMEs)

may  be  slow in achieving a quick recovery because they  are

beset  with  multifarious problems, such as heavy  overheads,

labour and managerial insufficiency, low productivity, rising

retail  and  labour costs and structural changes.  Therefore,

better  liaison  and consultation between the Government  and

the  SMEs  will give rise to effective targeted  measures  to

assist them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by urging the

Minister for Finance to take a more urgent, bolder and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>

generous  approach  to  prepare Singaporeans  and  the  local

companies to meet the challenges of the new economy.  As  the

Finance  Minister has said in the conclusion of his  Budget's

speech:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to face up to the challenges of a globalised

economic  system and keep pace with changes . .  We  need  to

accelerate the pace of economic restructuring. ."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the good Finance Minister, do

not  hold back your pen, write in the benefits and incentives

now, so that we can be better placed to meet the velocity  of

changes ahead.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just

like  Mr  Leong  before me, I too find the  turnaround  of  a

projected  budget deficit of close to $5.1  billion  in  FY99

into  an  actual budget surplus of $3.1 billion, a  swing  of

$8.3  billion, to be a great surprise.  Like a magician,  the

Minister has managed to pull the proverbial rabbit out of his

hat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, maintaining budget surplus is a good

thing.  On the other hand, perhaps we should also revisit the

circumstances  under which FY99 budget was  presented.   Time

was bad, prospect was gloomy.  Economy was in recession.   As

we  all learned in our first course in economics, the economy

needed  a  shot  in  the arm from the Government's  spending.

FY99  budget  was supposed to do just that.   The  Government

planned  to  maintain  its  spending  even  though  it  meant

incurring  a deficit.  However, by the close of the financial

year, the Government's cup overflowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that in arriving at this budget surplus,

besides higher than expected revenue, the Government actually

incurred  $3.4  billion  less  development  spending   partly

because  of  better prices and partly also  because  of  some

lower   priority  projects  being  rescheduled.   Development

expenditure for FY99 stands at 6.9% of GDP, and that is lower

than  8.7%  in FY98.  The question is why should  some  lower

priority projects be rescheduled?  Were there good reasons to

do so?  Is there a change of heart of the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>

from  trying to extend a helping hand to the economy  into  a

hands-off stance?  Basically, in my mind, Sir, if prices were

good,  should  the Government not let out more  contracts  to

gain  better value for money?  Should we not pump  prime  the

economy  a  little bit more by keeping those  lower  priority

projects in the pipeline?  It seems that some of these  lower

priority  projects  might include something  like  pedestrian

bridges, road widening and other civil engineering work  that

would  be  needed  sooner or later.  In my own  ward,  I  was

informed  by the authority that a pedestrian overhead  bridge

originally slated for completion in September 1999  would  be

done.  Yet even at this very moment, there is no sign of  any

activity.  Could this particular project be a victim  of  one

of those lower priority projects?  If so, are there many more

such  similar  projects?  As we all  know,  the  recovery  is

actually spotty.  So would the construction industry  not  be

given  a boost if these lower priority projects were actually

let as scheduled?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we are all aware that the Government has

cut  back  on  MUP  and  IUP in HDB estates  because  of  the

projected  budget  deficit.   As the  economy  turned  around

towards  the  middle  of  the last  fiscal  year,  could  the

Minister  not be more generous by allocating more money  back

to HDB so that such upgrading programmes could be maintained?

I feel that the Minister has been overly conservative in this

particular respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking at FY2000, it is noteworthy

that  development expenditure has increased to $12.9 billion,

an  increase  of $2.25 billion.  But by doing so,  it  merely

brings  us  back to the same level of development expenditure

as  in  FY98.   Part  of this increased expenditure  probably

includes  those lower priority projects I mentioned  earlier.

It is also pertinent to note that as a percentage of GDP, the

new  development expenditure stands at 7.8% and while  it  is

higher  than 6.9% in FY99 it is actually lower than  8.7%  in

FY98.   Development  expenditure is an  investment  into  our

future.   I  would like to see development expenditure  being

maintained at a higher level compared to what is provided  in

FY2000.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strikes me as unusual in this Budget is that close

to  $1  billion has been set aside for new priority  projects

that  may  materialise in FY2000.  This is a very interesting

sentence  in  the  Budget Statement, since  most  development

expenditures would require careful planning, and it is unlike

this  Government  to  allocate such a large  amount  for  new

priority  projects that may come about within a short  period

of  12  months.   So my question is: Does the  Minister  have

something  up  his  sleeves?  Is he saving some  goodies  for

Singaporeans?  If so, would he be kind enough  to  drop  some

hints?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note this Budget provides a significant

increase  for  Education,  historically  the  second  largest

allocation  after  Defence.  There is  a  15.3%  increase  in

Operating  Expenditure  and  21.7%  increase  in  Development

Expenditure.   This reflects the importance  this  Government

attaches to education of our children, in particular for  the

coming  knowledge-based economy.  I hope this is not a  once-off  increase  but  part  of a long-term  investment  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now comment on the various tax

changes in this Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before doing so, allow me to report that the Feedback

Unit  had  conducted  a series of dialogue  sessions  in  the

middle  of this January with the business community  and  the

general public as a prelude to the Budget.  The Feedback Unit

moved  the dialogue session ahead of the Budget so  that  the

inputs  of  the  participants  could  be  considered  in  the

preparation  of  the Budget.  I chaired the English  language

session which was held on 17th January 2000.  Participants of

the  session for the business community were drawn  from  the

various  chambers of commerce, small and medium  enterprises,

as  well as selected corporations.  The wish list is  a  long

one and it is included in the report of the meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general consensus of the business community was that

the  recession  is  by  and  large  over.   Nonetheless,  the

recovery  is  spotty with some sectors, such as construction,

retail,   still   reeling   from   the   economic   downturn.

Furthermore, many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>

companies have suffered during the recession and are still in

the  process  of  recuperation.  The  participants  generally

would  like  the  Government to maintain  the  various  cost-cutting  measures implemented by the Government  for  another

year.   Doing  so will allow most companies to restore  their

health to deal with the challenges of the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tax-deductible savings for retirement, one

participant,  noting that expatriates are exempted  from  the

CPF   scheme,  suggested  that  a  tax-deductible  individual

retirement saving scheme be established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On saving for retirement, it was noted that most

taxpayers  do  not  enjoy tax deduction for  their  insurance

premium   payments  as  their  CPF  payments   exceeded   the

eligibility condition for deduction.  Perhaps additional  tax

allowances could be given to insurance premiums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, Sir, these appeals found a sympathetic ear

with  the  Minister.  He has maintained  a  number  of  cost-cutting  measures,  albeit at a lower level.   For  instance,

property tax rebate is being extended for another year  at  a

lower rate of 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate tax rate will be lowered to 25.5% from 26% but

only  from  Year of Assessment 2001.  With the withdrawal  of

10%  corporate  tax rebate for this year, Year of  Assessment

2000,  the corporate tax rate effectively will return to  26%

from  23.4%,  and then later down to 25.5%.  The question  is

why  should  we subject the businesses to this  variation  of

corporate tax payable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Minister is fully aware of "tax haven"

provision in many developed countries that would be triggered

against  a host country when its corporate tax rate drops  to

25%  or below.  As such, the use of lower corporate tax  rate

to   make   Singapore  more  attractive  for   multi-national

companies  has its limitations.  For instance,  in  Japan,  I

believe that the "tax haven" trigger is exactly at 25%.   So,

after  this rate has been lowered to 25.5%, there  is  really

not much leeway left

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>

for  the  Minister to play with.  I am sure the Minister  has

been   exploring  other  fiscal  measures  to   enhance   the

attractiveness  of  Singapore to foreign  investors.   So  it

would  be  useful  if he could elaborate  on  some  of  these

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the half step in this fiscal year, it is clear

that  the  Government is preparing the ground for a  complete

withdrawal  of  all  the  cost-cutting  measures  implemented

earlier.   So I think Singapore business leaders and  workers

are well-advised to be prepared mentally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the personal income tax measures, most Singaporean

taxpayers express disappointment that the personal income tax

rate has not been adjusted this round.  Furthermore, the once-off 10% rebate is also withdrawn altogether.  As a trade-off,

the Minister announces a few measures that while laudable, do

not bring about much immediate benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has accepted the

recommendation  of  the Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  the

Ageing  Population  to  implement  a  tax-deferred  voluntary

saving  scheme next year.  This is a good idea to  complement

the  CPF  scheme for those who can afford it.   However,  for

most  Singaporeans who are already putting away 30% of  their

income into CPF, I doubt many would be able to take advantage

of  this  scheme.  Furthermore, for those who are  likely  to

participate, they are either high-income earners close to the

age  of  retirement or young unmarried singles  without  many

obligations.   Although the details of the scheme  are  still

being worked on, I would like to ask the Minister whether the

saving in this SRS could only be withdrawn after the official

retirement age, as at today at 55, or otherwise determined by

the  Government.  Would he consider not imposing a retirement

age at all in this SRS, so that the individuals who put money

in  this SRS could decide as and when to withdraw the saving?

I  think  this  flexibility is useful and important,  and  it

would  encourage  the  individual to  save  for  rainy  days,

periods of unemployment,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>

dire needs, or for those who are prepared to go back to study

by taking time off from working.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government is agreeable to allow foreigners

working  in  Singapore to participate in this SRS,  it  would

have  addressed the concern raised by expatriates during  the

feedback sessions I mentioned earlier.  It will overcome some

of   their  concerns  regarding  how  they  would  save   for

retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the extension of the tax

relief  scheme  for  CPF cash top-up for grandparents.   This

step  is  laudable but, again, I wonder what kind  of  impact

this   would  have.   First  of  all,  most  taxpayers   with

grandparents are likely to be young, below 30 years old,  and

furthermore their parents are still likely to be very  active

in  their  working life; in fact, in the most  productive  of

their  working  life,  and would be  able  to  support  their

grandparents.   These  young  taxpayers  are  probably  still

establishing  themselves in the world and not  many  of  them

would  be  able  to contribute up to $6,000 a year  to  fully

benefit  from this scheme.  Perhaps, the Minister can  inform

the  House  how many taxpayers could take advantage  of  this

particular  scheme  and therefore achieve  his  objective  to

enhance "inter-generation ties".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not be more beneficial if the Minister could

review  the CPF cash top-up scheme for parents, but  not  for

grandparents?  There are many taxpayers today who  have  made

use  of this scheme to continue to support their parents  and

have  reached  the limit of the tax relief  for  cash  top-up

because  there is a provision for the Minimum Sum  limit.   I

would  urge the Minister to review the limit of this  Minimum

Sum  so  that  those who have already reached the  limit  can

continue  to enjoy tax relief when they continue  to  support

their  parents.  The Minister is aware that the  Minimum  Sum

has  actually been increased from $30,000 to $60,000 over the

years.   Depending  on their age, different  senior  citizens

today  would  have different top-up limits.  The  older  ones

would be entitled to $30,000 and the younger ones would  then

be entitled to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>

$60,000.   As  we  all know, the older the  person  the  more

expenses  he would incur.  So the Minister would  find  great

support  among  Singaporeans  if  he  could,  in  the   first

instance, revise all the top-up limits to $60,000 so that all

those  who  have  reached  their existing  caps  today  could

continue  to  obtain  tax relief for their  filial  sons  and

daughters who contribute to their support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would urge the Minister to increase the

annual contribution limit from $6,000 to a higher number.   I

surmise  the  total  revenue loss if we undertake  all  these

measures  would be a small number and doing  so  would  go  a

longer way towards promoting filial piety and the concept  of

extended families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another tax incentive that I would like to see in the

Budget  but  did not get a nod from the Minister is  the  tax

incentives  for  the third and fourth child.  Currently,  the

incentive is set at $10,000.  But this limit was set close to

10  years ago.  It is time to review the amount and  I  would

like  to urge the Minister to consider increasing this amount

to encourage larger families for those who can afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has gone through a recession

and  came through unscathed.  Our coffers are in great shape.

I  would  like  to  thank the Minister  for  his  outstanding

contributions  as Minister for Finance during the  period  of

his  term  of office and for his stewardship of the  Ministry

during  this crisis.  Despite his recent health problems,  he

has   continued  to  serve  Singapore  selflessly.    Indeed,

Singaporeans are indebted to him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  this  year we have the good fortune to  debate  our

Budget  on  a happier note.  Our economy has got out  of  the

difficulties brought about by the regional financial  crisis.

A friend of mine has drawn an analogy of the ups and downs of

our  economy.  He said that each time we entered the Year  of

the  Tiger,  our  economy would face  difficulty.   From  the

financial crisis in 1998, the recession in 1986 and  the  oil

crisis in 1974, it seemed to have formed a pattern or a  rule

of some sort.  Fortunately, after the Tiger Year, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>

would be able to jump up again like a rabbit, followed by the

vitality  of  the  Year of the Dragon and the  dance  of  the

golden snake.  The prospects seem bright again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may well be a great coincidence. In reality,

we  cannot  blindly  believe in this kind  of  rule  and  our

economic  development cannot  be taken for granted.   We  are

able  to  go  through the difficulties because of the  strong

tripartism  that  we practise in Singapore.   When  the  time

becomes  better, we should spare no efforts in enhancing  the

strong partnership and nurture our togetherness as a nation - one  country,  one  people,  one Singapore.   Our  tripartite

partners  have  to constantly work closely to strengthen  our

competitiveness so as to expand our economic  pie.   In  this

way, we would be able to safeguard our workers' jobs and also

help to improve their quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another main reason that Singapore was

able  to  recover  so  quickly is Singaporeans'  ability  and

willingness  to  see the big picture and  accept  the  bitter

medicine to help nurse our economy to health.  This  kind  of

selflessness helps us to recover quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the economic crisis, many companies closed down

and thousands of workers were retrenched.  For those who were

able to keep their employment, many had to accept wage freeze

or  wage  cut  to help the companies tide over the  difficult

times.   We should therefore thank all the workers for  their

understanding and sacrifices.  I am glad that the  Government

has decided to top-up $250 in each worker's CPF account.   It

is  certainly a good gesture to reward our workers  for   the

sacrifices  they had made.  This will also help to strengthen

the  trust  in  our  leaders.  I  hope  the  Government  will

consider  the  suggestion that such CPF top-ups  for  workers

should continue whenever there is a good budget surplus until

the CPF cut is fully restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to the majority of our rank-and-file workers

who  earn  a basic salary of less than $2,000 per month,  the

sum  of $250  is equivalent to about 2% of the employer's CPF

contribution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very glad that the ordinary Singaporeans are

not   left  out  in  this  year's  Budget.  The  service  and

conservancy  charges, utilities and rental  rebates  for  HDB

residents amount  to $154 million.  If we take the  CPF  top-up,   the  contributions  to  Medifund  and  Eldercare  Fund,

individual income tax relief and so on, the total giveaway is

more  than $1 billion.  This is a glowing testimony that ours

is a caring Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our economic recovery is not exactly an even

one.   Some sectors of our economy are not quite out  of  the

woods.  Quite  a  lot of workers are not free  from  worries.

They  will  be  happier if the once-off personal  income  tax

rebate could remain at 10% and everybody will be happy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the additional tax relief for the

maintenance of parents.  It is a good incentive.  But I  hope

the Government would consider higher tax relief for those who

look  after their parents by making an effort to stay  nearby

or  in  the  same HDB estate with their aged  parents.   Such

people should be given higher tax reliefs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are moving in this fast-paced

competitive  world,  and as the Chinese  saying  goes:  "Know

yourself,  know your enemy and you will fight a  100  battles

and  win  them  all."   We must know our weaknesses  and  our

strengths.   I  also  recall reading an article  by  IDEA  of

London suggesting a looser monetary policy, keeping our wages

at  a  competitive  level and containing our  industrial  and

commercial property prices as the key strategy that we should

consider.   I agree with these suggestions.  As  far  as  our

wages  are  concerned,  we  have taken  steps  to  make  them

competitive.   It  is  only proper that  we  also  align  our

industrial and commercial property prices to make  them  even

more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour movement, our first priority is the well-being of our workers. We must see to it that they have jobs.

When we negotiate wage increases, we always take into account

two factors: (1) productivity

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>

gains;   (2)  the ability to pay by the company.   But  wages

form  only part of the overall business costs, and, in  fact,

only  a  small  part.  It would also be good if the  non-wage

costs, particularly Government charges, could be held down so

that   companies  can  continue  to  operate  profitably   in

Singapore  and our workers will have good jobs.  It  is  only

then  that  we would be able to create a good environment  of

doing business for the companies and our workers will be able

to have better jobs and enjoy higher standard of living.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, the Budget for the Year 2000

which has been recently presented is a realistic Budget.   We

are  indeed  pleased  to see that we  are  getting  into  the

economic growth again and this is encouraging.  I commend the

Government  for  taking various measures  to  deal  with  the

economic crisis we faced earlier and the Finance Minister for

his good financial management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy to persuade him to do more than what

he  has  set  aside for the Budget.  I have tried hard  every

year to try and tug at his heartstrings to get more funds  to

be  released, but each year I have great difficulty.  I  hope

that this year, with the new millennium, he would be able  to

hear  out and accede to some of the requests that I would  be

putting up.  I hope that he will be able to see what  he  can

do more for the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few suggestions and observations to make

relating  to  the  Budget.   With the  restructuring  of  our

economy,  we  expect  more  labour  intensive  industries  to

relocate  and  this will displace our older workers  who  are

middle aged.  I think we know some of their problems.  But  I

feel  that  we  need to monitor and see the  impact  of  this

changing economy in terms of their employability and how they

are  likely  to be affected.  They will face difficulties  in

finding  the same type of job and salary.  They will be  less

employable  because they do not have the skills to  fit  into

the  changing  job  requirements.  The  employers  will  take

advantage to employ cheaper semi-skilled and skilled  foreign

workers and this compounds the problem

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>

further  as  they  tend  to pay these  foreign  workers  less

salaries  and, to some extent, the Minister for  Manpower  is

trying  to  ensure that we have a foreign worker  levy.   But

somehow I think they will find a way out to depress the wages

further.   Sir, there is a danger of structural  unemployment

amongst older unskilled workers.  It will be painful for them

as  they have teenage children to support, in terms of  their

education and other needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I draw the attention of the Minister for

Finance   that   funds  allocated  to  skills  training   are

inadequate to train more than one third of our unskilled  and

semi-skilled  workforce.  In order to  make  a  good  impact,

further  tax rebates to encourage employers to upgrade  their

workers  should  be considered.  More worker  training  funds

should be allocated to ITE so that it can work with NTUC  and

the  Ministry  of Manpower to implement a more  comprehensive

plan   for   older   worker   training   to   enhance   their

employability.  This is going to be a critical  problem  that

we  will  face in the next five to 10 years, especially  when

the  economy  is being restructured and we are  moving  to  a

knowledge-based  economy.  This has got a tremendous  impact.

I  feel there is every reason for the Ministry of Finance  to

allocate more funds to the Ministry of Manpower, trade unions

and  other  sectors which can help to prepare the workers  to

meet  the challenges ahead.  And unless and until we do this,

there  is no point saying that the workers need to be trained

and  we  need to prepare them for the KBE economy.  All  this

remains  rhetoric unless we really translate them  into  real

action and there is indeed an urgent need for the Ministry of

Finance to allocate the funds because there is a surplus  and

we can do more for this group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that I would like to raise is that

Singaporeans are appreciative of the CPF top-up  of  $250  in

their  ordinary  accounts. This is indeed  a  bonus  for  the

working   class  Singaporeans  and  I  must  say  that   many

governments  cannot afford to do this. This is only  possible

because we have done well and the Singapore Government, trade

unions  and employers have worked together to try and  revive

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>

economy.   This  is  an important effort  that  we  have  all

jointly  undertaken and I feel that the Minister for  Finance

could be more generous as mentioned by my colleagues, Dr Wang

Kai  Yuen  and Mr Leong Horn Kee, who have urged the Ministry

to  see  whether  it could roll back some of  its  plans  and

allocate more funds for those who have contributed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister should be urged to grant a grace period

until  the  end of this financial year, 31st March 2000,  for

retirees  and retrenched workers to make one CPF contribution

so  that they can get their CPF top-up. This group could  not

make  the  CPF  contribution  because  they  could  not  find

employment  within the cut-off period.  It would  be  a  good

gesture  and  a  show of good heartware of the Government  to

extend  the  benefit  to  them  if  they  can  make  the  CPF

contribution  soon.   I  hope that the Minister  for  Finance

could  look  into  this issue because I  know  many  of  them

deserve  it, and attempts could be made to see how their  CPF

top-up could be granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a continued case for us to review the

status  of low-income pensioners and each year, I have  tried

to  persuade  the Minister to see what can be done  for  this

sector of the population and also for the poor segment of the

population who need help. We need to examine more closely the

impact of the recession on their livelihood. Some of them are

retirees, others are older and jobless persons and pensioners

with  low pensions.  They all deserve a little more attention

for   the  simple  reason  that  they  have  contributed   to

Singapore's   past   development.  As  for   the   low-income

pensioners, I have sounded their plight to the Minister  many

times.   I  hope that this time, he would open up  his  purse

string  and  distribute at least a one-time year-end  payment

during good times for them. We should not forget them as they

have given sterling service.  For the low income families and

single elderly, it will have greater impact if rental rebates

and  rebates for SC&CC charges can be increased  by  25%  per

month.  This  will reduce their burden of increased  cost  of

living,  particularly meeting basic necessities, and many  of

them do not really

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>

have  any income.  They deserve our attention and I feel that

we could do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has considered the need to encourage

family  members  to take care of their aged parents.  He  has

increased  the tax relief for looking after the aged  parents

to  $5,000.  This  is reasonable but he has  not  taken  into

consideration the financial burden of those who have to  look

after  their aged sick parents.  I hope he will be  generous,

at least, to this group next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to examine more closely the social consequences

of   corporatisation   of  our  public   services   and   the

restructuring of our economy to a knowledge-based economy. We

must  see  that  public services remain  affordable  and  the

working  class  is not priced out of the market  to  purchase

goods  and  services.   The Government must  intervene,  when

necessary,  to mediate and enable working-class  families  to

have  access  to  services by levying  charges  which  remain

within  their reach.  In short, many of these services  would

have  to  be  reviewed to ensure that they remain affordable.

Otherwise,  we would have a large sector which  may  not  get

access to the services for which they require.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence, if we remain aloof and oblivious to the

needs of this group, we can expect the social divide to widen

and  people  who are productive may give up the race  because

they  cannot  catch  up.   Therefore,  policymakers  who  are

involved in the promotion of KBE should look closely  at  the

dangers of the wide digital divide and how those who have  IT

skills  and  those who do not can be bridged  through  skills

training  and education.  Here, I must say that  we  need  to

prepare a younger generation of Singaporeans, as early as pre-school  age,  to IT exposure and deploy more  funds  for  the

promotion of IT education at grassroots level and within  the

means  of  the working-class families. The $25 million  which

has  been  allocated  by the Ministry  of  Communication  and

Information Technology is actually peanuts in the light  that

there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>

many  people  who  need  to be trained  and  exposed  at  the

grassroots level.  The Ministry of Finance could, in fact, be

more supportive of this scheme and allocate more funds to the

Ministry so that it is able to promote hardware.  Hardware is

essential but without trainers and people to provide them the

guidance,  exposure and education, it remains  not  effective

and does not make an impact. And many of these hardwares will

remain  as  white elephants in many of these centres  because

there are not sufficient attempts to see how the training  is

carried out at the grassroots level to those who really  need

to be exposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should allocate and deploy more funds to the

younger  children within the community, particularly  at  the

pre-school  centres, and if this could be done earlier,  many

children  who  belong to the working-class families  can  get

early exposure or an early headstart so that they could catch

up  and remain in the forefront of the KBE.  Otherwise, if we

do  not do this, our drive to KBE would land us up in KJE,  a

dead-end road for the less well-off families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, I must say that we have done well

despite  serious  social  and economic  difficulties  of  the

region. We will face more challenges when we restructure  our

economy  and  we must pay more attention to the  semi-skilled

and  unskilled  generation  of workers  who  will  need  more

support to cope with the changing economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek a

clarification  from  Dr  Vasoo?  Dr Vasoo  mentioned  in  his

speech  that  he is afraid that there might be some  services

which  may  be  out  of reach of the lower  income  families.

Would he elaborate on what these services are?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> I think the Member should raise the question

with  the Minister or the relevant Ministry.  But what  I  am

saying  is  that  for  the working-class,  education,  health

services  and  other related services must  be  within  their

reach.   The prices that are charged should remain affordable

so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>

that many of these families, at this juncture, do get access.

I  hope  that  it  continues  to be  so  and  the  respective

Ministries should see how subsidies and other related aspects

could be given to ensure that we do not leave out a group  of

people who otherwise need support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this year's

Budget is an inconsequential one.  The workers have not  been

given  any  significant benefits, neither  has  the  business

community. The real beneficiary is the Government,  as  usual

ending up with hefty surpluses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let us look at the position of the workers. For

two  years,  our workers were at the forefront in  the  fight

against the recession which has gripped this country and  the

region since July 1997. The workers were the first to suffer.

Their casualties include massive retrenchments, pay-cuts  and

lowering of the employer's CPF by 10 percentage points.   Our

workers  have suffered. They were the ones who were  affected

most by the cost-cutting measures, to hold back the recession

and  not  let  it  get worse.  Yet, at this  time,  when  the

economy  has basically recovered, what do we see?  No rewards

for  the  workers, only pittance of small rebates of  service

and  conservancy  and other charges for  HDB  flat  dwellers.

Those rebates are less than the ones given last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two years' recession has left the workers worse off

this  year.   Last year, many of the workers still  had  some

savings  to  rely  on but after two years of  recession,  all

their  savings have dried up. And this year, they  are  in  a

worse  position  than last year. They should  be  given  more

benefits  this year.  I think the Minister should  have  been

more   generous  and  reward  the  workers.  The   employer's

component of the CPF should have been restored at least by  a

further  2  percentage points, if not more.  I do  not  think

that  the economy shall be adversely affected if 2 percentage

points of the employer's CPF contribution are restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of America is strong. So too is that of the

EU.  Japan's economy is said to have bottomed out in 1999 and

it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>

on  the  road to recovery.  The countries in the region  have

all  recovered  from the recession and are  showing  positive

growth  too.  For  Singapore, the NUS Economic  Studies  Unit

predicted  that its GDP shall be 7.9% this year.  It  can  be

seen  that  the  world,  the region and Singapore's  economic

prospects  are not that bad.  Therefore, there is  no  reason

for the Government for not increasing the employer's CPF rate

by another 2 percentage points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is already a restoration of 2

percentage points of the employer's CPF to take effect on 1st

April  this  year.  I do not think that that is enough.  With

the  high  cost of living, workers in Singapore are generally

living  from  hand  to mouth and any cut  in  the  CPF  shall

certainly  cause  hardship among them, as happened  in  1998.

On the other hand, an increment of the CPF rate contribution,

even if it is only 2 percentage points more, shall be a great

help  to  the workers as most workers have to pay  their  HDB

monthly loans through their CPF.  It is really a sad day  for

the  workers on Budget day not to have any restoration of the

said  employer's   CPF contribution rate.  So  much  for  the

gratefulness  of the Government, for the sacrifices  made  by

the workers.  When times were bad, the Government called upon

the workers to accept a lowering of the CPF contributions, to

tighten  their  belts,  to  accept  pay  cuts.   The  workers

responded  positively.   There were no  strikes,  no  trouble

given to the Government.  Yet, when times are good again, the

Government appears to have forgotten the sacrifices  made  by

the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the two percentage points which the

Government has restored to the workers, the other thing  that

the  Government could do is to lower the foreign  maid  levy,

which  now  stands at $345 per month per maid.  I  have  been

told  that the foreign maid levy is higher than the  salaries

received  by  the  maids themselves.  My  feedback  is  that,

generally,  a  Filipino  maid receives  $350  per  month,  an

Indonesian maid receives about $240 a month, and a Sri Lankan

maid receives about $200 per month.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government makes the most money when a foreign maid

is employed in a household in Singapore.  Yet, the Government

has  not  provided  any services to the foreign  maids.   The

Government  has  not provided training for them  to  be  good

housekeepers or child minders.  The only thing the Government

does is to allow them to work here and impose a heavy levy on

them.   The foreign maid levy, to me, is nothing more than  a

tax  imposed  on  the maids.  The Government  says  that  the

rationale  for such a high rate of levy or tax is to  prevent

Singapore from being flooded with foreign maids.  With such a

high  levy, the great number of foreign maids wanting to work

in  Singapore  has  not diminished, but  still  continues  to

increase.  As we have heard on the sitting of  22nd  February

2000 in this House, the Minister for Manpower said that there

were about 100,000 foreign maids employed in Singapore.   So,

the  number  of  foreign maids working in Singapore  has  not

abated,  but it is increasing despite the imposition  of  the

high  rate  of levy.  The fact is that there shall always  be

families  wanting to employ foreign maids,  as  both  spouses

have  to  go  to work.  The cost of living is  so  high  that

families  generally  cannot  depend  on  the  income  of  one

breadwinner  to support the whole family.  As a result,  when

both  spouses are required to seek employment, a foreign maid

has  to  be employed, primarily to look after their  children

and aged parents, and to cook for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment of a foreign maid is a necessity for many

families  in  Singapore.  Therefore, no matter how  high  the

Government  raises  the  levy, the families  that  need  some

domestic  help to look after their children and aged  parents

shall  somehow find ways and means to employ a foreign  maid,

either  by  changing jobs for higher paid  ones  or  to  work

longer  hours to pay for the increased levy.  The  policy  of

high  levies shall never be a deterrent for Singaporeans  who

have  to  employ foreign maids.  What is going to  happen  is

that  Singaporeans  shall seek cheaper  maids  or  employment

agents shall force

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>

foreign maids to accept lower pay, which shall also not be  a

good thing because Singaporeans shall then get poorer quality

maids.  The Government should lower the foreign maid levy by,

say,  $45,  to  $300 per maid per month, for a  start.   This

shall be a great relief to many working Singaporean couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken on many Budget debates and highlighted the

visibly  large  surpluses accumulated by the Government  each

year.   The  people of Singapore are beginning to  feel  that

these accrued budget surpluses are, in fact, not the people's

money,  but exclusively the money of the Government, although

the Government always says that they hold it in trust for the

people.   Much  of  these  surpluses is  collected  from  the

people.    The  opposition  suspects  that  the   policy   to

accumulate massive amounts of funds by the Government is  not

exclusively for economic reasons, but for political ones.  We

have  seen that in the 1997 general elections, the Government

made  it  clear  that  it shall only  upgrade  HDB  flats  in

precincts  that  supported Government  policies.   The  words

"support Government policies" are an euphemism for the  words

"vote for the PAP".  The residents of HDB flats were made  to

understand that if they do not vote for the PAP, their  flats

shall  be upgraded last.   The upgrading of HDB flats  was  a

major  strategy of the PAP to win votes in the  1997  general

elections.  The budget surpluses of the following  year  were

to  be used for the upgrading programme of HDB flats.  As  it

turned  out,  1998  was  the worst  recession  year  and  the

Government  had to announce a scaling down of  the  upgrading

programme promised by the PAP the previous year.  The  budget

surpluses that were used for the upgrading of HDB flats after

the 1997 general elections were clear evidence of the use  of

surpluses by the Government for a political motive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this year's Budget, the surplus is shown as

$2.45  billion.  This surplus is only the surplus  of  income

over  expenditure.  The actual receipts or  the  money  which

shall  be collected by the Government is actually about $3.41

billion.  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>

sum  takes into account what the Government receives from its

investments  and  sale  of land.   When  we  talk  of  budget

surpluses, we are only referring to part of the money  to  be

made  by  the Government.  The budget surplus this year  only

shows  $2.24  billion but actually the  net  receipt  of  the

Government is $3.41 billion.  The statistics which only  show

budget  surpluses each year of the Government do not  show  a

true  picture  of the receipts of the Government,  which  are

more than the budget surplus for each year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is touted that the Government has $150 billion in

reserves.   I  do  not see the rationale for accumulating  so

much money, other than the political benefits from it by  the

party in power.  The Government wants to awe the people  that

it  has  so  much money.  I think the Government  should  not

continue to accumulate so much money.  It is time to  release

some of those monies back to the people for their benefit, in

particular,  to  benefit  people in education  and  training.

Money  spent on the people's education is not wasted.  It  is

not a consumption but an investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government tells the people of Singapore that we are

embarking  on a knowledge-based economy, and the majority  of

Singaporeans agree with the Government that we should build a

knowledge-based  economy.  For a knowledge-based  economy  to

succeed,  there  is a presumption that the  majority  of  our

workers  have  attained their basic education  and  they  are

conversant  with  the   three Rs.   The  truth  is  that  the

majority  of  our  workers  are poorly  educated  and  poorly

trained.  Since I came to Parliament more than 10 years  ago,

I  have  been  hearing  that our workers  should  be  further

trained and retrained.  But as far as I know, no real success

in  this  respect  is  in  sight.   Even  today,  the  Budget

Statement says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Less than half of our workforce above the age of 40 has

secondary  and  higher education.  We need to level  up  this

group  of  workers  numbering some  834,000  or  42%  of  our

workforce  through training and retraining to help them  cope

with the new economy.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I suspect is that those 800,000-odd workers may not

be  able  even to read and write English at all, because  our

school

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>

system  has  automatic promotion.  Those who fail in  primary

one are automatically promoted to primary two.  They fail  at

primary  two and they are pushed up to primary three  and  so

on.   They finally fail primary six and they are put  in  'N'

classes in secondary schools.  And after one or two years  in

secondary school 'N' level classes, they just simply drop out

of  school,  and  they  join the pool  of  almost  illiterate

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must make up its mind to put a stop to

this  kind  of  a  school system.  Otherwise, the  continuing

growth in the number of illiterate amongst our workforce  can

never  be  stopped.  At one time, the Government  blamed  the

large  number  of  uneducated amongst our  workforce  on  the

previous government, ie, before the PAP took power.  But  now

we  see  workers  above  40 years old who  are  not  properly

educated.  All these workers have gone through the PAP system

of  education, and 42% of them are not properly educated  and

not fit for the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only solution is that the Government must have a

political  will to improve our education system.   For  this,

the  Government must release surpluses to spend  on  building

more schools and recruit more teachers.  I estimate that  the

Government should spend an additional $780 million more  each

year  to  really  give  effective teaching  in  our  schools,

especially  the neighbourhood schools, to make  sure,  for  a

start,  that all pupils at least learn to read and write  the

English  language by the time they leave school.  I recommend

an  additional sum of $780 million to be spent to reduce  the

class size by one quarter of its pupils.  I believe that with

a  smaller  class size, the teaching can be infinitely   more

effective.   I  have been informed that there  is  a  sizable

number of students studying in HDB neighbourhood schools  who

do  not manage to read and write the English language at  all

when  they  leave  school.  If this is true,  then  something

drastic must be done to our school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that I feel the budget surpluses can be

beneficially used is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>

train   more   of   our  local  workers  to  become   skilled

construction   workers.   It  is  noted   that   almost   all

construction   workers   at  our   construction   sites   are

foreigners.   This  is surely not a healthy  situation.   Our

Government should try to get more of our local workers to  be

trained  as skilled construction workers by giving attractive

subsidies  for the training.  At this time, it is  perhaps  a

good  time to do so when the construction industry is in  the

doldrums.

<br>2.27 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Finance has delivered the good news to  us  that

he is once again in the happy position of announcing a budget

surplus this time of $3.2 billion.  He did not dwell long  on

this  accomplishment,  but  he  did  pause  to  observe  that

Singapore  had  emerged largely unscathed from  the  regional

crisis  and  attributed this to strong economic  fundamentals

underpinned  by  years of consistent and  rational  policies.

While  I am fully in agreement with and appreciative  of  the

good  leadership  that has made possible  these  policies,  I

think  we  have  been guilty of forgetting or of  taking  for

granted the other major underpinning of our economic success,

namely,   the   ordinary  Singaporean  of  whom   we   expect

extraordinary    effort,   extraordinary    commitment    and

extraordinary resilience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister moved on to deal with the challenges that

lie  ahead  for Singapore in competing in the new millennium.

He spoke of the increasing intensity of competition that will

be  inevitable in the face of globalisation and the onslaught

of  technological advancement.  The times are  going  to  get

tougher  and the pace even more punishing.  He spoke  of  the

competitive   edge   that  we  have  in   hardware   in   our

infrastructure, and he identified as a key component  of  the

software  aspect of our competitiveness, the quality  of  our

people.  He said, as many of our political leaders have often

repeated  in  recent  times, that as a small  country,  every

Singaporean  matters.   But  his focus  was  on  everyone  to

consciously improve their skills and look for new ways to  do

the job better.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a concern for the ordinary Singaporean, and the

ordinary  Singaporean  family.  In  the  face  of  these  new

challenges,  the  demands of the new global,  knowledge-based

economy,  the hectic pace and the pressure that  starts  from

the  child  in  primary school and, in  fact,  following  the

recent accounts in the newspaper from preschool, how will our

ordinary Singapore family cope?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, we are beginning to see some fault lines show

in  the  increasing examples we have of young people  getting

into trouble, not so much in the numbers perhaps, but in  the

violence of their crimes.  I believe all Members of the House

have   numerous  stories  from  their  constituents  of   the

pressures that the latter faced.   In the last month alone  I

have  heard of three families who have carted their  children

off to Australia to escape the pressure.  Of these, in two of

the  families,  the mothers accompanied the  kids  while  dad

remained in his job in Singapore.  What kind of a family life

is  this?  And with regard to the children, will they  return

to Singapore after their studies are done?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the far greater number of families who do not

have the means of this form of an escape valve?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting for a moment that

we  should, even if we could, stop the world because we  want

to  get  off.  There is no turning the clock back and wishing

for  the  nice  comfortable world that used  to  be.   It  is

precisely  because  we cannot turn the  clock  back,  that  I

believe  that  it is time for us to review all  the  policies

that  we have that impact on the Singapore family, to see  if

we  cannot  do  better in supporting and  strengthening  this

precious entity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House in October last year, the Prime Minister

spoke  of his concern with regard to two trends: the  falling

fertility rate, Singaporeans not replacing ourselves, and the

increased  number of Singaporeans going overseas.   He  noted

that  there are many reasons for the declining fertility rate

-  urbanisation,  education, changing lifestyles,  singlehood

and late marriages. The stresses and pressures of modern life

are  intimately intertwined with all of these  factors.   The

Prime

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>

Minister  was absolutely right when he commented that  simply

the  extension of the family benefits to fathers that  I  had

proposed  in  that  same sitting would not be  the  solution.

There is no magic bullet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would take a wide ranging review of a multitude of

issues  to  come up with a clear vision of what  outcomes  we

want  for the Singapore family, a decision to prioritise  the

needs  of  the family, and a clear statement in the  fact  of

conflicting  demands  of the importance  of  acting  on  this

decision.  Follow through and implementation will take plenty

of  political will and muscle, and the slaughter of not a few

sacred cows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we are serious about making this vulnerable

little  island  a good home for all of us in the  long  term,

then  we must approach the problem in a comprehensive manner,

in  the same way as we approached our economic well-being  in

establishing  the  Committee  on Singapore's  Competitiveness

(CSC)  to  map out a comprehensive set of long term  economic

strategies,  and  not have individual Ministries  take  small

bites  at the subject in an ad hoc manner.  And as Government

adopted  the strategies proposed by the CSC as the  blueprint

for  developing  Singapore  into  an  advanced  and  globally

competitive knowledge-based economy, so we need in  tandem  a

blueprint  for forming and preserving strong happy  families,

not just to enjoy the fruits of this material success but, in

fact, to ensure that we are able to soldier on effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a slew of policies in place that impact on the

family  in various ways, many of them enacted and implemented

at  various  points in our history, for various good  reasons

and  priorities  at  that  time,  that  altogether  now  send

sometimes conflicting messages to Singaporean women  and  men

as  they  make  their  way through life taking  decisions  on

marriage,  starting  a  family,  bringing  up  children   and

possibly finding time and space for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let me walk you very quickly through the factors

that  come into play at these various points.  For  a  start,

even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>

before  worrying about helping the family to  cope  with  the

pace  and pressures of life in the new millennium, persuading

young Singaporeans that they want in fact to form a family in

the  first place.  For the young Singaporean deciding to  get

married - yes, no, or wait?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have brought up a generation of youngsters on the lap

of  economic well-being, who have very high expectations, and

who  place  economics - work and career - before  family  and

home.  And understandably so, when so much more tangible  and

immediate  rewards come with having a successful career  than

for  being  a  good  spouse  or  a  good  parent.   Expressed

appreciation  from the boss, promotions, a good  salary,  and

the attendant lifestyle that this affords.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there some way to moderate these values? What could

we  be  covering in a life skills curriculum in  school  that

might  place  some  emphasis  on  the  importance,  joys  and

responsibilities of family life?  How do we engage parents in

the process?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a survey commissioned by the SDU in 1998, 62% of

young  couples  felt that it was important to have  financial

stability  before embarking on marriage, and 33% would  delay

marriage until a matrimonial home is ready, even if they were

otherwise ready for marriage.  There are limited options  for

housing  for the young couple just getting started  in  life,

apart from getting into the queue for a HDB flat.  There  are

various  HDB grants and schemes to assist young couples,  and

also promote and facilitate extended families living together

or  in  close proximity.  These are good.  And then there  is

the   Fiance/Fiancee   Scheme   which   requires   a   $5,000

registration deposit on application, and the production of  a

marriage certificate three months after taking possession  of

the  flat.   Does this push them into marriage  too  quickly,

without enough consideration, resulting in increasing  number

of divorces in this younger age group subsequently?  A review

of  the impact and implications of the assorted policies  may

be timely.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the decision to have children, the first

baby.   Again, attitudes and values, weighing work and family

come   into  play.   Wait  for  one's  career  to  be  better

established,  to  better afford the financial  responsibility

that comes with bringing up a child?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to have baby number three carries with it

weighing the tax benefits against the maternity benefits,  or

rather,  the lack thereof.  Dr Wang has made the point  about

increasing tax incentives for the third and fourth child.   I

myself rather think that one should be looking at the loss of

maternity  benefits and maternity leave for the  third  child

and above.  In fact, I think the group that benefits from the

increased tax incentives is much smaller and at this point in

time  we are ready to look at encouraging a wider portion  of

the  population to consider having the third  child  and  not

just the very top cream of the economic crop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking after baby. How many young couples are

fortunate enough these days to have the family infrastructure

available and willing grandparents on hand to help with child

minding?   If not, a decision has to be made between engaging

a  maid,  fostering the baby to a child minder, or finding  a

good child care centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the child care centre - the quality of care, the

availability of a place in a conveniently located centre, and

cost  and  subsidy, are all issues.  This is the one solitary

item  I  found highlighted in the Budget estimates  that  was

specifically  for  the  family - the 49 additional  childcare

centres  and  25  student  centres provided  for  under  MCD.

Should we be doing more over and above this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viability of each of the options varies from one

young family to another.  What is important, therefore,  must

be the availability of the range of options.  With one child,

a  childcare centre, especially with the available Government

subsidy,  may  be  a good option.  With two children,  it  is

probably cheaper to get a maid, who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>

then  also  helps with the housework.  If the maid  levy  was

less, or could be put aside towards a gratuity to be paid  to

the  worker at the end of the contract period, would  parents

be  able  to  afford  to attract and hire  a  better  calibre

employee, who can then act more as a governess in helping  to

bring  the children up, relieving some of the pressures  that

are  felt  in terms of providing a good environment  for  the

child at home?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the first baby arrives, the parents have then to

address  how  to balance work and home responsibilities  with

the  burden falling very much at the moment on mum.  To  stop

work, work part-time, or continue to work full time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a median Singaporean household income of just around

$3,000,  for  many  of  the 56% of dual  income  families  in

Singapore,  continuing to hold down  a  full-time  job  is  a

necessity for both parents.  How to cope with the demands  of

the  current working environment, the pressures of increasing

productivity, constantly learning new skills, and yet  manage

to do a decent job of bringing up a child and maintaining the

household?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at how to convince companies of the

benefits  of implementing family friendly practices  to  help

employees with this balance.  How can Government support  and

facilitate   the   process?   By   sourcing   and   providing

information   of  best  practices  in  other  countries,   by

commissioning  local studies to demonstrate applicability  to

our  own  environment, by providing tax and  other  financial

incentives where applicable, and by setting the example as  a

major employer in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These family friendly practices should include measures

to  facilitate re-entry to work, when the kids are older  and

more  independent,  for the parents who had  earlier  stopped

work  to attend to family responsibilities full-time.   Then,

when  the kids get to school, life becomes a pressure  cooker

seething with anxieties and angst.  The study done by  Stella

Quah on the Singapore Family, published in May last

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>

year,  identified children's education as the single greatest

worry for parents.  Over and above the simpler issues of  the

availability  of before-and-after-school-care,  important  to

working  parents,  are  the  pressures  that  come  from  the

curriculum   load,  streaming  and  examinations   that   are

characteristic of our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has in recent years announced

many   admirable  initiatives  which,  if  and   when   fully

implemented, should go some way to dealing with the  problems

and  challenges.  But there seems right now still a huge  gap

to  bridge  between the existing and the desired  situations.

Mr  Chiam has asked for more funds for the Education Ministry

to decrease class size and improve the situation.  I noted in

fact  that  in this Budget 2,400 positions had been  provided

for.  Not only that, when I look at previous years, I believe

there  is  a huge vacancy rate in the Education Service.   My

concern  is not so much that there is no willingness  to  put

money  aside  to provide for this, but how on  earth  are  we

going to find the bodies, the brains and the hearts and souls

to  fill up these positions that will help ease the position?

That, in fact, is key to the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ageing population, the care of frail elderly

family  members  will  start becoming  a  factor  that  needs

consideration. Fortunately, in this instance, Government  has

anticipated the problem and action has already been initiated

in  this  area in the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee

on the Ageing Population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, changing the traditional views and practice in

the  sharing  of home responsibilities.  More flexibility  in

the assumption and sharing of different roles and duties will

allow  couples to better manage the calls on their  time  and

attention,  to achieve better outcomes for the  family.   Two

people  willing to pitch in according to their strengths  and

aptitudes without preconceived ideas about rigid divisions of

labour are going to be that much more effective and efficient

in  sharing  the  responsibilities of  bringing  up  a  happy

family.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we are seeing more younger men helping out

in  more  ways with home responsibilities these  days.   Just

recently,  a  group of three young men have got  together  to

establish  a  Centre for Fathering.  How can we  support  and

facilitate  this trend?  Training in parenting for  both  our

young men and women is much needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you can see, many Ministries need to

be involved if we are to address the subject of strengthening

the  Singaporean family in a holistic and coordinated manner.

Not  just  the MCD, the obvious Ministry, through its  Family

Development Division.  MCD, by the way, soon to be the  MCDS,

Ministry  of Community Development and Sports, and alas,  not

even  MCDF, Ministry of Community Development and the Family.

But also the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower, the

Productivity  and  Standards Board  under  MTI,  Ministry  of

Finance.  Practically, every Ministry has policies and can do

things  that  will  impact  and that  can  help  support  the

Singapore  family, as we push for all the  training  and  the

entrepreneurial talent.  In the meantime, the Singaporean and

his  or  her  family,  that  is the  mainstay,  and  that  is

ultimately what produces all the energies and the engine that

drives  what  we are trying to achieve, I think we  sometimes

stand  in danger of taking that very much for granted, as  we

are  so  caught  up  in undoubtedly all  of  the  other  very

important things that we need to pay attention to.   I  think

the  Singapore  family needs and deserves our  attention.   I

will  pick  up  in  the debate on the estimates  that  follow

specific issues with the Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should like to call upon perhaps a more

coordinated  approach.  When Government feels that  something

is  important, it places priority on it and straightaway  the

resources  move,  and  you can see  this.   The  best  recent

example is, having identified the issue of ageing, we  formed

the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing Population.  And we

now  have $200 million in the Eldercare Endowment Fund.   The

Minister for Finance has introduced various tax incentives in

the Budget for looking after our older population.  If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>

only  we  would pay the same amount of attention  to  putting

something together for the Singapore family.

<br>2.46 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us were anxiously waiting for this year's

Budget  which we anticipated as a growth budget and one  that

was  going  to give a strong signal that Singapore is  indeed

serious  about  participating  in  a  global  knowledge-based

economy  which  is now at our doorsteps.  We  are  now  in  a

completely  different  era  where  competition  is   not   in

Singapore,  nor is it in the region, but it is now throughout

the world.  Whether we like it or not, we have to participate

and fight to win if we want to ensure our survival.  The good

news  is that we have a level playing field and have as  good

an   opportunity  as  any  other  world-best  countries   and

economies  to  be  successful.  The  bad  news  is  that  the

competition is going to come to our doorsteps and it will  be

here  whether  we like it or not and our old  ways  of  doing

business is not going to work in this future.  All of us will

have  to  make  major  mindset  changes,  including  how   we

formulate the country's budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today I will be touching a bit on the strategies

that  we should consider in planning our economy and  I  will

give my detailed suggestions during the Committee of Supply's

discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to talk about Singapore's

role  in this global world and the lessons that we must learn

from others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is fortunate to have a strategic geographical

position  and through this we have developed ourselves  as  a

hub  for various activities like trade, logistics and  travel

and  as a language hub linking Asia to the rest of the world,

which  were all very important in the `old economy'.  In  the

new economy, information technology will create tremendous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>

efficiencies  in the way goods and services are produced  and

distributed.   IT  has  also increased  the  productivity  of

workers,  and  it  is  going to reduce uncertainties,  create

visibility  and  transparencies and break any  barriers  that

governments may try to erect to protect their economies.   So

the question is: are our infrastructure and hardware going to

make  the same difference in this new economy as they did  in

the past?  My contention is that it will not and we will have

to  create  new competencies and use of IT will  continue  to

play  the role we played in the old economy, but we know that

the physical and geographical advantages are not going to  be

the  differentiating factors anymore.  Neither will  we  have

the   luxury  of  just  importing  and  transplanting  proven

technologies  and  competencies  from  other  more   advanced

countries into Singapore as we did in the past.  Every one of

our  competitors will be able to do the same or  even  better

than  us.   Our role therefore has to be one of an  innovator

and  leader, capable of being in the leading edge of  things,

and   be   a  choice  place  where  business  will  be   done

efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent Cable and Wireless HKT and SingTel

episode  should  be  a  lesson  that  we  should  learn.   It

basically says that we are not yet ready to participate in  a

very fast moving new economy.  The paper wealth and the speed

at  which  Pacific Century Cyberworks group  moves  are  good

examples of how things are going to be done in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worry I have is that this is just a signal and an

indication of things to come if we do not change  fast.   The

fact is that Singapore started talking about and planning for

a  knowledge-based economy about two years ago and many other

Asian  countries, including Hong Kong, started  this  journey

later  than  us.   Hong Kong, for example,  has  leap-frogged

Singapore  despite their later start and the danger  is  that

Singapore may lose out in its battle to be the Asian Hub  for

this  new economy and the Silicon Valley of the east.  If  we

do not change, we may just get the number two or number three

position.   And we as a nation, I believe, cannot risk  being

in this position.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my speech today, I would like to touch on three

areas  which we should focus on in order to be a more  potent

source in this new economy and these are:  (1)  Changing  the

way  Singapore  is governed;  (2) Promoting entrepreneurship;

and (3) How to build world class local companies.



<br><br><i>Changing the Way Singapore is Governed</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many observers have advised us that the Government

should  rethink  the  traditional  strong  guiding  role   in

developing  the country and the economy.  My suggestions  are

as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we need an entrepreneurial civil service that is

willing to take risks in policy making.  In some cases,  when

we  are  unsure,  it may be necessary to implement  a  policy

first,  based  on the  best of everyone's judgement  and,  if

necessary, fine-tune it as we learn our lessons.  If we  wait

for  a  perfect  policy to be formulated, the battle  may  be

lost.   Sir,  our  Government  and  civil  service  need   to

transform   its   administrative  role  to   one   of   being

entrepreneurial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in the new economy, as we compete with the best

in  the world, public policy making and decisions need to  be

made at very fast speed, which I call Internet speed.  And  I

believe  from certain research that I have done, one Internet

year  is equivalent  to seven physical years in terms of  how

fast  things change.  This means that we must be able to move

seven  times faster than how we had moved in the old economy.

In  my  opinion, the loss of the Cable and Wireless HKT  deal

was a result of how fast our Government and GLCs are able  to

make  decisions.  Richard Li's Pacific Century Cyberworks  is

an  example of how Internet speed works in this new  economy.

In  certain cases, decisions based on gut feel and on the fly

may be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have an experience that I would like to share

with  the House about the speed at which things get  done  in

this  new  economy.   I  have started an e-commerce  shopping

portal about six months ago.  I managed to build quite a good

concept in the last six months.  About two weeks ago,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>

I  had a call from a CEO from the Norwegian company that  was

also  doing  a  similar portal.  And we started talking  just

about  two  weeks ago.  The true negotiations really  started

last  Friday  night  at  about 10.30  pm  in  my  house.   We

negotiated  through  the  night until  4.00  am  on  Saturday

morning,  and  we shook hands that we had a  deal.   We  then

passed  on  the work to our lawyers who worked the  whole  of

Saturday.   I  got  the  draft  legal  document  on  Saturday

evening.   We  met  on  Saturday at 2 o'clock  in  my  place,

thrashed  out the whole legal document, and by  4.30  pm  the

document was ready.  At 5.15 pm, I left my home, rushed to  a

hotel  to  sign  the agreement, witnessed  by  the  Norwegian

Ambassador.  By 6.00 pm, the deal was done.  And this took us

just  48  hours.    This is an example of how Internet  speed

works if you want to be successful in this economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should seriously consider my suggestion that

I  made  in  the past, that of outsourcing the governance  of

Singapore  to the people and the private sector  as  much  as

possible, wherever possible.  While certain sectors cannot be

outsourced,  for  example, defence  and  a  number  of  other

Ministries,  there  are others that can be.   And  through  a

partnership, we will have a better chance of succeeding.   In

this  way, with a shared responsibility, we will be  able  to

make  better  decisions  and move faster  than  before.   Our

Government  agencies  will  do  well  if  they  act  only  as

facilitators and not as drivers in this new economy,  because

too  much  of  Government involvement will only  slow  things

down.   So  agencies like the NSTB and PSB should  either  be

privatised  or they should modify their roles to become  more

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I feel that the civil service needs to be

rewarded  differently  so  that they  will  be  motivated  to

transform Singapore to a knowledge-based economy.  If  we  do

not  do anything about this, there will be a feeling of being

left out and a reluctance to change policies for the sake  of

promoting entrepreneurship and enriching the private  sector.

I  feel  that  we  need to seriously consider  revamping  the

compensation system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I believe that we have failed in attracting

many  good  people  with private sector experience  into  the

civil  service  because  of  the bureaucratic  and  promotion

practices  that  exist today.  People do not feel  that  they

will  get  what  they deserve and be able  to  advance  their

careers  should  they  move from the private  sector  to  the

public sector.  I hope that the Government can relook at  its

practices to change things to attract more people of  varying

backgrounds into the Government service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should not worry about perfecting and

devising  perfect  policies before we  make  changes.   As  I

mentioned  earlier, a little uncertainty and a  little  chaos

may  be necessary and may not necessarily be a bad thing  for

the country.  In fact, this type of uncertainty and chaos  is

what  that  threw  up  the  truly  entrepreneurial  group  of

Ministers  and  civil servants during the era  of  our  first

generation  leadership of Singapore.  Too much  of  structure

will create complacency in society and weak leadership.



<br><br><i>Promoting Entrepreneurship</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without doubt, the promotion of entrepreneurship is

the  most important activity all of us should focus on in the

next  10  to  15 years of economic development,  because  the

nation needs this new breed of wealth creators who will  then

generate  jobs  and create a better standard  of  living  for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it was a disappointment that nothing new

was  done  and  no  new initiatives were introduced  in  this

year's  budget regarding promotion of entrepreneurship.   Any

spending in entrepreneurship development should be seen as an

investment and not as a handout.  I would have hoped that the

budget  surplus  that  we surprisingly got  could  have  been

better spent in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few things on what we can do

about promoting entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our tax system needs to change with time. I

feel that we are too caught up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>

in  devising  a  single  tax  system  for  all  our  economic

activities.   I  suggest that the Minister  consider  a  mass

customisation  approach, as the Minister  for  Education  had

considered for the education system, to our tax regime as  it

needs  to  be  proactive  in  supporting  certain  types   of

activities  like technology and info-communication start-ups.

We   should   treat  entrepreneurs  and  start-up   companies

differently,  be it in how we tax them or in the  incentives,

grants and Government charges levied on them.  We should also

facilitate   their   growth  and  help  remove   bureaucratic

obstacles.   For  example,  I feel that  the  employee  stock

options  and  share  grants in start-up  companies  could  be

treated  differently  from those given by  companies  already

established  or  companies  that have  already  been  listed.

Similarly,  technology savvy investors could  also  be  given

preferential treatment on how they are taxed or how they  can

minimise the burden of investing in companies that eventually

collapse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, capital raising should continue to be

liberalised.   We  should make it easier to raise  funds  for

start-up  companies either through angel  investors  who  are

well  incentivised to do so and also by making it  easier  to

list  new  companies  on  a stock exchange  and  by  allowing

international access of funds to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government should allow the private sector

companies or individuals manage its funds.  If the Government

can identify a pool of well established local businessmen and

entrepreneurs, we can develop a cluster of small  funds  that

can  act  as  catalysts  for  many  more  new  start-ups   in

Singapore.   Currently,  the  Government  funds   are   being

invested  in  only  a few large and well established  venture

capitalists  who  can  serve  a different  purpose  from  the

smaller cluster of funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in the new economy, we will be seeing an

acceleration  in  innovation, never seen before  in  history.

The  way businesses and companies are run will be re-invented

all   the   time.   To  participate  in  this  economy,   all

Singaporeans need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>

become  knowledge  workers who must  be  prepared  to  accept

constant  change  as a way of life and to  survive,  everyone

needs  to  continue to learn new skills.  While once  upon  a

time  a  single  career  path and hence a  once-in-a-lifetime

learning   and  training  was  sufficient,  in   the   future

environment,  this will lead to an early end of  our  earning

ability.   I  therefore feel that it is about  time  that  we

revamped  our education system and the values we believe  in,

including the practice of meritocracy so that our workers can

become effective knowledge workers of the future.



<br><br><i>Developing Local Companies into World Class Companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area I want to talk about is the development

of local companies into world class companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the promotion and growth of many more successful

local companies who can compete head on with any other of the

world-best companies is a very important task in the next few

years.  In this respect, I feel that we should have taken the

opportunity   to  give  more  incentives  to   companies   to

regionalise and globalise in the current year's  budget.   We

now  have  a unique opportunity to acquire or merge  with  or

invest  in  good  companies  around  the  world,  given   our

financial strength and strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our quest to create world class companies, we have

been  focusing too much on our GLCs.  Once again, the SingTel

and Cable & Wireless HKT deal has shown us that despite being

highly successful locally in Singapore, many of our GLCs will

not  be  able  to compete effectively outside Singapore.   We

have  also  recently seen a number of other failed  deals  by

some  other  GLCs and my worry is that while we  can  compete

effectively in our small Singapore market, we do not have the

ability  to compete globally.  I do not have the full  answer

as  to  where  the problem really lies, but my feel  is  that

there  is  too  much  of  comfort  with  a  large  Government

ownership  in such companies.  We should fully privatise  all

GLCs  and  let them be driven by market forces.  In fact,  it

will do the GLCs a lot of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>

good if they are run purely on a private enterprise basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, since we are just coming out of the economic

crisis,  I feel that this is an excellent time to incentivise

local  companies to restructure and consolidate.  They should

focus more and more on the value creation proposition and  be

less  dependent  on just cost factors in  the  future.   Many

European  countries  have  been able  to  breed  world  class

companies  despite their high costs and this  is  because  of

their  focus  on  technology and value creation.   Nokia  and

Ericcson are just two examples of such companies coming  from

these countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should watch against rolling back too

quickly  all  the cost containment measures implemented  last

year.   Delaying any cost measures by another one  year  will

allow  companies to regain their full strength and they  will

not  have  to  worry about cost at this stage.   During  this

time,  they  can focus on their restructuring plans.   If  we

roll  back the cost measures too fast, we may risk a reversal

of  the  recovery seen by some companies.  We should  wait  a

little longer before changing things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, in my opinion, after so many years, we have

failed  to  find  a good solution or formula in  helping  our

local small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  I believe a major

restructuring  is needed in how we support and nurture  SMEs.

If  we  do  not do things differently, the recently announced

SME  21  plan will have little chance of success and  I  will

give  my  suggestions  on  how we  can  do  this  during  the

Committee  of  Supply  discussions.   But  the  gist  of   my

suggestion  is  to  let  the  private  sector  handle   this,

including the administration of grants and incentive schemes.

The  various industry organisations and Chambers of  Commerce

can do a good job in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, e-commerce is the future for Singapore and our

traditional traders risk collapse if they do not embrace  the

Internet  economy.   However, in the  meantime,  our  traders

still  need  some help, especially in the area  of  financing

their trade and in modernising the whole

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>

order  fulfilment process, to compete in the new economy.   I

feel that the Government is not doing enough and is too quick

to  decide  that the trading sector does not  need  any  more

help.   Similarly,  I  believe that the legislation  and  tax

regime  are  not fully ready to participate in the e-commerce

world and there is an urgent need to address this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new economy is already here. We have no lack

of  capable  people  with many ideas.   What  we  need  is  a

conducive  environment  and a sea  of  entrepreneurs  in  the

private, people and public sectors to come up tops.  We  have

the ability and the will power to make it happen.  We must be

prepared  that  we  may  have to  adjust  and  re-adjust  our

policies and strategies as we move ahead and learn.  We  must

be  prepared to give up certain efficiencies for the sake  of

success.   Now  is the time to act, so I hope the  Government

will  urgently  address the issues that  Members  will  raise

during the next 10 days of debate regarding the promotion  of

enterpreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, over the years, it has become a somewhat popular Shenton

Way  tradition to attach terms to describe the Budget.   This

millennium Budget is no exception.  Some have called it  "The

Good  Old  Budget" in respect of the SRS and tax reliefs  for

dependent parents and aged grandparents.  Others have  called

it  "The  Cyber Budget" in recognition of the tax initiatives

for  an increasingly borderless virtual world.  But it  is  a

bothersome Budget for taxpayers who were disappointed by  the

full  or partial withdrawal of a number of rebates.  In  this

regard, some have even called it "The Withdrawal Budget".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these are quite unfair terms that have been

coined  out  of  parochial interests.  It is  unfair  because

people  conveniently chose to overlook a  possible  GST  hike

that  did not materialise.  It is unfair because people chose

to forget the conditions attached to one-off rebates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>

Personally,  I  prefer  the term "measured  Budget"  for  the

Minister's   measured  fiscal  response  to  the   millennium

challenges.  It is a measured response because the withdrawal

of  each  rebate appears to be followed by a concomitant  new

tax  initiative.  It is a measured response because while  we

see  great  challenges ahead, we must not lose sight  of  the

lessons that we have learned from the recession, that we need

to  remain  competitive, that a continued bright  outlook  is

sometimes contingent upon forces and factors entirely  beyond

our  control.   And so, Sir, there are merits in  adopting  a

measured  fiscal approach.  For this reason,  I  support  the

Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Minister to consider a scenario

that  assumes  the challenges to be somewhat more  compelling

and  that  requires a slightly more rigorous fiscal approach.

What  happens  when  the twin forces of IT and  globalisation

require stronger response from the Government?  What are some

positive tax initiatives to accelerate the path to become the

Asian  Silicon  Valley and to maintain our  position  as  the

regional  business hub?  What tax measures can be  considered

to  encourage our local companies to think bigger, enter into

new  markets and invest more boldly?  How can we give  a  tax

boost  to  companies  that  are  still  struggling  from  the

lingering  effects  of the economic downturn?   We  ought  to

visit these issues and attempt to answer these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, companies that are still facing economic

difficulties.  The V-shape rebound is understandably met by a

U-turn  in  recession year tax rebates.  The  conditions  for

these rebates were laid out beforehand by the Minister.  Once

the  economy improves, the rationale for the rebate collapses

and  reason compels that the rebates be removed.  If specific

business  sectors  require  a post-recovery  boost,  new  tax

measures should be designed to deal with a specific issue  at

hand.   This  seems to be the measured approach  adopted  for

this   Budget.   But,  Sir,  have  companies  and  businesses

recovered  entirely from this recession?  Statistics  suggest

that  our  growth is not broad-based across all sectors.   In

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>

course  of my day-to-day business dealings, I have also  come

across many people who feel that we are not fully out of  the

woods.   Many SMEs are still struggling.  Many SMEs bore  the

brunt  of  the recession, much harder than larger businesses.

The  withdrawal  of rebates will again hurt  them  harder  in

relative terms as compared to larger businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are genuinely concerned about growing our

local SMEs into world class companies, we will need to create

a  conducive  environment  for them  to  grow.   A  conducive

physical  environment  should be part of  the  blueprint  for

local  SME  growth.  Instead of a flat corporate  income  tax

rate  for  all  companies, we might consider  implementing  a

lower  rate  of  income tax for local SMEs.   SMEs  that  are

wholly owned by Singaporeans could be subject to a lower rate

of  tax,  say,  16% on the first million of income  which  is

ploughed  back  into  the  business and  not  distributed  as

dividends.  Low rates will allow the SMEs to build  up  their

reserve  to better weather economic downturn that will  occur

in the future as part of the normal business cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of helping SMEs still suffering from the

lingering  effects of the recession, consideration should  be

given  to  allowing  SMEs to use losses incurred  during  the

recession  years  of 1998 and 1999 against income  earned  in

previous  years.   This  ability to  so-called  "carry  back"

losses  would  greatly benefit SMEs that are facing  cashflow

problems  and  financial difficulties now.  The  current  tax

rules  allowing for the carry forward of losses  is  only  of

benefit  if  a  company  actually survives  the  recessionary

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the topic of providing relief for tax losses, I

would  also like to raise the issue of corporate group relief

for  losses.   Businesses  under  the  common  control  of  a

shareholder,  or group of shareholders, may be  organised  in

separate  companies for a variety of reasons.  This corporate

separation,  while real in the legal sense, is artificial  in

the  business sense from the perspective of the  owners.   We

hear  the  Government's message that the more entrepreneurial

approach of style is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

needed to sustain us beyond the millennium in the face of the

tough  regional  competition.  But the  willingness  to  take

structured   risks   may  manifest  itself   in   operational

structures, giving rise to quarantine losses.  Our tax  rules

do  not  permit  losses in one company to be  offset  against

profits in another company even if one person owns both.   If

the  two  businesses were run out of the  same  company,  the

losses would implicitly reduce the profits resulting in  less

tax.  In effect, by not allowing inter-corporate losses,  and

I  use  the term loosely, the effective tax rate is  actually

higher than 25.5% for the above companies taken together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with certain other countries, I suggest we

seriously  look into the concept of group loss  relief.   The

structured  separation of businesses and risks into  separate

companies should not lead to the very real problem of  taxing

a  corporate  group at a tax rate that is effectively  higher

than the statutory rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to focus on the other possible tax

measures   to  boost  our  regionalisation  efforts   in   an

increasingly  globalised  world.   Risks  are  involved   for

companies  going regional.  Investment and external financing

are   required.    Interest  costs,  in  some   cases   quite

substantial,  are  incurred.  In initial years,  the  company

invested  may  be  expected to operate with little,  if  any,

profits.   It  will  take time for them  to  build  up  their

reserves  in  order for such companies to repatriate  profits

back to Singapore.  We can try to minimise the time needed by

local  companies  going regional to build up their  reserves.

We can try to help our local companies to be competitive in a

global environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current tax rules do not allow funding costs to be

deducted  if  the investment does not produce  income.   This

serves as a disincentive for local companies to seek regional

expansion  opportunities.  We can assist  such  companies  by

allowing  them  to  accumulate expenses in  periods  when  no

income  is  earned and allowing them to deduct such  expenses

when the investment starts to produce income.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>

Such  rules could be targeted specifically to costs  incurred

in  regional expansion activities, such as funding and  legal

costs, and would help companies that are starting to plan for

regional    expansion.     The   tax   authorities    already

administratively  allow  expenses  to  be   accumulated   and

deducted in future years where foreign income is earned,  but

not brought into Singapore in a given year.  It is not such a

great  extension  to  allow expenses  to  be  accumulated  on

certain expansionary activities to be treated similarly.

On  top  of  helping  companies to get  started  in  regional

expansion,  we should also think forwardly and  consider  how

best to allow successful companies to reinvest their overseas

profits.  Currently, foreign taxes paid by a second or  third

tier  of  foreign company may not be recognised in  Singapore

when the Singapore parent company receives dividends from its

overseas   subsidiaries  through  an  offshore   intermediate

holding  company.  Since credit is not given for such foreign

taxes  suffered  at  the  second and third  tier  level,  the

overseas  income  that  is  brought  back  to  Singapore   is

effectively  taxed  twice, once by the foreign  country,  and

once  by  Singapore.   This may act as a  disincentive  to  a

Singapore  company  that  has  been  successful  abroad  from

reinvesting  in Singapore even if the best opportunities  are

available  at  home.  We should remove this  potential  road-block and, as a general rule, allow companies to look through

intermediate  holding  companies  in  foreign  countries  and

receive credit for foreign taxes paid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to issues affecting individuals. The

Minister,  in  his Budget speech, stated that only  employees

will be eligible for the Supplementary Retirement Scheme.  It

does  not  appear that any provision has been made  to  allow

entrepreneurial  business owners, such as  the  self-employed

like sole proprietors and partnerships, to take advantage  of

this  scheme.   It appears strange that the scheme  does  not

apply  to SME entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks  in

the  prime  of their life.  There is no guarantee that  their

ventures will succeed. There is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>

no  certainty  that  having risked it all,  they  would  have

enough for their old age. As it is, the CPF contribution rate

for  the self-employed is already capped at $14,400 per year.

Is  this  enough  for them in the long-term?  What  if  their

businesses  do  not  prove  to  be  successful  in  the  next

recession?   Should  we  try  to help  them  build  up  their

reserves  as  well?  Depriving entrepreneurs of the  old  age

safety  net  may  not be the way to forge a more  risk-taking

mentality  among  Singaporeans. We need to  support  them  by

putting  in  place  provisions to facilitate  their  personal

financial  planning for old age. We need to ensure  that  any

Government  initiative  does not indirectly  prejudice  their

ability  to  achieve long-term personal financial goals.  For

these  reasons,  we  should make the  scheme  open  to  self-employed entrepreneurs in addition to employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Government's desire to create a more

innovative   business   environment   and   consistent   with

remuneration  trends  in the world of technopreneurship,  the

Government  has introduced provisions governing the  taxation

of  employee stock option schemes. The business community, as

a  whole,  is encouraged by the Government's plan to  improve

the  tax  treatment of such schemes and has much  focused  in

this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this scrutiny, we need to carefully consider

how best to motivate companies to make more widespread use of

such schemes when warranted and we need to determine how best

to  motivate key employees in an organisation to  take  long-term  stakes in the company they work for.  We have  seen  in

the  past  how  speculation, be it in the share  counters  or

properties, destabilises and undercuts the society's economic

and  social progress. We need policies that encourage  people

to  take  a longer term view of things.  I, like the rest  of

the  business  community, will wait  with  interest  for  the

details  in  respect of the stock option scheme.  However,  I

would encourage the Ministry to improve the taxation of  such

schemes  to encourage the long-term development of the  stock

option schemes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides proposing tax initiatives to face the challenges

in  the economy, I would also like to very briefly comment on

a  few  other  issues.  The first is the need to  review  the

threshold  parameters  for  estate  duty.  For  example,   in

relation  to estate duty, the use of $600,000 as a  threshold

for non-property exemption seems to be inadequate. After all,

the  $600,000 is inclusive of CPF which nowadays, as a result

of  higher  income  and better investment  opportunities,  is

easily  achieved.   The current exemption scheme  appears  to

favour  the  very wealthy, or at least those with significant

property    ownership   and   their   investment   portfolio.

Consideration  should be given to revising upwards  the  non-property  exemption  to allow or, more radically,  abolishing

estate  duty  on  all non-property assets  and  allowing  for

estate  duty to be levied only on real properties passing  in

excess   of,   say,   $9  million.   This   would   encourage

Singaporeans to adopt a wider investment strategy rather than

to be overly tied down and exposed to the property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern deals with the personal reliefs

generally.  Such reliefs do not appear to have kept  up  with

the  times.  We have introduced business tax measures to keep

up with the move towards technopreneurship in the economy. We

should  consider measures to keep up with changes in society.

For instance, the personal income threshold of $2,000 for the

wife  relief  does not appear realistic given  the  financial

pattern  of today's families.  I suggest that we look closely

at  the  current programme of personal reliefs  to  determine

where  improvements can be made.  One area which seems to  be

of concern to a growing number of Singaporeans is the cost of

medical  treatment  for their ageing parents.   Perhaps,  the

personal  tax  system can be used to help alleviate  some  of

their concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to propose the topping up of

students'  Edusave accounts to encourage  PC  ownership.   We

want  to  encourage our students to be more  IT  savvy.   Not

every  student can afford a personal computer.   While  there

are personal computers in schools, the IT

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>

exposure of the students without personal computers  at  home

is very much restricted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, IT has increasingly become an integral part of how

we  educate  our  next generation, both  during  and  outside

school  hours.  In this regard, we should level the  learning

field  for our students by giving each and every student  the

opportunity  to widen their learning experience  through  the

use of a personal computer. We should make personal computers

an  essential  part  of the home, as much as  telephones  and

television  sets are.  For this purpose, I suggest  that  the

Government consider granting topping up of students'  Edusave

accounts  to  subsidise or pay for the purchase  of  personal

computers.  The  top-up can be reviewed five years  later  to

keep up with the changes in computer technology.  This amount

in  the  Edusave  account will be for  the  sole  purpose  of

allowing  students to own a personal computer  at  home  such

that  a programme can be put in place by the school to effect

learning at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, I cannot help, just like my other

colleagues  here,  but notice the glaring  disparity  between

what  was  budgeted last year and the eventual  out-turn.   I

understand  that  the  V-shaped  recovery  is  remarkable.  I

understand that revenue collection has not fallen  last  year

and  that  development expenditure intended to stimulate  the

economy  is  no longer required. What all this  adds  to,  of

course,  is  that  we  have  over-budgeted  last  year  under

exceptional  circumstances. But when I cast my eyes  back  to

the previous Budget estimates, I wonder if the Government has

developed  a  trend  of  over-budgeting,  albeit  in  smaller

amounts.   I wonder if the buffer built into previous  Budget

estimates   could  have  arisen  out  of   a   mentality   of

conservatism and safety nets.  A conservative mentality  that

was,  and  probably  still is commonly  associated  as  being

symptomatic of the bureaucraticism in the civil  service.   I

hope  not.   But  it is a side message emanating  from  over-budgeting.   I  hope not because in order to adequately  meet

the  millennium challenges head on, we need both the  private

and the public sectors to be more rigorous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>

and  less risk-averse. The Government should lead this change

to   promote   this   renewal  and  stance  for   Singaporean

entrepreneurs to factor-risk into their business strategy and

the  Government should send the correct messages through this

budgeting process.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of

the Finance Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance, Dr

Richard Hu, said that about 65% of individuals no longer  pay

income tax and would not benefit from income tax rebates.  To

assist people in this group, the Government will continue  to

grant  rebates  on HDB service and conservancy  charges,  and

rents.   At the same time, they will also enjoy the utilities

rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that this kind gesture of the

Government  will  enable the people of Singapore  to  realise

that  the  Government is very caring and is full of humanity.

I commend the Government for continuing to help this group of

Singaporeans as our economy recovers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also announced that taxpayers who

stay  with  their parents and grandparents will enjoy  higher

tax relief, and the tax relief will be increased by $500,  to

$5,000.  And also from the Year of Assessment 2001, taxpayers

who  top  up  in  cash  to  his  grandparents'  and  parents'

retirement  accounts  will  be allowed  a  tax  relief.   So,

irrespective  of  the  amount  granted,  the  Government  has

clearly indicated that it wants to maintain the tradition  of

family  core  values  to deal with our problem  of  an  aging

population.  This rebate will help to promote family cohesion

and  family  harmony and to encourage maintenance of  parents

and  grandparents.   The message of the  Government  is  very

clear and precise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also announced another scheme, ie,

our  people  are allowed to contribute voluntarily  over  and

above  their  CPF  savings  to the  Supplementary  Retirement

Scheme  with  tax  being payable only when  the  savings  are

withdrawn,    and   participants   will   have   considerable

flexibility  investing  their  savings.   I  think  this   is

attractive  to  the higher income Singaporeans.   However,  I

urge  the  Government to also consider giving more favourable

terms  to Singaporeans who are in the lower and middle income

groups,  such  as giving them a higher interest rate,  higher

than the bank's interest rate so that those Singaporeans  who

are  in  the  lower and middle income group who  do  not  pay

income  tax would also benefit from this scheme.   This  will

make  sure  that  the people in the lower and  middle  income

group will have higher CPF savings in their old age and  this

will also help to solve and deal with our problem of an aging

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our economic recovery, the Government has

decided  not to grant the 10% income tax rebate as was  given

last  year,  but  to  give only 5% rebate  this  year.   Many

Singaporeans  are  disappointed.  They  said  that  with  the

recovery  of  the economy, our CPF cut has not been  restored

and   yet  our  income  tax  rebate  was  reduced  by   half.

Therefore,   they   had   a  misunderstanding   against   the

Government.   I  can  understand  their  feelings  and  their

sentiments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since our independence, we have gone

through  four  economic crises and economic  recessions.   We

have,  fortunately, been able to weather through this  recent

Asian  financial crisis.  And under the Government's  prudent

management,  instead  of a $5 billion  deficit  in  our  1999

budget,  we  had actually a $3.2 billion surplus.   This  was

because  our people and the Government have worked   together

in  one  heart to battle this financial crisis.   However,  I

feel that the top up of $250 to our CPF account is good,  but

not  enough.  We should commend our people and give them more

positive  incentive  rewards.  I think the  best  way  is  to

immediately  consider restoring their CPF contributions  even

in  a  gradual  manner.  I feel that at this  moment  we  are

actually  going  into a period of high economic  growth.   We

have emerged from the bicycle era in the 1960s to the F16 era

now.    Now   that  our  foreign  reserves  are  steady   and

increasing, I think so long as the people and the  Government

can  work hand in hand, we would be able to grab hold of this

opportunity,  and the 21st century will be  a  high  economic

century for Singapore.  I personally feel that we should also

gradually  restore the CPF to our people so that  people  and

the  foreign investors will have  more confidence in  us  and

then  our  F16s  will  be  able to perform  better  and  more

successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the Government reduced the corporate tax to 26%

and from FY 2001, it will be further reduced by 0.5%, so that

our  corporate tax will be reduced to 25.5%.  This is a  very

wise decision.  This will enhance our competitiveness in this

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the competition in the region getting more and more

intense,  many  developing countries,  in  order  to  attract

foreign  investments,  are reducing  the  corporate  tax  and

giving  tax waiver for a certain number of years.  Therefore,

in  order to maintain our competitiveness, I think we  should

further  perfect  our GST system, ie, to pay  more  when  you

consume  more, so when you use less, you pay less.  When  GST

becomes our main source of revenue, we should consider

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>

further  reducing  the corporate tax and individual  personal

tax,  so  that  we  may  attract more foreign  companies  and

foreign  talents  to  Singapore, and  to  contribute  to  our

economic  development so that we would  be  able  to  compete

actively in the international arena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Finance Minister's proposal to

further  improve  the  stock option scheme.   Many  developed

countries  have realised that the stock option scheme  is  an

important  factor  to retain talents in a company.   And  now

with  competition  getting  more and  more  intense  in  this

region,  I  think it is very important that  we  be  able  to

retain  our  team  of talents.  Because the talented  people,

whether   they   are   the   CEOs,   scientists,   engineers,

researchers, technicians, MBAs or even an ordinary  staff  in

the  office, they would rather take the company's shares than

to  ask  for  high salaries, because they feel that  to  have

shares in the company will be something that creates a  sense

of  belonging  to  them.  If the company  makes  money,  they

should  get more benefit from it.  Of course, I feel that  we

should fix a ceiling as to how much shares they can sell off,

maybe  10%  or 20% per year at the most.  And when they  were

given the stock option and at a discount, then of course they

would have to pay tax when they sell off the shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is very important in our effort to

build  up  Singapore  as  an  international  securities   and

financial centre.  Only then many foreign high-tech companies

will  come  to Singapore for listing.  At the same  time,  it

would  also  encourage  our people  to  have  shares  in  the

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I like to mention about is how to

establish a more healthy era of creativity.  Apart  from  the

development expenditure which will be increased  by  21%  and

our  tax  system  amended  to encourage  people  to  go  into

creative  work and to start business, this is something  that

is  truly  commendable.   I  personally  feel  that  when  we

encourage  the  people  to go into business,  we  should  not

create  misunderstanding.  We should not let  the  people  go

into business impulsively or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>

blindly.   They  should  understand what  is  their  ultimate

purpose of going into business.  We should not encourage them

to  go  into business like a swarm of bees with the  thinking

that  everyone can make money and everyone can be a Sim  Wong

Hoo.   Then  this will be ridiculous.  However, if  they  can

make  good money and have great wealth because of the success

in  their enterprises, then, of course, it is well and  good.

However, I can only see young people going into business with

the  objective  of  making more money and  wealth.   This  is

wrong.  In the next five to 10 years, if we have successfully

created  a  new society, then it will be a very materialistic

society  where everyone just goes for money and greed.   This

is  not something that we want to see.  Therefore, because of

this,  I feel that when we are encouraging the people  to  be

enterprising,  we should also lead the young  people  in  the

right   direction.   First  of  all,  they   must   have   an

understanding  of  themselves before  they  create  business.

They  must have this human factor.  They must have the talent

and the wisdom to go into the business.  Of course, nowadays,

we  have many young talents.  They have this first condition.

I think this is something that is beyond doubt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this human factor, we must find out whether

the surrounding environment is conducive to their starting  a

business.   In  this  respect, the Singapore  Government  has

encouraged people to venture into business and to go regional

or  global.  The Finance Minister has amended our tax  system

to  encourage our people to undertake creative  work  and  to

have  the entrepreneurial spirit.  This is something that  is

clear  for everyone of us.  Whether or not they will be  able

to  raise enough capital to start their own business, this is

again  something that the Government should help.  Of course,

there  are  lots of venture fund schemes to help  them  solve

this  problem of shortage in capital to start their business.

With  the human factor and a conducive environment, the  next

thing is to look for opportunities, ie, the right timing.   I

think timing is very important.  It is like when to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>

produce  and what type of products to satisfy the demands  of

the  consumers.   As  for  products,  whether  designing   or

manufacturing, do they really understand the  market  for  it

and  what will be the competition?  These are things that the

young  people will have to carefully consider before they  go

into  business.   So,  when we see these  people  going  into

business  like  a swarm of bees, I feel that they  are  going

into  business  with the belief that by just  setting  a  few

dot.com  companies, they will become Sim Wong Hoo  in  a  few

months'  time.   This  is very unrealistic  and  very  naive.

Money  does  not come so easily.  They do not fall  from  the

sky.   So,  when the young people go into business,  even  if

they  have the aforesaid conditions, they are only  the  pre-requisites.   It  is still a long way before they  can  taste

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I want to say is that if they are

enterprising just at a moment's impulse, then it will not  be

sustained  and it will wither away very easily.  The  Silicon

Valley was not established in this way.  Even if you have the

pre-requisites,  it  does not mean you  will  be  successful.

Therefore,  we have to consider all the complicated  problems

that  you may encounter after you have started your business,

whether you have the will power to fight on, whether you will

give  up  half-way, whether you would get up again after  you

have  failed.  You must also understand that success  is  the

accumulation of many failures.  Your dreams are  nothing  but

just  a  fantasy  in  your  mind,  you  will  never  succeed.

Furthermore,  you  will have to know whether  you  have  this

business acumen, whether you are sensitive about the  market,

when  to  get  in  and when to get out, how to  analyse  your

business operations, how is your inter-personal relationship.

These are all very important factors to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people must understand what is the highest

objective  that you should pursue.  A successful entrepreneur

will pursue a sense of satisfaction, the achievement in their

business  and  a  sense of mission and not  just  money.   Of

course,  if you are successful in your business, if you  have

money, so long as you do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>

womanise, gamble or not greedy, you will have enough money to

live through life.  But a successful entrepreneur goes for  a

sense  of  satisfaction in the achievement of their  business

and  a  sense  of  mission  to  the  society.   This  is  the

intangible  wealth  that  is inexhaustible.   Of  course,  an

entrepreneur will have the imagination, the courage  and  the

vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people going into business would of course want

to  make  money.  But we do not want just to make  a  lot  of

money and pay a lot of taxes.  We have also to return some of

our  moneys  to society to help those who are less  fortunate

than us.  Of course, the pursuit of wealth is not a sin,  but

we  must  understand  benevolence and wealth.   There  is  no

conflict between them.  Only the very rich can exercise great

benevolence.  Our forefathers in the business world like  Tan

Kah  Kee and Lee Kong Chian are great entrepreneurs but  they

have  contributed a lot in helping our society.  But  at  the

moment  I can only smell  young people going like a swarm  of

bees, just to make money.  This is indeed a profound regret.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must say that in order for Singapore to

flourish,  we  must  have a very good culture  in  our  civil

service.    First  of  all,  I  must  declare  my   interest.

Recently,  I  invested with a friend on a type of  electronic

product.   It  is something invested by a young  Singaporean.

It  is  what we call "creative cracker".  It is not the  real

cracker, no gun powder and no danger.  Once we announced  the

invention of these creative crackers, the police told us that

we  cannot  sell  them.   We submitted our  application.  The

Government's response was very fast.  The Police was helpful.

But  when  it went to the Ministry of the Environment,  noise

pollution was not a problem.  It can be accepted.   But  they

say  this  creative  cracker will let  out  a  lot  of  paper

fragments  and  they  will litter the public  areas.   So  it

becomes littering.  They pushed the buck and finally it  went

back to the police.  I feel that if it is just a question  of

littering, you can make rules and say you must clean  up  the

paper  fragments.  Why  must you push away  such  a  creative

invention?  Finally, it just died a natural death.  This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>

not  an  environment in which the Government  is  encouraging

creative   enterprise.   Many  of  our  civil  servants   are

inflexible.  When the rules say you cannot do this,  then  of

course you cannot do it.  When there are no rules to say  you

cannot do, yet you are not allowed to do it.  I hope that our

civil servants would not just say, if there is no U-turn, you

cannot  turn.  Only if there is a U-turn sign, then  you  can

make  a U-turn.  But if there is no U-turn sign, think  about

it.  Do not do a U-turn but turn into a side road, make a  3-point turn and go on.  This is creative!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently announced the setting up of

Enterprise Challenge Trophy started by Dr Tan Chin Nam.  They

want to introduce this sort of creative spirit of the Silicon

Valley into our public service departments. We encourage  our

public  servants to keep on coming out with new ideas and  to

cultivate  our civil service with this concept of creativity.

Only  then  can  we establish a very creative entrepreneurial

society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget Statement by

the Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, seems notable to  me

for at least three reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it officially marks the turn around that our

economy  has made in this past year.  It is a marker  in  the

change of mood from the doom and gloom of last year, and  the

fresh hopes of a new year and millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the statement recognises how much our continued

recovery   depends  on  the  region  and  the  wider   world.

Singapore's  open economy can be buoyed or  brought  down  by

events  in the USA, Japan, Indonesia and other parts  of  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the statement is a budget that seeks to deal with

the effects of globalisation.  The phenomena of globalisation

increase  competition  between  companies  and  nations.   It

creates  great opportunities for some, with the right  skills

at  the right price.  For others, without such skills, it can

mean  the  end  of existing jobs and the start of  persisting

pockets of unemployment or of persistently low wages.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many economic indicators and some stock markets have

shown  marked  improvement since the third quarter  of  1999.

Some  believe the crisis is over.  I think that this  is  not

the right way to look at things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe instead that we are going to enter a period in

which  crisis  may recur.  These may be similar  to  what  we

experienced in 1997, or from a wholly new nature and  source.

There is little guarantee that the long decades of rapid  and

largely  uninterrupted growth that we and much  of  the  East

Asian region knew until the crisis will again return, whether

for  us  or  for our neighbours.  It is likely that  we  will

instead  experience a much more patchy pattern.   Some  years

will  be  better  than  others.  Some  countries  will  surge

forward  while  others  in  the region  will  struggle.  Some

sectors  of  our economy and society will prosper and  others

may experience a slow down or even extinction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the Budget of 2000 is not simply a budget for

the  new financial year.  It may in fact be seen as a  Budget

for  a  new  era.   This is a post-crisis era  in  which  new

stresses from worldwide competition and globalisation must be

addressed. This is an era in which the recovery would be real

for  some,  uncertain  for  others,  and  a  missed  boat  of

opportunity for yet others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much depends on the policies that we adopt. The

important  policies, moreover, are not just on macro-economic

and financial matters.  They relate to technology, education,

citizenship and foreign talent, rules and social  norms  that

allow  and reward risk-taking as well as to community, family

and good relations with others in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, there are special needs for financial and other

policies  that  allow  and encourage the new  knowledge-based

economy to flourish here in Singapore.  Yet, there is also  a

need  for  measures that reaffirm many important and enduring

foundations of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this setting, there are many points we must consider.

I can only touch on some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>

of these. Some relate to the general context the Minister has

set  out.  Others relate more specifically to strategies that

can be suggested to deal with the challenges of this new era.

I  shall deal first with the regional setting, and then  with

policies for Singapore.



<br><br><i>Singapore, ASEAN and the World Economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at ASEAN and the world economy, we must see

that  we have generally enjoyed a special place in the  world

economy,  as have others in the region.  They have attracted,

together  with  China,  the lion's share  of  foreign  direct

investment  that  goes to the developing  countries.   Asia's

trade,  up to the crisis, had been the fastest rate of growth

in  the  world.  In contrast, many countries in Latin America

and  Africa have known years, decades, of slow or no  growth.

ASEAN  countries, with some exceptions, have been  relatively

open  to  the  world economy.  Singapore is  the  most  fully

integrated and open of all.  Openness has, to date, been part

of our formula for success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Hu is right, therefore, in pointing to both the

developments in the world that favour our continued recovery,

and  other  events  that  may  de-rail  that  recovery.  With

openness comes both opportunity and vulnerability.  If others

do  well, we are most likely to prosper.  If others fail  and

flounder, we may well be affected.  This is the nature of the

open and inter-dependent world economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Hu has pointed out some of the major trends,

both  the upswings and possible downsides.  May I ask him  to

additionally consider three factors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors are (1) the need to renew our regionalism;

(2)  the  prospect  of  increasing economic  cooperation  and

integration in ASEAN and East Asia; and (3) the rising  price

of oil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Budget Statement, Dr Hu recognised the

rising  competition  with  China.  He  also  recognised  that

China's rise is not all negative for us all.  There are  also

opportunities if we find ways to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>

complement  investments and growth there.  The Minister  also

spoke  of problems in neighbouring countries and the relative

strength of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, may I draw him out on how the Budget

might  set  the  context  for  a  renewed  wave  of  regional

undertakings  in  China and elsewhere?  I ask  this  question

particularly  in the light of our experience  in  the  Suzhou

Industrial   Park,  and  of  the  financial   and   political

fluctuations in other countries during this crisis.  What new

ways,  if  any,  does  the Government propose  to  complement

investments  and  growth  overseas so  that  Singapore  might

benefit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister if it is time that we provided

better  schemes for our businessmen to consolidate and  write

off  losses from their overseas ventures.  Or even  to  enjoy

lower  tax  on profits they may remit from overseas ventures,

when they return these profits back to Singapore's economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all that has happened in the crisis generally and

in  Suzhou  particularly, we must recognise that  going  into

China  and other countries is subject to risk.  Yet, we  also

recognise  that these risks must be taken, if our economy  is

to  go regional, global and help sustain growth in Singapore.

It  may  therefore be a strategic step forward for the Budget

to  provide  greater financial incentive for such  risks  and

reward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some who heeded the Government's call to

regionalise  have  been badly hit by the crisis.   We  should

assist  them to renew their commitment to going regional  and

global.  New incentives would set the right signal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my second point on economic cooperation

and  integration in ASEAN and East Asia.  Sir, the Minister's

Budget  Statement  recognises the  importance  of  China  and

Japan.  Additionally, we can and should make more  ties  with

our  fellow ASEAN economies, to increase economic cooperation

and integration.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the crisis, positive steps have been taken. A

system  of  financial surveillance over ASEAN and East  Asian

economies  has begun.  There may be  a temptation to  slacken

now  the worst of the crisis seems over.  Yet, such a  system

must be continued, the vital alarm bell to signal that danger

of any recurrence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other positive steps forward taken despite the crisis

have  been  in  the  ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)  and  ASEAN

investment Area (AIA).  While these steps have been promised,

there  seem to be some negative trends.  Countries  that  are

newer  to ASEAN and the world economy and free market system,

such  as  Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, may well  have

doubts about opening up their economies.  These concerns  are

often not confined to economic matters.  They also relate  to

social, cultural and political factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I would ask the Finance Minister and

his  colleagues  in  Government to  do  more  to  assist  our

neighbours  in  making the necessary but  sometimes  daunting

transitions for these countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is both an open economy and one of the most

developed  ones  in the region.  We can and should  do  more.

This should not be as a bandage or charity, but to help build

the  expertise, capacity, infrastructure, and for  us  to  be

true  partners with our neighbours.  This is as much for  our

good  in  the longer term, as for theirs.  It would encourage

and  enable  neighbouring countries to  undertake  the  right

policy  reforms  and allow the AFTA and AIA to  proceed  more

smoothly and quickly.  I will speak more on this matter  when

we come to the estimates of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One related and further question, which is directly

under  the  Minister for Finance's purview,  is  whether  the

Minister  will  consider  more generous  tax  exemptions  for

foundations  and institutions in Singapore who  undertake  or

fund development and training projects abroad, in other ASEAN

and  Asian  countries.  Our private sector and civil  society

can play a significant role in helping our neighbouring

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>

countries.   This  can  be in small but significant  projects

such as the provision of medical care in Bintan, or assisting

environmental groups in Indonesia.  Tax exemptions  for  such

worthwhile overseas projects would encourage such good  works

and  better recognise the growing interdependence between our

society and those of our neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Finance Minister to play his part

in  continuing  and strengthening the new  ASEAN  system  for

financial surveillance.  Indeed, we might ask the Minister to

look   forward  to  a  greater  system  of  cooperation   and

coordination for financial and economic matters in ASEAN  and

East Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might also hope that the Government will proceed with

more bilateral agreements on free trade, investment, taxation

and  associated matters.  Singapore is presently  studying  a

number  of these, including those with New Zealand and Japan.

With our ASEAN partners, we are also considering an agreement

between ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand.  We should  do  all

we  can  to  proceed with these with due dispatch.   This  is

especially  given that talks in the World Trade  Organisation

have stalled.  Perhaps other regional agreements too might be

usefully explored, such as one with China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my third point on the overall context.

This is on rising oil prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is observable that there has been a sharp rise

in  oil  prices.  This may mark a reversal in the low  prices

that  the  world  has  known in these past  years.   We  will

remember  how oil prices hiked up by the OPEC cartel  in  the

1970s  caused  many  economies  to  slow  and  stall.    This

particularly affected economies such as ours which are highly

dependent on energy, and yet have little or (in our case)  no

energy resources.  May I ask the Minister how he thinks  this

trend  may affect our recovery, and what we might do to  meet

this possibility, as best we can?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself believe that much more can and should be done

to encourage greater

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>

energy efficiency in Singapore.  I will return to this  point

when  I outline my thoughts on the national economy.  But  at

this juncture, I do wish to emphasise that my call for energy

efficiency  is  not,  in  this  sense,  premised  solely   on

environmental  and ethical concerns, that I often  raised  in

this   House.   Energy  efficiency,  like  other   forms   of

efficiency, is primarily a concern about our competitiveness.

It  is  a way to enhance our economic security against sudden

shocks and rising energy prices that seem to be on the way.



<br><br><i>The Singapore Economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thus far, I have spoken about the place of

Singapore and our region in the world economy.  Now, allow me

to  turn  to  the place of all Singaporeans in  our  national

setting.   In  doing so, I will touch on three  points.   The

first  is  whether we can keep the compact of  1999;  second,

whether  we  can  provide opportunities for all  in  the  new

economy;   and,  third,  of  increasing  the  efficiency   of

government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point, the crisis saw the ouster of

leaders  in  some countries and, in others, the  betrayal  of

trust  that  people gave to their governments.  The  role  of

Singapore's Government in this context is very difficult.  We

weathered the crisis and the Government led our recovery, and

people  should  acknowledge the role of the  Government  with

gratitude.  Singaporeans have a strong and resilient  spirit,

but   good  governance  and  leadership  have  been   greatly

important for our recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, while the Government has done well, I

believe  some further explanation of the Budget Statement  is

important.  Some may otherwise wonder if the compact  between

the  Government and people in facing the crisis of  1999  has

been met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to two facts. First, that the Government

was  supposed to go into deficit, but did not.  Second,  that

the  CPF  cut  is not yet fully reinstated, yet senior  civil

servants and Government leaders will have their full pay  put

back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking for further explanations, we should

acknowledge that citizens were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>

asked to make a sacrifice in their pay, and did, and this was

real.  In contrast, the Minister announced a surplus, instead

of a deficit.  This reversed a projected $5.1 billion deficit

into  a surplus of $3.2 billion.  This is a variance of  some

$8.3 billion in total.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his statement, the Minister explained that, in part,

this  happy  state  of affairs was due to  lower  development

project  spending,  and the rescheduling  of  some  projects.

This  may  seem prudent to some.  However, the state  of  the

economy   depends  on  a  mix  of  both  public  and  private

consumption.   A  fall in Government spending  may  therefore

create  a  surplus,  but  at the cost  of  lessening  overall

demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I note that the Minister acknowledged

that  the  construction  sector remained  in  recession,  and

remains  so today.  In 1999, this sector contracted a  severe

12%,  according to the Minister's statement.  May I  ask  him

whether,  if  the Government has not held back its  projects,

part  of  this  contraction might have been avoided  and  the

construction sector helped?  What were the main or main types

of  projects  that  were  held back by  Government?   Equally

important,  how  will the unexpected surplus  be  used?   The

Minister  announced various schemes that add up to some  $685

million, but this is well short of the full surplus  of  $3.2

billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, therefore, to propose a way of spending some

of the Minister's money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation, as I have mentioned briefly, will

increase  the  divisions between sectors  in  our  societies.

Some  sectors  will  prosper  and  others  may  experience  a

slowdown.   Those with little formal training  and  education

have  less  chance to participate and benefit  from  the  new

knowledge-based economy.  This may strain our social cohesion

and  the  Singaporean ideal that all must have  a  chance  to

prosper.  We should do all we can to increase the capacity of

everyone  to  participate.   If not,  we  are  in  danger  of

breeding resentment and our own tribe of Luddites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Luddites, if you recall, was a movement in the early

19th century that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>

protested against new technology by rioting and breaking  the

new  machines.   The  use of violence  must,  of  course,  be

condemned.  But what we have to understand today is that  the

Luddites  did  not wreck machines for no purpose  or  because

they  were  against progress.  In most cases, it was  because

they  were displaced by machines and given no chance to  join

in  the  benefits  of the progress.  We must,  therefore,  be

inclusive  in promoting progress.  Thus, while some  sectors,

such  as  younger graduates and professionals or even foreign

talents, may have advantages in the KBE, we must act so  that

no  sector is completely excluded.  Worker retraining,  which

the Government initiated, is part of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe we would benefit from greater attempts to

bring  IT  and  other new skills to the mass of  people.   We

should  in this recognise that Government cannot provide  for

everyone.  I therefore ask the Government to consider  giving

all  Singaporeans  a new fund for their own self-improvement.

This  would  be open to a wide range of courses in  different

skills.   This  could  range  from  Masters  courses  at  the

university to language instruction or to computer  skills  or

basic   education.   Such  educational  schemes   should   be

recognised  as  creating assets, just as much (if  not  more)

than  buying a house with your CPF money or upgrading  flats.

This  would  be  a  fitting use for the  surpluses  that  the

Government has unexpectedly generated in 1999.  Perhaps  this

new fund might be called "EdVenture", as it is like a venture

capital for education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to close, Mr Speaker, by looking at the forward

projections for the coming year.  One item that stands out to

me  is the operating revenue of Government.  This will go  up

by  some 8.6%.  In particular, I note that manpower estimates

will  increase by some 10.8%.  That is to say, Government  is

costing us more, and civil servants are costing us more.   Of

course,  good  governments do not come cheap.  But  expensive

things  are not always better.  Most Singaporeans like  their

stuff cheap but good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in operating revenues and in manpower

costs are notable in that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>

they outstrip economic growth for 1999, which was 5.4%.  They

are  also  larger than the Government's forecasts  for  2000,

which  is  between  4.5  and 6.5%.   Should  these  types  of

expenses  grow  faster than our economy?  Or should  they  be

pegged and made sustainable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my point that we must reduce Government costs

at  all  costs.  What I am suggesting is that we  should  set

ourselves  the challenge of doing more with less -  having  a

good government, making good government better, but for less.

And  I  am asking the Government to try to do more with  less

money,  people and resources of land, water, and energy.   To

do  so,  Government should aim to be competitive, transparent

and  efficient.   This is for all resources,  but  especially

those which Singapore has in short supply, such as energy and

land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture return to my concern about

energy  efficiency as an illustration of this broader  point.

As  I said earlier, oil prices have risen and may well remain

high, or go higher.  Government and businesses can always  do

nothing more than just pass on these new and higher costs  to

their   consumers  and  taxpayers.   Or,  and  this  is   the

alternative, they can seek to be more efficient in their use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done by incentives in our Budget for the

private  sector.  Energy efficiency can also be  mandated  by

new  regulations with higher standards.  Such  measures  need

not  be  at  the forefront of technology and risk undermining

our  competitiveness.   But they can be usefully  benchmarked

against  what  other  countries with  good  records  achieve.

Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, Government itself

can set the tone for energy and other efficiencies in its own

practices and principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would hope that the Government will

see   fit  to  release  all  or  part  of  its  own  internal

interagency report on energy efficiency.  At the last sitting

of Parliament, the Senior Parliamentary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>

Secretary  in  the  Ministry of National Development,  Assoc.

Prof.  Koo  Tsai  Kee, said they might do so,  under  certain

conditions and subject to certain caveats that he did not  or

could  not  specify.  I would ask the Government to  consider

the  need  for  greater transparency and leadership  in  this

important arena of efficiency and competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a critical aspect of good governance. Not just

as  it  relates to the specific example of energy efficiency,

but in all aspects of Government policy making.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will take up and develop some of the points in my

cuts on the estimates for the various Ministries.  I hope the

Minister will consider and respond to the points that I  have

made here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayere-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.  I  am

much obliged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nominated MP, Mr Noris Ong, said that it has

become  common practice to use a single word to describe  the

budgets  in  recent years.  He used Millennium Budget,  Cyber

Budget, Withdrawal Budget, and many other words.  If  I  were

to  follow  that,  I  would call this year's  budget  an  "e-Budget".   Delivering the millennium's first  budget,  Dr  Hu

signalled  the  entry of Singapore in the world's  burgeoning

knowledge  economy.   I use the alphabet   "e"  not  to  just

describe  the new Internet economy, but rather I use  "e"  as

the  first alphabet of some of the key points that Dr Hu  has

raised  in his Budget Statement and the tax changes  that  he

announced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, e-Budget for economic recovery. This Budget

signals our region's economic recovery.  That was the  reason

why  many  found that the Santa Claus, Dr Richard Hu's  gift-sack  was much lighter relative to last year.  This has  even

led to some people to dismiss the Budget, very unfairly in my

opinion, as a non-event.  Dr Hu, in his statement, emphasised

that,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>

given  the  favourable  external environment,  and  I  quote:

"Unless  we are among the world's best, we will be  relegated

to  playing  a  peripheral role in the global economy".   And

this could be achieved through an educated and highly skilled

workforce augmented by external ("e" for external) or foreign

talent,  promoting  technoprise  or  technopreneurs,  and  by

throwing  open  our  financial services, communications,  and

power sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2000 commentators, like Price Waterhouse Coopers,

feel  that  there is not much tax incentive for skilling  our

workforce and the job has been left very much to the Ministry

of  Manpower.   They  and  others  who  feel  that  way  must

recognise  that Manpower 21 was just launched late last  year

and  that  MOM's development expenditure has increased  by  a

whooping  684% from $7 million last year to $52 million  this

year.   But  I  agree  that  the  skilling  needs  much  more

financing beyond the $52 million and much more attention from

all quarters of Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the many more "e"s of this Budget

2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-budget for Government expenditure. Sir, the Budget

book  says  that this expenditure will increase by  12.5%  to

nearly $29 billion this year.  Whereas the Nominated MP Noris

Ong, and I think Mr Simon Tay as well, pointed out that  when

the  year  is out, this 12.5% increase would really be  spent

and not seen as surpluses in the following year.  I hope that

the  Government  will make up for the less  expenditure  last

year    by   meeting   this   target   of   12.5%   increase.

Entrepreneurship  has been given more boost  through  various

incentives,  particularly for non-manufacturing  sectors  and

for  foreigners  who carry out their work in Singapore.   For

example,  the employee stock options scheme (ESOP).   Changes

have  been announced and I welcome the Government's  move  in

this  much  awaited direction to reduce taxes  for  employees

when  they  exercise  their options.  This  would  help  both

budding high-tech start-ups and established companies attract

and retain both local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>

and   foreign  talent.   Along  with  this,  employer's   CPF

restoration  of another 2% is a welcome gesture though  there

was  greater public expectation for restoration of  a  higher

percentage, despite DPM Lee's earlier announcement about  the

Government's schedule of CPF restoration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-budget for estate duty - the exemption for residential

properties    will   certainly   facilitate   many    budding

entrepreneurs  to work from their home, as  many  do  in  the

garages of their homes in the United States and Europe.  Sir,

some MPs who have spoken earlier had said that Government has

not announced too many incentives for entrepreneurs.  Against

the  background  of $1 billion that has been  set  aside  for

promoting  technopreneurship, many have  expectation  of  the

Government doing more for the entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an entrepreneurship is an entrepreneur if he finds

his  way given the facilities that the Government can provide

and  the environment that the Government can provide  is  for

the  entrepreneur to see a way through to make his  money  to

succeed  in  his  business.   Sir,  the  best  definition  of

entrepreneur is perhaps given by one American magazine that I

read  many  years ago, and they talked about the logo  of  an

entrepreneur  association in America where  it  had  a  stone

sculpture  where  a male's body up to his waist  was  already

sculptured  and he was leaning forward with a  hammer  and  a

chisel, trying to carve his own legs and putting himself into

shape.   That  is  how  perhaps  an  entrepreneur  should  be

evolved.  He does not know what is ahead but he is constantly

evolving  and  trying to make use of the  environment  before

him.    And   the   Government's  job  is  to  provide   that

environment, not to do everything for the entrepreneur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I am happy to see the changes that

the  Government has made so far and it must continue to  open

up  the facilities so that more entrepreneurs can surface  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to a few other "e"s that

relate to society and education.  Education of the young has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>

indeed  received  a significant boost.  The  operational  and

developmental  expenditure for the Ministry of  Education  is

significantly higher at 15% and 22% respectively,  signalling

our  commitment  to prepare our school-going children  for  a

knowledge economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E" for elders or senior citizens. Senior citizens will

benefit   through  this  CPF  top-up  and  through  the   new

Supplementary Retirement Scheme which appears good in concept

to  prepare Singapore for a rapidly aging population.  But as

Nominated  MP Noris Ong pointed out, there are  a  number  of

issues there and we would have to wait and see how this  will

be implemented and its full tax implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E" for extended families. Extended families will

benefit  from  increased  income tax  concessions  for  their

dependants who are their aged parents.  Let us hope that this

will  be  one  of  the additional factors in  increasing  the

number of extended families in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, almost everyone has something to gain from

this  year's  Budget.   My  congratulations  to  Dr  Hu   for

delivering not an exceptional or excellent Budget this  year,

but an efficient Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to move on to talk briefly about

the advent of the new global knowledge economy and its impact

globally and locally, and the role of our Government in  this

regard.  The Internet economy is rapidly changing the way  of

life  for  people the world over.  New developments  are  not

only happening every day but every morning and afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet economy, through the equity, money and

debt markets, has been the catalyst in the redistribution  of

wealth  of  legendary proportions.  Let me relate a  folklore

that  is familiar to all of us here:  Robin Hood and his band

of  merry men stole from the rich to feed the poor.  Over the

centuries of retelling, the Robin Hood legend grew:  peerless

archer, noble fighter against injustice and tyranny, champion

of the little guy.  A hero.  Thanks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>

to  the Internet revolution, we cosmopolitans live in a Robin

Hood  economy, where redistribution of wealth in  significant

proportions  is taking place.  It is not so much robbing  the

rich  to pay the poor, but it is not far off.  And, irony  of

ironies,  it  is  the money men, the venture capitalists  who

play Robin Hood.  Sir, I want to say that I am an advisor  to

one  of  these venture capital firms and declare my interest,

if  any.   And  the twist is that in the Robin Hood  economy,

everybody who is involved wins, at least thus far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and

South  America are the key continents that are  very  quickly

adapting  themselves to the new Internet world.  But  let  us

ask   ourselves  where  Africa  features  in  this  new  era.

Already,  Africa is far behind the rest of the world  in  the

industrial  age.  Will Africa become a victim of the  digital

divide  and  become  a digital outcast?   Or  will  there  be

resources and the political will amongst the African leaders,

to  change this sad state of affairs?  One distinct advantage

if the above problems can be resolved, is that the absence of

legacy  systems would help Africa leapfrog into the  Internet

technologies  faster.   But  at  this  moment,  I   am   very

sceptical.  This is something that the world leaders have  to

address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zooming back to Singapore, very many of our

cosmopolitans  and  our young are the  immediate  and  future

beneficiaries of this wonderful new money world, and the  new

technology  infrastructure.  And many  of  us  in  Singapore,

unfortunately,  just link the many dot.com companies  to  the

equity market and we say that this Internet economy is  going

to burst.  I like to just use this example that BG George Yeo

had used, some years ago, when he talked about pornography on

the   Internet.   He  said  that  we  should  keep  the  main

pornographic  sites out of the main streets  and  if  someone

does  go  through the alleys and the lorongs and  get  there,

well, we cannot help it the way technology is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me follow on his analogy and just make this point on

how  this Internet economy is going to move.  Suppose we were

in the age when Raffles founded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>

Singapore in 1819, or thereabout, when Singapore was  just  a

fishing  village,  and suppose there was  no  PWD,  no  state

agency  to  build roads, and if everyone who had  his  little

kampong  hut,  had to decide to put a road in  front  of  his

house,  and some of us did more extensively and succeeded  in

attracting more users to the road in front of us, and we  did

it  together with others, then we will have some  roads  that

would  become Orchard Road, others would become Shenton  Way,

and some others who might not have been more successful might

become the small lorongs, others might do it wrongly,  or  in

their  minds, might do it for different reasons, might become

the  Desker  Road.  But whatever the case, as more  and  more

people  use  a  particular road, it is going to  become  more

important  and  the  infrastructure around  it  is  going  to

develop.   And that is what the technology infrastructure  is

all  about.   As  more and more companies go into  this,  the

infrastructure is going to be there.  But when we link it  to

the  equity  markets, it is a different  phenomenon.   It  is

something  that  nobody  can  foretell.   But  the   Internet

technology infrastructure is here to stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the MPs from the private sector, who spoke

earlier,  spoke at length about what Singapore should  do  to

move towards this direction.  Personally, I think we are  one

of  the  few countries in the world where the Government  has

proactively done so many things to move us to, what we  call,

the  KBE.   And one of the MPs who spoke earlier  said  that,

although  Hong Kong had started later than us, we are  behind

because  of this SingTel-C&W HKT deal.  I think the deal  did

not come true for different reasons, and it has nothing to do

with  whether they were faster or working at Internet  speed.

I  think  it  is  much more complicated  than  that.   To  be

accurate,  some  of us who went on a Parliamentary  visit  to

Hong  Kong last year found that Hong Kong had started  almost

the  same  time  as  we did.  And Hong Kong  is  a  different

environment.   They have entrepreneurs for  more  than  20-30

years and an entrepreneur culture which we are just starting.

But  coming back, many MPs here, with the exception of a  few

like Mr Simon Tay, had said that we should not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

just  focus  on the business world.  Yes, we have to  succeed

economically.   But I think we have to be  inclusive  of  the

society at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I sat here on 25th February to listen attentively

to  Dr Richard Hu's pronouncements on the economic challenges

and  opportunities that we face in this Internet world, I was

somewhat  saddened that the important aspect  of  the  social

dimension  of  the digital divide was not being addressed  in

his  fiscal policy statement.  Perhaps, I thought it may  not

need  some  fiscal treatment at this point of time.   I  told

myself  that perhaps it would be the key point that  I  would

raise  in  this  debate.  I was however pleasantly  surprised

when  MCIT  announced a few days ago that IDA  will  get  $20

million  to  address the digital divide issue  in  Singapore.

Sir, I think it is a very good start, but much more needs  to

be done, and not just in terms of money.  Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the SBA has under its wings the National

Internet Advisory Committee (NIAC) (in both I sit as a member

of the board and committee).  The SBA and NIAC promote, among

other  areas,  the  use  of Internet for  housewives,  senior

citizens and non-working people, young, school-going children

as well. It has set up Project I-Senior and the Family Access

Network  led  by  Mrs Carmee Lim, retired RGS Principal,  and

this  has gone on for about two years.  This pioneer work,  I

would  say, is excellent, very commendable and has tremendous

challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, I estimate that the bottom 20% of the

population  can be regarded as relatively poor.  My  fear  is

that  the  digital  age  may  increase  and  accentuate  this

percentage and the number as our population grows.   This  is

compounded by two factors: a rapidly ageing population and  a

higher  computer illiteracy amongst those who are  above  the

age of 45 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I want to make is this. Singapore is

known internationally as the first country in the world to be

broadband networked completely.  There are sufficient

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

political, social and economic reasons why we need to prevent

a  digital divide in Singapore.  Can we also become the first

country  in  the world whose population is entirely  Internet

ready?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To underscore the importance of computer education for

adults  and senior citizens, I wish to ask the Government  to

consider  setting up a Ministerial Committee  with  a  social

focus that can coordinate a national drive in this direction.

Providing  money or computers is but only a first  step.  The

human  psyche,  the  apprehension,  the  fear  for  computers

amongst the older Singaporeans need much more attention.   To

support  this effort, a new multi-agency can be set up  under

the Prime Minister's Office to achieve the same.  Sir, I will

speak more on this when we consider the estimates under PMO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Dr Hu's E-Budget 2000 signals a new age.

As  we  move forward, let us remind ourselves of some of  the

axioms  that  we often hear and speak of. We  must  create  a

thinking  people  and a learning nation.   We  must  try  and

maximise   the  potential  of  not  just  every  student   or

undergraduate in our universities or schools, but also  every

citizen,  young or old, skilled or unskilled, who is  in  the

workforce, and the housewives.  We must develop and  maximise

their  potential.   Let  us not allow the  tentacles  of  the

digital age divide us.  Let us remain one nation, one  people

and one Singapore for many more years to come.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to participate in the Budget debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget tabled by the Minister for Finance is a

carefully crafted Budget, with emphasis placed on the welfare

of  the ageing citizens and the low-income families, the need

to  encourage innovation, creativity and enterprise  and  the

continued  liberalisation  of  the  financial  sector.    The

business  sector  welcomes  the  corporate  income  tax  rate

reduction  from 26% to 25.5% and the retention of  employers'

CPF contribution rate at 10%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>

until  1st April this year. The Minister has obviously shared

the concern of businessmen that, as the economic recovery has

just  begun  and not evenly spread, it is still important  to

keep   business  costs  at  a  competitive  level.   Workers,

recognising  that it is crucial to help keep  business  costs

low,   continue   to   accept  the   lower   employers'   CPF

contribution. They are somewhat compensated by rebates on HDB

service  and conservancy charges and rental rebates.   It  is

therefore  a  Budget of balanced consideration in  the  sense

that it tries to take care of the welfare and benefits of the

low-income  earners,  businessmen, as  well  as  enterprising

young entrepreneurs.  In terms of revenue and expenditure, it

is  projected to produce a surplus of $2.45 billion.  As both

operating and development expenditures are greater than those

of  the last Budget, it is relatively expansionary, which  is

necessary to support the recovery of the economy.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.48 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One emphasis of the Budget is to encourage innovation,

creativity and enterprise.  Under this heading, the  Minister

has  proposed  removing  the  restrictions  that  residential

properties  must  not  be  used  for  any  form  of  business

activities,  which is a qualifying condition for estate  duty

exemption  up  to  $9 million.  The purpose is  to  encourage

entrepreneurs who may want to work from home and  to  support

the  Technopreneur  Home  Office Scheme.   I  have,  however,

doubts on the effectiveness of the proposed removal of  these

restrictions. Technopreneurs are mostly young risk-takers who

have  new  ideas but limited financial means.  They  want  to

work from home in order to reduce the initial start-up costs.

The notion of disqualifying them for estate duty exemption as

a  result of using their residence as home office is probably

least  of  their concern.  The reason is that they are  young

and paying estate duty upon death is something very remote to

them.   As  such, the removal of the qualifying condition  is

equally least of their concern and will likely fail to excite

them.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>

therefore  do  not  see  how  the proposed  relaxation  would

support the would-be technopreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, estate duty itself has long been

regarded  as  a disincentive for greater wealth  creation  by

individuals  in  today's world. The purpose of  the  original

estate duty, which was known as death and gift taxes, was  to

reduce  inequalities in the distribution  of  wealth  and  to

prevent large estates passing from one generation to the next

generation.  The rationale behind is therefore social and not

for  revenue generation. However, the social reason to retain

estate duty may no longer be valid in our present context. We

do  not  subscribe to the philosophy that income  and  wealth

distribution should be completely equal for individuals.   In

fact,  we  support  greater rewards to individuals  who  work

harder  and contribute more to economic growth.  Furthermore,

in  Singapore,  there  are not too many large  estates  which

warrant their being broken into smaller estates.  In the  few

cases  which  we  may  have  had,  the  natural  process   of

inheriting  estates by a number of children will break  large

estates  into  smaller ones.  This, to some extent,  fulfills

the aim of the estate duty legislation without the agony of a

complicated administrative process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, the collection amount is small and

relatively   insignificant.   In   Singapore,   the   revenue

collected from estate duty was $45 million, out of the  total

revenue of $15,628 million in 1998, which was only 0.28%  and

was the smallest tax item.  In addition, estate planning will

further minimise the collectable amount of estate duty.  This

includes the setting up of trusts and holding companies which

are  effective in avoiding tax payments.  But the setting  up

of  trusts and holding companies itself is a tedious  process

and it involves large amounts of legal costs.  Perhaps, it is

timely to review the estate duty ordinance to see whether the

Act  should be revised further, or whether estate duty should

be exempted for residential properties, irrespective of their

values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may argue that most people are not liable

to pay estate duty as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>

the  exemption amount of $9 million for a residence is  high.

But  the  agony of assets being frozen for investigation  and

valuation is an unnecessary burden to bear.  In his reply  in

the  old  Parliament  Chamber  on  26th  November  1998,  the

Minister  promised  to  consider introducing  legislation  to

exempt  small estates, and to give an answer to requests  for

abolishing  estate  duty in the present Budget.   However,  I

have found no reference on this topic by the Minister in  the

Budget Statement.  I would therefore be very much obliged  if

the  Minister  could  share with us  his  thoughts  on  these

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this year's Budget is a cautious one.   It  is

generally  acceptable by the people in Singapore.   Realising

that  in 1997 and 1998, we faced an economic crisis,  and  in

1999   we  were beginning to recover, my constituency leaders

are quite happy with the rebates and tax exemption and income

tax  of 5% granted in this year's Budget.  The residents will

also  get  rebates  on  service and conservancy  charges  and

rentals  for their flats. On top of that, everyone  above  21

years  old  will  get  a  CPF  top-up  of  $250.  These   tax

incentives,  though cannot be described as a  big  "hongbao",

are  nevertheless  a good gift.  For the business  community,

the corporate tax has been further reduced from 26% to 25.5%.

It  is  also a breakthrough.  However, on property  tax,  the

rebate  has  been reduced from 50% to 25%.  I would  like  to

express my views on this item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, this tax rebate was geared towards high-tax

enterprises  but they neglect those hawkers  and  some  small

merchants  and traders.  In 1994, the Government announced  a

scheme   to   sell   the  hawker  stalls  to   the   existing

stallholders.  Altogether  there  were  1,627   cooked   food

hawker/market stalls.  Out of these, 299 cooked food and  189

market  stalls  were sold.   After they have purchased  their

stalls,  the  hawkers who took the loans from the  commercial

banks,  the repayment period is 10 years and up to a  maximum

of 15 years. Some stallholders purchased their stalls in 1994

on a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>

20-year  lease.  After operating for six years, they  decided

to  quit  and wanted to sell the stalls. They could not  find

anyone  to  take over because the banks were not prepared  to

provide  the  loan as the lease had only 14 years  remaining.

Therefore,  the stallholders have no choice but to  carry  on

with  their  business  at  the  stalls.   These  stalls   are

scattered  in housing estates and their customers are  mainly

HDB  flat dwellers.  The hawkers have to raise prices to cope

with  the  high overheads and this has affected the residents

there. Many stallholders told me that they had to pay  $2,500

to  $3,500  in property tax and the monthly payment  is  from

$250  to  $300 which is more than the rental which they  were

paying prior to the purchase of the stalls.  They were paying

rentals  at $160 per month only.  This is a big headache  for

them.  This is in addition to the loan payment they  have  to

make to the bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market stallholders particularly are finding it

difficult to make ends meet. Their operating hours  are  very

short,  that  is,  from 7 am to 10 am. So  I  hope  that  the

Government can give more rebates on property tax to them.  If

they  could get 50% rebate, it would be better, or else  they

should  revalue  their stalls and then  give  them  more  tax

rebate on property tax.  If the stallholders find that  their

burden  is  too heavy, this will defeat the original  aim  of

selling the stalls to them.  On the other hand, residents  of

HDB estates will have to pay higher prices, thereby adding to

their  burden.   Therefore, I would  urge  the  Minister  for

Finance to consider giving them special treatment on property

tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the clan associations have to

pay quite high property tax.  Singapore is a multi-racial and

multi-religious  society.  In order to forge racial  harmony,

to  live  together  and to build a harmonious  society,  clan

associations  have  made  tremendous  contributions  in  this

regard.   Before we set up grassroots organisations and  RCs,

the  clan  associations have already done  a  lot  to  foster

racial  harmony  between the different  races  in  Singapore.

Even today, in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

midst of prosperity in Singapore, our clan associations still

play a very important role.  There are many clan associations

in  Singapore  like the Lee Association, Wu Association,  Tan

Association  and  so  on  and  so  forth.   All  these   clan

associations have done a lot for their members and they  have

carried   out  various  activities  for  their   members   to

strengthen  the  cohesiveness  of  their  members.   This  is

beneficial to our national solidarity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a clan association conducted a seminar to

discuss  their  common problem of having  to  pay  very  high

property  tax  on their premises.  Property  tax  is  levied,

based  on  the commercial rates of the buildings.  Therefore,

we  hope the Government will give them special treatment.  Of

course,  if these associations make use of certain  areas  of

the  premises for other purposes, then they should  be  taxed

according to commercial rate.  But if these premises are used

for  their own purposes and for conducting social activities,

a  lower property tax should be levied on them or no  tax  at

all.   These  associations' revenue depends on the management

committees  and  members'  subscriptions  or  from  voluntary

donations.   However, they have to pay income  tax  on  these

donations.    Therefore,  the  council   members   of   these

associations hope that the Government can accord them special

treatment,  because  the  activities  they  carry   out   are

charitable  in nature.   It is not profit-making.  Therefore,

these  revenues should not be taxed at all by the Government.

I  hope  the Government will consider the two points  that  I

have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make use of this opportunity to

congratulate our Minister for Finance and the Government  for

turning a projected deficit of $5.1 billion into a surplus of

$3.2  billion.  I would like to applaud them for this special

feat.  This is also a testimony to their sound management  of

our  economy  and our finances.  I would like to congratulate

the  Minister for Finance and I hope that we will accrue more

surpluses in the next financial year.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun Bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun Bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I

support the Budget tabled by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>

the  Minister  for  Finance.   I  wish  to  congratulate  the

Minister  for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, on the announcement  of

this  year's  Budget Statement in which he announced  several

measures  which I think could foster family spirit among  our

younger  generation.  I am referring to the incentives  given

not only to parents but also to grandparents, and at the same

time  foster a three tier family unit that includes children,

parents and grandparents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look carefully at the financial incentives given

to  children  for maintaining their parents and grandparents,

it  may sound odd.  It seems that these measures encourage  a

materialistic culture among our young generation.   In  fact,

if our children could look after the welfare of their parents

and  grandparents without the financial incentives, we should

be  thankful, because it is something ideal that we dream of.

However, in reality, it would only remain as a dream  because

without such financial incentives, I think it is not easy for

us   to  encourage  our  young  generation  to  shoulder  the

responsibilities   of  looking  after   their   parents   and

grandparents.  This, however, should be an embedded value  in

our young generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad that attention was also given to the low-income earners who could not afford or are helpless in

looking  after  the  welfare  of their  parents  through  the

ElderCare Fund.  This is because the low-income earners often

face  hardship  in  their  life.  To maintain  themselves  is

already  a problem; what more if they have to look after  the

welfare of their aged parents who require medical attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to propose that more

Malay/Muslim  homes for the aged be set  up  in  one  or  two

years'  time  to  meet the future needs of  the  Malay/Muslim

community.   It  is not my intention to encourage  the  young

generation  to place their aged parents in these  homes.   In

fact, I feel that the addition of these homes is necessary to

meet the needs in the next five or six years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, by encouraging more Singapore citizens to

upgrade  their  skills  and secure better  jobs  with  higher

income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>

would  lower  the  number  of low-income  earners  among  the

Malay/Muslim community.  Once this is achieved, there  is  no

need  to  increase  the number of homes  for  the  aged.   In

addition, the proposed Supplementary Retirement Scheme  (SRS)

would  hopefully be able to meet the needs of  the  retirees.

However, this objective may not be achieved in 10 years' time

and,  as  such,  I  feel  that while  waiting  for  a  better

situation  in the next 10 years, the addition of one  or  two

more homes for the aged is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Monthly Digest of Statistics, it

is   estimated  that  about  15,000  Singapore  citizens  die

annually.  Their deaths are due to various diseases   -   old

age,  accidents,  homicides  and  so  on.   What  I  wish  to

highlight  here  is  the  deaths  caused  by  road  accidents

involving vehicles and innocent people as a result of drunken

driving  and deaths by accidents.  We found that  200  people

have  died, 396 with serious injuries and over 8,500 suffered

minor  injuries.  From the 200 people who died, we  were  not

able  to  identify how many were due to drunken driving;  and

the fights that took place at coffeeshops, hawker centres and

at homes which were all due to excessive alcohol consumption.

Drug addicts who could not get drugs would indulge themselves

in alcohol consumption and when they become drunk, they cause

social  problems  by  committing  theft,  housebreaking   and

outraging  modesty.   As  such, I  wonder  why  there  is  no

increase  in  the  tax on alcohol.  I hope  the  Ministry  of

Finance   would   consider  my  proposal  so   that   alcohol

consumption could be reduced and our youths will  find  it  a

pinch  when buying and consuming alcohol.  On the other hand,

this  will increase the revenue of the Government from $343.1

million   to   possibly  $500  million  a  year.   Otherwise,

alcoholism will be a way of life for our youths to show  that

they  are "cool" and somebody.  And what will happen  to  our

youths in future when they indulge in drinking alcohol?

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in

1998, we experienced the full impact of the regional crisis

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

and economic growth had slowed sharply to 1.5%.  In 1999, the

Minister  in his Budget Statement cautioned another difficult

year   ahead.   In  the  end,  we  registered  a   remarkable

turnaround and achieved that overall growth of 5.4%.  I would

like  to  register  my  gratitude to  the  Minister  and  the

Government  for having so ably steered Singapore out  of  the

Asian economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general response to the Budget 2000 is "Nothing

dramatic".   The dominant sentiment is this: if the  business

measures  adopted  in  the 1999 Budget  had  yielded  such  a

remarkable  V-shaped recovery, what are the reasons  for  not

continuing with the measures for another 12 months  to  allow

those  sectors already rebounded to reap an even higher level

of growth while giving more time for weaker sectors, like the

construction, financial services and businesses to get out of

their  recession?  The decision to stop these incentives  and

rebates  which  are particularly significant  to  these  weak

sectors  seems  difficult  to understand  when  we  weigh  it

against an unexpected budget surplus of $3.2 billion in FY99,

a  forecast  of economic growth between 4.6% and 6.5%  and  a

budget surplus of $2.5 billion in FY2000.  We need some  very

good explanations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many would agree with the Government that we need

to  live within our means and accumulating surpluses in order

to deal with sudden downturns again, many would query how the

Government balances the gains by taking back the goodies  and

the  possible  losses  to  the  private  sector  which  needs

continuing  fiscal support for just another  12  months.   If

these  firms  cannot  make  it  for  FY2000,  what  are   the

implications  for employment and family well-being?   Is  the

Government  prepared  to pick up these  companies  when  they

fail, or is the Government going to let them vanish, sticking

by  the  cardinal  law of the survival  of  the  fittest  and

ablest?   Sir, many companies do not belong to this category.

Hence,  we need the Government to play a stronger, supportive

role.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn to the social and community sector.

While  observing that the overall expenditure priorities  for

the  social and community services account for 39.6%  of  the

total  expenditure, or an allocation of $11.5 billion, it  is

education,  public  housing,  health  and  environment  which

receive  a larger chunk of the allocation.   These are  well-deserved  investment, Sir.  MCD, on the other hand,  receives

only  5%  of the sector allocation followed by MITA receiving

3%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the allocation of $610 million to MCD

registered a substantial increase of 38% over the last  year,

and   within  the  MCD,  the  Elderly  Development  Programme

benefitting an increased allocation by 55% to $12.3  million,

the feeling in the community is that the Government could  do

more.   Within  the perspective of the family  and  community

services  being  seen  as central heartware  institutions  to

create the level of cohesiveness for Singapore to function as

a  competitive  economy, $610 million  spent  on  operations,

People's Association Programme and delivering social services

and  sports  facilities to a population of 3.8 million  which

averages  a per capita annual expenditure of $160  per  head,

totalling  a  monthly  $13 per head,  are  clearly  not  over

generous.   I  would like to know how we fare  compared  with

other countries, if the Minister could provide the figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, our ageing population will need

specialised  care services and personnel which are  expensive

to  develop and sustain.  Without the many helping hands from

the  community and the private sector, this budget allocation

to  MCD  cannot  cater  to  the needs  of  the  disadvantaged

families,  the  young,  the  old,  the  vulnerable  like  the

disabled and the intellectually challenged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many loving and willing hearts, Sir, but the

community donors and volunteers are stretched.  The same fund-raisers are chasing the few generous donors and the needs are

forever  expanding, with more and newer services required  to

attend  to the emerging needs of a complex society.  Can  the

Government please look into its funding principles for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>

social  and  community  services in particular,  and  respond

generously  to future recommendations put forward by  various

community  agencies,  not only those working  on  the  ageing

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is indeed a feeling that not enough is done for

restoring family wellness, not enough is committed  to  youth

activities  and  interests, even less  is  provided  for  the

disadvantaged and dysfunctional families with multiple social

problems.   As to developing research competence to  help  us

identify   new   concepts  and  methods  in  organising   the

community, our resources and effort leave much to be desired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will ask how much is enough and caution me

that  giving more to one Ministry will mean less for  another

equally  worthy  programme, that I must  always  assess  what

counts and what matters in the overall scheme of development.

But  I urge the Government to look at people's needs, not  at

cost allocation alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that investment on social fundamentals in

matters  related to the family and the community is a process

of  enhancement intrinsically important in themselves,  while

serving  as  a  significant supplement to a market  mechanism

which  leaves many struggling behind in the development race.

After  all,  Sir, economic growth at 5.4% a year  only  means

progress  if  we use more of the money to allow  families  to

lead the kind of lives which they have reason to value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister that MCD, like any other

Ministry,  must get the most out of their allotted  resources

by  managing  them  well  in order  to  achieve  the  desired

outcome.   However,  community  programmes  that  deal   with

dysfunctional   families  and  youths,  including   eldercare

programmes  and counselling programmes for the  abused,  rape

victims and violent perpetrators do not yield easily tangible

and  immediate outcome, and they are not easily  audited  and

measured.   This  is  not to say that the Ministry  must  not

attempt  to  do  so, but the exercise requires  a  tremendous

amount of human and research resources.  Our habitual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>

pragmatic scrutiny of outputs and tangible outcome very often

make  us  fail to respond with open mindedness and  accept  a

level  of  "untidiness" in the community sector.  Because  of

this  nature  of complexity, all the more we need  to  commit

energy,  resources, skills and time to level up services  and

involve community participation in developing an audit  blue-print to set best practices and performance indicators.   The

easy  part  in  project planning is spelling out  the  social

objectives.  It is less certain that we are able to agree  on

clear  indicators that are understood and shared by different

Ministries  and the people sector.  Sir, this has  to  be  an

evolving process and we need more resources to set the  right

directions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I noted the decrease in budgeted development

for  MCD by 15.4%.  This year, I am pleased to note that  the

development  expenditure of MCD registers  a  98.6%  increase

over FY 1999 and many community projects are in the planning.

I  hope  the Minister for Community Development and his  team

will  continue  to  heed the appeals from the  community  and

Members of this House during the debate on the estimates  and

champion our causes before the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy

Speaker, for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is indeed a conservative and a prudent

budget.   The  economy has recovered.   How  else  could  the

Government  finances show a turn around of $8.3 billion  last

year  -  from  a  projected deficit of  $5.1  billion  to  an

unexpected  surplus of $3.2 billion?  Yet, in spite  of  this

unexpected sterling performance of the economy, the  Minister

has  seen  it fit to remove or reduce almost all the measures

given  in  prior years to reduce the tax burden of taxpayers,

individuals as well as corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result, as we can see, is a projected Government

surplus  of  $2.5 billion for the coming fiscal year.   Given

the  Finance  Ministry's well-known bias  of  underestimating

revenue and overestimating

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>

expenditure, this figure could well be much higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring the attention of this House

to  just one item, that of corporate taxes, as an example  to

illustrate this.  In the Budget book on page 21, the  revised

collection  in 1999 from corporate taxes is estimated  to  be

$6.2  billion.  The projected figure for FY 2000 is estimated

to be $6.75 billion, an increase of $550 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then look at the Minister's Budget statement on

Corporate Income Tax section.  In it he said that the revenue

loss  arising from the reduction in corporate tax  rate  from

26% to 25.5% would amount to $140 million.  In other words, a

0.5% reduction amounts to a loss of $140 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with this, except that we must

not forget that 1999's revised collection was estimated after

a rebate of 10% from a tax rate of 26%, or effectively a 2.6%

rebate.  This rebate has been removed from this year's budget

while  the  loss of $140 million will only take  effect  from

next year, as this drop of 0.5% will only take effect in  the

year  of  assessment 2001.  In other words, there is  a  claw

back of tax collections in this section to IRAS for this year

resulting from the removal of the 2.6% rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would this sum be? Based on simple arithmetic and

the  same  corporate  profit base, it would  amount  to  $728

million.   This  is  based  on 0.5%  is  equivalent  to  $140

million,  and  therefore 2.6% would  be  equivalent  to  $728

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, 1999's collection was based on the actual

corporate  results  in 1998, a year in which  most  corporate

profits  were  ravaged.  On the other hand, this  year's  tax

collection  would be based on last year's corporate  results.

We  all  know, Sir, that most corporations had been reporting

much improved corporate figures for last year.  Thus, I would

expect the taxable base for this year, which is based on last

year's corporate result, to be much higher than that of  Year

of Assessment 1999.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this, Sir, I expect the increase in the

collection  of corporate tax could be much higher  than  $728

million, yet the Budget book shows only an  increase of  $550

million.   I  am not against the Government taking  a  bigger

bite of the expected bigger economic pie.  But I question the

timing  of  this  policy.   We have  just  recovered  from  a

recession.    Private  sector  wealth  of   individuals   and

corporations has been badly mauled.  In the light of economic

globalisation and competition, the Government has been urging

the  private  sector  to  take greater  risks.  Sir,  a  most

appropriate and correct call, but how can the private  sector

do  this  when, at the first sign of recovery, the Government

implements  measures to nip the rebuilding  of  such  private

sector  wealth so necessary to provide the basis  for  taking

greater risks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, budgetary measures such as those in this

year's Budget are matters of judgment and timing.  Whether or

not  the  Minister's judgment to remove  or  reduce  the  tax

relief  measures  now is correct, we will  never  know.   The

removal  of these measures is not that major in that economic

growth  will be visibly affected.  All it means  is  that  we

will  have lost some time in the global competition of  being

there  first.   Unfortunately, in today's  fast-paced  global

market place, especially in the new technological engines  of

economic growth, speed and being there first is of the utmost

importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would have expected that after the recession the

Government  would use the Budget to signal  a  more  forward-looking policy for Singapore.  Unfortunately, in this  year's

Budget,  there are few such signals.  I would  thus  like  to

touch on three areas where such signals should be set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are: (1) Tax deduction for contributions to S21

programmes;  (2) Tax deduction for venture capital;  and  (3)

Closing the digital divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in S21, we have come up with a first class vision

of  what we, as Singaporeans, want Singapore to be.  We agree

that   we   should   take  a  more  participative   role   as

Singaporeans; active citizenship, civil society, helping  our

less fortunate and less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>

able fellow citizens, and so on and so forth.  All these call

for greater resources from the average Singaporeans, in terms

of willingness, time, effort and money.  While the Government

cannot,  in  the  short  term, do  much  to  promote  greater

participation in the first three areas, that is, willingness,

time  and  effort, there is much it can do to encourage  more

monetary contributions from Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government can afford to be more generous

with   the   treatment  of  tax  deductions   to   designated

institutions  and  projects.  For example, some  institutions

and  projects  could  be designated as S21  institutions  and

projects.   Contributions to such institutions  and  projects

could then qualify for double tax deductions.  Or if this  is

too generous, maybe 1.5 times tax deduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong signal will then be sent to all and sundry,

that  is,  this  is  the direction we want  to  go,  and  the

Government  will do all it can to encourage all  Singaporeans

towards  that direction.  Double tax deduction as a means  to

promote  desired  objectives is not new.  It  had  been  done

before;  with success, I must add.  Surely, it  will  not  be

misplaced in this instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, those supporting such specific

institutions and projects, though initially encouraged by the

greater financial benefit of higher tax deductions, may begin

to  identify with such institutions and projects.  With time,

ownership  and subsequent involvement then becomes that  much

easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for suggesting financial methods

to  encourage  the  attainment of the high ideals  and  goals

embodied  in S21, I know that I take on the danger  of  being

branded  as crass or gross.  How can I bring in the  idea  of

sullying S21 with Mammon?  If so, I make no apologies for it.

First, let us not forget that however crass the idea may  be,

money is a strong motivating factor.  Second, we need not  be

so  altruistic that we forgo one of the strongest  motivating

factors  to reach our objectives.  Remember that the goal  is

to get greater involvement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

and participation.  Once that goal is reached, very often the

reasons why one started to participate and be involved in the

first place are often forgotten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, we are always fond of quoting the

participation of Americans in their civil society  and  their

financial contributions to charitable and educational causes,

and  how  we should emulate them.  But how many of us realise

that  one reason for their generosity is the regime  of  high

tax rates in the United States and the tax shelters that such

generosity  creates  for  them.   Does  it  matter  what  the

original reasons are, when in the final analysis, the  nation

benefits from a more involved citizenry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these days, we are bombarded with calls to be more

entrepreneurial and to take greater risks by our leaders,  in

particular  the Prime Minister and the Senior Minister.   The

Government has also done much to develop an environment which

allows technopreneurial companies to start up and thrive.  As

a  matter  of  interest, only in last Friday's Straits  Times

Forum page, the National Science and Technology Board came up

with   a   long  list  of  initiatives  implemented  by   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point of concern addressed in this letter

was   that  of  adequate  financing  being  crucial  to   the

development of technopreneurship.  How true!  And  I  applaud

the  truism of that statement.  But what I would like to  add

is that what the Government had done is still inadequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, many a bright idea has died an untimely

death  from  the  lack of seed money.   While  there  may  be

venture  capitalists, these people would not normally finance

start-up  ideas.   Often,  they want  to  see  more  concrete

evidences of potential successes than a dreamer with an idea,

a  burning ambition and a willingness to work 25 hours a day.

Luckily for technopreneurs-to-be, before venture capitalists,

there  are the business angels, normally individuals who  are

more willing to finance dreamers with their own money.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not have enough individuals who are

prepared  to be angels.  I would certainly like to  see  more

business  angels.   With more angels,  we  will  be  able  to

support  more idealistic budding technopreneurs.  We will  be

able to build a critical mass of individuals having some form

of  financial support.  This is important as creativity  will

come from such individuals, not from corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here that I have a bit of disagreement with my

colleague,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh.   Sir,  his  call  for  more

privatisation includes clusters of funds to be managed by the

private  sector.  If this be the case, nothing much  will  be

changed.   The  rules  for  managing  other  people's  money,

whether  by the private sector or the public sector, will  be

the same.  One still has to be very prudent, very careful and

very circumspect in decision making, because you are managing

other  people's  money.  And that is why I am suggesting  the

incentives for individuals.  It is only when individuals  are

making  investment decisions with their own money  that  they

can  afford to be more generous and can afford to  take  more

risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to suggest that the tax treatment in

this  area  be  changed to encourage the  emergence  of  more

business  angels.   Under  the current  Venture  Capital  Tax

Incentive  Scheme,  the  investor  must  invest  in  approved

companies  and can only claim relief as and when  the  losses

from  the sale of shares of the venture company are incurred.

Sir, this is certainly not enough to encourage the growth  of

business angels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Government should allow relief for such

investments at the point of making the investment.  Also, the

need  for  the  venture  company to  be  approved  should  be

scrapped.   The approving process implies that EDB  can  spot

winners and losers.  I doubt very much that EDB would dare to

claim  that it can do so.  Instead, general guidelines  could

be used to ensure that abuse of the scheme is minimised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if such a scheme were to be adopted, it would bring

up two other issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that of the possible loss of too much tax

revenue. After all, the scheme as proposed creates a very big

tax shelter for high taxpayers.  To prevent this, there could

be  a  limit  on the relief given.  For example,  the  relief

could  be  limited to, say, 50% of the taxable  income  of  a

taxpayer.   It  could  also  be a  graduated  scheme,  higher

percentages  for  those with lower taxable  income  to  lower

percentages for those with higher taxable income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that of capital gains. Our current system

is  based  on  "no  deductions for investments  and  thus  no

capital  gains tax on gains from investments".  Allowing  tax

deductions for venture companies would mean that the investor

stands  to  gain from both ends; tax relief at the  point  of

making an investment and no capital gains tax at the end when

they are successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer to this issue is: why not? After all, we are

encouraging  a  speedier fusion into a new world  and  a  new

economy.  If this scheme promotes that objective, what is the

loss  of some tax dollars as compared to the benefits to  the

economy and community of the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the Government still cannot accept such

thinking  out  of the box and feels an instinctive  need  for

order  and symmetry, then I suggest a choice be given to  the

business  angel  at the point of investment.   And  this  is,

"Take  the  tax relief option now and pay capital  gains  tax

when  your  venture succeeds later.  Or forgo the tax  relief

now  and  you do not have to pay capital gains tax when  your

venture  succeeds".  Since at the point of making  investment

it  is  not  possible for the investor to  know  whether  his

investment is going to succeed or not, I think it will  be  a

fair choice to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On digital divide, I do not have to stress the

importance of this issue.  Enough of our leaders had  brought

up this issue for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>

all  Singaporeans to know that, if not resolved, it will  lay

the   foundation  for  economic,  social  and  perhaps,  even

communal   divisions,  in  the  future.   Even  the   world's

superpower  and  the powerhouse of IT and the  Internet,  the

United  States,  is  concerned about the digital  divide,  as

evidenced  by President Clinton's recent State of  the  Union

address  on  the  subject  and his  budget  proposals  for  a

multibillion-dollar   plan  to  help   poor   Americans   and

minorities  get  access  to  the  Internet  and  make  it  as

universal as the telephone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I was very pleased when the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology recently unveiled a

$25  million plan to bridge the digital divide and help every

Singaporean  go online.  At least that is the  objective.   I

just  hope  that  it would be the thin end of  the  wedge  to

seriously  address this important issue.  If so, I hope  that

the  wedge will thicken very quickly for there is so much  to

be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if the House could bear with me, I would like

to  relate a story while I was with the Monetary Authority of

Singapore.   It  was  in the late 70s and personal  computers

were  just coming into prominence.  In those days IT was  not

known as IT, not even known as IS (Information Systems).  But

in  those  days  it  was known more as EDP  (Electronic  Data

Processing),  because computers were then  mainly  mainframes

and  used  in  the backrooms for processing voluminous  data.

One  day,  we were told that every department was to  get  an

Apple  computer for its use.  The Government also implemented

a  scheme whereby public sector employees could obtain  cheap

loans  to purchase personal computers.  We were surprised  as

few of us, other than those in the Electronic Data Processing

department, knew much of computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I heard it whispered at the corridors of City

Hall and Fullerton Building that the late Mr Hon Sui Sen, the

Finance  Minister, had personally lobbied for this programme.

I heard that he was told that the staff would only play games

with the computer, as few then knew how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

to  use  the personal computer.  So why should the Government

spend this money to put computers in the department when they

would be used to play games?  His retort was reportedly this:

"Let  them  play  games, as it would teach  them  how  to  be

familiar with the computer.  However, someone somewhere  will

know something and he will use the computer for improving his

work.  And if that happens, we will progress."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was exactly what happened. The computer in my

department was first used mainly to play games, I  must  say.

Subsequently, somebody came out with a VisiCalc  program  and

also other programs and we were able to use such programs  to

improve our work.  And the rest, as I said, Sir, is history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that today in this House there are some

who  knew exactly what happened then.  I have no idea whether

the version that I have just related is true or not.  If not,

Sir,  I  stand corrected.  I hope however that I am  correct,

not  because I am afraid of being corrected but because  such

stories are the stuff of legends.  We must remember that  the

late Mr Hon was known as an extremely prudent and careful man

with  money, especially those belonging to the nation.   Yet,

for such a man to come out  with such an IT plan, even if the

computers were used to play games in Government offices,  is,

indeed,  visionary.  I think all of us in Singapore  owe  him

much.  I know I do, as I would have never purchased my  first

computer,  an  Apple  IIe, without the encouragement  of  the

loan.   And I thank him for his part in making me a bit  less

computer illiterate today than what I otherwise would be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this story is related not so much as to add to the

legend  of Mr Hon (though I hope that it does), but  more  to

illustrate  that  visionary thinking and  speedy  action  are

needed in this area.  We should be bolder, much bolder in our

plans to reduce the digital divide as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should aim for a 100% PC ownership in every home,

similar to the goal of 100% home ownership.  We should ensure

cheap  and fast access to the Internet for without such cheap

and fast access, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>

computer is just a machine and not the gateway to information

and  the  future.   We should harness the assistance  of  the

private sector through a system of tax incentives.  These are

but some of the ideas that I can come up with for the moment.

But  I  am  sure that the civil servants could come  up  with

more,  if  given  the go-ahead.  Sir, more  importantly,  the

mindset must change.  We should not make investments in  this

area  on  the  basis of economic returns alone.  Instead,  we

should   look  at  such  investments   from  a  communitarian

perspective.  If the digital divide persists into the  future

when the use of IT becomes that much more pervasive, can  our

community survive the divide?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like the Government to

reconsider   its  policy  on  the  ownership   of   broadband

electronic highways, such as those provided by cable.   Cable

modem  access to the Internet certainly is fast.  But  it  is

not  cheap.   Singapore  CableVision recently  announced  the

slashing of prices for its broadband Internet access  service

via  the  cable modem.  The reduced prices would be  $76  per

month  for those who subscribe only to the broadband service.

To  many  Singaporeans, let alone the poorer  ones,  this  is

certainly not cheap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that, to date, SCV has only about

8,000  subscribers to this service, including the  5,000  who

were on the trial service.  This means that since they opened

up  in  December last year to all and sundry, they have  only

increased it by about 3,000 subscribers.  However, so long as

SCV  continues with its high rates, there will  be  many  who

would   prefer  to  use  the  much  slower  dial-up  service,

especially  when some are provided free.  If it were  just  a

matter  of  time  spent on the computer, I would  not  be  so

concerned.   But we know that there would be  more  and  more

Internet  services needing broadband access.  If  because  of

the  high charges, many Singaporeans continue not to use  the

SCV  broadband  access, then there could  be  more  and  more

Internet services denied to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to take over the ownership of such

electronic  highways.   They are  like  our  expressways  and

should  be  publicly owned.  Internet service  providers  can

then   rent   them  from  the  Government  and  provide   the

competition  so  necessary to improve quality and  efficiency

while reducing cost to the consumer.  The events in the arena

of  the dial-up services have shown that this can be done and

would  be  done,  if only there were competition.   Moreover,

with  public  ownership, the Government  can  then  charge  a

policy-dictated price that may not necessarily be an economic

price.   The  losses  could  then  be  subsidised  from   the

Government's general revenues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the IT revolution has become too

important  for the Government to ignore and to be treated  as

simply  another area of development.  Instead, it  should  be

treated  as  an essential public service, similar to  health,

education,  housing and security.  Anything less will  be  to

the peril of our future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support of the motion standing in the name  of  the

Finance Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of business and government is dominated by

buzz words like "e-commerce", "dot com", "portals", "eyeball"

and  "Internet  economy".  But what is  Internet  economy  or

sometimes  loosely  termed  as the  new  economy  or  digital

economy?   The  truth  is  there is no  universally  accepted

definition  for "Internet economy".  Economists have  trouble

defining  what  is the new economy, let alone understand  it.

Some  used  the  term  to  describe the  combination  of  the

business  of  multi-billion dollar  Internet  companies  like

Yahoo  and American On-Line as well as the effects  that  the

Internet has had and continues to have on businesses.   Since

the  driving force on the Internet is the US, some have  gone

so far as to suggest that the Internet economy is also the US

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you know for certain is that Internet technologies

and  applications have grown more rapidly  in  the  last  few

years than any other singular event in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

human  history  and the cumulative effect of  technology  and

business transactions alone done through the Internet is  the

backbone  of  the new economy and this has a profound  effect

not  only  on our lives but governments all over  the  world.

This  new  economy has continued to surpass all  expectations

and  confounded experts and no lesser a person than even Alan

Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet economy indicators, an on-going study

of  the  Internet at the University of Texas funded by  CISCO

System,  seek to quantify the Internet economy.  It  reported

that the industry generated US$300 billion annually, grew 68%

from  the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of 1999,

accounted  for  2.3  million jobs and is  expected  to  reach

US$507 billion by the end of last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another report from the Commerce Department in the US

measured  the  "digital economy" which they  defined  as  the

value  of  the hardware and software produced by the computer

and  telecommunications industries.  It was reported that the

digital  economy accounted for 8% of America's  GDP,  a  very

remarkable figure considering how new this economy is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are mind-boggling numbers. There will be

about 250-300 million global users of the Internet by the end

of  this  year and still growing with some 65,000  new  users

every day.  Some 2,000 new secure web sites (secure web sites

are  those  set  up  by  businesses) are  added  each  month,

reflecting  the  creation of new companies  and  shifting  of

existing  businesses to the Internet.  All  these  impressive

growth  numbers  must  mean that it  is  imperative  that  we

understand the truly incredible impact the Internet will have

on  the  global  economy and Singapore's  role  in  this  new

paradigm.   The  Internet economy is an  economic  phenomenon

never seen before in human history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the Internet economy, or transactions done

through the Internet,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>

is   experiencing  exponential  growth.   Research   company,

International Data Corporation (IDC), reported that  commerce

on  the Internet is expected to top US$1 trillion by the year

2003  on  the  World  Wide  Web.  It  is  small  wonder  that

businesses are moving their capital spending into technology,

not  just among technology companies, but also those in other

mature industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, a GS Asia Web report recently released by

Goldman Sachs concluded that Internet users in Asia will grow

by  a  compound annual growth rate of 40% bringing the  total

number of Net users to 64 million by the year 2003.  This  is

about twice the growth rate of the US.  Extrapolating the  e-commerce  market in Asia is set to be worth US$32 billion  by

2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Singapore, the Gartner Group Incorporated

reported  that Singapore spent US$484 million in business-to-business (B to B) transactions and US$101 million in business-to-consumer (B to C) transactions last year.  They forecasted

that  by  the  year 2003, B to B and B to C will total  US$11

billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these huge numbers, Government's e-commerce

plans and promotion of venture capital activities, many  more

companies  are expected to jump on the e-commerce  bandwagon.

If  these  statistics are anything to  go  by,  I  think  the

Internet economy has arrived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside the social issues, the profound changes

brought  about by the Internet economy raises two key  issues

for  the Government.  Sir, the first relates to how this  new

economy  affects  Government planning and growth  forecasting

and  how  this will affect areas, such as manpower,  economic

modelling, accounting for productivity improvements  and  the

effect  of  wealth creation through high-tech  start-ups  and

stock  market listings.  The second issue posed by  this  new

economy  is the potential loss in Government revenue  due  to

losses  in  GST  and  direct taxation.  Underlining  this  of

course  is  the question of how are we prepared for  the  new

economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion of the technology era will have

implication on the manpower planning of countries hot on  the

heels  of  this  new  economy.  The  US,  for  instance,  has

experienced  changes  in  its  employment  and  wage   growth

patterns  as  a result of the rapid pace of adoption  of  new

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers on the job suffer from a lingering sense of

insecurity.   Technology  has  led  to  higher  productivity,

allowing firms to meet rising demand with the same number  of

workers.   The  remarkable growth of the US economy,  coupled

with  low inflation in the last decade, is attributed to  the

high productivity contributed by technology and the Internet.

The  rapid increase in B to B and B to C e-commerce has  also

made redundant a whole host of middlemen from car salesmen to

ticketing agents and stock brokers to insurance agents.   The

result  is  also  a  mismatch of skills and labour  shortage.

There  is  a  shortage of workers in the  new  economy  which

cannot  be filled by workers who are made redundant as  their

skills  are not what is required.  This must be a frightening

prospect  not only for workers who are not well  versed  with

technology, but for Government planners as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost every industry it touches, the Internet

changes  the role of the middlemen.  In a world in which  the

Internet  can connect everyone, it is possible for businesses

to  have  direct relationships with their clientele  and  not

rely  on  distributors.  For example, dramatic  changes  have

also  occurred in the brokerage business.  Although middlemen

remain  in the on-line investing world, they charge more  and

provide fewer services than their off-line rivals.  Moreover,

the  web  gives individuals the ability to buy stocks without

using a broker at all.  Why transact on-line?  In most cases,

it is a matter of convenience besides lower cost.  It is also

easier  to trade stocks on-line than it is to trade over  the

phone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the not too distant future, the distinction between

on-line  and  off-line  financial services  will  fade  away.

Banks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>

without  Internet web sites will be as rare as banks  without

ATMs.   Lenders  without a web presence will find  themselves

losing   market  share.    Insurers  incapable  of  providing

services  over  the Internet will shrivel.   Eventually,  not

giving  customers  the ability to check  balances,  originate

loans,  buy  insurance, or otherwise manage  their  financial

lives over the Internet will cost institutions business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no time, employers and employees will have little

alternative    but   to   seek   training   and    retraining

opportunities.    This  will  have  great   impact   on   the

Government's role and response in training and retraining and

the  role must increase in importance in the areas of  skills

development and manpower planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Macroeconomic Advisers, a St Louis-based economic

consultancy,  in  September last year, reported  evidence  of

technology's  impact on productivity.  A new  analysis  shows

that  about half of the growth in non-farm businesses  in  US

can be explained by the benefits of computer-related advances

and  investments.   The study found that productivity  growth

has recently been more than double the average since 1973 and

will remain over 2% for the next decade if current technology-investment  trends continue.  In the study by  University  of

Texas,  Internet  firms  are  impressively  productive.   The

average revenue per Internet economy worker is US$250,000, or

65%,  higher  than employees in the industrial economy.   The

automotive  industry, for example, in the US earns US$160,000

in  revenue  per employee versus US$250,000 for  an  Internet

employee.  The US Department of Commerce forecasted last year

that  almost half of the American workforce will be  employed

by information technology-related companies by the year 2006.

It  also  reported  that from 1990 to 1997,  digital  economy

companies  achieved a "robust" 10.4% average growth  rate  in

value  added  each  year per worker.  And  these  IT  workers

earned  more than non-IT workers.  Finally, just last  month,

the  US Labour Department said worker productivity rose at  a

5% annual rate during the fourth quarter of 1999, pushing the

average growth in productivity for all of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

1999  to 2.9%, the best the US has seen since 1992.  Internet

and  technology  play  a vital role in  wealth  creation  and

productivity in the US, as confirmed by these figures.   This

must have a significant impact on Singapore as well.  I think

the  Government should take this into account in our economic

modelling,  especially  in the area of  forecasting.  Are  we

working  on  too  conservative a basis if the  United  States

example  is  anything  to  go by and  whether  our  budgeting

process needs some form of an overhaul?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important issue is the impact of the new

economy  on Government revenues. This new economy  where  the

transactions  in  the  provision of goods  and  services  are

carried   out  between  faceless  individuals  and   faceless

corporations domiciled in any corner of the world  will  pose

the   biggest  challenge  in  the  collection  of  Government

revenue.   In  the area of direct taxation, it makes  perfect

good  sense  for a corporation to locate the  source  of  the

supply of goods in a tax haven just to get themselves out  of

the  reach of the tax man. This is one potential large  drain

on Government coffers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other relates to indirect taxation. How does the

Government  intend to tax every little parcel or packet  that

goes  into  a consumer home?  What about non-physical  goods?

Another  one of the key e-commerce tax policy issues  is  the

increasing  conversion  of  tangible  goods  into  intangible

goods.  At issue are products like computer software,  music,

movies, videos and even books that can be turned into digital

code  and downloaded by customers anywhere in the world.  For

example, currently if a British-based firm downloads  a  book

into a customer's computer, this will be considered a service

and  will be taxed at the United Kingdom's rate of 17.5%. But

if  this same company is based in the British Channel Islands

or  outside  the EU, it will avoid this 17.5% tax completely.

In  Europe, tax officials have proposed that products sold in

digital  form  will  be taxed on the rate in  the  customer's

country.   For  example, companies operating  in  the  United

States  would have to collect taxes on all sales to  European

customers.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>

other  words, there has to be a reciprocal agreement  between

nations  for the collection and remittance of tax on  out-of-state  basis.   Sir, my question to the Minister  is:   where

does Singapore, a relatively small country and small economy,

fit into this global scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional retailers have gone on-line in droves.

"Click  and mortar", denoting a combination of on-line  sales

and traditional retailing, went from an unknown phrase in the

beginning of 1999 to a New Yorker headline -  making event by

the end of last year.  There is barely a traditional retailer

left  that  does not now accept the Internet  as  a  critical

weapon  in its retail arsenal. A recent report in the  United

States  estimated that current tax revenue  losses  are  less

than  1% of total tax revenue collected.  However, losses  in

the immediate future could grow to 2% to 4%.  State and local

governments also fear growth in Internet commerce will  drain

sales in shopping malls and traditional retailers, causing  a

drop  in  sales  tax.  In Singapore, the impact  is  no  less

profound.  The Gartner Group has projected that by  the  year

2003,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  transactions  through  the

Internet will total some US$11 billion.  Translated at 3%  is

a  total  loss  in  GST  collection of no  less  than  US$330

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States government has a headstart in this

area  but has yet to arrive at Internet rules that will  curb

tax  losses  as  a  result  of sales  transactions  over  the

Internet.  It is important for other nations to speed up  the

process  of setting Internet rules especially when e-commerce

is still small enough and tax distortions are modest.  On the

home  front  in  Singapore,  it  is  pertinent  to  ask   the

Government or the Minister on how it intends to address  this

critical issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new economy will pose tremendous challenges for

Government as its working is not well-understood and, yet  at

the  same time, has immediate impact. We have to grapple with

lots  of unknowns which are affecting our lives in a profound

manner.  My question is:  can the Government face up  to  the

challenge?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, thank you for permitting me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since many Members before me have spoken on the

details of the Budget, allow me to touch on two topics  which

I  feel  passionately about as they concern the future  well-being of Singapore and then comment on some specific areas of

taxation  which  I  would like the Finance Minister  to  give

attention to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on foreign talent. I recall how I listened

in awe last year when Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, spoke

during  the  Singapore  21 debate about  the  criticality  of

bringing in top talent into Singapore because we are now on a

global  stage,  whether we like it or not.  It  really  drove

home  to  me  that as a pre-requisite for us to play  in  the

global arena, we must have talents, whether local or foreign,

who  are  of global standard.  I am convinced more than  ever

now  as  I  too,  in my experience in working  for  a  multi-national corporation, am compelled to look for talent  beyond

the  shores  of  Singapore to carry  out  higher  value-added

activities where locals do not have the expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proverb "time and tide waits for no man" is more

relevant  now than ever. Technology has enabled  many  things

never  thought  possible  in the  past  and  is  changing  at

lightning  speed  with  each passing day.   It  is  therefore

highly essential that we intensify the inflow of talent which

could  help us narrow the gap and catch up with those at  the

leading edge of technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy used by Senior Minister of how ATMs had

dramatically  affected traditional banking  services  in  the

recent  past and how this is about to change again  with  the

advent  of  the  smartcard, is a clear demonstration  of  how

technology  is  driving  and forcing change  in  the  banking

industry,  and how it will make many of the services  offered

by  banks currently irrelevant in the not-too-distant future.

It is this "change or risk becoming irrelevant"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>

phenomenon that has forced the restructuring of our banks and

banking system and the pursuit of top talents like John  Olds

and Alex Au.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am encouraged to note that the Trade and Industry

Minister, BG George Yeo gave a convincing perspective of what

foreign  talent  had done for Singapore in the  Sunday  Times

yesterday and why we need them.  I think it is important that

this  subject be raised periodically.  Although by and large,

Singaporeans generally accept foreign talent, many still feel

that  foreign talents deprive them of some of the  good  jobs

which should have been theirs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to accelerate our KBE positioning and ensure

Singapore's successful transition to a full-fledged knowledge-based  economy, we must be able to bring in the top  high-end

talent.  Evidently, the competition for such talent  is  also

intense as we are meeting head-on with Silicon Valley and the

other  top  places  in  the world - the Himalayan  peaks,  as

Minister George Yeo puts it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to offering tip-top infrastructure and

an   increasingly   intellectual   environment,   I   believe

incentives matter a lot to this group of people.  I  know  of

many cases where attractive stock options made the difference

between losing or winning a top candidate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If pioneer status or tax holiday has been a successful

tool  to  lure MNCs to invest in Singapore, we must  look  at

such  top individuals as intellectual capital, especially  in

the  context of KBE positioning.  It is therefore  imperative

that  we  find  ways  and means to incentivise  higher  level

intellectual  capital to attract them to Singapore  and  stay

here for a period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the corporations doing their part to retain

talent,  the  Government  should  consider  making  the   tax

environment  for such people more attractive. As an  example,

we could consider a progressive tax rebate system, say, a 30%

rebate on their tax paid in the first year is given in  their

fourth year of residence in Singapore, 40% in the fifth  year

and so on, subject to a maximum cap.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, such incentives could be confined to high-level talents who truly contribute and make a difference for

Singapore,  just as pioneer status is not extended  to  every

MNC   putting   in  their  money  here.  The   criteria   for

qualification must be stringent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for talent attraction in general, I know much has

already  been  done  to  position  Singapore  as  a  hub  for

international talent.  The setting up of the Kowloon Club for

Hongkongers,  for example, provides a sense  of  comfort  and

relief  for new arrivals from Hong Kong to turn to  and  help

them  quickly  integrate  into Singapore  society.  The  same

should  also  quickly  be done for others,  such  as  Chinese

nationals and Indian foreign talents, if this is not  already

in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the frequent complaints I often hear from

foreigners  living here is the lack of space and recreational

facilities.  Hence, the NTUC's recent initiative in  building

a  $22  million theme park in Pasir Ris and the repositioning

of  Sentosa  as  a  day  and night tourist  and  recreational

destination  are  encouraging.   I  know  for  a  fact   that

Caucasians enjoy weekend getaways.  Hence, it would also help

to freely disseminate information about weekend packages such

as  escapades  to  the Riau Islands or Tioman,  these  places

being just a couple of hours away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the exemption of the 90% granted to royalties

for  innovations  and  inventions in a  bid  to  attract  and

encourage foreign talent to create new products in Singapore.

The   new  tax  deductible  Special  Retirement  Scheme   for

foreigners is an initiative in the right direction to  enable

them to reduce their tax burdens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel there is no better way though to attract top

talent here than to create an abundance of success stories as

evidenced  by Silicon Valley and the Hshinchu's Science-based

park  in  Taiwan.  We all must be familiar with  the  saying,

"success  breeds success." Doing all this and more will  help

to  accelerate the creation of success stories which will  in

turn help bring in the talent we need.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second topic is my concern about our youth's world

readiness.  I  can  still vividly recall the  headline  of  a

Straits Times report less than two weeks ago which states  "A

wake-up  call  for  Singapore  youths."   In  spite  of   the

financial  crisis  afflicting  Singapore  recently,   it   is

apparent  that our youths are shielded by their parents  and,

as  the report noted, are stuck in a comfort zone where  they

saw no necessity to keep themselves abreast of the impact  of

globalisation and the borderless economy.  Our  young  people

saw  not  much of a need to seize opportunities  in  an  open

economy  where information, products and people  move  freely

across  national borders. They seem to be obsessed  with  the

feeling  that just because Singapore is tops in  many  areas,

there was little scope for them to learn from others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this, Sir, as a dangerous trend which needs to be

given  urgent attention.  Such negative attitude and  narrow-mindedness  among  our  youths can only  spell  disaster  for

Singapore's  future, if not quickly corrected and  given  the

right perspective to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the idea of a Ministry of Youth has been

suggested  as  unnecessary by Deputy Prime Minister,  BG  Lee

Hsien  Loong,  it  is imperative that the Government  focuses

attention to this looming problem by setting up a body within

an  appropriate Ministry to tackle the issue.   Perhaps,  the

Singapore International Foundation could also be charged with

the   responsibility  to  design  overseas   attachment   and

internship programmes for a wider cross-section of our youths

to  make  them  understand that there is much  more  to  just

material  success and help equip them with  a  more  balanced

perspective of how they see the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the specific tax areas. I would like to

first draw attention to the Finance Minister's segment of his

speech on the new economy where he cited  the important  need

to  "adopt a global mindset, innovate and advance with global

trends, or risk being rendered redundant".  He went on to say

that  "unless  we  are among the world's  best,  we  will  be

relegated  to  playing  a  peripheral  role  in  the   global

economy."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am glad that some enhancements were announced to

support the technopreneurship drive, such as the estate  duty

exemption   on  residential  properties  used  for   business

activities,  it is my hope to see the Employee  Stock  Option

Scheme (ESOP) creatively enhanced when it is announced in May

this year, which, hopefully, will trigger many more high-tech

start-ups.  Apart from motivating local investors to be  more

adventurous  to put in their money in start-up  ventures,  it

will  also  help  to  bring us closer  to  a  Silicon  Valley

atmosphere  where talent from every nook and  corner  of  the

world flock, hoping to strike it rich through stock options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technopreneurial ventures involve high risks. As such,

it  would  augur  well for the Government to  send  a  strong

signal  that it is prepared to participate through incentives

which would promote and motivate such ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to take issue on group taxation,

which  has  been raised by several Members today and  in  the

past.   This  is  where I feel we continue to fall  short  in

comparison to the advanced economies in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng, the Member for Cheng San GRC, and

Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen, the Member for Bukit Timah, have  argued

convincingly  in last year's budget statement debate  of  the

important need for us to seriously consider this move in  the

context  of  our  rapid shift to a modern and knowledge-based

economy.  This, coupled with the effect of globalisation  and

more  liberalised  measures initiated  by  the  international

community  aimed at converting the world into  one  monstrous

marketplace,  and with many of our companies now  plugged  to

this  marketplace,  is  making our territorial  principle  of

taxation  more and more irrelevant, and the absence of  group

taxation felt stronger than ever.  I sincerely hope that  the

Minister  for  Finance will review this in  the  interest  of

keeping pace with global trends and maintaining our relevance

in the business world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is heartening to note a half percentage point

reduction  on corporate tax, the gap for taxes on individuals

is widening to 21/2%.  To prevent a trend of more individuals

corporatising  themselves  to  reap  the  benefit  of   lower

corporate tax rate, I would urge the Finance Minister to also

look into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which I think is in need of review is tax

relief  for  children.   With our declining  total  fertility

rate,  which currently stands at less than 1.5,  we  have  to

find ways to increase birth rates and incentivise couples  to

have more children and bigger nuclear families.  In spite  of

the  special tax rebates of $20,000 extended for two to four-child families to set off against income tax, this has proven

to  be an insufficient motivator for married couples to  bear

more children.  Singaporean couples want to give the best for

every  child  they bear and because of this high  expectation

they  have  set  for themselves, it pushes  up  the  cost  of

bringing up children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of increasing the number of Singaporeans

and  arresting our declining fertility rate, I would urge the

Minister  to consider increasing the tax relief for  children

as a motivator for Singaporeans to have more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, our challenge is for Singapore to

continually  differentiate ourselves from  the  rest  of  the

world by finding ways and means to creatively harness and add

value to both our hard and soft infrastructures that we  have

painstakingly built.  The secret of Singapore's  success  has

not  been  that we were just responsive to the ever  changing

economic and political landscapes but always anticipating the

changes ahead.  We need to always keep it this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the latest

Government Budget.  I am particularly pleased with  the  $250

top-up of workers' CPF ordinary accounts and the rebates  for

rentals  and  HDB  conservancy and  service  charges.   These

benefit workers and their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>

families directly and will be especially useful for those  in

the  low income group.  Other Singaporeans and those  in  the

low  income  group have also accepted the 10%  cut  from  the

employer's CPF contribution and wage cuts last year  to  pull

Singapore  out  of  the recession.  It is painful  for  those

earning low salaries to accept the cuts, but their sacrifices

have  not been in vain.  It helped companies to cut cost  and

saved many jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the number of retrenched workers fell to

14,600, about half the figure of the previous year.   But  we

must not forget that less than half of Singaporeans above the

age  of  40  have secondary and higher education.  They  were

born  before  1960.  At that time, we were living  under  the

colonial  rule.   We  grew  up  in  poverty.   There  was  no

opportunity for us to learn English or to go to the secondary

school.  Therefore, this group of people did not receive good

education.  If this group of more than 800,000 people, or 42%

of  our  total  workforce,  could not  upgrade  their  skills

because  of  linguistic problems,  they are  likely  to  lose

their  jobs.  Many do not have computers at home or  at  work

and  are  practically  IT-illiterate.   They  can  easily  be

replaced by younger and more computer-savvy employees who are

cheaper to hire and are more trainable.  If these older folks

lose  their  jobs,  they  will  have  no  income  to  support

themselves  and their families.  They will also lose  medical

and other benefits provided by their previous employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $250 CPF top-up in the new Budget is a good way for

the Government to tell these Singaporean workers that this is

good  news for them.  It is a good way for the Government  to

tell  them  that  it  cares  for them  and  appreciate  their

sacrifices  during the recent recession.  It is also  a  good

idea  for the Government to make these top-ups whenever there

is  a  surplus  in the annual Budget.  Because of  their  low

income,  many workers do not pay income tax and therefore  do

not  enjoy tax reliefs.  With all these kind gestures on  the

part  of the Government, it will be easier for the Government

to  convince  them  to accept wage cuts if there  is  another

recession in future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other ways to reach out to the hearts and

minds of the rank and file workers.  Many of them would  want

to  know  when  they can get back the full  10%  cut  in  CPF

contributions by employers.  The first restoration of 2% will

be  made on 1st April this year.  Will the next instalment be

made  next year if the economy grows by 4.5%-6.5% this  year,

as expected by the Government?  If the growth is sustained in

this way, how long will it take for the Government to restore

the full 10% that was cut?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can also provide more funds to step up

skills  upgrading  for those with low education  and  skills.

Perhaps in the years to come, when there is a budget surplus,

the  Government  could explore the idea of having  a  similar

$250 CPF top-up but in a skills upgrading account instead, to

encourage  our  workers  to use this fund  to  upgrade  their

skills.   The Government can also consider giving more  funds

to  Community Development Councils and town councils to  help

retrenched workers and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also urge the Government to revise certain

labour  laws  to  allow  trade unions  to  represent  casual,

contract  or part-time workers who are paid by the  companies

on  a project-by-project basis.  Tougher economic competition

will  force companies to downsize their workers to cut  cost.

This  trend will grow in future and those without the  skills

needed in the labour market may be forced to become casual or

part-time  workers.   They  will move  from  one  project  to

another  without  getting  CPF  contributions  paid  by   the

employers.   When  they retire, they  will  have  no  CPF  or

medical savings to take care of their old age requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is marching into the 21st century. It will be

a  different  Singapore from that in the past century.   With

technology   advances  and  the  Internet  revolution,   many

existing jobs and skills will become redundant.  But, at  the

same  time, new jobs requiring new knowledge and skills  will

be  created.  As such, it will be unavoidable that  the  wage

gap  between the IT literates and those with lower  education

and skills will widen.  Besides

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>

urging  workers to change their mindsets to one of  life-long

learning  in order to surf on the wave of changes,  I  wonder

whether there are any other plans to help those lower skilled

workers  adapt to these changes.   I think it is  timely  for

the  Government to study these implications and to make extra

effort to help these lower income earners keep pace with  the

change.   In  short,  this  is to help  them  increase  their

incomes  so that they can enjoy a better standard of  living.

Simply  put, the Government should think of ways to help  the

low income workers so that they will also be able to ride  on

the trend and to enjoy a higher standard of living.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support of the motion as proposed  by  the  Finance

Minister.   The  Budget for Financial  Year  2000  is  indeed

prudent  and cautious.  Despite the difficult year  in  1999,

the Singapore economy has made a quick recovery to achieve  a

5.4%  growth and have a budget surplus of about $3.2 billion.

As  highlighted by the Finance Minister, the financial crisis

is largely behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $3.2 billion budget surplus has raised expectations.

As  a result, both the individuals and business community are

disappointed  when  not much rebates and tax  incentives  are

proposed  in  the  Year 2000 Budget.  Many had  expected  the

Finance  Minister  to continue last year's  rebates  and  tax

incentives  for one more year.  This would have  helped  more

firms  to  recover and more individuals to ride  out  of  the

crisis faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address the concerns of individuals and the

business  community,  I  would like  to  make  the  following

suggestions for the Finance Minister to consider.



<br><br><i>Special CPF Top-up grant</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Finance Minister, the 10-percentage point cut in employer's CPF contribution and wage

restraint  in  1999  have  made a significant  difference  in

increasing our cost competitiveness.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>

Thus, the sacrifices made by workers have indeed helped firms

to  turn around and contributed to the growth of our economy.

In  view of this, I feel that more rebates should be accorded

to  our  workers  to recognise their efforts  in  helping  to

revive the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed special CPF top-up grant of $250 in the

Ordinary  Account  is a token sum as compared  to  the  total

amount of CPF contribution loss suffered by the workers.  Let

me illustrate the computation of this CPF loss.  Based on the

Department of Statistics' household survey conducted in 1995,

the  median  monthly  household  income  is  $3,135.   A  10%

employer's   CPF  cut  will  result  in  the  loss   of   CPF

contribution  of $3,762.  Thus, the $250 special  CPF  top-up

grant only accounts for 6.6% of this loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have a budget surplus of $3.2 billion, I would

urge  the  Finance Minister to be more generous and  grant  a

higher  CPF  top-up  grant  of $1,000  for  individuals.   To

further   ensure   that  this  top-up  grant   will   benefit

individuals more effectively, we should allow CPF holders  to

decide  which account they would like to top up  in  the  CPF

such  as  Ordinary,  Special, Medisave or  the  Supplementary

Retirement Scheme account.



<br><br><i>Individual tax rebate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has highlighted that not all

industries  are  out  of the woods yet.  In  particular,  the

construction business and financial sectors are  still  under

performing.  Similarly, not all Singaporeans are out  of  the

woods  from the financial crisis.  There are some  who  still

face  difficulty  in finding jobs, servicing their  mortgages

and   paying   for  their  living  expenses.   Although   the

Government  has implemented various measures to assist  these

Singaporeans,  there  are  some  who  still  need   financial

assistance to overcome the financial crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have lost jobs experienced a drastic drop in

their household income and may need time to retrain and  find

other  suitable  jobs. During this transition  period,  their

families  undergo  a difficult period of financial  hardship.

In many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>

cases,  their  children's  studies  and  welfare  are   badly

affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that more incentives or subsidies be

given  to those who make efforts to retrain and upgrade their

skills.  Besides training grant, incentives such as CPF  top-up,  or  service and conservancy or utilities rebates can  be

used  to alleviate the financial burden of these workers  and

facilitate  their upgrading efforts.  Without strong  support

from the Government, these workers will find it difficult  to

prioritise between family survival and skills upgrading.   In

addition, more grants should be given to the CDCs or the CCCs

to provide a safety net for these affected individuals.



<br><br><i>Development expenditure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction sector is an industry that is closely

related to many other industries due to its range of products

and  services.  Its downturn has affected many industries and

the  jobs  of  many Singaporeans.  I welcome the increase  in

development expenditure by 21.1% to $12.9 billion.  This will

provide  a  boost  to  the  construction  industry.   But,  a

significant  proportion of this expenditure  is  on  physical

infrastructure development such as Jurong island development,

reclamation  of  Changi East, 5-year sewerage programme,  MRT

and LRT system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these projects are complex and large in contract

value.   The  scope  and  nature of these  projects  is  also

limited  to  very  few  building trades such  as  excavation,

concrete  and steel works.  As such, these projects  may  not

provide  much  impetus  to boost the  construction  industry.

Local  contractors  and suppliers may not benefit  from  such

development expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider

increasing the budget for more building projects such as MUP,

IUP,  upgrading  of  existing schools,  construction  of  new

schools and upgrading of sports complexes.  As stated in  the

Budget,  only $188 million and $80 million are allocated  for

MUP   and  IUP  respectively  this  year.   6,420  flats  are

projected to undergo MUP while 13,026 flats will start IUP.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of MUP and IUP, many HDB

residents have enjoyed the benefits of having a better living

environment.  As these programmes are funded when there is  a

budget  surplus, we should expedite these programmes so  that

more  residents living in older estates can have their living

environment  improved earlier.  Similarly, the Selective  En-Bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme should  be  expedited  so  as  to

maximise  land use and rejuvenate older housing  estates.  We

should also consider upgrading the public infrastructure  and

amenities in private estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Ministry of Community Development and

Sports  has  plans to make Singapore a sporting  nation.   To

achieve  this  goal,  we should also  invest  in  the  sports

infrastructure  in our living environment.  Many  old  sports

complexes and swimming pools must be rejuvenated to provide a

wider  range  of facilities.  New sports facilities  must  be

developed  to  encourage Singaporeans to take up  sports  and

maintain healthy lifestyles.  Therefore, it is necessary  for

the  Government to develop an upgrading programme for  sports

complexes and swimming pools.



<br><br><i>IT infrastructure upgrading grant</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of IT on businesses has surfaced new concerns

on  the suitability of building design of existing buildings.

Many commercial and industrial buildings are not designed  to

incorporate  IT  technologies.  As a  result,  companies  may

incur high cost or loss in efficiency when they implement  IT

in  their  existing  business premises.  Productive  time  of

workers  may be wasted due to the incompatibility of building

design and IT infrastructure of the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported in the Straits Times today, some buildings

can  have  as much as two tonnes of unclaimed copper  in  the

buildings due to the change of tenants and frequent  rewiring

of communication lines.  This will not only increase the cost

of  maintenance but also the efficiency of the communications

system in the buildings.  Therefore, in order to maximise the

potential of IT, companies must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>

encouraged  to upgrade their business premises  to  house  IT

technologies appropriately.  Proper facilities planning  must

be incorporated to ensure that building design can facilitate

business processes or workflows in an IT working environment.

This will not only improve the morale of the workers but also

increase the productivity of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider

providing  an IT infrastructure upgrading grant for  building

owners  or  companies  that invest in  IT  infrastructure  to

increase their productivity and competitiveness.



<br><br><i>CPF housing grant</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the tax changes to encourage Singaporeans to

plan  prudently  for  their retirement  needs  and  encourage

greater family cohesiveness. To further encourage families to

stay  together  or  close to each other, I  propose  that  we

extend our present CPF housing grant for HDB first-timers  to

include  all  Singaporeans who choose to purchase flats  near

their  parents in the resale market.  Our housing policy  can

also  be  revised to allow HDB owners within the requisite  5

years'  occupation  period to move near their  parents.   But

measures must be taken to ensure that such relocation is bona

fide and fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Ownership Policy in Singapore has resulted

in  the rapid nuclearisation of families over the years.  The

progressive development of New Towns and our Flat  Allocation

Policy has also caused many members of families to be located

in  different  parts  of Singapore.   To  address  the  rapid

widespread of family nuclearisation, it is necessary for  the

Government   to  relook  into  its  housing   policy.    More

flexibility  must  be  adopted  in  our  housing  policy   to

encourage  families  to live close to one  another  within  a

community.   This  will provide much impetus  in  encouraging

Singaporeans to age in-situ within the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with our fast ageing population, it is also

necessary to provide elderly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>

friendly  infrastructure within the community.  Many existing

housing  estates  are not seamless and not  entirely  elderly

friendly.   For example, some external staircases  are  steep

and   have  no  railings,  ramps  are  not  provided  or  are

inconveniently located in some areas, not many vehicle  drop-off points are available near housing blocks, and there is  a

general  lack  of  communal spaces  and  facilities  for  the

elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Town Councils and Citizens' Consultative

Committees  have been improving the housing estates,  limited

funding  is available to spearhead these initiatives to  make

the  towns  more elderly friendly.  Thus, I hope the  Finance

Minister can increase the allocated budget of $51 million for

Community  Improvement Projects.  In this way, the  CCCs  and

the  Town  Councils  can  work  together  to  undertake  more

improvement projects for the benefit of our senior citizens.

<br><br><i>World class companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT and globalisation have indeed put immense pressure

for companies in Singapore to increase their capabilities and

competitiveness.  To face these challenges, the  Committee on

Singapore's Competitiveness has recommended that we  need  to

build up a stable of our own world class companies with  core

competencies,  which can compete effectively  in  the  global

economy.  Unfortunately, this year's budget does not  provide

any  specific boost to nurture our own potential world  class

companies.   Although there are various existing  schemes  in

EDB  and PSB to help local companies, more support is  needed

to  expand  these  schemes so that more local  firms  can  be

nurtured to achieve world class standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is timely for the Government to re-examine

these  schemes and set appropriate benchmarks to measure  the

success  of  these schemes. The various approving authorities

must be given more mandate to take more risks to assist local

companies'  ventures.  In addition, we  should  provide  more

flexibility  and easier access for such companies  to  obtain

grant or financing to strengthen their core capabilities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies that produce global products should be given

special  tax  incentives to venture into the  global  market.

The  Government can also provide more support to  help  these

potential  world  class  companies  market  and  brand  their

products or services globally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further assist these firms to attract and retain

talented  staff, companies must be given more tax  incentives

to package their remuneration system.  For example, we should

allow personal tax exemption for staff benefits such as  car,

housing,  club,  etc.    To be able to  attract  world  class

talent,  we must offer world class remuneration packages.   I

believe  the  Government  can  play  a  significant  role  to

facilitate   the  recruitment  of  world  class   talent   in

Singapore.   This  will increase the chances  of  success  in

producing world class companies in Singapore.

<br>6.43 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak in support of the motion in the

name of the Minister for Finance.  After a long day where  my

parliamentary colleagues have given so much of the bird's eye

and fish eye view of things in this budget, I would just like

to  focus  on  one  particular topic, ie,  the  Supplementary

Retirement  Scheme (SRS).  The Minister intends  to  initiate

some  tax changes in order to encourage Singaporeans to  save

more  prudently  for  their needs after  retirement,  and  to

encourage greater family cohesiveness, particularly  in  view

of  the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  Ageing  Population

Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "complementary private sector system" is to

encourage individuals to contribute to a private fund such as

under  the "Supplementary Retirement Scheme".  It is proposed

that  the SRS will be accorded tax deductions at the time  of

contribution, but the tax being payable only when the savings

are  withdrawn.   The Minister said that the  percentage  cap

based  on  the  salary will be determined.  In view  of  this

prospective  ageing  population, and  the  higher  dependency

ratio

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>

that  we  are going to face in the next 10 years, I urge  the

Minister  to  consider  immediately  giving  some  leeway  to

taxpayers who would also like to save under the SRS for their

aged parents who may be either working or retired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans retired on very small retirement

savings  because our country was quite poor  in  its  initial

stages  of  our  economic development, and the  country  went

through  a very dramatic growth era, from ground zero  within

one  generation.  Just now, my parliamentary colleague Mr Ong

Ah  Heng  from the NTUC has just given an example of  how  we

have  a  huge  group,  40% of our labour  force,  of  800,000

workers  without  Secondary Four education.   This  group  of

people at that time did not have this opportunity, because we

were under a colonial administration, as he had aptly put it.

And because of this, their earning capacity and income stream

all  through their life were quite low.  So even if we had  a

CPF  scheme during the period when they were working for  the

last  20  to  30 years, the amount saved is quite  small  for

these workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A SRS Scheme for aged parents, with an appropriate tax

offset,  ought  to be incorporated.  The Minister  may  reply

that  there  is  already in existence an allowance  for  aged

parents  supported by a taxpaying son or daughter.  But  this

tax  relief is only limited to one taxpaying son or daughter.

He  may also say that there is now already a Minimum Sum top-up to the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I support my colleague, Dr Wang Kai Yuen's

suggestion  to raise this Minimum Sum top-up to  $60,000  for

all.   But  I am more concerned also with extending this  SRS

scheme  to aged parents as well.  I believe this is quite  an

urgent  task.   The sooner we do this the better  because  it

takes time for some reasonable accumulation of savings to  be

effectively  useful.   It makes possible  a  kind  of  inter-generational  transfer of income with some tax  incentive  by

the  Government.  I hope we do not have to wait  for  another

five  or 10 years to discover that the Minimum Sum top-up  is

not enough.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will seriously look into the

widening of the SRS scheme now to allow taxpayers with income

to transfer some savings to their aged parents through such a

scheme.  They should get full tax offset on this, up to  some

generous cap, and I mean generous, bearing in mind the longer

lifespan of people in the next 10 to 20 years.  We need to do

this  now  as  soon as possible.  Although we  have  our  CPF

scheme  for  many years, the truth is that many  Singaporeans

will not be fully prepared for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax relief the Minister offers now will pay off in

lessening the burden of a large number of such aged  who  are

inadequately funded for retirement.  A positive step now will

add  to  building a cohesive bond between the Government  and

the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, many people told me that

the  Budget  this year is not exciting at  all.   It  is  not

surprising  because  this  Budget was  pronounced  after  the

series of supplementary measures announced last year.  It  is

now  the  time  to adjust to new conditions.   Some  measures

which  were  necessary last year would not be necessary  this

year.  So there should be a period of adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures abolished were not many. The 10% corporate

tax  rebate has been replaced by 0.5% reduction in  corporate

tax.   The  exemption  of property tax for  properties  under

development was withdrawn.  These two big measures show  that

the  Government is quite optimistic about the recovery of our

economy.   The  Minister also mentioned that the construction

industry is still in the doldrums.  However, I feel that  the

reduction of the tax rebate on developments from 55%  to  25%

happened too soon.  The construction industry has a share  of

10%  in  our  GDP.   The long term negative  growth  of  this

industry would affect quite a lot of people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>

Many  people  in  this  industry are  facing  bankruptcy  and

becoming  insolvent.  If the Government does not do  anything

to help the construction industry, this industry will take  a

much  longer  time to revive.  To withdraw the  property  tax

exemption  for  the  property  under  development  will  have

negative impact on the construction industry.  We should make

use  of  these measures to stimulate the property  sector  so

that they can be restored to their former prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of corporate tax from 26% to 25.5% would

imply  that there will be some adjustments in personal income

tax in future.  Right now the 5% rebate in income tax is more

preferred.   However,  I  feel  that  there  should   be   an

adjustment  in  the personal income tax rate  so  that  there

should not be too big a difference between corporate tax rate

and personal income tax rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things which merit our support. In the

allocation  of  funds for MCD, there is an  increase  of  38%

which  shows  that  the  Government is  concerned  about  the

building  up  of  social  cohesiveness  as  proposed  in  the

President's  Address.  The proposed Supplementary  Retirement

Scheme  is  a  good  suggestion.  The  increase  in  the  tax

reduction  for  the  aged  parents and  the  top-up  for  the

parents' CPF  show that the Government has taken note of  the

problems  of  an ageing population in our society.   I  think

families  are the best places to look after the aged parents.

And  the  big increase in other social and community  funding

also shows that the Government pays attention to the personal

relationship   between   the  people   and   the   harmonious

relationship  between the different communities.   This  will

also  strengthen other social amenities like  homes  for  the

aged,  childcare  centres  and  other  measures.   This  will

alleviate the problems of working mothers and the problems of

aged  parents who need people to look after them.  Therefore,

the  increased funding for MCD will help to raise the quality

of life and the cohesiveness of the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget encourages young people and foster the spirit

of entrepreneurship.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>

The  measures such as the reduction in estate duties and  tax

exemption   for  royalty  for  intellectual  properties   are

positive measures for encouraging entrepreneurship.  However,

on  the  other hand, there is this scheme called the employee

stock option scheme.  The tax levied on this scheme, I think,

is  not  very  appropriate.  We should  understand  that  the

capital  gain from the acquisition of shares is not  taxable.

Generally,  a  stock  option scheme  is  aimed  at  retaining

employees so that they have a stake in the company  in  order

to  motivate  them to work better and longer  hours  for  the

company.  After they have opted for the shares, there  is  an

appreciation in the share values.  Why should they  be  taxed

on  the gains of the shares which they are allocated?   These

shares   allocated  to  the  employees  will   have   certain

conditions  attached.  For example, the value of  the  shares

will   be   based  on  the  market  value  at  the  time   of

announcement.  And there is a limit in the period before they

can  take out the shares.  If the gains from these shares are

taxable, they will have to sell their shares to pay for their

income  tax.   This will defeat the purpose of  the  employee

stock  option  scheme, and the employees will suffer  certain

losses  because it may not be the right time  to  sell  their

shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many young entrepreneurs have many ways to make money

but  they are short of funds.  Therefore, through this  stock

option  scheme,  the  young  entrepreneurs  could  acquire  a

substantial  portion of the share in the  company  where  his

idea  is  implemented.  The benefits accrued are the same  as

those shareholders who founded the company.  To levy taxes on

the   shares   under  the  stock  option   scheme   will   be

contradictory  to  the  aim  of  the  scheme   in   promoting

entrepreneurship.  I hope the authorities will take  note  of

this.  I personally do not agree to the levying of tax on the

stocks under this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Budget last year, the Budget benefits many

Singaporeans,  especially those who are in the  lower  income

group.  In this tax package, those who are above 21 years old

will  be  given $250 CPF top-up.  This is a very good measure

to make them feel that the people of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  have a stake in our economic prosperity.   Through

various  tax rebates, for example, in the case of  4-roomers,

they  will get a minimum of $683 as rebates and top-up.   For

those earning higher income they would be getting as much  as

$1,138  in the form of rebates and top up.  Many Singaporeans

benefit from this Budget.  I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I stand to urge the Ministry of Finance help chart  the

future work of the Ministry of Health in a new direction  and

for  the  better of healthcare in Singapore.  It is  a  known

fact  that  the right allocation of funds will determine  the

advancement  of  certain  desired  outcome.   Sir,  the   new

direction I would like the Ministry of Health to go  in  this

new  millennium calls for a greater integration of the public

and  private  medical  sectors in  Singapore.   This  is  far

removed  from  the  type of integration  that  we  have  been

stressing  on  -  the  vertical integration  between  primary

through  to  tertiary services and facilities all within  the

public sector only.  What we need to look into is the lateral

integration,  say, between the polyclinics  and  the  private

general   practices,  between  specialists  in   restructured

hospitals   and  those  in  private  practice   and   between

restructured and private hospitals, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do contend that there is already a little integration

in  our  health  system at the moment.  The  Health  Ministry

allows  private doctors to come back as visiting  consultants

to teach and to impart experiences to the younger doctors.  A

set  of  scheme under the Ministry of Health has  specialists

providing services in hospital departments that are short  in

such  expertise.   The  Health Ministry taps  expertise  from

private  sectors  with the setting up of specialist  centres.

Among doctors, collaboration for complicated procedures, such

as  open  heart  surgery or liver transplant, is  common  and

fairly routine.  There is, however, a distinct and disturbing

divide  between  the  private and public medical  sectors  in

Singapore.   And, Sir, this divide is and will  always  be  a

dilemma for healthcare here.  BG George

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>

Yeo,  when  he was Minister for Health, supported the  notion

for  greater  integration of the public and private  sectors.

Integrate  these two sectors and we may even  achieve  global

recognition as being one of the best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying on with BG George Yeo, he mentioned that he had

visited the Mayo Clinic at Rochester in Minnesota.  He  noted

that  Rochester  was  a  small  town  of  less  than  100,000

inhabitants,  in the middle of nowhere and has  beastly  cold

winter  four  to  five months a year.  But it  has  the  most

wonderful medical facilities in the whole world.  And because

it  serves  the  rich and famous from around the  world,  the

people  and  Rochester  enjoy a  quality  of  healthcare  not

possible for any other prairie town of 100,000 in America  or

in  the world.  He said that in the same way, if we were able

to establish Singapore as a "Mayo Clinic in South East Asia",

then  all of us who happen to live in Singapore will enjoy  a

quality  of medical care far surpassing what a population  of

three million would otherwise deserve.  Singapore will  be  a

"Mayo Clinic in South East Asia", Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and

the way towards achieving this is through the integration  of

our public and private medical sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a change of direction towards integration

rather  than  maintaining division.   Singapore  is  a  small

country  with a small population; we must derive our strength

through  unity.   We  must remove the  unnecessary  waste  of

energy  on  competing and bickering amongst  ourselves.   Our

energy  should  be used to put all our resources  to  maximal

use.   In the past, the Government's policy has been to  rely

on  competition and market forces to keep health  cost  down.

Sir, we need a mindset change now; these are different times.

We  must look at things globally and we are doing in so  many

aspects of our forward planning.  Our healthcare plans should

be  included  in  this overture and I am suggesting  that  we

quickly  do  away  with  the divide between  the  public  and

private sectors of our healthcare system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give ten reasons

to  emphasise  the importance of integrating the  public  and

private  medical sectors in Singapore.  I am sorry I have  to

hold you back, my colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore is a small country; an integrated system

will lead to maximisation of potential in the medical arena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The public and private sectors should work together

to plan facilities more efficiently.  Integration will reduce

duplication  of  facilities, in terms of expensive  equipment

such as the gamma knife, etc, in the two sectors.  Sir, there

is  certainly  no necessity for duplication of facilities  in

certain  highly  specialised fields  of  medicine  where  the

patient pool in the country is limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) It is more sensible to maximise the use of our

healthcare personnel.  For instance, the experts in the  very

specialised fields like liver transplants should  be  allowed

to  operate  in both sectors because there is  really  not  a

sufficient  pool  of  patients from our population  of  three

million  to  support these areas in the  divide  of  the  two

sectors.    Another   example  is   to   make   the   private

practitioners look after a portion of the "subsidy  patients"

and   ease   the  load  in  the  polyclinics  and  specialist

outpatient clinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Patients will stand to benefit from integration of

the   two  sectors  because  there  will  be  more  equitable

availability  of  quality care.  The  costs  will  be  better

contained and the wait times will be less lengthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Both private and public sectors could work together

to  develop Singapore into a Regional Medical Hub.  Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the two sectors should not be in conflict  but

should  be  in synergism, or Singapore will lose the  leading

edge  over  the  neighbouring  countries.   As  it  is,  many

overseas  patients are now finding Penang to be a  very  good

alternative  place  to  seek medical  treatment  in  lieu  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Integration will restrain the exodus of specialists

from  the  public  to the private sectors, especially  during

good economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>

times.  This will prevent uneven spread of talent.  This will

also   bring  earnings  of  doctors  in  both  sectors   more

comparable with one another and stem one of the major reasons

for the outflow of doctors to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Training of young doctors will get a boost from the

active   participation  of  private  doctors,  both   general

practitioners and specialists.  Sir, there are  many  private

practitioners who love teaching and are, indeed, very good at

it.   Training young doctors should therefore be  seen  as  a

national concern, involving doctors from both sectors, as  it

is   a   "very  specialised,  time-consuming  and  expensive"

exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Doctors can learn from each other when more

collaborative  work  becomes  possible  through  integration.

They  will learn when they work together and get to  see  and

treat more complicated cases that they may not otherwise meet

individually.  This will further fine-tune the skills of  our

doctors,  and  thus get closer towards our  aim  of  being  a

regional medical hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) With the healthcare system integrated, both doctors

and patients will benefit.  Specialists from both sectors can

be  called in to treat local and foreign patients, especially

in  areas  of  super-specialisation.  Super-specialists  will

then  get  more  patients to hone and improve  their  skills.

Patients, whether local or foreign, will benefit because they

will  get to be treated by the best in each field and from  a

wider base of doctors and specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Our talent pool is unnecessarily segregated and

restricted in their respective positions in the two  sectors.

Many  doctors  will  have the chance for  research  work  and

teaching as well as to have a private practice if their  more

dispensable  roles can be shared out amongst more colleagues.

The private practitioners, in the present system, can lighten

the  workload of Government doctors if allowed to work in the

public  sector  as  visiting  consultants,  treat  subsidised

patients and impart their skills to the younger doctors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should look at some of the

basic  steps  that must be adopted to bring about integration

as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unless the Government is serious about integration

of  the  public and private sectors and actively promote  it,

all  efforts  in  this  ideology will not  come  about.   The

Government, therefore, must be even handed in all aspects  of

its  handling  of  the private and the  public  sectors.   It

should  be  concerned  about the well-being  of  the  private

sector also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Government must be seen to be committed towards

bringing  about  this  change.  The appropriate  funding  and

incentives provided by the Finance Ministry will  be  a  good

start.   The correct directives must also come down from  the

Ministry  of Health to all public medical sector and  private

medical sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There must be a paradigm shift of mindset of all

doctors in Singapore to work as one in synergism and  not  in

competition, to aim to become a regional medical hub for  the

good of the country and the people.  Without this basic shift

in  mindset,  even all the favourable areas  in  our  present

healthcare system will sadly go to waste.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Many schemes must be structured properly by the

Ministry  of  Health.   For example, the visiting  consultant

scheme  must  be structured by an objective panel  so  as  to

optimise  the  benefits.   Prime  Minister  Goh  did  suggest

previously that this scheme should be enhanced and called  on

more  private  specialists to contribute  their  services  to

Government hospitals as visiting consultants.  At the moment,

this scheme cannot be enhanced because it lacks the directive

from  the Ministry of Health.  Private doctors have to depend

on  friendship  and  courtesy of their colleagues  in  public

hospitals  to be invited as visiting consultants.  Some  feel

redundant  and  unwelcome even after being  offered  visiting

consultant   posts.   To  succeed,  this   scheme   must   be

structured,  with the appointments made by a panel  from  the

Ministry,  and  a  clear programme drawn up to  optimise  the

visiting consultants' time in public hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Fuller cooperation by the private sector must be

forthcoming, for example, to accredit Government  specialists

as  consultants  to  private hospitals.   Government  doctors

could  be allowed to work in primary healthcare set-ups  such

as general practice clinics.  In other words, let us evolve a

system  where  the cross-borders between public  and  private

sectors are less distinct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this new directive, if adopted,

will  bring  medical healthcare in Singapore to even  greater

heights.   This  opportunity to maximise our present  medical

healthcare system should be harnessed quickly and  fully.   I

therefore  beseech our Government to proceed immediately  for

greater integration of the public and private medical sectors

in Singapore.

<br>7.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, like many other

citizens,  I  am  very  pleased  with  Singapore's   V-shaped

economic  recovery and proud of the way in which Singaporeans

have  banded together, accepted cuts in CPF and faced  global

competition by adjusting to increasing liberalisation of  key

sectors  of  our  economy. We have taken the  Asian  economic

crisis  by  its horns and rode the tidal waves  in  the  last

three  years,  coming up stronger, as the  sterling  economic

results presented before us by the Minister have exemplified.

I  would like first to thank and commend the Minister and the

Government  for  the skilful steering of our  economy  as  we

emerge from the wood of the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we enter into the new millennium, the Minister

has  rightly  pointed  out that the terms  of  reference  for

global   economic  competition  have  altered  significantly.

Globalisation and the onslaught of technological  advancement

have  altered the way markets operate and the nature of doing

business  altogether.   We do indeed  need  to  innovate  and

advance with global trends or risk being rendered redundant.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional brick and mortar enterprises are being

replaced  daily by virtual dot.com businesses.   Indeed,  the

first  two  months of the new millennium saw  the  Dow  Jones

falling  17% from its peak in a rather short period of  time,

while  the  technology heavy NASDAQ doubling since  September

1999  and seems to rise irrespective of whether there is  any

intervention in the money markets via interest rates  by  the

FED.   What this boils down to in essence is that there is  a

clear  diversion of capital to the new technologies, the  new

methods of doing business or the new era of competition  that

lies before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to express my concerns

whether  the  Budget  caters enough to  enable  Singapore  to

embark on the genesis of this knowledge-based economy of  the

future.   My  concern transcends beyond the simple allocation

of  a budget for IT across the Ministries.  It is essentially

whether  we have provided enough across the entire  budgetary

system  and  framework, to incentivise, to  motivate  and  to

support a strategy of the new knowledge economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has indeed tried to position Singapore

for  these  new  challenges.  I note  that  there  have  been

concerted efforts to roll out IT education programmes in  our

schools  and  to  "wire" Singapore up. The NSTB  is  also  in

receipt   of   development  expenditure  for  financing   and

administering R&D projects in addition to the various schemes

already  in  place  to co-support IT start-ups.   Its  recent

launch  of  the  portal for technopreneurs  in  Singapore  to

facilitate and support budding dot.com companies  is  also  a

step in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal incentives in the budget for innovation, as well

as   the  estate  duty  exemption  extended  to  support  the

Technopreneur  Home Office Scheme, are all encouraging  signs

that the Government is positioning Singapore for the new age.

However, this begs the question of whether more can  be  done

in  the  shortest  possible  time as  we  quickly  reposition

ourselves to face the KBE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, at the macro level, through belt tightening and

the cost of restructuring,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>

which  was  felt  by many at the individual job  loss  level,

Singapore has been able to run budget surpluses in  the  last

two  financial  years, to the tune of $4.2  billion  and  the

Government  has  rightly decided to pass a  portion  back  to

Singaporeans via a $250 CPF top-up. I wonder whether part  of

this  surplus could be passed on to Singaporeans to get  them

to prepare for the knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may sound radical at this juncture but we may

need  to be courageous as we enter the brave new world ahead.

The  Communications and IT Ministry has recently announced  a

$25  million scheme to finance IT courses. This would,  as  a

start, underline the commitment and the fundamental strategic

direction that the Government has for Singapore to compete in

the  new environment. This programme would be a basic enabler

to  ensure that the vast majority of our workforce  or  every

single  family is IT equipped and can then start  to  embrace

and  take full advantage of the KBE.  It is indeed a laudable

move.   However, I believe the $25 million, averaged  over  a

workforce  of 1.5 million Singaporeans works out to  $16  per

person, may not be enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, I would like to propose that perhaps a

matching  amount  for the CPF top-up of $250  per  person  be

channelled  through  the CDC to co-fund IT  courses  or  even

basic hardware purchases like PCs by families as part of  the

life-long learning initiatives.  Furthermore, I would propose

that the Minister consider a scheme whereby we devote some 10-15%  of our annual budget surpluses to be ploughed back  into

the  economy  through the CDC to upgrade and to  prepare  our

population for the KBE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more substantial than the mere $25 million

earmarked  by  the Ministry of Communications  and  IT.  This

programme  would  help ensure that the vast majority  of  our

workforce  or even every single household is IT equipped  and

can  then  start  to embrace and take full advantage  of  the

global  KBE.   This  method of involving  the  CDCs  and  the

community  groups  is  also  consistent  with  our   aim   of

encouraging ownership and self-reliance,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>

in  keeping with the objectives of Singapore 21, and would go

a   significant  step  to  reach  out  to  our  families  and

communities to influence their mindset and culture.  This  is

especially   applicable   to  the   middle-aged   and   older

generations, a vast number of whom still have an innate  fear

of  technology and have felt left behind by the fast changing

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is the comparatively few firm

initiatives    to    support    the    entrepreneurial     or

technopreneurial  society that we envisage  for  the  future.

The  Minister  has emphasised that the review  for  the  ESOP

scheme would be completed in May this year. We recognise  the

importance  of how stock options are essential  to  start-ups

and  mature corporations in this new environment to  recruit,

motivate and retain top talent.  Indeed, equity ownership  is

the  key  to  the  development of a vibrant  technopreneurial

environment  in  Silicon  Valley and  other  high-tech  nodes

elsewhere in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time is of the essence in respect of creating a

technopreneurial society.  Hence, I would urge  the  Minister

to  consider hastening the process as this tax review on  the

ESOP  scheme has been on-going in Singapore for a  number  of

years  now, whilst other countries such as the United Kingdom

and Japan have gone ahead and revised their policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to improve on our modest first step which

was to enhance the tax treatment of ESOP by deferring the tax

payable by up to five years announced last year, I would like

to  suggest  a  bolder  extension. To  really  make  the  tax

treatment for ESOP scheme more favourable than cash payments,

perhaps  an easy to administer scheme would be to charge  all

income  derived from share options exercised and  sold  at  a

flat rate of 3%.  This could be a spur to allow companies  to

incentivise  their employees and partners in enterprise,  and

is  also  in  line with our attempt to encourage  basic  wage

flexibility as well as a more risk-taking culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly on fiscal policies, we note that many younger

generation  IT savvy potential entrepreneurs are  lacking  in

funds to support their good ideas. While

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>

there are various schemes in place at the NSTB, we still have

a   large   number  of  successful  Singapore  technopreneurs

obtaining funding from angel investors in Singapore.   May  I

further suggest that the Minister consider tax incentives for

these  angel investors, such as the ability to offset venture

investment  losses  in such hi-tech start-ups  against  their

personal  income tax, as a catalyst to encourage  more  risk-taking  by  our people and to spur the private sector  growth

for angel investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the knowledge-based economy of the

future,  there  are  employment trends in the  United  States

showing an increasing growth of part-time and contract  jobs.

These  are  created  as a result of the outsourcing  of  many

aspects  of  a  traditional firm, from project  work,  supply

chain management, IT to human resource management.  Firms are

becoming  more  lean  and  mean  and  efficient  to   compete

effectively.   This trend is not isolated and  the  model  is

applicable  to  the  KBE of the future.   Indeed,  there  are

already  signs in Singapore that our companies  are  adopting

such methods to stay nimble and competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot to this trend is that permanent work or full-time employment is on the decline and that self-employment

and  part-time  work  are  on the  increase.  This  increased

incidence  of flexi-work is consistent with a KBE and  should

be   supported   especially  in  the  light   of   increasing

deregulation of our services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are implications that we have to cater

for.   We  have  to encourage individuals to  be  more  self-reliant  and responsible for their own well-being  since  the

era  of  life-long employment is on the decline.  I  am  glad

that  the  Minister  has  announced  the  introduction  of  a

Supplementary  Retirement  Scheme  (SRS)  which  would  allow

Singaporeans to contribute voluntarily over and  above  their

CPF  savings  which would be accorded tax deductions  at  the

time  of contribution. However, I would urge the Minister  to

consider extending the SRS in two areas.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the percentage cap for tax deductibility for

employees'  CPF contributions could be set at a higher  level

so  that employees have greater flexibility to maximise their

long-term  interest via the CPF.  Secondly, to encourage  the

greater use of CPF accounts and ancillary benefits, I suggest

an  equivalent  scheme be extended to the  self-employed  and

those who are employed on non-CPF schemes, particularly those

part-timers and contract workers, to also contribute  to  the

CPF  in  such  like  manner.  In the KBE  that  Singapore  is

transforming itself into, there would be a greater number  of

self-employed,   contract  staff  as   well   as   home-based

entrepreneurs and technopreneurs who would benefit from  this

measure.  This would enable the Government to encourage  more

personal  responsibilities and less reliance on the state  as

we move forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, with the trends in new forms of work and

employment,  I  would  suggest that the Government  encourage

Singaporeans to take up private insurance. The tax  deduction

for  life  insurance premiums is currently limited  for  most

individuals who have regular CPF contributions.  To encourage

greater  self-dependency and personal  responsibilities,  the

Government  should  consider  lifting  this  cap  and   allow

Singaporeans  to use their CPF to buy health,  education  and

other forms of life insurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a critical aspect to the success of

Singapore in the new globally competitive IT intensive future

is  to influence the culture and mindset of Singaporeans.  We

have  to  change our traditional expectations of what working

life  or  what  a job is like. We have to become  less  risk-averse,  more entrepreneurial and more IT enabled.   Some  of

these  aspects are already enshrined in Singapore  21  goals,

where  we should leverage on the strengths of family and  the

community  and  not merely let loose unbridled individualism.

I  am  glad that the Minister has continued to extend  fiscal

incentives  that are supportive of the family.   However,  in

conclusion, I urge the Minister to consider my suggestions to

encourage greater contributions to CPF,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>

and  to  use  the  channel of the CDCs  and  other  community

organisations to distribute some of our budget  surpluses  to

enable Singaporeans and the community at large to benefit and

to contribute to the successful KBE of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

suspected to have hearing loss or who are at higher risk (eg,

premature  babies or those with family history  of  deafness)

referral  service  for  members  of  the  public.   From  its

inception to the end of 1999, the Helpline has received about

19,400 calls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, besides enquiries about the National Education

Exhibition  and  miscellaneous calls to  air  personal  views

about  life,  the  Helpline also received  requests  for  job

matching  as the CDCs are linked to the Ministry of  Manpower

(MOM)'s  Labournet and job banks set up by some CDCs.   Other

callers  raised family concerns, financial needs and training

sponsorship.  The summary is given in  Table A below.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the largest number of callers were interested

in  skills  training and upgrading.  This could be attributed

to the CDCs' sponsorship of approved courses under the Skills

Development  Fund  (SDF)  and Skills Redevelopment  Programme

(SRP).   Job  matching continued to be high on  the  callers'

list   for  1999.   The  requests  for  financial  assistance

decreased from 769 in 1998 to 666 in 1999.  The breakdown  is

at Table B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA provides the necessary training for all the staff

at  the  CDCs so that they are able to carry out their  tasks

effectively and efficiently.  Such training is either at  the

National  Community Leadership Institute or  by  professional

organisations and trainers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education if his

Ministry will give the statistics of students failing in  the

second  language  in  the Primary School Leaving  Examination

(PSLE) and "O" level examination.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the PSLE, the grades awarded are the following: A*,

A,  B,  C, D, E, and Ungraded which is considered the  Failed

grade.   The  percentages  of  pupils  failing  Mother-Tongue

Languages  in  PSLE  are very small. In the  1999  PSLE,  the

numbers  and percentages of pupils who failed, that  is,  did

not  achieve  a  Grade  E or better,  in  Chinese  and  Malay

Language  were  20 (0.07%) and 2 (0.03%) respectively.  There

was no failure in Tamil Language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the GCE 'O' level examination, the grades awarded are

A1,  A2,  B3, B4, C5, C6, D7, E8 and F9. In the 1998 GCE  `O'

level  examination, the percentages of school candidates  who

failed,  that is, getting F9, were 2.1% for CL, 2.2%  for  ML

and 2.1% for TL.  These represent 532 of CL students, 118  of

ML students and 24 TL students.

<div align="center"><b>GUIDELINES ON DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education whether

there  is a need to issue detailed guidelines on disciplinary

actions  to ensure consistency of application and to  provide

some  comfort  to those schools which face the need  to  take

such actions on students.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br><i>Guidelines on Disciplinary Actions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are given broad guidelines on the approaches and

actions they could adopt in managing pupil discipline.  These

guidelines include the development of a comprehensive  system

of  discipline  involving all teachers,  the  setting  up  of

referral systems as well as the use of a variety of measures,

ranging from the preventive to the corrective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guidelines drawn up were based on the principles

that  punishment is only a means to an end; that it  must  be

commensurate  with the seriousness of the offence  committed,

and  appropriate  to  the  nature of the  offence  committed.

Schools  include  counselling as  an  integral  part  of  the

corrective process to ensure that the punishment is meted out

with  care  and  concern and that the pupil  understands  the

reason  for  his punishment.  Parental involvement  would  be

sought  when  deemed necessary.  In extreme situations  where

corporal  punishment needs to be meted out, as a  measure  of

last  resort,  principals are empowered to do so  within  the

guidelines set by the Ministry.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Consistency of Application of Disciplinary Actions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the broad guidelines ensure a general consistency

of approach and actions across schools, schools are, and must

be,  given  the  flexibility to develop their own  discipline

policy  with regard to specific disciplinary problems.   This

degree  of  school autonomy is essential as school situations

differ.   Detailed guidelines on what schools can and  cannot

do  would  curtail the ability of the schools to  manage  its

discipline situation effectively.
