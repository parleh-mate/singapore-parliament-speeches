<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AIRPORT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Improvement to technical facilities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  what measures are being taken to  improve

the  technical facilities at the Singapore  Airport

so   that  it  will  acquire  a  reputation   among

international  airlines as an equal to  the  safest

airports in the world.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Joo  Chiat  need  not really worry  that  Singapore

Airport lacks a reputation as being a safe airport.

The  fact  that  there  are 20  airlines  operating

through   Singapore  is  eloquent   evidence   that

facilities  at Singapore Airport are acceptable  to

them.  And,  in  fact,  there  is  a  Facilitations

Committee which consists of my officials as well as

representatives  from  the  airlines  which   meets

frequently  to discuss what measures  we  ought  to

introduce  at the Singapore Airport that will  make

commercial operations viable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The I.C.A., or the International Civil Aviation

organisation,  of  which  Singapore  is  a  member,

prescribes  standards regarding airport operations.

They    include   air   traffic   control,    radio

communications, air navigational and landing heads,

fire  and rescue services, meteorological and other

aeronautical  information  services.  As   far   as

Singapore is concerned, we have complied  with  the

prescribed  standards, and the Member no  doubt  is

referring to a newspaper article published sometime

ago in which criticism was directed at all airports

in Asia, excepting Hongkong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind Members of the House that

the   approach  to  Singapore  is  free  of   hilly

obstructions; neither do we suffer the disadvantage

of  having fog which interferes with the vision  of

pilots. Because we do not have these disadvantages,

we  must,  therefore,  use  our  common  sense  and

discretion in equipping Singapore Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention that once upon a time Singapore

had housing by-laws which were taken wholesale from

the  United Kingdom building by-laws when Singapore

was   under  colonial  administration.  One  by-law

insisted that the roofs of houses in Singapore must

be built at an angle of 60° so that when snow falls

the  snow will slide off the roof. It was  only  in

recent years that we removed this by-law as it  was

patently  obvious  that  snow  does  not  fall   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral that I would like to draw is that it

would  be foolish for us to insist on, or  to  have

imposed upon us, the facilities and standards which

are  required only in those airports which face the

perennial problem of fog or hazardous approach  due

to obstruction by hills.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister for Finance the number of non-citizens  in

the    Civil   Service   eligible   for   Singapore

citizenship under the proviso to paragraph (c) of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



Article 57 (1) of the Constitution who have applied

for citizenship and the number who have not.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the present policy is

that  only  Division I and Division  II  Government

officers  are  eligible for the reduced  period  of

residential    qualification   to    qualify    for

citizenship under the proviso to Article 57 (1) (c)

of the Constitution. We do not recruit non-citizens

into Division III and Division IV posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of 697 officers in Divisions I

and  II  who are non-Singapore citizens. Of  these,

471 officers are eligible for Singapore citizenship

under this proviso. 196 are not eligible and 30 are

expatriate  officers.  Of  the  471  eligible   for

citizenship,  387  or  82  per  cent   have   taken

advantage  of the concession and have  applied  for

citizenship.  The 84 who have not applied  comprise

47  officers  in Division I and 37 in Division  II.

The  47 Division I officers are mostly medical  and

dental officers. The majority of the 37 officers in

Division II are teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Sir, what does

the Minister propose to do about the 47 Division  I

officers  who  do not wish to apply  for  Singapore

citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In my answer I said that the

majority  of  these  47  Division  I  officers  are

medical  and  dental officers. They are  performing

technical duties and are not concerned with policy-making decisions, and I propose to do nothing about

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, should there be available

Singapore  citizens who can take over these  posts,

would  the  Minister  consider replacing  the  non-citizens with local citizens?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When we get the situation

where we have more doctors than we need, I think we

will consider that particular proposition.

<div align="center"><b>LIBERALISATION OF INCOME TAX ASSESSMENTS AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COLLECTION FROM FOREIGN ARTISTES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (a) what was the amount and percentage  of

income tax collected in 1966 from foreign artistes;

(b)  if  he  is  aware that the present  income-tax

assessments  of foreign artistes and  the  mode  of

collection   are  discouraging  talented   overseas

musicians,  dancers and actors from  performing  in

Singapore;  and  (c)  as the performances  of  such

artistes  can be a means of fostering the  progress

of the performing arts in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



Singapore,  if  he  will consider liberalising  the

allowances  and modes of assessment and  collection

of income tax from foreign artistes as an incentive

to  talented overseas performers to come to perform

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is a question in

three parts, and my answers are as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Approximately $205,000 were collected in

income  tax  from foreign artistes  in  1966.  This

works out to 0.18 per cent of the total income  tax

collected during that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) I am not aware that the present income tax

assessments  of foreign artistes and  the  mode  of

collection   are  discouraging  talented   overseas

musicians,  dancers and actors from  performing  in

Singapore. In 1965 there were 381 foreign artistes.

In  1966  the number increased to 636, i.e.,  there

was an increase of 67 per cent; and in the first  9

months of 1967 Singapore had 666 foreign artistes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of collection is basically similar to

that  used by income tax authorities all  over  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) I agree that the performance of talented

artistes  can be a means of fostering the  progress

of   the  performing  arts  in  Singapore.  Foreign

artistes whose visits are financed by public  funds

of   another  country  are  exempt  from  tax.  All

artistes   are  given  reasonable  allowances   for

expenses  as laid down in the law. These allowances

include expenditure on make-up, hair-dos, costumes,

laundry,  accommodation, travel, and so  on.  Where

the  artistes are on a circuit, stopping  at  other

places  than  Singapore, only a  portion  of  their

passage    expenditure   attributable   to    their

performance in Singapore is allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence to suggest, and I am not

convinced, that income tax is the crucial factor in

determining   the   number  of   foreign   artistes

performing in Singapore. However, a Bill  is  being

introduced to reduce the rate of income tax payable

by non-residents deriving income from employment in

Singapore, from 40 per cent to 15 per cent. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



will  apply to all persons taking up employment  in

Singapore for short periods. Artistes will  benefit

by this concession.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A census of the population

if  he  will make a statement on comparative prices

of   non-luxury   goods   (including   food-stuffs)

imported into Singapore from India, China and Japan

and those imported from America, the United Kingdom

and Germany.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My difficulty is that I do not

know  what  the  hon. Member means  by  "non-luxury

goods", and no doubt his definition, if he attempts

it,  will  differ from mine or anybody  else's.  We

import no less than 1,470 different items from  the

countries he mentioned, and they are worth $1,521.3

million  last year. So I am afraid that unless  the

hon.  Member narrows considerably the scope of  his

question,  I would not know what is the information

he is seeking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

can  give  an example -for instance, footwear.  The

footwear we import from China as compared with  the

footwear   we  import  from  the  United   Kingdom,

Germany, or America.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir,

footwear  imported from China will be much  cheaper

than  footwear  imported from Germany,  the  United

Kingdom  or  America.  But I  hope  that  the  hon.

Member,  as a patriotic citizen of Singapore,  will

only buy locally-made Singapore footwear.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are no arbitrary price

increases  by  large  and  monopolistic  commercial

firms  in  Singapore  where market  conditions  are

generally highly competitive. We are, in fact,  one

of the few remaining outposts of free enterprise in

the world.

the  prices  of  their  products.  Though  the  oil

companies at one time tried to increase the  prices

of  their products, they finally decided not to  do

so. For some time they were considering how much of

the  increased freight could be passed  on  to  the

consumer  and how much could be absorbed  by  them.

decided to do the same. I think they did the  right

thing in taking a long-term view of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the third part of his question, the

hon.   Member  assumes  that  reducing  advertising

expenditure would lead to lower prices.  I  do  not

think everyone would be as confident as he is about

this.   My   own  inclination  is  to  allow   free

competition to settle market prices. Once you start

fiddling  with the market mechanism, you will  find

that  one  thing leads to another, and  before  you

know  where you are you have landed yourself in  an

unholy mess.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Does the Minister agree that

in regard to petroleum there is no such thing as  a

free market in Singapore? The price is fixed by the

oil companies themselves.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is what is called non-price competition. Prices are agreed, as the hon.

Member  has  suggested, but  there  is  an  immense

amount  of  competition in getting a share  of  the

market at those agreed prices. So in this sense  we

can  say that there is free competition in the  oil

market,  though it is not competition in  terms  of

price  cutting  but competition in  terms  of  non-price,  that  is, advertising, getting more  retail

outlets and that sort of thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Can the Minister give

us the figures of the expenditure on advertising in

respect of the oil companies?

the  number  of employees newly recruited,  locally

and  from abroad, by the various oil companies  for

the  refineries; and (ii) the number  of  employees

transferred from the various departments of the oil

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The total fixed capital

investment  of the oil refineries which were  given

pioneer  status to date amounts to $124,814,575.00.

To  date the employment of the oil refineries given

pioneer  status numbers 398, and of these  56  were

the  refineries. The local employees number 378 and

foreign employees 20.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Is the Minister

aware that despite the pioneer status given to  the

Shell  Group,  they are preparing early  retirement

for some 400 employees which may ultimately lead to

their retrenchment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am not aware of that.

The  fact  that  a company is given pioneer  status

does not mean that it is not entitled to reduce its

staff  if it finds that it has excessive staff  for

the work and for the market that it has to serve.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Will the Minister support the

Shell Company in the event that there is a manpower

exercise   which   leads  to   the   dismissal   or

retrenchment  of 400 or so employees?  And  in  the

event that the company is willing to compensate all

those affected employees, will the Minister support

the  Company's policy for this retrenchment, if the

company  can  pay  sufficient compensation  to  the

employees?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not quite sure what the

supplementary  question is. I do  not  think  I  am

called  upon to support or oppose any action  taken

by  a private firm in respect of its own staff. All

private  firms  have the right  under  the  law  to

increase or to reduce their staff according to what

they  think  is in the interest of their  business.

One  hopes,  of  course, that  employers  will  not

retrench staff unless there are over-riding reasons

for so doing. In the case of Shell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



Company,  I have always known them to be very  good

employers paying good wages, and in the event  that

they  find  it regrettably necessary to  reduce  or

retrench staff, they have always paid very handsome

retrenchment terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I thought pioneer status was

given  to companies to help reduce the unemployment

market?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir. Pioneer certificates

are   given  to  companies  for  producing  pioneer

products.  And when they produce a new  product  or

establish a factory, it follows that they will give

more  employment to people. In the  case  of  Shell

Company, it could well be that they have found that

they   have  got  an  excessive  number  on   their

establishment.  If this is the case,  then  in  the

interest of efficiency and higher productivity,  it

is  quite  open to them and it is only  right  that

they  reduce  their staff to the number  that  they

think   they   need  to  carry   out   their   work

efficiently.

<div align="center"><b>IMPORT OF FOREIGN GOODS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Relaxation of quotas)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he will consider relaxing the quotas  on

the   import  of  foreign  goods  where  the  local

production of similar goods is insufficient to meet

the  local demand, as a relief to importers who are

experiencing  a decline in their trade  because  of

quotas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, where local production is

inadequate  to meet local demand for  a  particular

commodity  which is subject to quota  licensing,  a

relaxation  of quota restrictions is  allowed.  For

instance,  the  quota  on matches  was  immediately

liberalised in December last year from one per cent

of  1964  imports to 75 per cent when it was  found

that there was a shortage of this commodity in  the

market.  There  were  many  other  occasions   when

similar  action was taken. The quota  on  builders'

hardware was completely removed in March this  year

when  it  became clear that the local  factory  was

going to shut down because of various difficulties.

During the Middle East crisis some time this  year,

quota restrictions on a number of commodities, such

as  electrodes, cables, galvanised wire and calcium

carbide,  were  immediately lifted to  ensure  that

importers had sufficient stocks to meet demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, where there is evidence that a local

manufacturer  is  trying to  exploit  consumers  by

either   arbitrarily  increasing   prices   or   by

deliberately  reducing  production  to  create   an

artificial   shortage   of  a   commodity,   import

restrictions  have also been relaxed. Undergarments

are  a  case in point. It was discovered  that  the

price of imported garments had been increased,  but

the  local factory did not increase its production.

Similarly  the  quota on wire nails  was  increased

from  10  per cent of 1963 imports to 50  per  cent

early  this  year  when  the  two  local  factories

arbitrarily increased their prices. The hon. Member

is,  of  course,  aware of Government's  action  in

granting a licence to import 10,000 tons of cement,

duty  free, when a temporary shortage developed  in

September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In issues such as these, the paramount

consideration  is the welfare of the  consumer  and

not  the  earnings of importers. I have  repeatedly

informed  our business community - and this includes

importers  - that where we can produce  a  commodity

which we have previously imported, we shall do  so.

Importers who know the product and the local market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



are   in   a   good  position  to  enter   into   a

manufacturing venture to produce the commodity.  If

they  fail to do so and suffer a decline in  income

as  a  consequence, they have nobody but themselves

to   blame   for   not   having   taken   seriously

Government's declared policy on industrialisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

According to the Minister, of course, this is  very

good.  But  for the local factories which  are  not

producing enough, I hope the quota system  will  be

more  liberalised in order to meet the  demands  of

the consumers. Ours is a trading city and we should

enable  the  traders  to do  their  business  under

better conditions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is precisely the

point I was making.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Does the Minister agree that

there is always a time lag between the increase  in

price  and  the  relaxation of  quota  restrictions

during  which the consuming public will suffer  and

the  manufacturers will benefit? Will the Minister,

in  such  circumstances, consider introducing  more

stringent   regulations  to  penalise  unscrupulous

local  manufacturers  who  take  advantage  of  the

special  protection given to them by the Government

to exploit the consuming public?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think it is possible to

exaggerate  the extent of this problem.  There  has

been  a  very substantial increase in our  domestic

manufactures,  and  the number of  instances  where

shortages developed is very small in proportion  to

our  production. On the whole, I would say that our

manufacturers  have acted with great responsibility

and it is only the odd persons, either deliberately

or otherwise, who have caused a shortage of supply.

There must be a time lag surely. Otherwise we would

have  acted before there is any increase  in  price

and  we could hardly justify our action under  such

circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Will the Minister assure this

House  that  if  a  time lag  arises,  he  will  do

something  to  restrict  local  manufacturers  from

exploiting the consuming public? There has  been  a

lot  of  talk  that the public always  has  to  pay

double  the prices of goods which we used to import

in  the  past, but which are now being manufactured

locally. And if this thing is not stopped, I  think

the  public  will have no confidence  in  Singapore

manufactured goods.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am astounded that a

leader  of  the trade union movement has  expressed

such  sentiments. Is he not aware of the  thousands

of  workers given employment in new industries,  or

does he want to see these compatriots of his thrown

out  of  work? As for local products costing  twice

the  imported products, I challenge the hon. Member

to  mention just one product and quote chapter  and

verse  where  the  local product  costs  twice  the

imported product.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE TO DECLINING WHOLESALE TRADE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether he has any proposals to assist  the

wholesale trade in view of the importance  of  that

trade  to the economy of Singapore and in  view  of

the decline in that trade, a situation which is not

eased   by   the   practice  whereby   some   local

manufacturers do not distribute their goods through

wholesalers but sell direct to retailers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, trade in Singapore, far

from  declining, is, in fact, on the increase.  For

the  12-month  period  ending July  1967,  external

trade  totalled $7,783.3 million which exceeds  the

volume of trade in 1959, a record year. In the last

12  months, i.e., August 1966 to July 1967, imports

have  increased by 9.7 per cent and exports by 10.8

per  cent  over the similar period August  1965  to

July  1966. Prospects are therefore very good  that

1967 will register the highest ever volume of trade

done in the history of the Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the increase in trade is the amount of

cargo loaded and discharged in Singapore. Thus  for

the  12-month  period ending in  July  1967,  cargo

discharged  amounted to 17.9 million freight  tons.

Cargo  loaded was 11.4 million freight tons,  which

exceeds the annual volume of cargo handled  in  the

past  eight  years. There is therefore no  need  to

give  assistance to trade or in any  way  interfere

with the free competition in our trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I asked

in my question is about manufacturers selling their

goods to retailers direct, which is not the correct

way of doing business. Will the Minister answer  to

the point?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, if I may paraphrase the

Member's  supplementary. He would like to  know  if

you  will  do  anything to ease the  situation  for

wholesalers,  a  situation which is  aggravated  by

local manufacturers selling direct to retailers and

not  through  wholesalers.  The  Member's  apparent

concern is in the last three lines of his question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I see no reason to help

wholesalers because if a local manufacturer can cut

out one stage in the circulation of his goods, that

means  the  consumer gets his goods  at  a  cheaper

price. Therefore, wholesalers who suffer from  this

should change their occupation to other lines which

are  more in keeping with their usefulness  to  the

economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not

quite understand what the Minister has said. What I

asked is that manufacturers should sell their goods

to the wholesalers and not direct to the retailers.

I  would like the Minister to pay attention to this

point.   The  reason  is  that  manufacturers   are

producing in large quantities. If the goods are not

sold  to  the wholesalers or the agents,  then  the

wholesalers and the agents will not have any  goods

to sell to the retailers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



and  consumers. If the manufacturers  sell

direct  to  the retailers, what are the wholesalers

or agents going to do?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, can you repeat your answer?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if the manufacturer sells

direct  to the retailers and does not make  use  of

the  wholesalers,  it  means the  services  of  the

wholesalers are unnecessary. There is no  point  in

making  use  of unnecessary economic  services  and

paying these people. Therefore, if they are out  of

job, they should go and do something else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me

several minutes more to ask another question.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, if you have a

supplementary,  please ask it.  I  cannot  allow  a

debate.  If  you are not happy with the  Minister's

answer,  there  are other devices whereby  you  can

criticise the Minister, but you cannot do by way of

a supplementary that asks no question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Sir.

We  should  look  into  this situation  where  many

manufacturers are now selling their products direct

to  the retailers. The manufacturers ought to  sell

their  goods to the wholesalers or agents  so  that

they  may make a living. If the manufacturers  sell

direct  to the consumers, to me or to you, how  are

they going to make a living? They must sell to  the

wholesalers.   It   should   be   the   case    for

manufacturers to sell to wholesalers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, those who are in the

manufacturing business are there in business.  They

are not charitable institutions to support families

of wholesalers.

confrontation. It is only possible for me  to  give

the  total  number of firms and companies  directly

affected  by confrontation and brought  within  the

scope of the Economic Defence Scheme established in

1963.  All  in  all, there were some 40  industrial

establishments  and 18 shipping  companies  brought

within the scope of this scheme. Today 17 of the 18

However,  new firms have been established  in  this

field. The exact number is not known. In March this

year, returns made to the Labour Ministry show that

there have been one new shipping firm and eight new

industrial  firms  established  in  the  field   of

raising  of  the  respective  Missions  to  Embassy

level,  trade  between Singapore and  Indonesia  is

that,  from the point of view of Singapore,  we  do

not  see  any  snags and indeed we are implementing

whatever  arrangements have been agreed to  by  us.

Differences  of opinion such as those  relating  to

shipping    agreements    are    being    discussed

continuously by both sides, both at the  commercial

system  and  its  own  way of life  free  from  any

essential principles underlining the creation of  a

stable and peaceful international order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy of Vietnam is that the conflict

between  North and South has drawn in also the  big

powers, so that the war has come to be regarded  as

confrontation between the big powers themselves. We

believe  that all those who feel for the sufferings

of  the  Vietnamese people, whether they be in  the

North  or  in the South, are anxious that  the  war

should  be brought to a speedy end. Many countries,

Asian,  African and European, have made efforts  to

mediate in the war but to no avail. If that is  so,

Sir,  I  need not add that there is precious little

that  Singapore can do to help bring the war  to  a

peaceful  conclusion. All we can hope is  that  the

outcome can be settled at the conference table  and

not  by  enlargement  of the war.  This  calls  for

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health  whether he will consider reducing  hawkers'

licence  fees  from  $10 to $6 in  respect  of  day

stalls



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



and from $20 to $12 in respect of night stalls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San (Acting Minister for Health):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not  possible  to  consider

reducing  hawkers' licence fees from $10 to  $6  in

respect  of  day  stalls and from  $20  to  $12  in

respect of night stalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees referred to apply to day stalls and

night  stalls  in the public streets  in  the  city

areas  and apply to pitches for the sale of  goods,

drinks  and sundries. They were imposed many  years

ago  and represent nominal charges. Considering the

average  volume  of  business  transacted  at  such

stalls, this is not an unduly high rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review is being undertaken, in conjunction with

the  Ministry of Finance, of various fees which are

charged  in  respect of all stalls in all  markets,

street  pitches, open pitches, etc.,  both  in  the

city and rural areas. No piecemeal decision can  be

taken  without  having regard to all  related  fees

being  charged. It is, however, not likely  that  a

reduction can be effected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Can the Minister say

how  many hawkers' licences have not been paid  for

now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I require notice of that

question.

Defence   whether  he  is  aware   that   documents

submitted   to   the  Immigration   Department   by

applicants   for  passports  have  sometimes   been

returned  undesirably folded up, if not  torn;  and

whether  he  will review the present  procedure  of

handling such documents to prevent this happening.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  documents submitted  by  applicants  for

Singapore  passports are usually not folded  except

the marriage certificate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



as  the  present marriage certificate is of  larger

size than the application form. Before the marriage

certificate is folded, prior permission is obtained

from the applicants by the counter clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new system has been adopted whereby all

documents  are  recorded on the  application  forms

immediately  on  application  and  the  documentary

evidence returned to applicants immediately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  (a)  how  many  students,  who  had   been

expelled  from secondary schools because  of  their

anti-national activities, have been admitted to the

National  Youth Leadership Training Institute;  (b)

what is the syllabus and the content of courses  of

instruction arranged for them; and (c) whether they

are satisfied with the reformative course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, of the students  expelled  from

secondary  schools  because of their  anti-national

activities, 15 were admitted to a special course at

the Institute on 14th August, 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course of instruction includes the study of

Communist ideology, systems and organisations,  and

methods  of  subversion. In addition, provision  is

made  in  the  syllabus for physical  and  cultural

activities,   and   tuition  in  secondary   school

subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are satisfied with the reformative

course.  This  is substantiated by  the  collective

statement  produced by them on 11th October,  1967,

whereby   they   renounced   Communism,   expressed

gratitude  to  the  Government for  giving  them  a

second  chance in life, and pledged loyalty to  the

Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Can the Minister

assure us that they will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



detrimental   to  the  National  Youth   Leadership

Training Institute?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my reply,

I  have  indicated  that they have  finished  their

reorientation  course and they are  going  back  to

school.  Some may be seeking employment. Therefore,

the  chance of any damage to the Institute does not

arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, can the Minister state why courses  on

subversion should be taught to these students?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> The answer is very simple. It

may have been due to their ignorance that they have

been  exploited by the Communists. For that reason,

they have been given a chance to study the course.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DELINEATION COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a White

Paper  on  the  Report of the Electoral  Boundaries

Delineation   Committee  has  been   presented   to

Parliament  as  Command 22 of 1967. The  Government

has  decided to accept all the recommendations made

by the Committee with regard to the sub-division of

ten  large constituencies and the creation of eight

new  ones  with consequential adjustments to  three

constituencies. It has also decided  to  merge  the

electoral  division of Southern  Islands  with  the

electoral  divisions of Jurong, Pasir  Panjang  and

Telok  Blangah.  The number of electoral  divisions

will be increased from the present 51 to 58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Parliament Elections Ordinance

(Chapter  53) provides that each electoral division

shall return one member to serve in Parliament. The

Constitution    of    Singapore    stipulates     a

Parliamentary membership of 51 unless it is  varied

by   law.   Accordingly,  a   Bill   entitled   the

Parliamentary Membership Bill will be introduced at

the  present  sitting  of Parliament  in  order  to

increase   the  number  of  electoral  members   of

Parliament above the present membership of 51. This

increase  will  come into effect as from  the  next

general elections. However, for the purposes of the

next  general elections, it is necessary to publish

a  Gazette  Notification under  section  8  of  the

Singapore Parliament Elections Ordinance specifying

the names and boundaries of the 58 revised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



electoral  divisions  and  to  prepare  for  public

inspection  the  1967 registers of  electors  under

section  10  of  the same Ordinance.  In  order  to

enable  these  steps to be taken, the Parliamentary

Membership Bill, 1967, will be introduced  at  this

sitting of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Bill, entitled the Singapore Parliament

Elections  (Amendment) Bill,  1967,  will  also  be

introduced.  This Bill will amend the Ordinance  to

provide  for the preparation of the first registers

of  electors  from the register maintained  by  the

Commissioner  of  National  Registration   and   to

include  in such electoral registers the  names  of

all entitled persons who were, on the first day  of

July  1967,  citizens  of  Singapore  and  to  whom

identity  cards were issued. The present  registers

of  electors were first compiled nine years ago  in

1958.  In  the  past, any person who  possessed  an

identity  card which shows his place  of  birth  as

Singapore,   or  who  is  ordinarily  resident   in

Singapore on the first day of February in any  year

and  not less than 21 years of age on the first day

of July in that year, was automatically included in

the  registers of electors. It is obvious that with

Singapore's independent status only citizens can be

given  the right to stand for election and to vote.

In  the recent re-registration campaign of persons,

it  was discovered that a number of identity  cards

had  been  forged. Also, a number of  persons  with

identity  cards  showing their place  of  birth  as

Singapore  were not given citizen's identity  cards

due   to   lack  of  adequate  proof  of  Singapore

citizenship. For these reasons, fresh registers  of

electors  have to be compiled. The fresh  registers

of  electors will be-compiled from the  records  of

citizens maintained by the Commissioner of National

Registration  and will include only  those  persons

who  produced  satisfactory evidence  of  Singapore

citizenship and who, on the first day of July 1967,

were  entitled to have their names entered  in  the

fresh registers of electors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Singapore Parliament Elections

(Amendment)   Bill  has  become  law,   a   Gazette

Notification will be published to specify the names

and   boundaries   of  the  58  revised   electoral

divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is my

intention  today to introduce only these two  Bills

and to defer debate on them when the Second Reading

comes up on the 14th of this month.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Lim Kim San):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years there has been an

increase   of  unauthorised  hawking   within   the

numerous  Housing  and Development  Board  Estates,

where  they  ply  their  trade  without  order   or

control, thereby causing health nuisances,  litter

and obstruction to traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncontrolled hawking is a menace to the health,

sanitation and cleanliness of our city, and in many

cases  is  a traffic hazard. To assist in the  more

effective solution of the problem, laws have to  be

updated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1964 a new Hawkers Code was announced

and  registration  of  hawkers  for  the  whole  of

Singapore was initiated. In the first phase, 11,000

pasar malam hawkers were registered followed by the

registration,  resiting and control of  hawkers  in

the    various   constituencies   beginning    with

Cairnhill, River Valley and Stamford in 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year a re-organisation of the Cleansing

Department  was started to control the environment.

This involves a four-pronged attack on problems  of

hawking,  public  cleansing, mosquito  control  and

general  sanitation. With the experience gained  in

Geylang  West, the programme has been  extended  to

three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



other  constituencies, in Anson, Tanjong Pagar  and

Telok Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the present Bill is to enable

statutory  bodies which have hawkers plying  within

the  limits of their estates to exercise powers and

control  normally  vested in the Health  Authority.

This  will enable effective and expeditious  action

against  those  who are plying their trade  without

order or control in these estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers are vested in the Director of

Medical Services and his officers, and the proposed

amendments  are to enable the Director  of  Medical

Services to delegate powers to control hawkers  and

stalls  to a statutory body or statutory bodies  as

and when it is found necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sections only of the Ordinance are amended,

i.e.,  section  77  which relates  to  stalls,  and

section  78  which  relates to  itinerant  hawkers.

These   two  sections  of  the  Ordinance   empower

officers  to  arrest,  serve  notices  and  impound

properties and articles which are put up  for  sale

by unlicensed stall holders and hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important amendment is given as an additional

subsection  (15)  to section 78 which  extends  the

definition  of public officer, for the purposes  of

these  two sections, to include "any officer  of  a

statutory  board or body". In this way any  officer

of  a  Statutory  Board, such as  the  Housing  and

Development Board, can exercise control  of  stalls

and hawkers in their premises or properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments made to sections 77 and 78

in  each  of their subsections (10) are similar  to

each  other. The amendments will enable an  officer

to   impound   or  seize  property  or   goods   of

unauthorised stalls or hawkers not only  in  police

stations or Government depots, as provided  in  the

existing  sections, but to any "such other  places"

as   may   be  approved  by  the  Director.   These

amendments will enable officers of the Housing  and

Development  Board, for example,  to  impound  such

seized properties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



within the Board's own premises. Obviously,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, it would be impractical  if  the

seized  goods have to be carted to a police station

or a Government depot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed, therefore, relate only

to  hawking  in the properties of Statutory  Boards

and  do  not  affect the general authority  of  the

Director or his policy-making powers in the control

of hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Lim Kim San):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill makes a number of significant

amendments  to  the  Medicines  (Advertisement  and Sale) Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years there have been numerous

complaints of undesirable advertisements  appearing

chiefly   in   the  Chinese  newspapers  concerning

medicines or unqualified persons claiming cures for

a wide range of conditions such as sexual weakness,

infertility,   delayed  menstruation,   etc.   Such

advertisements are generally deceitful, misleading,

and constitute a danger to the public. Prosecutions

under  the  two Ordinances which may  control  such

advertisements,     namely,      the      Medicines

(Advertisement and Sale) Ordinance, 1955,  and  the

Indecent  Advertisement Ordinance (Cap. 142),  have

been difficult and unsuccessful as advertisers have

got  round  the restrictions by using homonyms  and

synonyms or by claiming medical skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful consideration has been given to this

problem before it has reached the present stage  of

presenting an amendment Bill to Parliament. As  far

back  as  1962,  a Committee was appointed  by  the

former Minister under the chairmanship of Dr  Gwee

Ah  Leng,  one of Singapore's prominent physicians,

to  examine the problem and to suggest measures  of

control with the following terms of reference: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to study the current undesirable and unethical

`cures'  and  `advertisement  of  cures',  and   to

suggest measures of control."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee made certain recommendations for

amendments  to  the  Medicines  (Advertisement  and

Sale)  Ordinance  to  prohibit  advertisements   of

medicines  for  various ailments and advertisements

claiming specific personal medical skills.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, in the second half of 1966, the

Committee   was   resuscitated   under   the   same

chairmanship  but with wider terms of reference.  I

quote the terms of reference, Mr Speaker: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to study the current unethical, dishonest and

undesirable advertisements pertaining to treatment,

cures,  and  to  the medical skills of  unqualified

persons   and  to  suggest  measures  of  effective

control."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unanimous conclusions of this Committee

extended   the  recommendations  of  the   previous

Committee  by reviewing and adding to the  list  of

diseases prohibited for general advertising and  by

recommending a ban on all advertisements pertaining

to medical skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also made certain recommendations

for   the   effective  control  of  labelling   and

importation of drugs. However, these proposals  are

being  dealt  with separately by the Controller  of

Imports  and Exports as they relate to his  control

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to elaborate on the Bill clause

by clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 sets out the Short Title and

commencement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 4 of the Ordinance by

substituting  a Schedule in place of  the  list  of

conditions  and diseases mentioned  in  respect  of

which  advertisements are prohibited. The  Schedule

may be amended by notification in the Gazette. This

arrangement  is  obviously  less  cumbersome   than

having    to    amend   the   Ordinance    whenever

circumstances make it necessary to amend the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 creates a new section aimed at

prohibiting  advertisements  relating  to   medical

skill  or  service.  Medical practitioners  of  the

Western school are forbidden to advertise by  their

ethics  and  this is controlled by  a  disciplinary

body   of   the  profession  itself,  namely,   the

Singapore  Medical Council. The Chinese Physicians'

Association have also officially declared its stand

in   public   against  advertisements  by   medical

practitioners  of the Chinese school.  However,  in

their case, they are handicapped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



by  the lack of a disciplinary board. The amendment

in this section will, therefore, reinforce the hand

of  the medical practitioners of the Chinese school

who  will now be able to see their stand reinforced

by law. This prohibition will financially affect  a

number  of publications in the Chinese medium,  but

public  interest  must supersede private  interest,

however  much we may regret the loss of  income  to

these establishments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 5 of the Ordinance so

that  the prohibition of advertisements on articles

relating   to  abortion  is  extended  to  prohibit

advertisements  referring  to  medical   skill   or

service relating to abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, which amends section 6 of the

Ordinance,   is  consequential  on  the   preceding

sections. It tidies up the references made  to  the

various  prohibitions so that these  are  correctly

referred  to. As part of the tidying-up process,  a

new subsection is added to provide for reference to

the new prohibition of advertisements referring  to

medical skill or service within this section  which

sets  out  provisions  as  to  offences  under  the

preceding sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 7 of the Ordinance so as

to  clarify  that where the required disclosure  of

composition of a medicine is written in a  language

other  than  the English language, such  disclosure

must be made in the English language as well as  in

any other language that may be used in addition  to

the English language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 creates a Schedule of diseases and

conditions  in respect of which advertisements  are

to be controlled. This Schedule reviews the list of

the  various  diseases and conditions mentioned  in

section  4  of  the  Ordinance.  The  list  is  now

extended  to include insanity, menstrual disorders,

sexual   function,   infertility,   impotency   and

frigidity.  The  study by the two Committees  under

Dr  Gwee  Ah Leng has indicated that the  diseases

and conditions mentioned in the Schedule constitute

the happy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



hunting-ground  of  those unscrupulous  advertisers

who  seek to "get rich quickly" by preying  on  the

anxiety  and desperation of the unfortunate victims

of these diseases and conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of parties likely to be

interested in the proposals contained in this Bill,

such as doctors, physicians, pharmacists, dentists,

importers   of   Chinese  drugs   and   advertising

agencies.  It has therefore been decided that  this

Bill  be  referred  to a Select Committee,  if  the

Second   Reading  is  approved,   so   that   wider

consideration  might  be  given  to  the  suggested

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say that we owe a duty to the

people  of  Singapore to protect them from  further

ruthless  exploitation  of this  kind  which  makes

money  out of the sufferings and despair  of  those

unable  to  judge  wisely.  These  amendments  will

translate an universally accepted principle in  the

medical code of ethics into a provision in the  law

of  the  land. I am confident that the hon. Members

of  this  House will give me their support for  the

enactment of this proposed legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

fully  support  the amendment Bill now  before  us.

This  is because the introduction of this Bill aims

at  controlling  undesirable  and  immoral  medical

advertisements  and  stopping  quack  doctors  from

profiteering  and deceiving those  people  who  are

suffering  from  various diseases.  This  will,  of

course,  give  an impetus to those fully  qualified

doctors  and  other persons who are  professionally

qualified  to serve our sick people and to  promote

public health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you turn to the Chinese

newspapers,  every  day  you  will  see  from   the

advertisements  that there are so many  undesirable

advertisements relating to various diseases.  There

have been a lot of quack doctors blowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



their  own trumpets in the advertisements  to  show

how  efficient they are and that they  can  turn  a

sick  man into a healthy, robust person. There  are

gullible  people who fall for these advertisements.

They  not only lose their money, but some  of  them

even lose their lives. So we can see the extent  of

the harm done by these undesirable advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, Mr Speaker, we are quite

satisfied  with the code of ethics of  our  medical

profession  and  we must also take legal  steps  to

ensure that this code of ethics is observed so that

the  interest of the public together with  that  of

the  medical profession is upheld to the  exclusion

of those undesirable and unscrupulous quack doctors

who  poison our people with all sorts of drugs.  In

this  way, Mr Speaker, we can see to it  that  the

good  reputation of the medical profession  is  not

damaged,  and  the  health of  the  public  is  not

jeopardised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in point of fact, the rise of these

medical advertisements can be attributed partly  to

the  newspapers themselves. They should  have  some

moral  responsibility towards their  readers.  They

must  know  what is right and what  is  wrong,  and

cannot do things merely with a view to profiting at

the  expense  of  their readers who constitute  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own humble opinion, this amendment Bill

will  certainly receive the support of the  doctors

and  the professional bodies in the medical  field.

It will certainly promote the medical profession in

our  Republic  so that the services  and  medicines

prescribed  by  qualified  doctors  will  be  given

attention to, without the quack doctors fishing  in

troubled  waters.  In this way, we  will  certainly

become  a  country  in  South-east  Asia  with  the

highest  standard  in the medical  profession.  Mr

Speaker, I fully support this Bill.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, I do not propose to talk too long on  this

matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



As  we all agree, this Bill has been introduced  to

safeguard  the interest of the public and  it  also

indicates  that the Government is now paying  great

attention to this matter. With this amendment  Bill

I  am  quite sure that the people of Singapore will

have  greater protection medically, and  they  will

have one more safeguard against the quack doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of this Bill is that those who are

really  interested  in  the medical  profession  in

Singapore will not have their business affected  or

jeopardised  by  the  unscrupulous  advertising  of

quacks  in  Singapore. In this  way  professionally

qualified  people will be able to serve the  people

better  and  will be able to improve themselves  to

serve the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to raise one point. The

Minister has reiterated just now that the Bill will

be  enforced  against that sector  of  the  Chinese

physicians    who   have   resorted   to    medical

advertisements. What I wish to point  out  is  that

this  should  not  only be enforced  against  these

Chinese physicians. There are also cases of Western-trained doctors who are guilty of some advertising.

I    think   the   enforcement   should   not    be

discriminatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope also that the Bill will be referred

to  a  Select Committee which will then hear  views

and  representations  from the  Chinese  physicians

regarding the causes affecting their profession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> On a point of

order,   Mr   Speaker,  Sir.  The  Western-trained

doctors  do  not advertise. According to  the  hon.

Member  for  Delta, they have been advertising.  No

cases  have  been  reported to the Medical  Council

about  Western-trained doctors advertising. I  wish

the hon. Member will withdraw the remark.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

I  did  not  refer  to  the doctors  themselves  as

individuals. I referred to the pharmacists and  the

druggists   who   advertise  extensively   in   the

newspapers about the efficacy of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



medicine. I think this should also be controlled. I

did not refer to the medical profession as such.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member was perhaps

referring  to  advertisements in the English  Press

rather  than advertisements by doctors  trained  in

the Western system of medicine.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  personally feel  that  the  Bill

should  have been introduced a few years back.  But

it  is not too late however. A few moments ago  the

Member  for  Delta said that there  were  extensive

advertisements   both   in  the   Chinese   medical

profession   and   the   Western-trained    medical

profession.  As  pointed  out  by  Professor  Yeoh,

Western-trained   doctors  are   not   allowed   to

advertise and the position has been clarified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim of this Bill is to protect the

interest  of  the  public, not to protect  Western-trained  doctors  or  Chinese  doctors  or   Indian

doctors  for that matter. We admit that  there  are

drugs advertised in the newspapers manufactured  in

the Western world. But I wish to stress that in  so

far   as   drugs  manufactured  in  the  West   are

concerned, after clinical experiments on them  have

been  carried  out and they are approved  for  use,

they  are not allowed to be advertised. So this  is

quite different from the drugs manufactured by  the

Chinese  physicians. Of course, we do not deny  the

efficacy of some Chinese drugs. But there are cases

in  which  quack  doctors or businessmen  who  call

themselves doctors or physicians have advertised in

the papers for their own personal gain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also said that the

rise  of the medical advertisements should also  be

attributed partly to the newspapers. But in my  own

view,  the  position is not so had as he thinks.  I

know  of  one  case  where  one  paper  was  losing

business to the extent of some $3,000 a month,  and

it was proposed by a quack doctor that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



advertisement  to  the amount of  $3,000  would  be

given  provided the newspaper accepted him  as  its

medical  adviser; but this was turned down  by  the

newspaper. So it shows that the position is not  so

bad as the Member would think.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as other Members have already

pointed  out,  this Bill should be  referred  to  a

Select Committee for further consideration, because

even  at a random reading now, I can see that there

are  many  loopholes in the present  Bill,  because

some  of  these  quack doctors  may  not  advertise

directly but may advertise indirectly. For example,

one  may  say  that  he  has been  abroad  to  give

lectures  and  has been given some award,  so  that

when  he  comes back, he will be able to serve  our

sick  people  better.  This is  another  aspect  of

advertising and should be given attention.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, I wish to

say  a few words on this amendment Bill. Few people

have  supported it. If we are going to bring  in  a

law on advertisements of medicines, it is not going

to  affect  one  group, whether they  are  Indians,

Westerners  or Chinese. If there is a  law,  it  is

going  to affect everybody. The Member for Tampines

and   others  have  said  that  Westerners  do  not

advertise like this. But the law is not like  that.

Maybe  they do not do it today, but they may do  it

tomorrow. Whether they are Chinese or Indians, they

have  to  obey the law. It is a law for  everybody.

They  may  not  do  it today but  they  may  do  it

tomorrow.  So we have to bring in a law to  protect

even  for  the future. It should benefit everybody.

If  we  look  into this, the people are cheated  in

many  ways. They have spoilt themselves  by  taking

many  kinds of medicine. If we go through the  list

of  diseases  listed here, many people  may  be  in

favour   of  taking  these  medicines.  Take,   for

example,  diabetes. It is found in many people  who

are  over 45 years of age. They are anxious to cure

the disease and they are prepared to take any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



medicine, whether it is advertised in the papers or

whether  they hear of it from friends.  I  am  also

affected. That is why I am saying this.  I  am  not

taking   medicines   which   are   recommended   in

advertisements but I am taking medicines prescribed

by   doctors.  Many  people  may  be   cheated   by

advertisements. So I appreciate the action  of  the

Government in bringing forward this amendment Bill.

It  will  stop many people from getting  themselves

spoilt. Even old people, including me, may want  to

feel younger as they grow older So I may look for a

medicine to achieve this. But some people take  the

wrong medicine and get spoilt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important law but it should not affect

one  particular group or race. It should be  common

to all the races.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am glad we do not have a Standing

Order  that  prohibits advertisement of  one's  own

ailments!



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

consensus  of opinion is that this Bill  has  great

merits, and if at all there is any criticism, it is

that  it  has  taken such a long time  to  come  to

fruition.  We  hope  that  when  it  is  in  Select

Committee,  the Committee will work  fast  so  that

everyone will be satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<div align="center"><b>RUBBER ASSOCIATION OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(INCORPORATION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is designed to incorporate the Rubber

Association  of Singapore (hereinafter called  "the

Corporation") as a corporate body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1963, the Rubber

Association  of Singapore has been responsible  for

regulating  transactions in  the  Singapore  rubber

market.  Its  responsibilities were inherited  from

its original sponsors, the Rubber Trade Association

of  Singapore and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce

Rubber Association. The Association not only  deals

in  the day-to-day operation of the clearing house,

regulation  of  trading,  shipping  and  fixing  of

prices,  but  also  in  the  fields  of  contracts,

arbitration, packing standards and disciplining  of

the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association's income depends entirely on

members' subscriptions, tender fees and commissions

on    auction   sales.   In   recent   years,   the

Association's   income  from  these   sources   has

declined.  To  enable the Association  to  function

effectively  and competitively and to maintain  and

approve  the  high  standards  of  conduct  of  the

Singapore  rubber  market, it is clearly  necessary

that the Association should have adequate finances.

With  this  in  mind,  the  Association  approached

Government  with  a  proposal  that  it  should  be

authorised  to  levy  a cess on rubber  exportation

from  Singapore and to use the proceeds of the cess

to   cover  its  expenditure.  Since  there   were,

however,   legal   objections  to  empowering   the

Association,  as incorporated under  the  Societies

Ordinance, to collect a cess,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



it  was considered that the most appropriate  means

of overcoming these objections was to constitute  a

Corporation to replace the Association. The  assets

and property of the Association would then vest  in

the  Corporation. This is offered under  clauses  3

and 4 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objects of the Corporation are to

promote sales and exports of rubber from Singapore,

to  collect  a  cess  on rubber  exports  for  this

purpose,  and make rules and regulations  governing

the  marketing of rubber (clauses 4  and  14).  The

management  of the statutory body is  vested  in  a

Management Committee, which consists of 15 members,

seven  of  whom are nominated by the  Rubber  Trade

Association  of  Singapore and seven  of  whom  are

nominated  by  the  Singapore Chamber  of  Commerce

Rubber  Association.  The  remaining  member  is  a

public  officer.  It is proposed that  this  public

officer  will  be  the Director  of  Trade  of  the

Ministry   of  Finance.  This  officer  will   not,

however,   be   concerned   with   the   day-to-day

operations of the Rubber Association. The  Chairman

and  Deputy  Chairman  will  be  appointed  by  the

Minister  from  the  14 members  of  the  Committee

representing   the   two   component   associations

mentioned above (clause 10).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the powers of the Corporation are subject to

the  provisions  of  the Act  and  the  rules  made

thereunder, vested in the Management Committee. The

Committee  will, subject to the directions  of  the

Minister,  control the Singapore Rubber Fund  which

is  established under clause 13 of  the  Bill.  All

moneys  received  by the Committee,  including  the

proceeds  of  any cess collected under  clause  14,

will  be  paid into this Fund and the Fund will  be

used  to pay the expenses of the administration  of

the Committee and for carrying out the purposes  of

this legislation generally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



The  accounts of the Fund will be subject to audit.

The   Minister  under  clause  14,  acting  on  the

recommendation  of the Corporation,  has  power  to

make   orders   for  the  imposition,   collection,

variation  or  cancellation of  a  cess  on  rubber

exported  from Singapore. Any orders  made  by  the

Minister  under this provision are to be  published

in  the Gazette and presented to Parliament. It  is

made  clear in the Bill that all expenses  incurred

by  the  Corporation in the administration of  this

legislation shall be borne by the Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation may, with the approval of the

Minister,  make  rules  for  the  purpose  of  this

legislation. The Corporation may revoke,  amend  or

add to the rules, but such revocation, amendment or

addition  will not be effective until  ratified  by

the  Minister and published in the Gazette  (clause

17).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the existing Rules of the

Association will, with certain modifications,  form

the  basis  of  the  rules to be  made  under  this

proposed  legislation. This will ensure continuity.

assist  the  Association in  its  transition  to  a

corporate body, and cause the minimum of disruption

to the rubber industry in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Sir, the Rubber

Association of Singapore was originally  formed  by

the  Rubber Trade Association of Singapore and  the

Singapore Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association to

represent   most  of  the  Chinese   and   European

communities in the rubber business. Problems common

to  both the communities in the trade have to  some

extent   been  successfully  dealt  with   by   the

Association  in the past. This move to  incorporate

the  Rubber Association of Singapore as a corporate

body  with  perpetual succession is indeed  timely.

This  intention to provide for the conducting of  a

rubber market in Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



the regulation of the rubber trade and to establish

a Singapore Rubber Fund is very commendable in view

of  the  importance of the commodity to Singapore's

trade  and  of the importance of Singapore  in  the

rubber  business. But what strikes me most is  that

the  matter  does not seem to have been given  more

careful  thought  in the drafting of  the  proposed

Bill.  Under the present practice, one might become

a  member  of  the Rubber Association of  Singapore

only if he were sponsored by either one of the  two

component  Associations and duly  proposed  by  two

existing  members  of  the  Rubber  Association  of

Singapore.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill now provides for membership to

the  corporation as laid down in clause 7,  whereby

any  person  carrying on or intending to  carry  on

business  in  such classes of the rubber  trade  or

industry  may  be  admitted.  Members  of  the  two

existing  component  Associations  of  the  present

Rubber  Association of Singapore are  automatically

members of the proposed Corporation. In view of the

fact   that   under  the  Bill  before  the   House

membership  is being thrown open to all and  sundry

in  the trade in accordance with clause 7, I see no

reason at all why any member of the Corporation who

is admitted in accordance with clause 7 of the Bill

needs  to  be nominated by either one  of  the  two

component  Associations in order to be eligible  to

serve  in  the  Management Committee. The  proposed

Bill sets up a corporate body with wider membership

qualifications. It is to be a national body charged

with the task of regulating the rubber trade to the

best  advantage  not only to the trade  itself  but

also  to  the  national  good.  The  proposed  Bill

provides that the Minister has the final say in all

appointments.  I fully support the  Bill,  but  the

fact still remains that members of any organisation

should  have  the right and privilege  to  nominate

from  amongst its own members a Committee to manage

the affairs of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



organisation. I regret to say that clause 10 (2) of

the  proposed Bill denies members of this  proposed

Corporation  this  right  and  privilege  which  is

rightly theirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a nation in which every citizen is

given  equal opportunities. In view of what I  have

said, I see no justification in granting the Rubber

Trade  Association of Singapore and  the  Singapore

Chamber  of  Commerce Rubber Association  the  sole

right  and  privilege of nominating  14  out  of  a

committee of 15 members to manage the affairs of  a

corporation which admits members from  any  one  in

the rubber trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now propose that paragraphs (a) and (b) of

clause  10  (2) be deleted and substituted  by  the

following paragraphs -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lim, on the Second

Reading,  only the general merits and principle  of

the  Bill can be discussed. In any event,  to  move

amendments at the Committee stage, you should  have

given  notice under Standing Orders. No notice  has

been given. Therefore, I am afraid that even it you

try  to move your amendment at the Committee stage,

I  may have to reject it. But there is no objection

to  your making the criticism that you want to make

without attempting to move an amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Member like to proceed with the debate

on the general merits and principle of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> No, Sir, I would not like to

proceed now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened

to  the criticisms made by the Member for Havelock.

He should note that the Government wants the rubber

industry to be run without any disruption and  that

we  want continuity. That is why the present  setup

is continued in the new Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member's criticisms will be looked into

and considered in due course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have dealt with clauses 1 to 9.

Clause 10, Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 13, to leave out "Chambers" and

insert "Chamber". -[Mr Ramaswamy].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 22, to leave out "Board" and

insert "Committee". -[Mr Ramaswamy].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 10, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 10

stipulates that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The management of the Corporation shall be

vested in a Management Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Committee shall consist of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) seven members nominated by the Rubber Trade

Association of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) seven members nominated by the Singapore

Chamber of Commerce Rubber Association; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a public officer,...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I do not understand is this: clause 7

of  the  Bill  provides for membership whereby  any

person  carrying  on  or  intending  to  carry   on

business  in  the rubber trade or industry  may  be

admitted.  Members  of the two  existing  component

Associations  of the present Rubber Association  of

Singapore are automatically members of the proposed

Corporation. I see no reason at all why any  member

of  the  Corporation, who is admitted in accordance

with clause 7 of the Bill, needs to be nominated by

either  one  of  the two component Associations  in

order  to  be  eligible to serve in the  Management

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that members of any organisation should

have  the  right  and privilege  to  nominate  from

amongst  its own members a committee to manage  the

affairs of the organisation. But with clause 10,  I

regret  to  say  that  it  denies  members  of  the

proposed Corporation this right and privilege which

is  rightly  theirs. And I can see no justification

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



granting  the Rubber Trade Association of Singapore

and   the  Singapore  Chamber  of  Commerce  Rubber

Association   the  sole  right  and  privilege   of

nominating  14 out of a Committee of 15 members  to

manage the affairs of the Corporation, which admits

members from any one in the rubber trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, any reply?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b> indicated none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 to 20 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments: read a Third time

and passed.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That Parliament do now adjourn." -[Mr Jek Yeun Thong].



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Tuesday, 31st October, 1967</i></div>



<div align="center"><b>MALAY SETTLEMENT, SEMBAWANG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Further development)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development whether the Government has

a  scheme  for a Phase II Development of the  Malay

Settlement in the Sembawang Constituency  and  when

it will be implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> There are no definite plans for

the  further  development of  the  Sembawang  Malay

Settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 108 sites already allocated in

this  Settlement, approximately 92 more house  lots

can be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



available  if  the area is further  developed.  The

estimated   cost  of  filling,  site   preparation,

drainage  and  roads in respect of  the  additional

area  is,  however, around $100,000 i.e. more  than

$1,000 for each plot. The high cost of development,

the limited funds available for social development,

the  need  for  most effective utilisation  of  the

limited   areas   available  and  the   number   of

applicants   on   the  waiting   lists   have   all

contributed  to  cast doubts as to whether  further

development  in the Settlements along the  previous

lines   of  individual  house  lots  is   in   fact

desirable.  On balance, it would appear  preferable

if these areas could be more intensely developed by

building  flats  so as to cater for  all  the  many

applicants requiring housing.
