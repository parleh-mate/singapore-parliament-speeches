<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wish to inform hon. Members

that,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  No.  1(3)(a),   the

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>PEDRA BRANCA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs (a) what progress has been made in referring  the

issue  of  Pedra  Branca  to the International  Court  of

Justice;  and  (b)  whether the Singapore  and  Malaysian

Governments have ratified the Special Agreement.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after the signing of the

Special Agreement on 6th February 2003, the next step  is

for  the  two Governments to ratify the Special Agreement

and exchange the Instruments of Ratification.  Only after

this  is  done  can  both Governments jointly  refer  the

dispute  to the International Court of Justice.  On  17th

February,  we informed Malaysia that Singapore Government

has  ratified the Special Agreement and we proposed  that

both Governments exchange the Instruments of Ratification

on  24th February 2003 when both Foreign Ministers  would

be  in  Kuala  Lumpur for the Non-Aligned  Meeting.   The

Malaysian  Government  replied on 19th  February  stating

that because of heavy commitments that month arising from

their  hosting of the NAM Summit in KL, it was unable  to

do  so on that date but would propose a new date for  the

exchange of Instruments of Ratification in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where things stand and we have, on 11th

April,  reminded  them again to propose  dates  for  this

formality of exchange of Instruments of Ratification.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, does the Minister

find it surprising that the Malaysians, who were hurrying

us  on the date for signing the Special Agreement earlier

on, are now dragging their feet on the essential issue of

instruments of ratification?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Well, in a sense, it is

surprising.  And I do not know why that is so.  I am also

as puzzled as the Member

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>

is  as  to  why Malaysia is taking so long to ratify  the

Special Agreement.  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar and

I  agreed, when we signed the Special Agreement in  Putra

Jaya  on  6th  February 2003, that  ratification  of  the

Special  Agreement  would be done expeditiously  by  both

sides so that the ICJ process can begin.  More than eight

weeks  have  passed since the hosting of the  Non-Aligned

Summit,  and Dr Ong is right that Malaysia has criticised

Singapore  for  delaying  the  signing  of  the   Special

Agreement.    Now  that  we  have  signed   the   Special

Agreement,  we should get on with the next  step  without

unreasonable delay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Malaysian government would be able

to, as it had promised, propose dates for the exchange of

Instruments soon.  As I have said, we have reminded  them

recently on 11th April.

<div align="center"><b>REBUILDING OF IRAQ</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government's contribution)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for Foreign Affairs what is the Government's contribution

to   international  humanitarian  and  other  efforts  at

rebuilding Iraq.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore

supports  the United Nations' humanitarian relief  effort

along  with  the  work carried out by  the  International

Committee  of  the  Red Cross. On 23rd  March  2003,  the

Singapore  Red  Cross Society launched a national  appeal

for  humanitarian  aid to Iraq. The Singapore  Government

made  a  contribution  of S$442,000  to  kick-start  this

national humanitarian effort.  I understand that, so far,

the national appeal has raised more than S$770,000.  More

than   S$200,000   has  already  been  pledged   to   the

International  Committee of the  Red  Cross  to  purchase

basic necessities such as food parcels and wheat flour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government will also be contributing a

medical   team   of  13  personnel  for  a  three-monthly

rotation,  as  well  as  material contributions  such  as

tents,   blankets  and  cots.   The  expenses   of   such

additional contributions total S$3 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the people of Iraq deserve the full

support  of  the UN and international community  as  they

rebuild their lives and their country. Singapore will  do

what  it  can  in the international effort to  help  Iraq

rebuild and return to normal. This will pave the way  for

its eventual reintegration into the global community.

<div align="center"><b>(Privatisation process)</b></div>

Development,  (a) whether the privatisation  process  for

the  HUDC  condominium  at Bedok  Reservoir  (now  called

make good on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me explain the

privatisation  process.  Privatisation converts  the  HDB

leases  into strata titles under the Land Titles (Strata)

Act  (LTSA).  This changes the status of these flats from

public  to  private  housing.  With  privatisation,  flat

owners will no longer be subject to HDB's restrictions on

the  use, ownership and resale of their flats.  They  can

sublet  their flat wholly, purchase HDB resale flats  and

sell  their  flats to a wider group of potential  buyers.

Flat  owners  will own the common property as tenants-in-common and have the autonomy to manage and upgrade  their

estate, according to their needs and aspirations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privatisation of the former Bedok Reservoir HUDC

Estate  was carried out in accordance with the provisions

of  the  Land  Titles (Strata) Act (LTSA).  The  relevant

provisions of the LTSA allow for such a conversion if, at

least 75% of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>

lessees of the total number of flats apply to do so,  and

the proprietor of the land agrees to transfer the land to

them.   Privatisation is therefore  the  choice  of  flat

owners.   HDB cannot and does not compel the flat  owners

to privatise their estates unless the majority wish to do

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has explained its position with regard to the

privatisation process in its letters of 30th  April  2002

and 5th October 2002 to Waterfront View residents, and in

a letter published in the Forum Page of The Straits Times

on  11th  May 2002.  The application to convert  the  HDB

flat  leases  to  strata titles was submitted  under  the

relevant   provisions  of  the  LTSA  and  the  documents

(including the written consents signed by more  than  75%

of  the  lessees  of  the Estate) were  lodged  with  the

Singapore Land Authority (SLA) on 3rd December 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written consents of the lessees were signed over

a period of time prior to the submission of the documents

to SLA. There is no requirement in the LTSA that the 75%

mandate must be obtained in a single day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th December 2001, the SLA posted a notice in The

Straits  Times  and Lianhe Zaobao providing  for  written

objections  to  privatisation to  be  lodged  within  six

weeks.   It  also sent a copy of the notice by registered

post  to  all the individual flat owners on 10th December

2001.   No  objections were received.  As the application

was in order, the SLA registered the Strata Title Plan on

1st  February 2002, ie, the estate was privatised on  1st

February  2002.  The certificate of constitution  of  the

Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) Plan No.  2625

was issued by SLA on 2nd February 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that only a small proportion of the

residents  of  Waterfront View  were  not  in  favour  of

privatisation.   These residents should accept  that  the

majority  of  the  residents  had  wanted  privatisation.

Unfortunately,  some of these residents  have  taken  the

matter to court and have sued some members of the Pro-tem

Committee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>

("PC") and the law firm that had been selected by the  PC

to  assist  them.   The  Court will  determine  if  those

residents who have sued have a genuine case.

<br><br><i>The Role of the Pro-tem Committee</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB had, pursuant to its procedure for

privatisation,  encouraged the residents  of  the  former

Bedok  Reservoir HUDC Estate to form a Pro-tem  Committee

(PC) with the help of the Member of Parliament.  This was

done  in 1996 by the MP of the area at that time, Mr Chew

Heng Ching, under the auspices of the relevant grassroots

organisation.  The  members of the PC  were  subsequently

endorsed  in  1997  by  the Kampong  Kembangan  Community

Centre  Secretariat and by the new MP for  the  area,  BG

George Yeo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the PC was to facilitate the process of

privatisation. The members of the PC were all  volunteers

who  worked  as  the liaison between the  residents,  the

lawyers  selected by the PC to conduct the  privatisation

process,  HDB  and  the  other  relevant  authorities  on

privatisation matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the PC had kept the residents

fully  informed  throughout the  privatisation  exercise.

From  October  1996  to  April 2002,  the  PC  issued  16

newsletters  to  the  residents,  updating  them  on  the

various  issues of privatisation, such as the  conversion

cost,  progress of the various works carried out  in  the

estate  and inviting more volunteers to serve in the  PC.

They consulted the residents on the fencing and re-naming

of the estate after privatisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PC acted according to HDB's guidelines, and has,

in  HDB's view, discharged its roles diligently and acted

bona fide in the interest of the residents.

<br><br><i>Alleged defects in the estate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that there are widespread defects

existing in Waterfront View which would cost $20  million

to  rectify.  HDB has, consequent to receiving  a  survey

report commissioned by the MCST and which purports to set

out the extent of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>

alleged  defects, made a preliminary assessment of  these

defects.   HDB  has discovered that these "defects"  were

generally  due  to  fair  wear  and  tear.  This  is  not

surprising,  given that the former Bedok  Reservoir  HUDC

estate  was built more than 18 years ago.  In  any  case,

the  rectification cost of $20 million for these wear and

tear items is greatly exaggerated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB structural engineers inspected the blocks in the

estate  in  April/May 1997 and again in April 2001.   The

buildings  were  found  to  be  structurally  sound.  The

competent  authorities,  namely,  the  Fire  Safety   and

Shelter   Bureau   and  the  Building  and   Construction

Authority,  have  issued the Fire Safety Certificate  (on

21st  January  2003)  and the Certificates  of  Statutory

Completion (on 7th March and 13th March 2003) accordingly

for the estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to privatisation, the estate maintenance works

were  undertaken  by  the  Aljunied  Town  Council.  With

privatisation,  the  MCST has taken over  the  unexpended

funds  of  more  than $1 million from the  Town  Council,

being  an  accrual of the monthly service and conservancy

charges  the  flat owners had paid to the  Town  Council.

This  is  one of the highest amongst all the HUDC estates

privatised so far.  The MCST has the autonomy  to  decide

on  the  types of repair and improvement works,  and  the

amount  of  maintenance  fees to be  collected  from  the

residents.  It follows that the rectification of  defects

is largely the responsibility of the MCST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by reiterating three points with

regard to the privatisation of the former Bedok Reservoir

HUDC Estate.  Firstly, the privatisation was carried  out

in  accordance with the procedures set out in  the  LTSA.

Since   1st  February  2002,  the  estate  is  a  private

condominium  under the ambit of the LTSA.  Secondly,  the

PC  acted  according to HDB's guidelines on  HUDC  estate

privatisation.   It  has, in HDB's view,  discharged  its

duties diligently and acted bona fide in the interest  of

residents. Lastly, the $20 million cost of rectifying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>

the  said "defects" in the estate is greatly exaggerated.

The   blocks   in  the  estate  were  certified   to   be

structurally sound during HDB's inspections in  April/May

1997   and  in  April  2001.   With  privatisation,   the

maintenance  and  management  of  the  estate   are   the

responsibility   of   the  MCST.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Two supplementary questions, Sir. Some

residents are concerned that their apartment values  have

dropped because of the bad publicity.  Would the Minister

agree  to goodwill repairs of some of the defects?  After

all,  in  response to repeated requests by BG George  Yeo

and  the Pro-tem Committee before privatisation, HDB  did

agree to carry out goodwill repairs at the end of 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question: after privatisation, some residents

have  been  led to believe that under the HUDC  Act,  the

residents of Waterfront View should have been required to

pay   only   $1,  instead  of  about  $20,000   for   the

privatisation.  Can the Minister clarify this, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is correct that HDB had,

arising from some strong representations made by  the  MP

for the area, BG George Yeo, as well as the PC - this was

sometime  in  March and April 2002 - to  carry  out  some

goodwill  repairs to the aprons at some of the blocks  in

his estate.  This was, notwithstanding the fact that,  as

I  said  earlier, the maintenance and the upkeep  of  the

common areas and the aprons were under the responsibility

of  the MCST by then.  However, with the commencement  of

the  law  suit  by  some residents on  the  privatisation

process,  it is best for HDB to wait for the  outcome  of

the  law  suit  before  taking any further  action.   Any

goodwill  repairs would, of course, have to be considered

in  the  light of the recent complaint of defects by  the

MCST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the MP's second query about the payment of

the  conversion fee, whether it should be $1 or more, let

me clarify that there are two kinds of HUDC estates.  The

first type of HUDC estates are the estates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>

that  were  built under Phase 1 and Phase 2 of  the  HUDC

programme.   The  second type would  be  under  the  next

phases,  Phases  3 and 4.  The HUDC Housing  Estates  Act

applies  to flats in HUDC Phases 1 and 2 estates.   These

estates  were built and sold in the 1970s by  the  former

Housing  and  Urban  Development Company  (HUDC)  Private

Limited.  Under this Act, the flat lessees own the common

property as tenants-in-common.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waterfront View is one of the HUDC Phases 3 and 4

estates,  and these estates were sold by HDB in the  mid-1980s  under  Part IV of the Housing and Development  Act

(or  H&D  Act), which is different from the HUDC  Housing

Estates Act.  The HUDC Housing Estates Act does not apply

to Waterfront View.  The residents of Waterfront View did

not own the common property before privatisation.  So, as

part  of  the privatisation exercise, the residents  have

purchased the common property from HDB and they  now  own

it  as  tenants-in-common.  The cost of this transfer  of

common  property at Waterfront View is not at the nominal

sum of $1, as provided in the HUDC Act.  It is $18,992.65

per  flat,  inclusive of stamp duty.   Residents  of  the

estates  will  also  have to pay  other  costs  that  are

associated  with privatisation, such as processing  fees,

which  will bring the total cost of conversion  to  about

$20,000.   This, I must add, is lower than the  estimated

cost  of $25,000 which the residents were informed of  at

the commencement of the privatisation exercise.

<div align="center"><b>TRAINING OF NAVAL OFFICERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and  Minister  for  Defence,  in  view  of  the

findings  by  the  Maritime and Port Authority  that  the

collision  involving RSS Courageous was  due  to  several

errors of judgement by Navy personnel, (a) whether  young

trainee officers will continue to be put on the watch  of

Navy  vessels;  and (b) whether officers are  trained  on

international  maritime regulations  and  the  conditions

under   which  these  regulations  can  be   broken   for

operational reasons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to clarify that a

qualified Officer-of-the-Watch is always responsible  for

the  safe  navigation of an RSN ship.  When  there  is  a

trainee  officer  undergoing training to  qualify  as  an

Officer-of-the-Watch, the trainee officer may direct  the

ship's  movement  under  the  direct  supervision  of   a

qualified   Officer-of-the-Watch   who   always   remains

responsible for the safety of the ship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will appreciate that naval officers have to

be trained not just in classroom-based lessons and theory

but  also  in  the practical application of  the  various

skills  required  of  a  naval  officer.   This  includes

watchkeeping skills at sea.  The training system includes

regular written assessments to ensure currency on  bridge

watchkeeping as well as many practical sessions  on  ship

handling  simulators.   A key part of  the  qualification

process involves practical training at sea, during  which

the trainee Officer-of-the-Watch is allowed to handle the

ship  under close supervision.  This is necessary so that

our  young  officers  are  trained  and  qualified  under

realistic  operating conditions and  learn  to  make  the

judgements  and  decisions that are  necessary.   At  all

times,  the trainee is under the close supervision  of  a

qualified  Officer-of-the-Watch, and it is the  qualified

Officer-of-the-Watch who is always fully responsible  for

the safety of the ship during his watch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of maritime regulations, RSN Officers-of-the-Watch have to study the International Regulations

for  Prevention of Collisions at Sea, and they are tested

on  these  international regulations  every  six  months.

Thorough knowledge of these International Regulations for

Prevention  of Collisions at Sea is an important  feature

of the training syllabus which qualifies RSN Officers-of-the-Watch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSN ships have to comply with the International

Regulations  for Prevention of Collisions at Sea,  except

when  operational circumstances do not permit compliance.

RSN officers know that if there should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>

an   operational  requirement  to  deviate   from   these

collision  regulations, the ship must  do  so  with  full

regard  for  safety.   Any deviation from  the  collision

regulations  must  not  compromise safety  or  jeopardise

other shipping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be various operational conditions

requiring  a  deviation  from the collision  regulations,

depending  on  the mission and the operating environment.

An  example  would be when an RSN ship has to respond  to

violations  of our territorial integrity or  pre-position

herself in a situation which may require such a response.

Military  operations often do not proceed in a  regulated

or predictable way, and it is important that RSN officers

are  fully and comprehensively trained so that  they  can

carry   out   their  missions  effectively  in   whatever

circumstances they may find themselves in.

<div align="center"><b>(Breach of ethical standards by bio-medical researchers)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a) how such a serious breach of ethical standards in the

conduct  of  medical research on human  subjects  at  the

National  Neuroscience Institute could have  taken  place

and  remained undetected for so long; (b) what safeguards

will  be  instituted to prevent such breaches and  better

protect   patients   from  unauthorised   medical   tests

undertaken by bio-medical researchers as well  as  ensure

that  medical records are not released for purposes other

than the treatment of patients without their consent  and

whether  these  safeguards can be made public;  (c)  what

steps  will be taken to educate patients of their  rights

so  that  they  too  can better protect  themselves  when

confronted  with  such situations; and (d)  what  control

mechanism  is in place to prevent the use of questionable

research   methods  on  human  subjects  for  bio-medical

research.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> The

conduct of research on human subjects in Singapore has to

be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  rules  which  are

internationally accepted and which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>

based  on  the Helsinki Declaration.  Under these  rules,

the  welfare  of  the human subjects is paramount.    The

research  procedure must also be approved by  independent

Ethics Committees of Hospitals from where the research is

to be conducted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the NNI project, investigations show that Prof

Shorvon  and his assistant, Dr Ramachandran (who was  the

Project Manager), deliberately subverted the rules.  They

did  not  tell the Hospital Ethics Committees  the  exact

tests  that  were  going  to be conducted  on  the  human

subjects.    They  misled  the  Ethics  Committees   into

thinking that they were only going to extract blood.   In

fact,  they  carried out other tests which had  not  been

approved.   These  tests were not conducted  with  proper

safeguards and exposed the human subjects to unacceptable

risks.   The  two  doctors also did not  tell  the  human

subjects  the whole truth about the tests.  There  was  a

clear  and  deliberate breach of the Helsinki Declaration

and our own national guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unapproved testing started in May 2002. Most of

the  human  subjects were, however, tested in the  period

November   to  December  2002.   By  January  2003,   the

unethical  actions  came to light  and  the  project  was

suspended.   There was thus a period  of  about  5  to  6

months where the unapproved testing was carried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such conduct is serious and unacceptable. We will

not tolerate this.  Research is important.  But it has to

be  carried out ethically.  That has to be the foundation

on which we build our biomedical research capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing seriously deficient about the

systems  and  procedures that we had put in  place.   The

problem  was  that we had two doctors in the project  who

very deliberately circumvented the rules.  It is not easy

to  legislate against such conduct.  Everyday research is

being  carried  out ethically.  Most people  are  honest.

Drs  Shorvon  and Ramachandran are the exception.   Their

conduct was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>

exposed   when  the  human  subjects  and  their  doctors

complained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to look carefully at what we can do. To

prevent any errant researcher from attempting to beat the

system  by seeking out loopholes, we will look at how  we

can   further  strengthen  the  existing  systems.    The

Ministry  appointed a Committee of Inquiry to  look  into

the system and procedures relating to the ethics approval

and conduct of the study in question.  The Committee made

several recommendations to strengthen the ethics approval

process  in  hospitals for clinical research, ensure  the

medical   confidentiality  of  patient   information   in

hospitals,  and improve the standards for the conduct  of

clinical research.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will study the NNI Panel's report as

well  as  its Committee of Inquiry's Report, and will  do

what  is  necessary to strengthen the components  of  the

existing research oversight system.  The hospital  ethics

committees  and  research  monitoring  process  would  be

strengthened,  so that any deviations from  the  approved

stated protocols are detected and remedied early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do not want to put in so many rules to

counter  dishonesty  that we end up  seriously  affecting

honest  researchers.  Experience shows  that  such  rules

will  not always deter dishonesty anyway.  What is really

needed,   in  addition  to  strengthening  the   existing

systems, is strong leadership in the various institutions

that  deal with research, and a strong culture of ethics.

There  has to be strong leadership with a deft touch,  so

that  the freedom to do proper research is not curbed  by

bureaucracy  while, at the same time, errant  researchers

are pulled up quickly.  We will look into this seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also look into the education of

patients  and  the  general public about  their  role  in

medical research.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Could the Minister

comment whether the patients

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>

under  the unethical medical research suffered  any  side

effects  or long-term effects as a result of unacceptable

withdrawal of their long-term medication?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I said, the tests that were

conducted on the patients were done without the knowledge

of their supervising doctors.  So, that is a clear breach

of  ethics.   The impact of the tests on them varies  and

the patients are now being watched over by their doctors.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> I understand from the

media that two charges have been brought against the  PhD

student for causing grievous hurt and cheating.   I  just

want  to  seek  confirmation whether that is  indeed  the

case,  and  whether  similar charges  are  being  brought

against the lead investigator, Dr Shorvon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is indeed correct that the two

charges  have  been brought against Dr Ramachandran.   He

has  left  the  country and we have put up a  warrant  of

arrest and are seeking his extradition back to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Prof. Shorvon, he has accepted the findings

of  the Report and we are taking the findings up with the

professional Medical Council to take professional  action

against him.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL BULLIES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) if the Ministry or the schools keep records

of  the  number of school bully incidents in primary  and

secondary schools and, if so, (i) how many of such  cases

have  been reported for each of the last three years  for

primary  schools  and secondary schools respectively  and

(ii) how have these incidents affected the performance of

the  students in general and interaction among them;  and

if  not, (iii) what is the reason and (iv) whether  there

are  any  intention or plans to keep track of such  cases

to ensure that the problem is not escalating; (b) how are

principals  and  teachers  equipped  to  deal  with  such

incidents;  (c) whether the victims and the  bullies  are

counselled by qualified counsellors and followed up;  and

(d)  how  many  qualified  counsellors  are  attached  to

schools  on a full-time basis to help deal with incidents

of school bullies and other behavioural problems.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, in answer to part (a) of

the  Question,  the Ministry of Education  (MOE)  has  in

place  a  system  to  track  and  monitor  the  state  of

discipline in schools.  Bullying is closely monitored  as

one of the offences in the tracking system.  In answer to

part  (a)  (i),  in  2001, the number of  bullying  cases

reported  was  892, of which 350 were  from  the  primary

schools,  542 were from the secondary schools.  In  2002,

there were 880 cases, with 274 and 606 respectively  from

the primary and secondary schools.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>

do  not  have  the data for three years.  The  number  of

cases each year, on average, works out to less than three

per   school.   Schools  investigate  all  incidents   of

bullying  and work to resolve them quickly so  that  they

would  not  adversely affect the performance of  students

and interaction among them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to part (b) is Discipline Masters and

Mistresses are trained to manage bullying and other forms

of  misbehaviour in the school.  There are also proactive

programmes  in schools, eg, Peer Support, Peer Mediation,

Conflict  Management, to prevent bullying.  Schools  have

guidelines   for   handling  school  discipline.    These

guidelines  have been useful in helping schools  to  deal

with bullying.  Where necessary, schools may also consult

Guidance Specialists in the Ministry of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To part (c), every school has a counselling system

in  place to help both pupils who are bullied and  others

with  discipline or behavioural problems.   Teachers  are

trained in basic counselling skills, and are able to help

both the bully and the bullied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On part (d), there are also two Teacher Counsellors

in  each school to guide the more difficult pupils.   The

Teacher   Counsellors  are  trained  in   more   advanced

counselling skills and crisis intervention.  In 2001, the

School   Counsellor  Scheme  was  introduced  to  further

augment the counselling resources in the schools.   Under

this  scheme, education officers who have retired or left

the  service are specially selected, trained and deployed

to  schools  to  work  with the Teacher  Counsellors  and

teachers.  There are currently 50 such School Counsellors

who  have  been trained or are undergoing training.   The

Ministry   of   Education   also   works   closely   with

professional   agencies  and  self-help   groups,   where

necessary, to deal with incidences of bullying as well as

other incidences of behavioural problems.

<div align="center"><b>(Fire-resistant doors with automatic self-closing devices)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  if  he  will  review the  Fire  Safety  Bureau's

requirements  for low-rise Housing and Development  Board

multi-storey  carparks to be fitted  with  fire-resistant

doors with automatic self-closing devices.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, staircases are escape routes during

fires.   Hence,  they  have to be  adequately  protected.

Although multi-storey carparks are usually designed  with

open-sided walls that allow good ventilation,  this  does

not  preclude  the possibility of smoke,  heat  and  fire

penetrating the stairwell, thus hindering safe evacuation

of people.  This is especially so if the fire occurs near

the  staircase.  Therefore, as long as the  staircase  is

located  within  the multi-storey carpark  building,  the

stairwell  will  have to be isolated and  its  walls  and

doors  will  have to be fire-resistant.  The  doors  also

have  to  be fitted with self-closing devices  to  ensure

that the door is kept closed all the time to isolate  and

protect the stairwell.  This ensures that there is a safe

route  of  evacuation for people caught in a  fire  in  a

multi-storey car park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot assume that fires will not occur at

multi-storey car parks or that people will not be  caught

in them.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>

have  been  cases  of  fires in  multi-storey  car  parks

causing  extensive  damage.  A  fire  happened  near  the

staircase  of  the  multi-storey carpark  of  Block  931,

Hougang  St  11,  in  February 2000.   Despite  extensive

damage  to  several cars which caught fire, the staircase

enclosures  in  this  case were unscathed  by  the  fire,

demonstrating the importance of fire resistant  doors  in

ensuring  a  safe  evacuation route for  members  of  the

public.

<div align="center"><b>COOKED FOOD HAWKER STALLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Vacancy and allocation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  (a) how many hawker stalls for  cooked  food

are  vacant  and where are these stalls, and (b)  whether

his  Ministry will review the allocation of these  hawker

stalls which has been suspended for many years in view of

the severe structural unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, we have 6,990 cooked food stalls in 135 hawker

centres.   However, the number of vacant stalls  is  very

small,  only 46 in total.  After setting aside 21 of  the

stalls  for  temporary use by hawkers  under  the  Hawker

Centre  Upgrading Programme (HUP), the number  of  vacant

stalls available for allocation is only 25.  These stalls

are  put  up for tenders on a monthly basis.  The  tender

for this month has just closed on 17th April 2003 and the

next tender will be on 6th May 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Wang asked whether we would review the

allocation  of stalls in view of structural unemployment.

I  presume  he  is referring to the direct allocation  of

stalls for hardship cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the scheme was discontinued in 1990, about 13

years  ago,  because, on the supply side, we had  stopped

building  hawker centres since 1985.  There is  therefore

no  more new supply of vacant cooked food stalls built by

ENV  or HDB.  At the same time, on the demand side,  many

of  the hardship cases then were not prepared to take  up

vacant stalls as and when these stalls became available

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>

because  they  prefer  to wait for  stalls  in  the  more

popular centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the supply and demand situations, the

scheme was discontinued and interested stallholders  have

to  tender  for stalls as and when they become available.

In  the  past three years, we have allocated  240  cooked

food  stalls  through public tender.   On  average,  each

stall attracted about 15 applications.  On the whole, the

tender  scheme  has  worked  well  under  a  market-based

mechanism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even though we have no plans to re-introduce

the  direct allocation of stalls for hardship  cases,  we

will  continue  to  create  opportunities  for  potential

stallholders.  Under the HUP, we are offering cash  grant

to  enable  some of the first generation stallholders  to

retire.    This  will  help  free  up  more  stalls   for

newcomers,  including the hardship cases.  So far,  about

16%  of stallholders have opted for cash grants under the

HUP.   One example is Dunman Food Centre where six stalls

vacated by retiring stallholders had been tendered out so

far,  with  another 10 more stalls up for tender  in  the

next tendering exercise.  If this trend continues, we can

expect  that  a steady stream of stalls will continue  to

become available for tenders under the HUP.

measures  are  being  taken  at  pre-school  centres  and

childcare  centres to (i) educate parents on  SARS;  (ii)

prevent  the  spread of SARS; and (iii)  manage  children

with fever or cough who are suspected of having SARS.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, as the

regulator  of child care centres, my Ministry has  worked

relentlessly   to  put  in  place  strict   precautionary

measures and procedures to minimise the spread of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children in child care centres are very young

and  need  close supervision.  My Ministry has  therefore

drawn  up  a  comprehensive set  of   Standard  Operating

Procedures  in consultation with the Ministry  of  Health

and  the major child care operators.  All 630 child  care

centre  operators  were briefed on the procedures  before

the centres re-opened on 16th April 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of our procedures can be found at the

MCDS         websites         www.mcds.gov.sg         and

www.childcarelink.gov.sg.  Allow me just to  highlight  a

few  key  points, Sir.  Parents are reminded not to  send

their children to the centres if their children are  ill.

Besides  the health declaration forms, parents have  been

issued   with  advisories  to  monitor  their  children's

temperature and health every morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear procedures have been drawn up to handle

children or staff who fall sick while in the centre.   We

will  close  the centres for 10 days if sick children  or

staff  are  found  to  be  suspected  or  probable   SARS

patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have advised student care operators, who provide

before  and after school care services for primary school

children, to use the same procedures as we have for child-care  centres.   The  People's  Association,  which  runs

playgroups   and   tuition  classes,  has   adopted   the

procedures  as well.  As I have mentioned, my  Ministry's

procedures for child-care operators are available on  our

website for any pre-school service providers to use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides procedures, MCDS has also developed a series

of  public  communication programmes  targeted  at  young

children,   parents  and  caregivers.  Public   education

messages  were  carried  in the  four  languages  in  the

various media.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>

Young  children  are taught, in a fun  way,  about  basic

hygiene.  Information  packs were  distributed  to  every

parent when the child-care centres re-opened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by reiterating that

the  effective  control of SARS rests on individuals  and

parents    of    young    children   exercising    social

responsibility.   For young children,  the  precautionary

measures can only be effective if parents act responsibly

and  not  allow their sick children to turn up in  child-care centres or schools.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower in view of the highly contagious nature  of  the

SARS  virus  and bearing in mind the language  and  other

difficulties  faced by foreign workers and  their  living

conditions, some of which may not have proper  sanitation

facilities  (a)  what measures are being taken  including

screening and education programmes to prevent the  spread

of  SARS among foreign workers who are already working in

Singapore;  (b) will the intake of foreign  workers  from

SARS-affected areas be tightened; and (c) if there is  an

outbreak of SARS among foreign workers what measures  are

in place to contain the spread of the disease.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  my  Ministry  has  adopted  a  2-pronged

strategy  to  deal with the outbreak of SARS amongst  the

foreign worker population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first approach is to minimise the risk of

infection  by  raising  awareness  within  the   existing

foreign worker population in Singapore.  My Ministry  has

been  working  with  the Ministry of  Health  to  prepare

customised advisories to employers of foreign workers and

to  the foreign workers themselves, including the foreign

domestic workers.  Advisories to the foreign workers will

be made available in their own languages.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, officers from my Ministry have been

briefing employers of foreign workers on the threat posed

by   SARS   and   some  practical  early   detection   in

collaboration  with  the various  employer  and  industry

associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fight against SARS requires the total

involvement  of employers and employees.  Both  employers

and   employees,   whether  they  are   Singaporeans   or

foreigners,  must take proactive steps  to  minimise  the

chances of an outbreak of SARS at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministerial Committee on SARS has also studied

and  prepared contingency plans to deal with an  outbreak

of  SARS among large numbers of foreign workers.  So far,

this has not happened.  The plan would include setting up

quarantine  facilities  to isolate  affected  workers  in

designated areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second approach is aimed at minimising the

import  of  new  SARS  cases via the  intake  of  foreign

workers   from  SARS-affected  areas.   In  this  regard,

companies  have been strongly urged to defer bringing  in

new  work pass holders from SARS-affected areas,  and  to

refrain from sending existing work pass holders or  their

other  employees  to  SARS-affected areas  for  the  time

being.   Where  it  is  absolutely necessary  to  do  so,

employers   must  place  the  work  pass  holders   under

mandatory quarantine for a minimum of 10 days immediately

upon  arrival in Singapore.  Work permit holders will  be

placed  under quarantine at designated dormitories  while

employment  pass  holders  will  be  placed  under   home

quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist employers during this difficult time, my

Ministry   will  exercise  flexibility  in  renewing   or

extending  work permits of existing workers in  Singapore

coming  from  the  SARS-affected areas beyond  the  usual

maximum period of stay.  The other prevailing work permit

conditions  will  continue to apply to  such  renewal  or

extension.  This would reduce the need for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>

employers to bring in new foreign workers from the  SARS-affected areas.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, since 11th April

2003,  special quarantine measures have been  imposed  on

foreign  workers  coming to work in Singapore.   Can  the

Minister give us an update on those measures?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

introduced this quarantine requirement on new arrivals on

work passes, and also existing work pass holders who have

been  back to SARS-affected areas since 11th April  2003.

Since  then,  we have had several batches of work  permit

holders and groups of employment pass holders coming into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one of our dormitories used for quarantining the

work permit holders in Tampines, we had two groups coming

in  since 10th April actually.  A total of 93 work permit

holders  were quarantined at the Tampines dormitory,  out

of  which 79 had successfully completed their quarantine.

They had shown no signs of fever during the 10 days,  and

they were released back to their employers to start work.

Eight  of  the second batch of 53 developed fever  during

their  stay and had to be sent to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital

for  further observation.  Fortunately, to-date, none has

been  diagnosed as suspected SARS cases.   Most  of  them

have been released but, arising from having eight workers

to be sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, we have had to make

further   arrangements  to  re-isolate  those  who   were

discharged from Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  As of now, there

is  still one work permit holder who is at Tan Tock  Seng

Hospital under observation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Woodlands dormitory, we had 89 work permit

holders  under  quarantine, mostly existing  work  permit

holders  who had been on home leave from their  employers

and  who were coming back to Singapore.  Fortunately, all

of  them  are  well; none of them has shown any  sign  of

fever during this period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 126 current Employment Pass holders had

returned to Singapore from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>

SARS-affected areas since the quarantine requirement  was

implemented.   So far, 15 had completed their  period  of

quarantine yesterday.  Two of those who were expected  to

complete  their quarantine period yesterday  had,  during

that  period, left Singapore.  We are following  up  with

them and will take up their cases upon their return.   33

new Employment Pass holders had also completed their home

quarantine and were certified fit.  The doctors gave them

a medical certificate to say that they had no fever, they

were  certified fit to commence work.  They  were  issued

with  new  Employment  Passes accordingly.   Two  of  the

applicants  were  not issued with Employment  Passes  and

were  asked  to submit the required medical  certificates

before  the  Employment Passes could  be  issued.   Their

employers  were also warned to comply with the quarantine

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from this experience of running a quarantine

for newly-arrived work permit or Employment Pass holders,

we  have  to  revise some of our procedures, particularly

those concerning the work permit holders, as a result  of

which  we  have had to ask employers to slow  down  their

intake  of  new work permit holders for the  time  being,

especially those coming from the SARS-affected areas.  We

need  to look for more facilities, more accommodation  to

put  them  up.  In case they have to be sent to Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital for observation, upon their discharge from

the  hospitals,  we would have to find  better  isolation

facilities to accommodate them so that they are not mixed

together  with any of the other work permit  holders  who

are   under  quarantine.   Because,  if  they  are  mixed

together, then it will complicate the quarantine for  the

rest of the work permit holders.  They will end up having

to  stay  for a longer period, as we have experienced  in

one instance in Tampines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we are seeking the cooperation of employers.

We ask them to please defer bringing in new workers for a

period  of  time.   Let  us  look  for  more  and  better

accommodation that can meet the needs of this  quarantine

before we can allow them to bring in the work permit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>

holders  from these SARS-affected areas.  The purpose  is

not  to  prevent  them from recruiting  the  work  permit

holders if they really need them, but it is just to allow

us  more time to set up a better system to handle the new

arrivals.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

the  Minister spoke about language translations.  I would

like  to  know  the  number  of  languages  it  has  been

translated into and whether these are ready.  What is the

current capacity for quarantine?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> We will prepare the advisories in

all  the  languages  of the foreign workers  who  are  in

Singapore.   Of  course,  for  Employment  Pass  holders,

language is not a problem.  They are all better educated.

English is their lingua franca.  For the foreign domestic

workers,  they would be in Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog  and

Thai.   For  the construction workers, they would  be  in

Thai  and Tamil. For those from Bangladesh, we will  have

them  in Bangladeshi.  Whatever it is, we will have  them

in the language that they are familiar with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her second question on accommodation capacity

that  we have today for the work permit holders, we  have

sufficient capacity for about 200 work permit holders  in

a centralised quarantine at any one time.  But because of

the  complication that once a batch comes in and somebody

has  to be sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for observation

and, when he is discharged, he cannot go back to the same

group, he has to be kept separate for a further period of

observation.  So, if we have a number of such cases -  as

I  explained earlier on, we have eight out of the  second

batch  of  53  -  then we complicate the process  and  we

increase  the demand for accommodation.  That is  why  we

are  now  in the process of looking for more and  better-suited accommodation, and we are requesting employers  to

please, in the meantime, slow down the intake, to give us

time to look for these facilities.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Could the Minister please

let us know when these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>

translations  will  be  available,  because  the  foreign

workers are already at the doorsteps of hospitals?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I believe my Ministry has got the

translations  ready, and most of them  would  be  in  the

process of being issued.  The whole list of guidelines is

in this folder, and all that is required to be translated

would be made and released as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether the Government would differentiate

the  usage of the terms "SARS-affected areas" and  "SARS-affected countries", in particular, in relation to  large

countries like Canada and China.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, SARS-affected

areas  are all those that are listed by the WHO.  In  the

context  of  a  big country like China, any  work  permit

holder  or  Employment  Pass holder  coming  from  China,

regardless  of which point of departure, will be  treated

the same way.

<div align="center"><b>IMPACT OF SARS ON EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE PRACTICES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Ho Geok Choo -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. To ask the Minister for Manpower (a) what is

the  impact  of  the  Severe Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome

(SARS) on employment relations in the workplace vis-a-vis

terms  and  conditions  of  service  such  as  insurance,

deployment,  compensation,  and  work  segregation;   (b)

whether  the fear of SARS as well as the drop in business

have   contributed  to  or  aggravated  the  unemployment

situation  in  the  retail, hotel, hospital  and  service

sectors;  (c)  what plans are in place to deal  with  any

tension  and hostility related to SARS at the  workplace,

arising from employee-employer relationships and peer  to

peer  relationships;  and (d) how many  Singaporeans  are

making working trips to SARS infected countries and  what

are the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>

Ministry's guidelines to employers and employees in  this

special situation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Question No. 15, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the outbreak of

SARS   has   affected  our  economy  severely   and,   in

particular,  businesses in the tourism,  hospitality  and

associated sectors.  This will have an adverse impact  on

our   employment   situation.   In   response   to   this

unprecedented situation, many companies have had to  make

quick   adjustments   to  their  employment   terms   and

practices, such as getting their employees to take annual

leave,  implementing shorter work weeks, and re-deploying

staff  to  optimise the use of manpower resources.  While

these   changes  will  impose  a  strain  on   employment

relationship, I am confident and also pleased  to  inform

the House that there have been no major labour-management

relations  problems at the workplace since the  onset  of

the SARS outbreak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, there have been enquiries and

assistance  sought  as  to how to  manage  the  leave  of

absence of employees arising from SARS and how this leave

of  absence  should be dealt with.  In this  regard,  the

Ministry,  in  consultation with the  Singapore  Business

Federation,  the Singapore National Employers  Federation

and  the  NTUC had, on 2nd April 2003, issued  a  set  of

tripartite  guidelines on leave of  absence  relating  to

SARS  for  implementation by employers.   The  guidelines

cover  salary  payment for leave of  absence  in  various

situations.    Feedback  received  from   employers   and

employees on the implementation of the guidelines is that

the  guidelines have been useful in helping them to  deal

with the employment issues relating to the SARS outbreak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other issues such as staff deployment,

segregation,  insurance and compensation,  the  Singapore

Business Federation, in consultation with the Ministry of

Trade and Industry, Ministry of Health, my Ministry,  the

Singapore  National  Employers Federation  and  NTUC  had

also, on 16th April 2003, released a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>

set  of  advisories  and Frequently Asked  Questions  for

employers  on how such issues at the workplace  could  be

appropriately dealt with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these advisories, employers are advised to

explain  to their employees the need to cover the  duties

of  those who have been affected by SARS so that business

operations  will  not be disrupted.  On the  other  hand,

employers   should   also  provide  training   and   take

precautionary measures to safeguard the safety and health

of workers concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as mentioned earlier, the outbreak of SARS has

badly  affected  the hotels, airlines,  travel  agencies,

restaurants  and  retail businesses.   Hence,  we  expect

employment  in these sectors to be adversely affected  as

well.  To deal with this situation, my Ministry, together

with  the  Singapore Business Federation,  the  Singapore

National  Employers  Federation  and  NTUC,  had  jointly

announced  measures on 15th April 2003 to help  companies

in  these  sectors to reduce cost and to  preserve  jobs.

These  measures include getting employees to take  leave,

implementing shorter work week, temporary lay-offs and/or

sending  workers for skills training and upgrading  under

the  training  programmes provided  by  my  Ministry  and

several other such agencies. Where such measures are  not

sufficient to sustain business survival or preserve jobs,

companies  may  also  consider  temporary  wage  cut   in

consultation with their unions and workers.   To  further

minimise job losses in these sectors, the Government  had

also announced on 17th April a package of relief measures

to reduce business costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while there could be some problems and

difficulties affecting employer-employee relationship,  I

am  confident  that employers, trade unions  and  workers

will  rally  together and work out amicable solutions  in

the spirit of labour-management cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question on how many Singaporeans have been

sent  on working trips to SARS-affected areas, we do  not

have  the  statistics  as there  is  no  requirement  for

companies to provide us with this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>

information.  However,  the Ministry  of  Health  and  my

Ministry  had,  through our advisories, strongly  advised

employers to defer sending their employees to these areas

unless the working trips are absolutely necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with our strong tripartite cooperation and

support among the social partners, I am confident that we

will  be able to overcome the disruptions caused  by  the

SARS outbreak.

Sir?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The World Health Organisation

(WHO)  has  stated  that  SARS is  a  serious  threat  to

international  health and could become the  first  severe

new  disease  of  the 21st century with  global  epidemic

potential.  So this is a very serious problem confronting

Singapore and the rest of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by summarising what we know and what we

do not know at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now six weeks since WHO first issued its

global  health alert on 12th March on cases  of  atypical

pneumonia.   For  the  Healthcare Workers  (HCW)  at  the

frontline  combating  SARS, this  has  been  a  long  and

demanding six weeks.  But six weeks is a relatively short

period for a completely new disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WHO announced on 16th April that a newly

discovered virus from the coronavirus family is the cause

of SARS. Identification and characterisation of the exact

causative   virus  will  allow  development   of   better

diagnostic  tests and treatment protocols. A  significant

step  towards this was the recent sequencing of the viral

genome  by  scientists in the US, Canada, Hong  Kong  and

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are learning more about the spectrum of clinical

presentations.   Most  patients  present   with   typical

features  with  a  sudden onset of  high  fever  with  or

without  muscle  aches.   Some  patients  may  also  have

chills,  shivering, cough and headache.   After  3  to  7

days, patients may start to have shortness of breath, and

X-ray  changes  to their chest reflecting pneumonia.   In

about  80-90%  of cases, the patient gradually  recovers.

However, in 10-15% of cases, after about seven days,  the

pneumonia  progresses and the patient needs treatment  in

the  intensive care unit with most requiring a ventilator

to  help  them  breathe.  About 6% of cases  die  despite

intensive care.  The majority of patients who succumb  to

the  disease are older persons above the age of 40 years.

But we have had three deaths from patients below 40 years

old.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have observed a number of cases where the

symptoms  have  not  been typical.   This  has  made  the

disease even more difficult to combat.  This has occurred

in   patients  with  many  pre-existing  chronic  medical

conditions,   such   as  heart  disease   and   bacterial

infections that mask the symptoms and signs of SARS.   In

such  cases, the fever may be low-grade at the  beginning

and signs of lung infection occur very late in the course

of  illness.  Such cases are very difficult to  recognise

early  and  pose  a  major challenge for  our  healthcare

professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is SARS transmitted? Both WHO and the US CDC

believe  that  the  main  way  SARS  spreads  is  through

transmission of infectious droplets, for example, when  a

SARS patient coughs or sneezes droplets into the air  and

someone  else close by breathes these droplets  in.   Our

own experience in Singapore supports this view since most

of  our  cases  have  occurred  either  among  healthcare

workers  caring for SARS patients in hospital, or  family

members  and friends of the patients who had visited  and

come  into  close  contact  with  them.   Based  on   our

experience,  patients appear to be most  infectious  when

they  are  ill.  Most of the SARS patients  in  Singapore

have  passed  on  their infection to a  small  number  of

people only, and through close contact.  However, we have

also  noted that there is a small number of SARS patients

who  appear  to be highly infectious, infecting  a  large

number  of  people.  These people have  been  called  the

"super-spreaders".  This may also have been  due  to  the

fact  that  their  SARS illness had not  been  picked  up

earlier  and they had infected a large number of  persons

in  close  contact  with  them  by  the  time  they  were

diagnosed  with  SARS.   Hence, in Singapore,  four  SARS

patients  have  been responsible for the transmission  of

the  infection  to  the vast majority  of  the  182  non-imported patients that we have seen so far in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there may be situations where SARS may have

been transmitted through other routes.  For example,  the

outbreak involving a large number of residents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>

in an apartment block in Hong Kong suggests that SARS may

be  transmitted perhaps through some common environmental

route.   Transmission through contaminated surfaces  also

cannot  be ruled out.  That is why we emphasise the  need

for  a  higher  standard  of personal  and  environmental

hygiene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, three diagnostic tests have been developed

for  SARS.   However,  all  the tests  have  limitations.

There  is  a  test for antibodies to SARS in  the  blood.

However,  this is present only from about 20  days  after

the  onset of clinical symptoms.  It therefore cannot  be

used  to detect cases at an early stage. The second test,

an  immunofluorescence  assay (IFA),  detects  antibodies

reliably  as  of  day  10 of infection,  but  this  is  a

comparatively slow test that requires the growth of virus

in cell culture.   The third test is a molecular test for

detection  of the SARS virus genetic material.   This  is

useful in the early stages of infection but at this stage

of  development, the test method fails to  pick  up  many

patients  with SARS.  WHO has stated that  more  work  is

needed  to  produce  a robust test  that  is  capable  of

rapidly and reliably detecting cases at an early stage of

infection.    Many  laboratories,  including   those   in

Singapore, are working to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, as yet, no specific treatment for SARS.

WHO  has  stated that no treatment beyond good  intensive

and supportive care has been shown to improve the outcome

in patients with SARS.  About 8-9% of our cases have died

compared  to the global average of 6%.  The case fatality

rate  in  Hong Kong has been about 7% but that in  Canada

has  been  about  9%.  A likely reason for  the  slightly

higher  fatality rate in Singapore compared to Hong  Kong

is  that the daily occurrence of new cases here has  been

much  lower than that in Hong Kong.  In Canada,  most  of

the  fatalities have occurred among elderly patients with

co-existing chronic illnesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the current situation of SARS in

Singapore.  I had previously explained our strategy to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>

contain  SARS in Singapore. The main components  of  this

strategy  are  to identify and isolate symptomatic  cases

early,  to  quarantine contacts who have been exposed  to

patients  with  SARS and to minimise the  number  of  new

imported cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry decided early on to concentrate all SARS

cases in TTSH and CDC.  Enhanced infection controls  were

put  in  place.  No TTSH staff looking after  known  SARS

patients have caught the disease for the last six weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important characteristic of SARS is that it is

more  infectious when the patient is sicker.   Hence,  it

tends  to be transmitted quickly among healthcare workers

who  are not appropriately protected when they take  care

of  SARS  patients.  The lack of a rapid diagnostic  test

that  can  be applied early, the non-specific  nature  of

SARS  symptoms,  ie,  just  fever  and  cough,  and   the

possibility  of  the  co-existence of multiple  illnesses

masking  the  presence of SARS in the same  patient  have

made  it  very difficult to identify SARS patients  early

and  reliably.  The outbreak in SGH that started in early

April  involved  a  single super-spreader  with  multiple

illnesses.   The outbreak in SGH led to a cluster of SARS

cases  in  NUH.  We are still mopping up the consequences

of that setback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has implemented additional measures to

contain  the outbreaks in hospitals and other  healthcare

institutions,  including  nursing  homes.   Firstly,  all

healthcare  workers in all hospitals are now required  to

wear N95 masks, gloves and gowns and to practise frequent

handwashing  after every patient contact.   In  isolation

facilities, Emergency departments and ICUs, they are also

required  to  wear  goggles and hoods if  there  are  any

interventions.  This is to ensure that they  do  not  get

infected  by  patients who have SARS but  have  not  been

diagnosed  to have the disease.  Secondly, all healthcare

institutions  are  now required to  monitor  their  staff

closely   through  twice-daily  temperature   monitoring.

Strict instructions have been given to disallow any staff

member  who  has fever or is unwell to start or  continue

working.  Thirdly, all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>

healthcare  institutions have set  up  special  teams  to

prevent  and control SARS.  The Ministry is carrying  out

audits  on  health care institutions to ensure compliance

with  the  infection control practices.  The  Ministerial

SARS  Combat Unit, headed by SMS Khaw Boon Wan, will give

leadership  and  political weight to the  hospital  audit

teams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mdm Ho Geok Choo's questions,

selective  closure  of affected areas  of  SGH  has  been

carried  out  instead  of closing  SGH  completely.   For

example, the patients and staff in wards 57 and  58  were

all  transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital  en-bloc.   At

the  same time, staff who may have been exposed  to  SARS

patients have all been quarantined.  SGH has also changed

its  work practices so that teams of doctors work in only

one physical site, hence limiting the potential of cross-infection.   All public hospitals are closely  monitoring

their  capacity  so  that  they can  take  the  necessary

measures  to  match the need against their capacity.   As

for  using  private  hospitals to supplement  the  public

hospitals,  this  is being explored.  One  option  is  to

refer some subsidised patients for selected treatment  in

private hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak in SGH in early April also led to a

cluster  of  SARS  cases at the Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale

Centre.   We shut down the Centre for 10 days and imposed

Home  Quarantine Orders on all the stallholders and their

workers  in the Centre.  The aim is to keep them isolated

at  home  and prevent the infection from spreading.   The

regular  buyers  at  the  Wholesale  Centre  are  closely

monitored  through  telephone surveillance.   This  is  a

massive effort to systematically isolate and contain  the

spread.   We have harnessed all the Government  resources

to  this  end.   We  need the cooperation  of  all  those

involved, in order to break the chain of infection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also put in place a number of measures to

ensure that clusters of infection do not develop from new

imported cases of SARS.  To reduce the number of imported

cases,  we  are  carrying  out health  screening  through

temperature checks on incoming air and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>

sea  passengers  from  the  SARS  affected  areas.   This

complements the checks that airlines have put in place at

check-in counters.  Flight crews are also on the  lookout

for  ill  passengers on board aircraft.  All visitors  to

Singapore  have  been  required  to  complete  a   Health

Declaration   Card  from  9th  April  this   year.    All

travellers  who  enter Singapore from affected  countries

are  also  given  a Health Alert Notice  to  explain  the

symptoms  of SARS and how they can get help if they  fall

ill  with  suspected SARS.  We will continue  with  these

measures for the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 120,000 people enter Singapore from Malaysia

each day and half of those travel daily.  My Ministry  is

working  closely  with  our  Malaysian  counterparts   on

measures  to  prevent and control SARS in our  respective

countries.   A  delegation of MOH and MHA  officials  met

with   their  Malaysian  counterparts  to  discuss  joint

measures and the regular exchange of health information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to be realistic. Global travel means

that  new  imported  cases  will  occur  in  the  future.

Screening  of  travellers is limited in its effectiveness

as  it  will  not  pick up persons during the  incubation

period.   Persons  can therefore be  well  as  they  pass

through the screening procedures and develop SARS  later.

A  single  imported  case  can trigger  off  an  outbreak

involving many cases, especially if he or she is a super-spreader,  even though we quickly institute  the  control

measures to isolate and ring-fence ill persons and  their

contacts so as to limit disease transmission.  Hence,  we

must  all  be prepared to accept that we are in this  for

the long haul.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the specific questions

raised  by  Members.   Dr Amy Khor asked  about  measures

taken for Singaporeans living in SARS affected areas.  My

answer is that they should follow the advice given by the

local  health authorities where they live.   They  should

also check on the information provided by MOH through our

website  on how they can reduce the risk of catching  the

infection.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong, Dr Michael Lim and Dr Chong Weng

Chiew  asked  how  we are recognising the professionalism

and  contributions by our healthcare workers.  Let me put

on  record that we are proud of them and we commend  them

highly  for their dedication and professionalism.   I  am

pleased  to  inform  the House that  the  two  healthcare

clusters, as employers of these healthcare workers,  have

already  implemented  a policy of covering  the  complete

medical  bills  of their staff and their families  should

they  fall ill with SARS in the line of duty.  For  these

staff, the medical expenses and medical leave will not be

deducted  from their yearly entitlement.  A Courage  Fund

has  been  set  up  by the two healthcare  clusters,  the

Singapore    Medical   Association,   Singapore    Nurses

Association  and Singapore Press Holdings,  to  help  the

families  of  needy patients in honour of all  healthcare

workers  in  Singapore.   The clusters have  in  place  a

mechanism  to review the salary of our nurses  and  other

healthcare  workers  regularly.  Apart  from  the  salary

review,  we  will  look into other  ways  to  honour  and

recognise the exceptional contributions made by  all  our

healthcare workers at an appropriate time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to what we can do. My Ministry has

put in place all the measures to minimise the risk of new

clusters of infection from unrecognised cases of SARS  in

our  hospitals and from imported cases.  However, I would

like  to  caution  Members  that  in  the  absence  of  a

definitive  diagnostic  test, it  is  very  difficult  to

identify and isolate such cases early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we only have two weapons to work with.

First, the clinical symptoms, of which the onset of  high

fever  is  an  important indicator.  Second, the  contact

history which points to the possibility of being infected

by a SARS patient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win the battle against SARS, we need a change in

mindset,  a  much higher level of social  discipline  and

social  responsibility.  To make full use  of  the  first

weapon,   we  must  encourage  everyone  to  take   their

temperature daily.  If you detect that you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>

have  fever and are unwell, do not go to work.   If  your

child has a fever, do not send your child to school.  See

a  doctor and stay at home until you are well.  When  you

go  to  the doctor's clinic, wear a face mask  so  as  to

reduce the risk of spreading infection to others.  If you

cough, cover your mouth and nose with tissue paper  or  a

handkerchief.  Do not spit on the floor or in  the  open.

Practise  good  personal  hygiene  and  wash  your  hands

frequently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this difficult period, Singaporeans should

also look out for one another.  If your family member  or

colleague  or  neighbour is sick, advise  him  to  see  a

doctor and stay at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must be truthful about our contact history.

If  we suppress information about our travel history, our

likely  contacts with probable or suspect SARS  patients,

our  visits to the hospitals or other venues where we may

have contact with SARS patients, then we are giving false

information and giving up a very important weapon in  our

fight  against  SARS.   To the GP, for  example,  without

knowing your contact history, he may arrive at the  wrong

diagnosis  and think that your fever and cough  are  just

the symptoms of a cold or a flu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must recognise that it is in their

interest to work together with the Government to  prevent

and  control SARS in our community.  If you are sick  and

you  seek medical treatment immediately, your chances  of

recovery are better.  You are less likely to infect  your

family.  If everyone who has fever and is unwell stays at

home  and  away from crowds, then Singaporeans will  have

greater confidence that the likelihood of meeting a  very

infectious  person in a crowd will be much reduced.    In

this  way,  we  prevent  the  Battle  against  SARS  from

becoming a Crisis of Fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Battle against SARS, if all Singaporeans work

together, with our healthcare workers in the frontline in

the  hospitals, with all the Government resources backing

them, and all Singaporeans playing their part with higher

social discipline and social responsibility,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>

then I am confident that we can contain the disease.

outbreak and the gloomy employment forecast.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission,  I  will  answer all the Questions  under  my

name,  as  well as the Minister for Trade and  Industry's

name,  on  the Order Paper, in my Ministerial  Statement.

With   your  permission,  I  will  begin  my  Ministerial

Statement now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Severe Acute Respiratory

Syndrome (SARS) is a grave threat to Singapore.   It  has

taken a heavy toll on our public health, our economy  and

our  society.   We  have to muster all  our  resolve  and

resources, in order to fight SARS.  Then we can bring the

SARS  outbreak  under control, restore confidence,  boost

morale, and get the economy moving.  If we fail to do so,

and  allow  the disease to overwhelm us, the consequences

will be catastrophic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tackling SARS calls for an effective and

comprehensive plan, rigorously implemented, with the full

support   and  cooperation  of  Singaporeans.   We   have

mobilised  the  whole  Government  machinery   for   this

purpose.   The  Ministry of Health and the hospitals  are

fully engaged in the medical measures to combat SARS.  In

addition, we have set up a Ministerial Committee, chaired

by Mr Wong Kan Seng, to coordinate all the ministries and

departments involved, to support the Ministry  of  Health

and to direct the broader response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Hng Khiang has just presented the public

health  measures.  Let me now explain the overall  action

plan.  There are three battlefronts - public health,  the

economy and the society.

<br><br><i>Battlefront 1 - Public health</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, public health. Besides medically treating

those  who  have caught the disease, we must take  public

health measures to stop the spread of the illness, and to

minimise the number of people who fall ill.  We  need  to

set up lines of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>

defence around three groups of people.  First, those  who

are  already  infected or who might be infected;  second,

those  who  are  not infected; and third, those  entering

Singapore who might bring in the virus.

<br><br><i>Detect, isolate and contain</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are already infected or who might be

infected,  our  strategy  is  to  "detect,  isolate   and

contain".  This means sending those who are ill with SARS

promptly to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, contact tracing - to  identify  and locate those who have had contact  with

SARS  patients, and issuing Home Quarantine Orders (HQOs)

to  those  who  are at risk.  The HQOs are to  put  their

health  under close monitoring, and also to prevent  them

from  spreading  the virus to others.  This  way  we  can

break  the  cycle of infection and spread, and bring  the

outbreak under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most stringent precautions are taken at the

hospitals.  That is where most of the SARS patients  are.

They  must be prevented from infecting other patients  or

healthcare  workers.  If doctors and nurses get  infected

and fall victim to the disease, our healthcare system may

collapse,  and  SARS will spiral out of  control.   Hence

healthcare  workers are required to don  protective  gear

and  to monitor their own temperatures closely.  We  have

also  severely  restricted visits by family  members  and

friends   to  patients  in  hospital.   These   stringent

measures are working.  Because of them, since 31st March,

no  patients  in Tan Tock Seng Hospital have  fallen  ill

from SARS as a result of being infected in the hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the community, we must trace all the contacts of

SARS patients quickly and comprehensively, and place them

on  home quarantine.  For this strategy to work, patients

and   their   families   have  to  cooperate   with   the

authorities,  to  tell  fully and  truthfully  where  the

patient has been and whom he has had contact with.   And,

if  there is somebody or some place you have been to, and

you  do  not  want to tell us about, well,  that  is  big

trouble.    Also  the  quarantine  system   has   to   be

watertight.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>

It  takes  only one undeclared contact, one irresponsible

breach  of  an  HQO,  to  start a whole  new  cluster  of

infections.   It  is therefore absolutely essential  that

those  served with HQOs obey the orders and stay at home,

and  not  put  many others at risk.  Thus we  have  acted

firmly   against  HQO  defaulters.   We  have   installed

electronic   cameras  in  their  homes,  and  implemented

tougher  enforcement measures such as electronic tagging.

While most people on HQOs have complied and cooperated, a

minority are recalcitrant and incorrigible, and  I  think

the  public  understands that we  have  to  take  serious

measures.   I received a fax today from a member  of  the

public who says, "When you ring them up, better make sure

that  they are not using call forwarding."  I have  asked

the Minister in charge to fix that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Minister for Health is amending the

Infectious Diseases Act, on a Certificate of Urgency,  to

give  additional powers to the Ministry  to  take  action

against persons who breach HQOs, refuse to cooperate with

health  officers to take SARS control measures,  wilfully

hide medical information related to SARS control, or fail

to  comply with any directives or regulations related  to

SARS  control.  Violators can be levied composition fines

of  up  to  $5,000,  instead of being charged  in  court.

Furthermore,  the  general  penalty  for  committing   an

offence  under the Act will be doubled, to a  maximum  of

$10,000  or  6 months' imprisonment for a first  offence,

and $20,000 or 12 months for a repeat offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These public health measures to "detect, isolate and

contain"  the disease are all the more necessary  because

there  is  not yet a diagnostic test for SARS, which  can

tell quickly and reliably whether or not a suspected case

has   the   disease.   Scientists  in   A*STAR   research

institutes  in Singapore have been working  flat  out  as

part of a worldwide effort to identify and understand the

SARS virus.  They have successfully mapped the genome  of

the  SARS virus, confirming and extending the results  of

mappings   done  elsewhere.   The  Genome  Institute   of

Singapore  is  developing  new  diagnostic  methods,  and

several other diagnostic methods are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>

becoming available from other laboratories.  We  will  be

testing  these  out over the next weeks  and  months,  to

identify  the  best  methods to use, and  I  believe  the

methods will improve over time, as the scientists work at

it.   The ultimate goal of the scientific research is  to

develop  a treatment and a vaccine for SARS, but this  is

not  going to occur overnight, and may take several years

or even longer.

<br><br><i>Protect and Monitor the healthy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are not infected, we are taking

vigorous measures to prevent them from contracting  SARS.

We  need  to  pay special attention to public areas  with

heavy  human  traffic,  and  mass  institutions  such  as

schools and military camps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment (ENV) has taken

preventive  actions  to  raise the  overall  standard  of

public  health  and  hygiene, to  minimise  the  risk  of

environmental transmission of SARS.  ENV will  clean  and

disinfect  public  areas, check for and eliminate  pests,

ensure  that  waste  disposal  and  collection  is   done

properly,  and  make  sure our sewerage  systems  are  in

proper  working  order.  We will  also  ensure  that  our

environmental   workers   are   properly   equipped   and

protected,  so  that they do not inadvertently  become  a

mode  of  transmission.  Within the next week,  ENV  will

work  with  market stallholders to spring-clean  all  wet

markets.   Food handlers in all food establishments  will

be required to take their temperatures twice a day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development, together with

HDB and Town Councils, has instituted several measures to

improve  the  cleanliness of our housing estates.   These

include  stepping up the general cleaning of  HDB  common

areas and implementing an SOP to respond to complaints of

sanitary  pipe  leaks  within  24  hours.   The  Building

Control  Authority  (BCA)  has  reminded  all  Management

Corporations   of  private  buildings  to  maintain   the

sanitary  pipes  in  their  buildings  in  good   working

condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education (MOE) has also introduced

a series of measures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>

Schools are educating students about SARS, issuing  every

student with a personal thermometer, and teaching them to

check  their own temperatures daily.  Students and  staff

are  also  required  to  regularly declare  their  travel

history.    The   institutes  of  higher   learning   are

segmenting their large campuses into smaller sections, to

reduce  movement  across  the campus  and  to  facilitate

contact tracing should a SARS case occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of

Community  Development and Sports (MCDS) have implemented

standard operating procedures for child-care centres  and

kindergartens, to screen and manage the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has instituted all

possible precautionary measures.  It has disseminated  to

all  Singapore  Armed Forces (SAF) units  information  on

SARS,  tips  on  personal hygiene, travel  advisory,  and

procedures  for handling suspected SARS cases.   Critical

units  are  working in shifts to ensure  that  operations

continue seamlessly in case there is an outbreak  in  the

units.    All  recruits  and  NSmen  undergoing   in-camp

training will be screened for SARS daily.  By the end  of

this  month,  MINDEF will issue personal thermometers  to

all   MINDEF   and  SAF  personnel  to  do  twice   daily

temperature  checks.  These measures will  keep  the  SAF

SARS-free, while maintaining its operational readiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a useful practice for Singaporeans to take

their  own temperatures daily and, if they have a  fever,

to  stay  away from work or school and see their  doctor.

Temperatures  are already being taken at many  workplaces

and  large gatherings, and Members had their temperatures

taken  before  coming into Parliament  House  today.   It

reassures  everyone who is there that the group  is  less

likely  to contain an infectious SARS case, and it  helps

to  detect early anyone who is ill, before he can  infect

too  many people.  Even if this measure is only partially

effective,  it  will  still reduce the  chances  of  SARS

spreading from one person to many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>

others,  and  thus  help us to bring the  outbreak  under

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every home should have a thermometer. Every

Singaporean  should know how to take his temperature,  so

that  he  can  take personal responsibility for  his  own

health,   and   monitor   his  own   and   his   family's

temperatures.  It will take a month or two to obtain  the

supplies, distribute the thermometers to homes, and teach

Singaporeans how to use them.  Our first priority  is  to

provide  all  pupils in schools, and SAF personnel,  with

thermometers.    After that we will progressively  supply

the  homes  with thermometers, and each home should  have

one.   By June, every student and every household  should

have a thermometer, and should use it.

<br><br><i>Safeguard borders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third major concern is to prevent fresh cases of

SARS  from being introduced into Singapore by travellers,

and Singaporeans infected with SARS from going abroad and

infecting  other countries.  SARS is a major  problem  in

China  and  Hong  Kong, and cases have been  reported  in

nearly  every  country in the region, including  Malaysia

and  Indonesia.  We must expect new index cases to  enter

Singapore from time to time.  This was, in fact, how  the

SARS outbreak in Singapore started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot shut our borders, and stop the movement of

people  and businesses completely.  But we must institute

effective border controls, to identify people with  fever

so  that they can be examined more thoroughly by doctors.

We have built thermal scanners that enable us to scan the

temperatures  of large numbers of people efficiently  and

without intrusion.  If you walk past the scanner and your

face  looks green on the monitor, that means you  are  in

the  pink of health.  If your face looks red, the Chinese

say the kuan kong face, then you better see a doctor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already started screening all inbound air

passengers  from  SARS  affected  areas.   This  includes

passengers  coming into Changi Airport for  transit.   As

soon as we acquire more scanners,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>

we  will extend the screening to inbound passengers  from

all areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also started screening all passengers

departing  from Singapore.  At the airport, when  you  go

from  the  land side to the air side through the barrier,

you will be screened.  These measures make Changi Airport

both  a safe transit point for passengers from all  round

the world, as well as a safe place to visit.  There is no

reason  for  either locals or foreigners to avoid  Changi

Airport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also paying close attention to the Causeway

and  the  Second Link, where more than 100,000 travellers

move in and out daily. We have installed thermal scanners

at   both   the  Woodlands  and  Tuas  land  checkpoints.

Singapore  and Malaysian health and immigration officials

have  been meeting to discuss the SARS problem, and  will

work  closely together to draw up measures to screen  for

SARS at the Causeway and the Second Link.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly arrived work pass holders coming from SARS

affected  areas  are being required to undergo  a  10-day

quarantine to minimise the risk of their bringing in SARS

to the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN leaders recognise the seriousness of the SARS

problem,  and  the need for a collective response.   They

are  holding a Special ASEAN Leaders' meeting in  Bangkok

next  week,  to  coordinate our efforts and  collectively

respond  to  SARS  as  a region.  We  need  to  work  out

measures  to  manage the movement of people across  ASEAN

borders, so that we can stop SARS from spreading  between

countries while we maintain the flow of commerce.

<br><br><i>Plan for the unexpected</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides taking immediate steps to keep the SARS

outbreak  under  control, the Ministerial  Committee  has

also  been  working out contingency plans  to  deal  with

various   scenarios  that  could  arise.   These  include

measures  relating  to  health, the  economy,  transport,

border control, childcare centres, kindergartens and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>

schools, emergency housing and social support, and public

communications.   For  example, we are  working  out  the

housing and social support plan should a large number  of

people need to be quarantined, all at once.  We hope that

we  will not need these arrangements, but should any such

situation develop we will be prepared.

<br><br><i>Battlefront 2 - The Economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second battlefront is the economy. The

Government   is  working  with  the  Singapore   Business

Federation  and business chambers to encourage businesses

to  adopt  business continuity plans, so  that  they  can

continue  to  operate  even  if  their  staff  fall  ill.

Special  attention has been placed on essential services,

such as utilities, to ensure uninterrupted services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the industry level, firms in the tourism trade

are  working with the Singapore Tourism Board  to  devise

ways  to  bring  tourists back when  the  SARS  situation

stabilises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that investors and analysts

understand the true SARS situation in Singapore, and what

we  are doing to get things under control.  Our policy is

full  and  transparent disclosure, so that  there  is  no

doubt  of  the  true  picture and people  can  trust  our

statements.   The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  has  been

briefing the heads of foreign missions here, while EDB is

in  contact  with the multi-nationals as  well  as  their

corporate  headquarters,  to keep  them  updated  on  the

situation.

<br><br><i>Impact of SARS on the economy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the year, Singapore's economic

outlook was mainly clouded by the impending Iraq War  and

its impact on oil prices.  The war in Iraq has now ended,

and  oil  prices  have  fallen,  lifting  some  of  these

uncertainties.  However, SARS is now putting a strain  on

our economy and creates a new and greater uncertainty for

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourism and transport-related industries, such

as  hotels, restaurants, retail, airlines, cruise  ships,

travel agents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>

and  taxi  services, have been most severely  hit.    Air

travel  has been reduced sharply.  Tourist arrivals  have

fallen  by  61%  in the first 13 days of  April  and  are

expected to fall sharply for the second quarter of  2003.

A number of events, conferences and conventions scheduled

for  April  and  May  this year have  been  cancelled  or

postponed. China, which is our fastest growing source  of

tourist   arrivals  before  the  outbreak,   has   banned

organised  travel  to Singapore, Malaysia  and  Thailand.

Arrivals  from  Japan, South Korea  and  Hong  Kong  have

declined sharply.  I was in one hotel a few days ago  and

I  talked  to a worker there, and he said, "We have  five

lifts.  Three are closed.  There is nobody to ride up and

down.   We  are  only operating two to save  electricity.

The  workers  have been put on leave.  When  their  leave

runs  out,  they  will be asked to go on  no-pay  leave."

Times are tough for the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the manufacturing sector has not been

affected.   But if the SARS situation deteriorates in the

region  or  in  the major industrial countries,  it  will

affect our export markets and important trading partners.

It  could shake global confidence, and disrupt production

and  new  investments.  Then the impact  on  us  will  be

broader-based, and more severe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot predict exactly how the situation will

unfold,  but MTI has lowered the GDP growth forecast  for

this  year  to  0.5% to 2.5%.  This is on the  assumption

that the outbreak does not spread worldwide and become  a

global  pandemic.  The unemployment rate is  expected  to

increase  beyond the 4.2% last December.  While  we  will

try  to  preserve as many jobs as possible,  we  have  to

expect  more retrenchments this year, especially  in  the

tourism and transport-related sectors.

<br><br><i>Relief measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the economic hardship

brought  about by SARS.  To help alleviate the  immediate

problems,  we  announced on 17th April a  relief  package

worth $230 million.  These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>

measures  were targeted at the sectors most  affected  by

the  SARS  outbreak, namely, the tourism  and  transport-related sectors.  The measures will not fully offset  the

impact on these businesses, but they will help them  tide

over   the  difficult  period  and  save  jobs,  wherever

possible.

<br><br><i>Home Quarantine Allowance Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group who need help. People who

have  been  placed under Home Quarantine  Orders  (HQOs),

have  so  far not been given any allowance or assistance.

We  have  left  it  to employers to work  out  their  own

arrangements, for instance, by putting employees on  HQOs

on  medical  leave.   As  the HQO  cases  were  initially

dispersed and the number manageable, this did not pose  a

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the closure of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale

Centre  and  the  imposition  of  HQOs  on  about   2,400

stallholders and workers at the Centre showed  that  HQOs

may  need  to be imposed on large numbers when a business

establishment  is ordered to shut.  Furthermore,  if  the

Government can mitigate the financial burden of the  HQOs

on  the quarantined persons, it will reduce the incentive

for  people  to  breach  the HQO  in  order  to  continue

working.   Also,  people  will  be  more  willing  to  be

identified  and quarantined when they are traced  as  the

contacts of a SARS case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will therefore implement a Home

Quarantine Order Allowance Scheme, to be administered  by

the  CDCs.  Under the scheme, the Government will pay  an

allowance to self-employed persons who are serving  HQOs,

to  make up part of their income.  It will also give  the

allowance  to  establishments whose employees  have  been

affected by HQOs.  In other words, if you are working for

a  company,  then  we will pay the HQO allowance  to  the

company who is paying your salary.  This will defray part

of  their manpower costs for the duration of the HQO.  It

will  be especially helpful to smaller businesses,  which

may otherwise be unable to survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a small business establishment, in other words,

one with fewer than 50

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>

full-time  workers, the assistance will be more generous.

If  the  whole  establishment is ordered to  shut  for  a

period  on  account of SARS, then the firm  will  receive

this  ex-gratia payment for all its employees,  including

those  who are not on HQOs.  Because the firm is  closed,

it  has to carry its manpower costs; and we will help  it

to  carry  some  of these.  The cut-off of  50  full-time

workers  covers  more than 90% of business establishments

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For self-employed persons, the allowance will be a

flat  rate of $70 per day, for the duration of  the  HQO.

For employees, the allowance will be his daily salary, up

to  a maximum of $70 per day.  The allowance will be paid

to  the  employer.  We will leave it to the employers  to

make   their   own  financial  arrangements  with   their

employees.  However, newly arrived work-pass holders  who

are  required to undergo a 10-day quarantine will not  be

eligible for the HQO Allowance.  This allowance will also

be payable to all persons previously or currently already

on home quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the HQO Allowance Scheme, the Government

will  be  bearing  a good part of the wage  cost  of  the

businesses  affected.  MOF will provide full  details  of

this scheme later on.

<br><br><i>Specific Issues</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address specific economic issues raised

by the MPs in their questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rental rebates</i>: Mr Gan Kim Yong asked about rental

rebates  for HDB commercial tenants.  All HDB  commercial

tenants  are  already enjoying a 20% rental  rebate  that

lasts  until  31st  December this  year.   These  include

operators  of  student  care  centres,  tuition  centres,

childcare  centres  and  kindergartens.   Some  are  also

receiving  additional rebate of up to 20% to bring  their

rents  down to the prevailing market rent.  In  addition,

HDB will pass on to its tenants the full savings from the

recently  announced  property  tax  rebates.   HDB   will

monitor the situation closely and will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>

consider   providing   additional   assistance   to   its

commercial tenants, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Giro instalments for property tax</i>: Mr Chiam See

Tong  asked  whether  property  tax  could  be  paid   by

instalments.   The  answer is yes.  Taxpayers  have  been

able to pay their annual property tax in 12 interest-free

monthly instalments since 1989, provided they do  it  via

GIRO.   More  than  50% of taxpayers are  already  taking

advantage  of GIRO to pay their property tax  in  monthly

instalments, and the Government encourages more to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Indebtedness of Singaporean households</i>: Madam Ho

Geok Choo asked about the indebtedness of households.   A

study  by  the  Department  of  Statistics  showed   that

household financial liabilities have increased from  118%

of  personal disposable income in 1995 to 174%  in  2000.

If  the  economic  downturn  continues,  it  could  lower

disposable  income  and  further increase  the  ratio  of

household financial liabilities to income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to view this ratio in perspective.

First,  72% of the liabilities are in the form of housing

loans.   This  reflects  the high  housing  ownership  in

Singapore,  which is 92% compared to 60% to  70%  in  the

developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, residential property assets, even after

accounting  for the weak property prices, stood  at  $343

billion  in 2001.  Compared to housing mortgage loans  of

$106 billion, households still own about $237 billion  of

net  housing assets - a huge amount.  If we include other

household  wealth, such as bank savings and  shares,  the

total  net  wealth  of  households  represents  670%   of

disposable income, which is comparable to OECD countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, most households service their housing

loans  through  their CPF savings and contributions.   So

long  as  they keep their jobs, the impact is manageable.

This is why the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is trying  its

best  to  minimise job losses, through enhanced  training

grants, skills upgrading and other measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Retail sector</i>: Ms Olivia Lum asked about measures

to help the retail sector.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>

Domestic  consumption has been affected  as  the  initial

fear  of  SARS has kept consumers away from  all  crowded

places, including retail shops and restaurants.  However,

not all retail outlets are equally badly affected.  And I

believe, as confidence gradually returns, the restaurants

will  be  filling up again.  Those outlets in HDB estates

fared  better than those in the Central Business District

which  cater  primarily to tourists.   The  property  tax

rebates are intended to help such establishments,  and  I

strongly  urge property owners to pass on the rebates  to

tenants.   HDB  itself will be doing  so.   These  retail

outlets can also send their workers for training and make

use  of  the  absentee payroll scheme  for  MOM  and  STB

approved courses.

<br><br><i>Battlefront 3 - The Society</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third battlefront against SARS is in our

society,  the  way  each  Singaporean  responds  to   the

problem, and cooperates with the measures which will help

us  to  solve it.  This is the most critical battlefront.

If we lose this front, we will lose all the other fronts,

and lose the war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is doing everything possible. But for

these policies and measures to succeed, every Singaporean

must play his or her part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the public health measures, all

Singaporeans   should   follow  the   daily   precautions

recommended  by  the  Ministry  of  Health   to   protect

ourselves  and  those around us.  We need  to  be  keenly

aware  of  our  social responsibility  to  our  families,

friends and fellow citizens, in containing the spread  of

SARS.   See a doctor if you are unwell, telling  him  the

truth,  and  heeding his advice.  Go  to  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital  if  you suspect that you have contracted  SARS,

and  abide  by the Home Quarantine Orders if you  are  in

quarantine.  Do not travel to SARS-affected areas, unless

you  really cannot help it.  Take personal responsibility

to  measure your own temperature and the temperatures  of

your family daily.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the economic problem, we also need to

work  together.  The tripartite partners have rallied  to

help  affected companies stay viable and preserve as many

jobs  as  possible.   The  NTUC, the  Singapore  National

Employers  Federation and the Ministry of  Manpower  have

issued  a  joint  statement recommending  temporary  cost

reduction  measures,  including  a  shorter  work   week,

layoffs and wage cuts.  They have also acknowledged that,

despite these measures, retrenchments will be unavoidable

in the tourism and transport-related sectors, and advised

employers  to  treat  fairly  workers  who  have  to   be

retrenched.   This  realistic and  constructive  approach

will  help  companies to stay afloat, and  help  as  many

workers as possible to keep their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group that is bearing the heaviest burden is our

doctors  and  healthcare  workers.   They  are   on   the

frontline of the fight against SARS.  Despite their heavy

workload, the extreme stress, and the risk that they  are

exposed  to  daily,  they have not compromised  on  their

professionalism or their dedication to duty.  We can  all

be  proud  that  in  such  a difficult  situation,  these

doctors, nurses and hospital attendants, who include non-Singaporeans,  have  shown  the  steadfast  courage   and

commitment  to  do their best to overcome  this  national

problem.  They are an inspiration to all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courage Fund is a tangible way for Singaporeans

to  show their support for the healthcare workers.  I  am

sure  that  all  Members of this House will  join  me  in

adding  our gratitude and support to the sentiments  that

have  been  expressed publicly by many Singaporeans  over

the   last   few  weeks.   But,  more  importantly,   the

healthcare workers need our cooperation, because  whether

their  jobs  become easier or harder in the coming  weeks

and months, depends on whether everyone is doing his part

to contain the spread of the virus.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS will be a long-term problem for us. Now that

it  has  spread to so many countries, scientists  believe

that it is not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>

likely  to  be  eradicated  from  the  world.   We   have

instituted effective measures to contain the outbreak  in

Singapore.  As we discover more about the virus, we  will

modify and improve the arrangements to minimise the  risk

of  infection.  But every Singaporean must adopt sensible

precautions   and  socially  responsible  habits,   while

carrying  on  with our normal day-to-day activities.   We

have to learn as one society to cope with the virus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life will not be the same as it was before SARS. We

must  adjust our habits and behaviour patterns so  as  to

tackle   this  new  threat  and  adapt  to  the   changed

environment.  Doing this [indicating] - Nemeste,  instead

of   a   handshake  -  that  is  easy.    Watching   your

temperature,   keeping  yourself  healthy;   sequestering

yourself,  if  you are not - that takes more  discipline.

But  with precautions and changes in habits which protect

ourselves  and  especially  other  Singaporeans,  we  can

continue  to  make a living, bring up our  families,  and

maintain our social and community activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is a grave challenge. But we have an effective

public  service,  a cohesive and cooperative  population,

and  the  resources  to deal with the  problem.   We  are

mobilising all these to tackle SARS.  I am confident that

together   we   can   overcome  this   problem,   restore

confidence,  and  get  Singapore back  to  normal  again.

[Applause.]

<div align="center"><b>QUESTIONS ON THE MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister for Health

whether  the outbreak in SGH in the first week  of  April

could have been averted?  Could we not have prevented the

in-patient  in  SGH spreading SARS to so  many  patients,

causing  a  huge chain reaction, especially knowing  that

the  patient had just been discharged from Tan Tock  Seng

Hospital  and  that SARS had been around  for  about  two

weeks   at  that  time?   Why  were  more  stringent   or

precautionary measures not taken by SGH?  May I  ask  the

Minister for Health how widespread is SARS infection now?

Is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>

he  having difficulty in ringfencing SARS presently?  May

I  ask  how are we coping in contact tracing of  probable

SARS?   Why was the first case of SARS from Pasir Panjang

Wholesale  Centre  not quarantined  when,  in  fact,  his

brother died from SARS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for Health whether it is

right  and prudent that we should follow WHO's guidelines

on  SARS?   The  reason I am asking this is  because  the

Ministry  of Health has been quoting that it is following

WHO's  guidelines.  Sir, are we not fighting a new entity

with no precedent incident?  Is Singapore not one of  the

countries  quite  affected with about  189  cases  today?

Should   we  not  set  our  own  guidelines  for   better

containment?  Should we not err on the side of caution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister for Health whether his

Ministry  would urgently put up an epidemiological  study

group  to go through quickly the SARS case notes we  have

so  far, in order to map out the disease pattern so  that

we  can  control SARS better?  May I also ask him whether

our  healthcare  workers  in  our  public  hospitals  are

adequately  protected?   Are  doctors  and  nurses  over-stretched,   especially   in   wards   with   quarantined

personnel?   Is the past shortage of junior  doctors  now

becoming  critical?  Is the welfare of our medical  staff

well taken care of?  Are our public hospitals coping with

the delivery of services to our patients?  Are our public

hospitals  in  crisis?  May I also ask the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance whether our Government

is prioritising our healthcare urgently and sufficiently,

and  also through more funding?  Are the public hospitals

given  more  funds to fight SARS?  And would  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister  consider waiving  hospital  charges  for

patients seeking treatment for SARS?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have two questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.  The

first  is on the issue of public education and awareness.

For unwitting breaches of the Home Quarantine Orders, how

would the Government help address the issue of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>

ignorance, especially of the older citizens who  may  not

understand  the implications of their actions  or  simply

the substance of the matter, or of illiterate persons who

can converse only in dialects?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the economic impact

on groups of people who rely on licences which are linked

to  the  Medisave  contributions.  Will  the  renewal  of

licences  for  conducting  business,  for  example,   the

vocational driving licences for taxi drivers,  be  linked

to  the Medisave contribution?  And where there could  be

cashflow  crunches in view of the SARS effect, would  the

Government  be  flexible  enough  to  allow  the  renewal

without  insisting  on  a  complete  fulfilment  of  this

request  but by accommodating payments by instalments  or

even reductions in contribution?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

first question is directed to the Minister for Health.  I

would  like  to ask whether it is possible for  the  Home

Quarantine  Order, when it is issued to somebody,  to  be

issued  in the different languages.  Because I understand

that,  right now, it is only done in the English language

and  I  believe that many of the people who  receive  the

HQOs are the older people who may not understand English.

Looking  at the HQO, I also notice that, when  a  HQO  is

issued,  it  is stipulated that school-going children  or

young  siblings  would not be allowed to leave  the  home

during the period of quarantine.  But, on the other hand,

the  spouse  or  any other adults in the  home  would  be

allowed  to leave.  Could he explain to us the difference

in  the  treatment of the younger ones at  home  and  the

adults?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a condition which says that when a

workman  comes to the house to carry out work within  the

premises, they should be alerted that the person has been

served  with  a  HQO  so that the workman  can  take  the

necessary  precautions.   I am  just  wondering  whether,

during  a  time like this, when someone has  been  served

with  a  HQO, they should in fact allow anyone  into  the

home or not.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I have got a few questions as well.  On this  fight

against SARS, or the SARS war, may I ask the Deputy Prime

Minister how much longer is needed to solve this  problem

over time.  He says it is a long haul.  But how long will

this long haul be?  All these measures that we are doing,

in terms of temperature taking, checking at airports, and

so  on,  will it be something which will stay for  a  few

more years or it might be overcome in a few months?   The

reason  I  ask  is  because I think it is  good  to  give

Singaporeans a good sense of how these things  are  going

to affect their lives in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on all the measures being taken, I must

first  say  that I do support all these measures  because

they are very important.  But is there also a danger that

we are over-reacting?  It seems that Singapore takes this

matter  very  seriously.   In contrast  with  many  other

countries,  some  countries are  quite  blase  about  the

matter  and  do  not  really seem to be  taking  it  that

seriously as compared to Singapore.  Therefore,  even  in

contrast to the number of SARS incidents in Singapore per

population, we seem to have a very high incident rate  in

Singapore.  Is there a particular reason for this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a question on temperature taking for fever.

I  think I have heard a lot being said about the checking

of  persons through the thermometer for fever.  Is  it  a

very  safe measure?  How sure are we that having no fever

will mean that the person is not contagious, he will  not

carry  the virus and therefore will not spread  to  other

people?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would also like to ask the

Government whether, in implementing the various measures,

we  have  taken human psychology into consideration.   To

me,  Sir,  it seems that all the measures depend  on  two

factors:  one,  public spiritedness of the citizens,  and

second,  by  penalty, in other words,  punishment.   But,

Sir,  is  it  not  true that there are  individuals  who,

through  self-denial, will go to all extent to  say  that

they  do  not have SARS, and to be sent to Tan Tock  Seng

Hospital seems to them to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>

a  sentence or label that they will try to avoid  at  all

costs?    Perhaps,  the  Government  should   also   have

considered  human  psychology in this  respect  by  going

through  better publicity to show the recovery  rates  of

patients from Tan Tock Seng Hospital so that going to Tan

Tock  Seng Hospital is not considered a death penalty  or

sentence.  That, I believe, is pretty important as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I beg your indulgence here also to express my

personal  tribute  to the healthcare  workers  for  their

sacrifice in this battle against SARS.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, I have

three  questions  for  the  Health  Minister.   Two  taxi

drivers  so  far have been infected with  SARS  by  their

passengers.   Can  I  ask the Minister  that,  since  the

ambulance  service  was introduced to  transport  suspect

SARS patients to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, have members  of

the  public been ready to come forward to call  for  this

service  and to use it?  And how prompt is the  ambulance

coming  to  pick  up  the suspect  SARS  patients?   From

reading  the press reports, it would seem that they  take

several hours to come and that is why the family of eight

went  to the coffeeshop to have some drinks and then went

to  a Chinese herbal medicine store, causing the risk  of

infection  to  the  community.  And, third,  I  share  Dr

Wang's concern that the public has this fear of Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital.  Can I ask the Minister  to  do  more  to

allay the concerns on the ground about going to Tan  Tock

Seng Hospital?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> I would like to

join Dr Wang in asking about the treatment of patients at

Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  I think there are some people in

Singapore  who fear being sent to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital

now  because they think it is like a death sentence.   So

it  will  be good if we can inform the public  about  how

patients  are  treated there.  If they are not  infected,

they  will remain uninfected if they go to Tan Tock  Seng

Hospital and get out well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask the Minister

for Health is if he could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>

also  enlighten us on the measures that have been put  in

place  to  help minimise the inconvenience of  those  who

have been served with Home Quarantine Orders.  I think so

far  the plight and also the sacrifice of many healthcare

workers  have  been  highlighted but not  much  has  been

reported  or conveyed on the measures that have been  put

in   place  to  help  those  who  are  served  with  Home

Quarantine Orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity

to  not  only thank the healthcare workers but  also  all

those  who  have been put in the frontline to help  fight

this battle against SARS, including the Minister, as well

as  all  the  Government officials  and  those  who  have

actually contributed to the Courage Fund.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, DPM Lee has said that the

Government is going flat out to develop a diagnostic test

kit.   Sir, I am asking whether the Government is willing

to  give  a  prize  or reward to the  first  person  that

develops  this kit, in addition to his normal salary.   I

think this is an incentive needed because I think time is

of the essence as far as SARS is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mention also has been made of the super-infector. Now that her name has been revealed by MOH and

also   published  in  the  papers,  with   such   adverse

publicity,  I am certain that her life must  be  affected

badly.   I  wonder  whether  MOH  can  do  something   to

rehabilitate  her  socially, like  counselling  her,  and

also,  if possible, seek employment for her, if  she  has

not already got a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the compensation for persons who are

issued  with  a  Home  Quarantine  Order,  if  they   are

officially  issued with this order, they are entitled  to

compensation.   What  about  those  who,  on  their  own,

voluntarily quarantine themselves, if they feel that they

have been infected by the disease?

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, two questions for the Deputy Prime Minister. For

the  businesses that are quarantined, does the  ex-gratia

payment include the other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>

fixed costs like rentals and disinfecting expenses, other

than the labour costs?  On the second question: why limit

the Home Quarantine Order allowance scheme to only 50% of

the person's income?  Is this not a case of war against a

virus when the HQO is similar to the issue of the SAF-100

calling people out for national duty and that they should

be  fully compensated, instead of 50% of their salary, or

$70  for  self-employed individuals?  Can we  follow  the

claims practice similar to the SAF when people are called

up  for National Service to do make-up pay claim, so that

they get the full compensation rather than 50% of it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> I have three

questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.  First, can  DPM

provide  an update on the vegetable supply situation  and

the  steps  taken  to bring the supply  back  to  normal?

Second, what are the steps taken to safeguard the  safety

of workers and buyers in other food supply centres?  And,

third,  may I ask DPM to request Power Supply to  suspend

the  disconnection of power and water supply during  this

difficult time?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Speaker, may I ask the DPM two

questions?   The  first  pertains to  the  Pasir  Panjang

Wholesale Centre.  The livelihood of the wholesalers  and

the  workers  there  has  been quite  badly  hit  by  the

shutdown.   I would like to know whether, in addition  to

the Home Quarantine Order allowance and some of the other

measures,  there  is  specific assistance  available  for

these wholesalers and their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question pertains to the broader economic

impact.   The  DPM  has  announced  the  revised   growth

estimates  and there has been a package of measures  that

has  been  announced.   This  is  obviously  premised  on

certain assumptions of the intensity and duration of  the

SARS  virus impact on the economy.  May I ask, especially

in  the light of some of the announcements from Hong Kong

on  their  measures  which appear to be  of  far  greater

assistance, when or at what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>

point would the Government deem it appropriate to revisit

the  issue  of  further  Government  assistance  for  the

economy?

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask DPM

whether consideration may be given towards providing some

form of residential facility for those who are unable  to

take  home quarantine perhaps because they are renting  a

room, or for those who repeatedly seem to have difficulty

keeping their Home Quarantine Orders?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would

like   to  ask  the  Minister  a  question  on  the  Home

Quarantine  Order.  Presently, under the Home  Quarantine

Order, a person who is quarantined, the children are  not

allowed  to  go out of the home, but the spousal  members

are  allowed to.  In a situation when the Home Quarantine

Orders are very limited or small in number, I think  that

makes  sense, because we have to balance the economy  and

activity  going  on.   But  when  the  number   of   Home

Quarantine  Orders is 2,000-plus, as it is  now,  and  we

have  adult members of the family going about their work,

is  there not quite a high possibility that there may  be

some cases which might lead to infection or to situations

which  may not be truly watertight, as mentioned  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister just now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have a few

questions.  The first one relates to the impact that  our

actions have had on investors and on the business  people

who  intend  to  travel  to Singapore  to  meet  up  with

Singapore businessmen.  While we have been very effective

in  all  the measures - and I think we have done all  the

right  things  - the signal that this is sending  to  the

international  community is that we  have  a  very,  very

serious problem, compared to many others who may  not  be

doing  as  much as us.  So, we really need  to  do  a  PR

exercise to rebuild the confidence once again for  people

to have confidence to do business in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question, Sir, is one concerning people

from SARS-affected areas.  Many residents have brought up

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>

issue  as  to  why  we  have  not  been  so  decisive  in

restricting the entry of people from countries  that  are

severely affected, particularly from the various  regions

in  China where we do not even know the severity  of  the

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question, specifically for the Minister

for  Health,  is:  in  case children  are  affected,  the

question  that has been raised to some of us  is  whether

parents   will  be  allowed  to  visit  their   children,

particularly the very small ones.  I think this is one of

the  reasons  why  they  fear  going  to  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister for Health two questions?  The first is  whether

or not the Government has in place a policy of freeing up

information on SARS patients to the community for them to

take   the  necessary  preventive  measures  while  being

mindful that information of such nature is obviously very

sensitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question essentially relates to whether

or  not  the Government has a policy of naming persistent

defaulters of Home Quarantine Orders publicly,  in  order

for  the  public  to  take necessary cognisance  of  such

defaulters.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I have a

few  questions  for the Deputy Prime Minister.   Firstly,

DPM Lee mentioned that the HDB would pass on the property

tax  rebates to tenants.  May I ask him whether  he  will

ask GLCs, such as CapitaLand, to pass on the property tax

rebates to retail and restaurant tenants?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, wage cost is also an important component

of  business cost.  I understand that the Government  has

given  foreign worker levy rebates to hotels.   So,  will

the  Government  consider giving  such  rebates  also  to

retail or restaurant businesses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will the Government also ask Singapore

Power  to  consider  giving rebates to  those  businesses

which are affected by SARS?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

during  this SARS period, I think the demand  for  masks,

thermometers  and thermo probe covers has  increased.   I

wonder whether there is a problem with availability.   Is

there also a problem with price profiteering by suppliers

or retailers, and what action has been taken to make sure

that supplies will be available and the prices are within

control?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I have three

questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.  DPM said in his

Ministerial  Statement just now that SARS would  probably

last for two years or so.  So, what is his assessment  of

the  economic prospects for Singapore under the prolonged

SARS situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does he see the need to increase the

quantum  of  financial assistance, such  as  rebates  for

utility  bills, S&C charges, rentals, etc,  and  also  to

provide additional financial assistance schemes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, would the Government defer further the

intention to increase the GST rate next year, in view  of

the current situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, as part of the

effort to make it easier for Singaporeans to respond  and

help   in  this  national  effort,  can  I  request   the

Government  to  consider using easier telephone  numbers,

eg,   for  the  Ministry  of  Health's  and  the  special

ambulance's helpline numbers?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, first, I would like to

thank  the Government for extending assistance  to  those

who  are  on  Home Quarantine Orders.  I would,  however,

like  to  ask  the Government to also consider  extending

some  assistance to those who are not on Home  Quarantine

Orders but who have lost their jobs, who will lose  their

jobs, or who will suffer drastic pay cuts as a result  of

SARS.  They also need some assistance.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I

would  like  to ask what is the status of the people  who

have gone to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>

Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale Centre  during  the  identified

period  coming forward to be screened?  How many of  them

have  come forward?  And for those who have come  forward

and  are  found not to have any symptoms of  fever,  have

they  been  quarantined  or  have  they  been  asked   to

voluntarily  quarantine themselves?  In that sense,  will

they  also  be given compensation during their  voluntary

quarantine period?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, on this official quarantine

period,  ie, 10 or 14 days, can the Minister  for  Health

explain?   I  also  want to reiterate the  fears  on  the

ground  about  Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  Can the  Minister

explain  the  procedure when a person seeks help  at  Tan

Tock  Seng Hospital?  I went to the market today.   There

is  even talk that they would be locked up when they seek

help  there!  What are the preventive actions being taken

by Government agencies to ensure that there is service or

business  continuity if any of the staff is found  to  be

affected?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I

would  like to ask more about the Home Quarantine Orders,

because  there  seems  to be some  public  misperceptions

about  what steps are taken before Home Quarantine Orders

are issued.  There may be some hesitancy therefore as  to

why they want to keep to the Home Quarantine Orders.  Can

the  Minister  explain  how Home  Quarantine  Orders  are

issued and what sort of actions are required of those who

are quarantined?  I also understand that in all parts  of

Singapore you can be quarantined at home.  Apparently, in

Hong  Kong,  there  were some problems about  people  who

thought  that they had SARS and then took taxis or  buses

on  the  way  to the doctors, nurses and hospitals,  that

they are in fact spreading the infection.  What steps are

being  taken,  for  example,  to  control  this  type  of

problem?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask  the  Minister for Health how  many  super-spreaders have been identified in Singapore, and how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>

this figure compares with those of other nationalities in

other  countries.   Have there been any  studies  on  the

profile  of these super-spreaders and, if so,  are  there

any commonalities that have been found?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is directed to DPM and Minister

for Finance.  Will there be a possibility of including in

the  package  itself or introducing  a  package  to  help

individuals who are affected by SARS, eg, in  their  loss

of  income,  perhaps  in the form of  a  one-off  special

personal tax relief?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, my

question  is  on quarantine.  But, before that,  I  would

like to share this sentiment about a job well done by our

medical  providers, and we hope that they  will  continue

with the courage and serve us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question about quarantine, the Pasir Panjang

Wholesale Centre incident has shown us the risk  of  mass

quarantine.   I  gather  that there  are  some  essential

services  which  are  now trying out alternative  groups,

where  some  groups are encouraged to break up  into  two

distinct  groups, so that they do not meet each other  in

case  one  should contact SARS.  To what extent  is  this

necessary  and how far do we go in determining the  level

of  the  need to break up into two groups?  For  example,

the CDC is thinking of doing that.  I was told mass media

groups  are also looking at dividing themselves into  two

groups  and working differently.  What about our Cabinet?

I  see  that  all the Ministers are here.  What  are  the

risks   of   one  contracting  SARS  and  us  losing   or

quarantining all the Cabinet members?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Health

what  is the state of the morale of the medical staff  at

the  hospitals.  Is any emotional or counselling  support

given  to  them?  Do we have sufficient medical resources

at  our hospitals?  Could we consider mobilising military

and medical resources to supplement, if necessary?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is with regard to Home Quarantine

Orders.  I share Prof.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>

Chin's  concern  that there is some  misconception.   The

public  is  concerned what home quarantine involves  and,

therefore,  they are afraid to come forward.   Hence,  if

the  Minister could consider giving more explanations  on

what  it  involves  and  what  assistance  is  available,

whether financial or other forms of support that can help

them  cope  with home quarantine, that would help  dispel

the  misconception  and encourage  more  people  to  come

forward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ms Braema Mathiaparanam. I will allow

one more question after this.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> I have some questions for

the Deputy Prime Minister.  Talking about screening, will

people crossing at ferry points be included?  What is the

rationale for giving the money to employers to  give  out

to  employees who are on home quarantine?  Lastly, we are

here  for the long haul.  What are the plans to help take

off some of the load, especially of the frontline workers

in  the hospitals who are doubling up to help out, eg, in

SARS-screening duties, etc, and whether we can work  with

the  Ministry of Manpower to retrain retrenched  workers,

etc, to do them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I

have  a few questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.   We

have  noted  from the Deputy Prime Minister's speech  and

from  reports  elsewhere that SARS has severely  affected

the  travel  and  tourism industries, among  others.   My

question  is  whether  the Government  is  reviewing  the

importance that we have been attaching to the travel  and

tourism  industries.  What is the Government's assessment

of   the  impact  of  SARS  on  the  travel  and  tourism

industries in the medium and long term?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Steve Chia, you have had your chance

already.   Any  other hon. Members?  You  have  had  your

chance too, Mr Tan.  If I allow you, I will have to allow

Mr Steve Chia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, are we allowed to ask

questions  again, because I believe this is a Ministerial

Statement,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>

and  we  have always had the opportunity to ask questions

many times?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. I will leave it open then!

Mr Steve Chia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mr Tan. Thank

you, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Okay, ask your question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have an additional

question  for the Deputy Prime Minister.  Hong Kong  just

unveiled a $2.7 billion lifeline yesterday to fight  SARS

and create employment.  Taiwan is in the midst of passing

a  big  $2.5  billion expenditure Bill aimed at  creating

jobs,  boosting their economic growth and lowering  their

unemployment  figures.  In Singapore, is  the  Government

stopping  at this $230 million package that it introduced

last week, or is there more being planned in the pipeline

that is going to be disclosed soon?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, for doing

it for all of us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Neo, what is your question?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to ask the Minister for

Health whether he would consider public measures for  the

better  containment and tracing of SARS cases  by  giving

more public directives, eg, answering questionnaires  and

temperature  taking  for  public gatherings  in  confined

places.   May I ask him what kind of treatment  has  been

given in our public hospitals for SARS patients?  Have we

had  cases  where they were less responsive  to  previous

treatment,  suggesting maybe a more virulent  or  mutated

virus?   May I also ask him how near is Singapore in  the

development of a quick and reliable testing kit for SARS?

Could  I  also ask the Minister whether it is  true  that

Ward 55 and Ward 68 in NUH had probable and suspect cases

of  SARS yesterday, with a plan of removing them en  bloc

to Tan Tock Seng Hospital but was aborted in the evening?

Could he clarify this?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I think one of

the  concerns  of  the  members  of  the  public  is  the

survivability if the person were to be suspected of SARS.

The  concern is the number of deaths and mortality  rate.

One  way of addressing it is that many get out of it but,

on  the  other hand, a number have succumbed  to  it.   I

wonder  if  we have learnt from the lessons of those  who

have passed away.  Is there a better way of treating  and

taking care of these patients so that we can enhance  the

rate of survival of our patients?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I have two questions for the

Deputy  Prime  Minister.  My first question concerns  the

nation's rice stockpile.  In view of what has happened in

the  Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, I would like to know

whether we should take steps to relocate our stockpile of

rice  to  different locations, because I understand  that

all  our rice is situated in one locality.  Would  it  be

prudent for us to take some steps to ensure that, in case

there  is a repetition of what has happened in the  Pasir

Panjang Wholesale Centre, our supply of rice would not be

affected?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have relates to a report which

I  read in the newspapers a few days ago.  It quoted  the

Minister for Trade and Industry as having said that  some

headway  has  been made in the progress  in  negotiations

with the Chinese authorities to allow Chinese tour groups

to  come  to Singapore again.  Sir, I know we  are  in  a

dilemma  over  this.   On the one hand,  we  need  to  do

something  to boost the tourism sector to fill our  hotel

rooms and to allow our retail shops to have more business

but,  on the other hand, I am just wondering whether this

is really the right time to push for more Chinese tourist

arrivals,  in  view of the fact that China is  accounting

for  more  than half of the SARS cases around the  world.

And here, we are talking about quarantining newly-arrived

foreign  workers.  So, are we, in fact, doing  the  right

thing?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, first, I want to

express  my personal appreciation and admiration  to  our

medical  and healthcare workers for their good  work  and

sacrifices.  I have two questions for the DPM.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I must say that my Malaysian friends and

many other foreigners have a very dim view of what we are

doing  here  in Singapore, especially when  they  thought

that  we are in a very gloomy and dooming state.  I would

like to ask whether we should carry this psychological PR

war  to  the  international  media  so  that  we  present

ourselves  as  doing everything we can  and  keeping  the

situation under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we all know that PRC is a very significant

source  of  infection.  I would like to know whether  the

Singapore   Government,  as  well  as  the  international

community,   can  do  more  to  impress  upon   the   PRC

authorities to take extraordinary efforts to control  and

contain  this spread.  Because whatever we  do  here,  if

more come from overseas, particularly from China, we have

this going on and on, we will have great difficulties.  I

would like to ask whether we could share whatever we know

in  Singapore with the PRC authorities as well  as  other

ASEAN countries which we intend to do soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, DPM has

mentioned  that  if the situation does not  improve,  the

unemployment situation will get worse.  At this point  in

time,  for  those  industries that  have  been  affected,

besides  looking at the cost-cutting measures,  would  we

also want to urge the Government and the employers to  do

more to see how we can actually enhance the employability

of  this  group  of workers?  So, if the worse  situation

happens, they will not just end up with nowhere to go and

cannot find a job.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> First, I would like

to commend the Minister for Health and our Government for

having taken a very transparent approach in managing  the

SARS issue.  I have a question for DPM Lee, and that  is,

in  view  of  the  downturn, especially  in  the  service

sector,  is there any consideration for us to re-look  at

the  CPF  contributions by employers, perhaps a reduction

during  this period?  This is because I remember  an  old

lady  telling  me  once that if you  do  not  have  fresh

vegetables  to  eat  daily,  why  think  of  drying   and

preserving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>

vegetables.   Once  the  economy  turns  around,  we  can

perhaps  look into a restoration again.  This  will  work

towards helping to save jobs for the workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> In view of

the  incident at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Bowen Secondary

School,  I  am just a bit concerned about the places  for

mass gathering.  Are the schools and the institutions  of

higher   learning   (IHL)  equipped   to   handle   these

operational changes of this crisis?  Would there be  more

resources  given  to the schools and the  IHL  to  handle

these issues?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to refer to the societal battlefront

that  the DPM and Finance Minister mentioned.  In  trying

to  boost our psychological defence in this area, I agree

with some of the hon. Members about the public perception

and  the  kind  of  information that they  are  receiving

regarding  two  very important critical  aspects  of  our

containment   and  isolation  policies,  ie,   the   Home

Quarantine Orders.  We get a glimpse of some of the  SOPs

that  have  been put in place, but to the lay person  and

the  neighbours,  it is still not very  clear  what  home

quarantine  actually means.  What we understand  is  that

not  everybody is actually put under quarantine at  home,

but  only  certain categories.  Then, would  there  be  a

danger  of cross-contamination for those who are  allowed

to  leave  the  home?   But  if  you  were  to  ringfence

everybody in, there is a question of daily living.  It is

not very clear how this is going to be maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect would be those who have to go for

treatment  in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  We have been  told

that the earlier you go and seek treatment, the better it

is.   But  after that, it is blank. Nobody  really  knows

what  happens  in  it.  And again, as hon.  Members  have

mentioned, there are the misperception and all  kinds  of

rumours   and  exaggerated  horror  stories  about   what

happens.   So,  we  also  need to  know  what  would  the

progress  of the illness be like, so that it  is  in  the

interest of a potential victim to say that, "The  earlier

I  go for treatment, my survival chances are better."  We

do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>

get  the  idea because there is no profiling of  what  it

means  to be a patient and if your treatment is too late,

what happens.  I know that there are variations but in  a

general sense, it is to assure the public that these  two

aspects ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are making a long speech, Prof.

Ngiam.  What is your question?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> My question is that

we need more information and better explanation as far as

the lay person is concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, we have received feedback

from  our healthcare unions that the healthcare personnel

in  the  public  sector  is  actually  facing  tremendous

pressure  because there are a lot of healthcare personnel

themselves, ie, healthcare workers, who are affected.   I

would  like to ask the Minister what more can be done  to

rope  in support from the private healthcare sector,  ie,

the  private hospitals and private healthcare  personnel,

to  support  the  work  of the public  sector  healthcare

personnel.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, we are going to

carry  out  temperature checking for all the stallholders

in  the  markets  and  food centres.   In  the  whole  of

Singapore,   we  have  more  than  100  market   centres.

Currently, this job is carried out by the volunteers, ie,

the  CCC or CCMC members.  I would like to know how  long

this  would  carry  on  and  whether  the  committee  can

mobilise some of the medical staff to help to do the job.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> I would like to ask the Minister of

Health.  I understand from Today newspaper that Ribavirin

is  the most preferred oral medicine for SARS but it  has

long-term  effects  on the foetus.  In  other  words,  if

pregnant  ladies  ever  consume  it,  it  might  lead  to

negative consequences on the baby. What could be done  to

help  protect  our healthcare workers who  are  currently

pregnant  and are in the SARS battlefield?  Should  leave

be given to them or should they be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>

reassigned to jobs where they are not exposed to SARS?

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister for

Health if he could help clarify two matters that arose in

the  Sembawang area.  I wonder whether the Minister could

clarify the arrangements made for families who are  under

Home Quarantine Orders.  Is it clear that groceries would

be delivered and, if so, what types of groceries would be

delivered  to them?  Would they be expected to ask  their

friends  and  relatives to help provide for  their  daily

necessities?   I  think there is some  confusion  on  the

ground regarding the facilities being given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is the prominent space given in the

newspapers  one or two days ago regarding  a  person  who

came back from China and refused screening at the airport

and  a  check-up.  I understand that legislation  may  be

introduced in this regard.  But currently, can  a  person

refuse  screening?   And if he or she has  been  screened

somewhere else and has been given a clean bill of health,

how  much  credence will be given to that clean  bill  of

health?

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> I have got a question

actually   for  the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee   about

foreign students in the various institutions.  When  they

return  for  their studies, is there anything here  where

quarantining  them is concerned?  The other question  is:

healthcare workers sometimes do get into their own habits

and  since we are here with SARS for some time, what  can

be  done  now,  where  the medical students  at  NUS  are

concerned,  such that the component on infection  control

is revved up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are there any more questions? If none,

I  am  afraid Members will have to wait for their answers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>QUESTIONS ON THE MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to

respond to two of the questions that were raised just now

by Members concerning the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre.

Sir,  as  Members are aware, the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale

Centre has been closed for a period of 10 days, from 20th

April, and this is due to the discovery of probable  SARS

infection  there.   This  was a sudden  closure  and  the

Government  recognises that because of its suddenness  it

has  affected  the business of tenants in  the  wholesale

centre.    Of  course,  the  closure  is  necessary   and

justified to safeguard public health and also the  safety

of  Singaporeans  but, nevertheless, it  has  caused  the

tenants financial loss, not to mention inconvenience  and

disruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to recognise that it is not possible to

adequately  compensate  for  such  loss  and  disruption.

However,  the  Government  will  provide  some  financial

assistance to the affected tenants and workers.  First of

all,  HDB  will waive the rentals for 10 days,  in  other

words,  for the full period of the closure.  Second,  the

Government will provide an ex gratia payment of $1,600 to

each  tenant,  and  this is to cover  part  of  the  loss

arising  from  the goods that were destroyed.   When  the

Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale  Centre  was  closed  suddenly,

tenants  were  not  allowed  to  enter  the  premises  to

retrieve  their  goods.  As a result of that,  and  as  a

result of the disinfection that was carried out, most  of

the vegetables stored there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>

had  to  be  destroyed.  Finally, of course, tenants  and

workers whose incomes have been affected will be eligible

for  the  HQO  allowance which the Deputy Prime  Minister

announced earlier.  This allowance provides for up to $70

per day per person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for an update on

the  vegetable supply situation.  Again, as a  result  of

the  closure of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, which

accounted  for something like 70% of the total  vegetable

supply   in   Singapore,   from   Malaysia,   there   was

considerable  disruption in the first day or  so.   Since

then, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore

(AVA)  has  been  working  closely  with  the  six  major

supermarkets, as well as other distributors, which import

vegetables directly, without going through Pasir  Panjang

Wholesale Centre, to increase their imports in  order  to

compensate  for  the  loss.  At the same  time,  AVA  has

facilitated  importers, who have been  placed  under  HQO

following  the closure, to make alternative  arrangements

for their vegetables to be brought in and to be delivered

directly to their customers, without routing them through

Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre.  AVA has also worked with

Immigration and Customs Authority (ICA) to put  in  place

procedures to facilitate faster clearance of consignments

at  the  Causeway.  In addition to that, AVA has approved

additional   suppliers  from  Malaysia  who  can   export

vegetables  to Singapore.  Now, there are over  100  such

suppliers.    And  imports  of  vegetables   from   other

countries have also been stepped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures, the re-routing of supplies

through  supermarkets, opening up of secondary  wholesale

centres,   facilitation   of   imports   from   Malaysia,

additional suppliers, imports from other countries and so

on,  have resulted and contributed to an increase in  the

supply  that  is  available in the  market  today.   This

morning, I have been told that the supplies have actually

gone  up  above  the  levels seen  before  Pasir  Panjang

Wholesale  Centre  was closed.  So, there  is  now  ample

supply of vegetables available in the market and I  would

like to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>

urge  members  of  the public not to  rush  or  to  hoard

vegetables  because  more  supply  will  be   coming   in

regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the safety of the workers engaged

in  transporting and selling vegetables, as  far  as  the

drivers  and  delivery  workers  are  concerned,  at  the

Causeway, the AVA has now instituted special measures  to

screen  all  such workers coming in from Malaysia.   They

will  ask  for a health declaration.  They will ask  them

whether  they  have  been to the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale

Centre from the 5th to 19th April.  On top of that,  they

will  take  their temperatures.  All these measures  have

been explained to the importers, and also to my Malaysian

counterpart,  the  Minister for Agriculture.   They  have

been  accepted.   We  need to do this  to  safeguard  the

safety  of  our  workers and the buyers involved  in  the

vegetable  trade and also those involved  in  other  food

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are doing similar screening in the secondary

wholesale centres which have been set up  -  the ones  in

Toa  Payoh,  Eunos Estate and Sin Ming.  All  these  will

help  to ensure that the people who are working there  as

well as the supplies that are coming through are safe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a result of the Pasir Panjang Wholesale

Centre's  experience, we have also started to screen  the

temperature  of  users and visitors  to  the  Jurong  and

Senoko  Fishing  Ports  and Markets,  because  a  similar

situation  in the fish market prevails.  In other  words,

most of our fish flows through these two markets.  So  we

are  also taking additional safety measures in these  two

areas.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer some of the

questions  belonging to MTI.  First, on the  question  of

rice  stockpile, I am glad to report to Mr Tan Soo  Khoon

that,  in fact, we have a distributed network, and  there

are   three   stockpiles  in  three  separate  locations,

precisely to ensure resilience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electricity, we have switched to monthly

adjustment.  Because oil prices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>

have  come  down, and the Iraqi oilfields have  not  been

destroyed, from next month, the electricity prices should

come down by over 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for water, it can be a health hazard if the water

supply  is cut off.  PUB's policy has been to thimble  it

down.  But, if after six months, the household would  not

pay  and would not agree to instalment payments, then  it

is  cut off.  This policy is being reviewed in the  light

of the SARS crisis.  In fact, PUB moved in immediately to

restore supply to 60 households to which water supply has

been  cut  off.  So we are very mindful of the importance

of water to maintain hygiene at a time like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis asked about the impact of the SARS

crisis  on  travel and tourism, and whether we  have  not

become overly dependent on this sector.  In fact, tourism

revenue in the last 10 years has been steady, which means

that,  as  a  proportion of our GDP,  the  importance  of

tourism to our economy has come down.  This does not mean

that  we do not want it to go up.  In fact, our objective

is  to  try  and  jack  it up under the  Economic  Review

Committee recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to say what the long-term impact of

the  tourism  industry will be.  After September  11,  we

thought  that the industry would die.  It recovered  soon

enough.   After  the Bali bombing last  October,  tourism

fell  to  almost  zero.   But within  a  few  months,  it

recovered.   So human beings adjust.  They do  their  own

risk assessments, precautions are taken and the flow  may

come  back.  And this is the approach we are taking  with

respect  to  our travel and tourism related  industry   -

that  we  are  down  now, so we have  got  the  emergency

package,  but  keep  the workforce as  much  as  we  can,

retrain them, build safety hygiene into our products,  so

that amidst the choices that are available in the region,

we represent a superior and a safer product.  So, in this

regard, I had a meeting with some of the top hoteliers in

Singapore  just  last week, and we are  working  on  many

things

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>

together  to  see how we can gradually restore  foreigner

confidence in our travel and tourism industry.  From  the

time  you board SIA through Changi Airport, taxi  service

into our hotels and shopping centres, special precautions

are  taken  to  ensure  a high level  of  precaution  and

safety.  All these things we will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon asked whether we should, in fact,

welcome  Chinese tourists back into Singapore.  What  has

happened is this.  Because Malaysia quite suddenly banned

Chinese  tour  groups, it created a lot of  inconvenience

for  Chinese tour groups already in Singapore.  In  fact,

we  had  to help make alternative arrangements for  them.

Since  then, we have been in discussion with the  Chinese

National Tourism Authority to see whether we can  address

the  specific  problems.  They are thinking  of  resuming

either Singapore tours or Singapore-Thailand tours.   But

the   Singapore-Malaysia-Thailand  tours  are  no  longer

possible  because of the actions the Malaysian government

has taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also told us that they are very mindful - and

this was before the sacking of the Health Minister  -  of

the  healthcare  risk that they pose to  us.   So  it  is

important that throughout Asia, in the affected areas, we

talk  to each other and we check outbound travellers  and

they   check  outbound  travellers.   We  check   inbound

travellers  and  they check inbound travellers.   And  in

this  way, we do not stop cross-border travel but protect

ourselves, and reduce the risks which are involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very crucial at a time like this that while we

should over-react on the side of caution and safety,   we

should not do unnecessary damage to our economy.   It  is

to   be  expected  that  because  of  reporting  in   the

newspapers  and on television, because of the  repetition

of  certain  images, people who are not so familiar  with

Singapore  get  a  distorted  picture.   So,   from   the

beginning,  MTI took the position that it is crucial  for

our economic agencies to put out accurate information  to

all our clients, and EDB and IE Singapore have been doing

this  on  a daily basis.  And this has created a  certain

level of trust.  Not only have we been in contact with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>

the  people  here,  the Chairman of  EDB  has  also  been

writing letters directly to the CEOs in the headquarters.

As a result of this, among the important account holders,

there remains a high level of trust in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, as I was going through my e-mail, I

received a note from EDB saying that the American Chamber

of Commerce in Singapore will soon be issuing a statement

praising  us  for  the  efforts that  we  have  made  and

expressing their full confidence in the precautions  that

we  have  taken  to safeguard the health  and  safety  of

Americans in Singapore, and affirming their commitment to

continue to do business here.   In fact, tomorrow  night,

Stanchart  will  be carrying on with the celebrations  of

its   150th  anniversary.   The  Chairman,  Sir   Patrick

Gillman,  and  other top executives  will  be  here,  and

Senior  Minister will be speaking.  So, these things  are

continuing,  and that is because when we  say  something,

they believe us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, Members would have heard that Toronto

has  now gone on to the same list as Hong Kong, Guangzhou

and  Beijing,  and that is very serious.   The  Mayor  is

hopping  mad.  But WHO sees Singapore as a very important

demonstration  of  what can be done and  what  should  be

done.  German Chancellor Schroeder is continuing with his

visit to Singapore and other countries in South East Asia

next month.  So, if bit by bit, we restore confidence  by

what  we are doing, then the tourists and travellers will

come here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before I came here, I received a fax message

from the Chairman of EDB of a letter just written to  him

by  an  American company.  Because I have not cleared  it

with him in advance, I should not mention the name of the

company,  but it is an electro-chemical company based  in

New  York.   Mr  Teo  Ming Kian had  sent  him  a  letter

updating  him  on the SARS situation, and he  wrote  back

saying:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the update. We understand that it is

extremely  difficult but we are very  encouraged  by  the

response of the Singapore Government to this crisis."



The  last  paragraph of his letter is something  that  we

should think about.  He said:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the way, it occurred to me that Singapore's

decisive  and  effective handling of this serious  crisis

may    ultimately   result   in   significant    economic

opportunities for Singapore in the future."



At a time like this when we are in an emergency, he tells

us this.  He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that many US companies will hesitate

before  investing  serious money in countries  which  are

either unwilling or unable to properly deal with a crisis

of  this  nature,  that  investment  may  instead  go  to

Singapore  where there is a high degree of confidence  in

the Government and its willingness and ability to protect

its  citizens  as well as many major foreign investments.

I,  for  one, will think more than twice about  investing

millions   of  dollars  of  my  shareholders'  money   in

countries  where  the government is either  unwilling  or

unable   to   protect  the  investment.   I  would   have

absolutely no hesitation in investing significant amounts

of  additional money in Singapore.  As a matter of  fact,

we  are in the process of doing just that right now as we

speak."



That  cheered me up.  I showed it to Mah Bow Tan and  Yeo

Cheow  Tong  who were sitting next to me just  now.   And

since  Inderjit Singh raised this issue a moment  ago,  I

thought  I  should  read  the last  paragraph  to  remind

ourselves that we should pull out all stops to solve this

crisis,  and  if  we  do  not  lose  our  nerves,  if  we

concentrate on what we have got to do and have an eye  on

the  medium and long term, then I think we will come  out

of it ahead.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

address  a point that Ms Braema raised regarding  foreign

students.   Foreign students who come to our institutions

from  SARS affected countries and travelled recently  are

asked  to take leave of absence for 10 days, after  their

return  before they are allowed to join the institutions.

This   happens   in   our   schools,   universities   and

polytechnics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hostels, what happens is this. If a

foreign student arrives from a SARS affected country,  he

will undergo a medical check-up and we will house him  in

an  outside  facility  for 10 days  and  he  has  another

medical  check-up before he is allowed to join the  other

hostelites in the hostel.  And within the hostels,  there

is  a daily temperature taking regime, and those who  are

unwell  are asked to see a doctor.  There is a  sick  bay

where  they  can  rest separately from the  rest  of  the

hostelites.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a need for a Home Quarantine Order for

one  of  the  hostelites, because he went to  some  other

place  and  as a result of that he is subject to  a  Home

Quarantine  Order, then we have outside facilities  where

we  can house these hostelites separately from the others

in the hostel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin asked about the measures in schools and

institutes  of  higher learning.  As  Members  know,  the

schools  have taken a number of measures after they  have

reopened over the last few weeks to try to ensure that as

far as possible, only those students who are well are  in

school.  So there is temperature screening routine.   The

students  have  to  make  declarations  of  their  travel

history and they should declare whether they have had any

occasion  to  go to some of these places where  they  may

have  come into contact with SARS patients.  In the event

that  any student does become sick outside of school,  he

should  not  come to school and therefore the chances  of

getting  ill  as  a  result of coming into  contact  with

someone  who is ill in school is minimal.  And  with  the

twice   daily   temperature  taking  routine   with   the

thermometer that is issued to every student, teacher  and

staff  member, as soon as a student has a fever, he  will

be  picked  up very quickly and he will be isolated,  and

the chances of any infection will be minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the institutes of higher learning, the

polytechnics  and  universities are now  in  the  reading

period  before the examinations.  So there  are  no  mass

classes going on.  But in any case, the universities  and

polytechnics  will take precautions for the examinations.

And  as the Deputy Prime Minister has indicated just now,

they  have  developed plans to zone the universities  and

polytechnics  and  to  try  and  minimise  cross-movement

between  the different zones.   The universities and  the

polytechnics  will also be looking at various  procedures

to  see how they can do daily temperature taking when the

institutions reopen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should stress also that social responsibility

is one of the most important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>

features  as  well.  What we have done is  that  we  have

asked parents and students to check themselves every  day

before coming to the institutions, so that they will  not

come to the institutions if they are not feeling well.  I

am  glad  that  there is high confidence  among  parents.

Attendance  rate in schools has been very high,  but  the

attendance rate is slightly lower than normal.  And I  am

happy  about  that  because it  shows  that  parents  and

students  are  taking  their responsibilities  seriously.

Previously,  when  they  had been  slightly  ill  with  a

sniffle,  slight sore throat or cough, they would  go  to

school.  Now, they are staying at home.  I think that  is

a  sensible and socially responsible thing to do.  In the

approach that we are taking in the schools with regard to

SARS,  we  take it really as a public education exercise.

We  take  the  opportunity to educate the students  about

social  responsibilities, health issues, and how to  look

after  themselves.  And we hope that these messages  will

also  flow from the students into the homes and  help  to

educate Singaporeans at large.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing

me  to  respond to a couple of points.  There  are  three

points here which I thought I should respond to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua traced the plight of the

self-employed  who,  because of this  outbreak  of  SARS,

would  suffer, not that they have become victims  of  the

disease   but  that  their  income  would  be   affected,

particularly those who would need a licence to  carry  on

with  their  livelihood.  And if their income goes  down,

they  would  have cash flow difficulty, and  cannot  make

their contribution to Medisave, thereby they cannot renew

their licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure hon. Members that we would consider

such  cases very sympathetically.  Their contribution  to

Medisave is actually based on their income.  So if  their

income   indeed   goes  down,  their  contribution   will

obviously  go down.  But even then, if they have  special

difficulty  trying to meet this lower contribution  rate,

we would be very happy to make arrangement to ensure that

their licence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>

will  be  renewed and they can continue to earn a  living

and support their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen asked why was the foreign worker levy

rebate  that  was  announced as part of  the  package  of

measures  to help businesses affected by the outbreak  of

SARS  limited to foreign workers in the gazetted  hotels,

and  not  extended  to  all  foreign  workers.   In  that

instance,  the package was tailored, as DPM had explained

when  he  announced the package, to the sector  that  was

most  directly hit, and this was the tourism sector,  ie,

hotels, travel industry, restaurants and such like.  When

we  looked  at  that group, we found that  the  group  of

foreign workers who were paying higher levy, most of them

were actually in the hotel sector.  As hon. Members know,

there  are  two  tiers of levy for work  permit  holders.

Those  who have higher skills pay the lower levy of  $30.

So  the  levy  in itself is not a major cost  factor  for

those  at  the lower levy.  Those who are at  the  higher

levy  of  $240, most of them are actually  in  the  hotel

sector.  Therefore, we decided that this is where we  can

make a difference.  This is where by reducing the levy by

half, we can make a contribution to help the employers to

weather this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to address was made by

Mdm  Halimah  and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.  Both of  them  were

concerned  about those people who either lost their  jobs

or suffered wage cuts as a result of the outbreak of SARS

which  affects the economy.  In the case of Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang,  he  asked what we can do to help to  enhance  the

employability of those workers who were retrenched  as  a

result  of the business downturn.  We would like to  help

these  workers to be re-deployed wherever there are jobs.

We  would  be prepared to retrain them for new jobs,  and

there  are  many schemes under the Ministry of Manpower's

skills  upgrading and retraining programme.  So, I  would

offer  this retraining programme to them.  In fact,  this

weekend, there is a job fair organised by the North  West

CDC,  and  they  have  brought  together  many  employers

offering  nearly  1,000  jobs,  packaged  together   with

appropriate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>

training programme, so that anybody who is unemployed can

have  a  chance  to be retrained for the  jobs  that  are

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even during this period when we have high

unemployment  and  redundancy,  my  officers,  when  they

talked  to  the  companies which are in  the  process  of

bringing workers from the SARS affected areas, were  told

that,  notwithstanding the present situation,  they  have

great  difficulty recruiting workers.  That is  why  some

companies  still  resort to bringing in new  work  permit

holders  from SARS affected areas.  They know the danger.

They  know the risk, and they know that they have  to  go

through  this  additional step  of  putting  the  workers

through  a  10-day  quarantine which costs  the  company.

They  have to pay for the costs of the quarantine.   They

have  to  pay  for the medical staff that  supervise  the

workers under quarantine.  But they are willing to do it,

and  they  tell  my  officers that the  reason  is  that,

despite  this present situation, Singaporeans  are  still

not prepared to take these jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to take this opportunity to urge all our

people - if you need a job, there are jobs available, the

Ministry  will  be  there  to  help  you,  we  will  find

opportunity for you, but you must be prepared to make the

adjustment, you must be prepared to undergo training,  if

necessary, so that you can take on these jobs.   I  think

that  is the most viable solution.  Just giving out  more

financial  support can only last so long.  It  is  not  a

permanent  solution.  Yes, in the case of those  who  are

victims  of  SARS, we have this special  Home  Quarantine

Order allowance to assist them to tide over the period of

home  quarantine when they lose their income.   But  over

the  longer  term, the only way to support  yourself  and

your  family  is to get a job, and that is where  we  are

here to help you.  To retrain you for the job, if you  do

not  have the skills.  To help you to find a job, if  you

do not know how to go about doing so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

start  off by responding to Dr Lily Neo's question  about

how  the  SGH outbreak started and whether it could  have

been averted, and also how did that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>

lead  to  the  outbreak  in the Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale

Centre.   I  hope  in explaining how these  got  started,

Members  can  appreciate  the difficulties  that  we  are

dealing  with.   We  do  not have a  reliable  and  quick

diagnostic  test  system  now.   We  have  to  depend  on

clinical  symptoms and we have to depend  on  very  rapid

contact  tracing  in order to ringfence the  contacts  to

prevent  the  spread from widening,  which  is  also  the

second question which Dr Lily Neo presented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This index case in SGH that caused this cluster was

an  ex-patient  in  Tan Tock Seng  Hospital.   He  had  a

multitude of problems and he was discharged from Tan Tock

Seng  Hospital on 20th March.  He recovered from some  of

his  problems, and this was a regular discharge  on  20th

March.   On  22nd March, we decided that  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital would be a hospital dedicated for SARS.  So this

was in the middle of the problems that we were having  in

Tan  Tock Seng Hospital.  He was discharged on a  regular

basis because he recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of that decision to make Tan Tock Seng

Hospital  the dedicated hospital for SARS, when this  man

had gastrointestinal bleeding on 24th March, he had to go

to  SGH because Tan Tock Seng Hospital was only admitting

patients  for  SARS.  He went to SGH.  SGH took  all  the

necessary  precautions - screened  the  person.   He  had

gastrointestinal bleeding.  He also had a foot ulcer  and

a  low  grade fever.  SGH took a chest X-ray,  which  was

done on the date of admission on 24th March.  The chest X-ray was clear.  Because of the symptoms he presented, SGH

did  not  consider  him to be a suspect  SARS  case,  and

treated  him  for his problems and put  him  in  an  open

general ward (Ward 57).  On the 5th day of admission,  on

28th  March, he developed high fever.  So SGH  took  note

and  gave him a repeat chest X-ray.  The repeat chest  X-ray was normal again.  He was treated with antibiotics on

29th March and the temperature came down, indicating that

this  could  be  a bacterial infection and  not  a  viral

infection.  A blood culture showed that he had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>

infection of the blood by a bacteria, E. Coli.   A  third

chest  X-ray was done on 30th March, and this  was  again

normal.  He was given a stronger antibiotic on 4th April,

and  he did not have fever anymore.  But his chest  X-ray

on  4th April showed signs of pneumonia, and SGH did  the

right thing, which was to send him to TTSH, because  with

a  chest  manifestation, he was considered as  a  suspect

SARS case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, SGH management also began to notice a

group  of their staff and healthcare workers coming  down

with  fever,  and  they went into alert.   A  cluster  of

potential  problems was growing.  So on 5th  April,  they

decided  to  transfer Wards 57 and 58 to  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.   The process took some time and  the  transfer

was completed.  The transfer started on 6th April, and it

was  completed on 7th April.  In transferring two  wards,

we had to move all the patients, many of whom were fairly

sick,  and  the staff together with them.   We  initiated

contact tracing, involving 120 people - the patients  and

the  staff - to find out whom they were in contact  with.

Because  if they were infected, we did not know who  else

could  be  infected  in the two wards.   So  the  contact

traced everybody.  From the 120, we have to contact trace

a  few  hundreds  to see who they are.  By  the  time  we

detected his brother who had visited him in SGH, that was

already  8th April, one day later.  By then, his  brother

who  caused this cluster of problems in Pasir Panjang had

onset  of fever on 4th April.  He still went to  work  at

Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale Centre on 5th  April.   He  was

unwell  on  6th April; so he did not work on  6th  April.

But he went back on 7th April, and again on the 8th.   By

the  8th  of April, he was quite unwell; he was  sent  to

NUH.  So by the time we realised he was a contact of  his

brother  in SGH, he had already been admitted to  NUH  on

the 8th.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this illustrates the difficulties we face. When

a   patient  is  presented  with  all  kinds  of  chronic

problems, it masks the typical symptoms that we associate

with  SARS - high fever and all the other symptoms,  plus

pneumonia  and  chest problem.  In this  case,  they  did

three X-rays, they did a blood test, and this did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>

not  manifest  itself till much later.   We  have  to  do

contact  tracing very quickly, but it still takes  us  24

hours.   We  set  a target of completing contact  tracing

within  48 hours.  So in this case, even if we  meet  the

limit of 48 hours, by that time the onset was on the  5th

of April, he was very sick, and on the 8th he was already

in NUH.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, could we have done better? The

problem  is  a significant one.  Obviously we could  have

done  better.  I think SGH management could be on greater

alert when it comes to staff coming down unwell, which is

now  the new standard that we impose.  Any two healthcare

workers having fever in the same department now sends out

a   red  flag.   But  having  set  the  standard  of  two

healthcare workers having fever sending out a red flag, I

hope  Members realise now a lot of red flags are  showing

because it is not unusual to have fever.  And we set  our

fever  threshold now at 37.5oC, which is not a very  high

grade  fever.  So, everybody is on very high alert.   And

contact tracing is not 100% foolproof.  We need people to

be very truthful about their contact history.  Otherwise,

if  they  give us half a story, we miss out some  of  the

contacts and we cannot ringfence these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to say that this SARS challenge is a

tremendous  challenge for us.  We are flying  blind.   We

only have two instruments which are the clinical symptoms

- fever, chills, cough, muscle aches - and then only much

later,  ie,  three days, five days, or seven days  later,

you  get the chest manifestations.  The second instrument

we  have is contact history so that we know that, even if

you  have  got  fever  and cough, but,  because  of  your

contact history, we must suspect that you have SARS.  And

that is why I said in my statement that we have to depend

on  people  taking temperature, and we have to depend  on

people being truthful to us in their contact history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about WHO guidelines, why we have

to  follow them and why do we not set our own guidelines.

We   have  to  follow  a  certain  set  of  international

guidelines because we have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>

report to WHO.  This is a global problem.  We cannot have

a different set of guidelines.  Then WHO would not have a

true  picture  of  our situation.  But for  the  clinical

guidelines  set by WHO where we can be more conservative,

we  have done so, for example, WHO guidelines on what  is

deemed  a  recovery.  When a person  is  deemed  to  have

recovered  from SARS, WHO says he must have no fever  for

48  hours.   In Singapore, we set it at 72  hours.   Then

they  insist on a series of blood tests to see the  white

blood count.  We do that too.  They insist on X-rays.  We

do  that.   They say you need 10 days' medical  leave  at

home.   Our rule is 14 days' home quarantine, that means,

not  just  10 days' medical leave at home, but we  insist

that  the  person  stays at home  for  14  days  on  Home

Quarantine  Order,  and  he has  to  come  back  to  TTSH

regularly  through the ambulance for his blood tests  and

chest  X-ray.  So we follow WHO guidelines, in  terms  of

reporting  of statistics, otherwise, there would  not  be

sensible comparisons across the countries.  When it comes

to  clinical guidelines, our staff here always try to  be

more  conservative, as I have illustrated on the criteria

for recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about epidemiological study group.

We  are  doing  this  constantly, trying  to  piece  this

together  and  trying  to get a picture  of  the  disease

pattern.   We also have two WHO consultants with  us  and

one  consultant  from US CDC helping  us  to  track  this

pattern.  They of course provide the link to their parent

organisations,   and  whatever  we   do   is   completely

transparent  to them and audited by them.   And  so  they

have  high  confidence in their parent headquarters  that

whatever  we report is the truth and not something  which

we  are  doctoring  to give a different  picture  to  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked about the healthcare workers.

Are  they  adequately  protected?   We  try  to  have  as

stringent a level of protection as possible.  But  a  lot

depends  on  correct  usage  of  this  protection.    For

example,  if any of you have used the N95 mask, you  will

find  that  it is very, very uncomfortable.  It  is  very

hard  to  breathe.  When I put it on, I find that  I  was

being suffocated.  And I cannot imagine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>

how I could ever be a nurse.  But the nurse has it on for

eight  hours,  10  hours,  12  hours.   And  it  is  very

uncomfortable.  In the open wards, it is very  warm  with

the  gown  and the mask.  These are not easy  conditions.

It has to be very tight-fitting, so it is hard to breathe

and  if  it is not tight-fitting, then it does not  work.

So   it  requires  a  lot  of  vigilance  and  a  lot  of

discipline.  Day in and day out, keeping this  protection

on  because you know that if you make a slip-up, it  will

be a very costly slip-up.  So for the healthcare workers,

it is a lot of stress, and they are over-stretched in the

wards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation varies. When we have a big

cluster  like  in SGH and in the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale

Centre,  then of course the workload increases.   But  if

you  look  at  the situation across the public  hospitals

today, Tan Tock Seng Hospital is well protected.   As  we

mentioned in our statements, we have not had any  of  our

healthcare worker being infected for the last six  weeks.

So  the  morale  is  high.  They know that  if  they  are

diligent  and  they take good care of themselves  through

the  protection, they will continue to be protected.  But

once there is a slip-up, it will be a real setback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resources in Tan Tock Seng Hospital are bearing

up.  Our critical resources are the ICU and the isolation

rooms.   In  the ICU, we are doing okay because  we  have

nearly 40 ICU rooms and we are using about 20 each  time.

So  we still have some capacity.  Our isolation rooms are

now  very  stretched  because,  with  the  Pasir  Panjang

Wholesale  Centre cluster, we encourage  people  to  come

forward  for  screening.   Because  we  do  not  have   a

diagnostic  kit,  we  have  to keep  them  in  individual

isolation  suites to watch over them for some time.   And

therefore  the  isolation  rooms  are  filling  up   very

quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other hospitals are bearing up reasonably well.

As  I have said, KK Hospital is also clean of SARS and  I

think  they  are managing very well.  Alexandra  Hospital

has  not had an episode of SARS.  As a result, the public

goes there and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>

they   are  now  feeling  the  strain  because  Alexandra

Hospital is a very small hospital and it is not  used  to

this  load.  So a lot of the load that used to go to TTSH

and SGH now goes to Alexandra Hospital.  Changi Hospital,

after  their  episode in end-March, has not  had  another

episode.   So  they are again gearing up.  So,  today,  I

would  say TTSH, KK, Changi and AH are bearing  up  well.

We  have the problems in SGH.  They were doing okay until

the  recent  episode with Dr Alex Chao.  And in  NUH,  we

still have the cluster that was started by the brother of

the  index  case  in SGH which created a  cluster  there.

That one, we are still trying to keep it under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have the Ministerial Combat Team under SMS

Khaw  Boon  Wan.  He and his team have gone down  to  the

hospitals  to button down the protection guidelines,  the

execution  of those protection guidelines, to  raise  the

standards  and  the  morale and the capabilities  of  the

hospitals.   I think they are doing a great  job  and  we

should be able to see the situation improving day by day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our hospitals are coping fairly well with the

public  services.   As  to  hospital  charges,  we   have

explained  this before.  Screening is free.   So  if  you

come forward for screening in Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  it

is  free.  If you are kept for observation, then you  are

charged C class rates.  So it is heavily subsidised.  And

if  you  have financial problems, then our medical social

worker  would apply Medifund for you.  So I do not  think

Singaporeans should be concerned about the medical  costs

of coming forward for screening or treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of questions which Members raised

and  which  I  thought  it is worthwhile  for  me  to  go

through,  in  some detail, is the Home Quarantine  Order.

When  we  detect a probable SARS or a high  suspect  SARS

case,  we  start contact tracing and the people  whom  we

determine  to have contact with this patient, a  probable

SARS  or a high suspect SARS, we will then issue the Home

Quarantine  Order.  As far as this contact is  concerned,

he is still healthy, he is still well, but because of his

contact history with a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>

probable SARS or a suspect SARS case, he is given a  Home

Quarantine Order.  And the reason why we do so is that we

want  him  to stay at home, monitor his health constantly

and the minute he has a high fever or other symptoms,  he

will  call us and we will dispatch an ambulance to  fetch

him  to Tan Tock Seng Hospital straightaway.  So in  that

way,  we  minimise the likelihood of him infecting  other

people  in  his family as well as in the community.   But

the  other family members are not contacts of a  probable

SARS  or  a  suspect SARS patient.  So if  they  are  not

contacts,  they  will  not be issued  a  Home  Quarantine

Order.   But  if  the other family members are  contacts,

they   will  also  be  issued  a  Home  Quarantine  Order

accordingly.  Then how do we treat the children?  Because

we  felt that as schools are very sensitive institutions,

we  took the extra care of asking the children to also be

quarantined even though the children will not be infected

until the adult is infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through this again. If we detect a

probable  or  a  suspect  SARS  case,  we  determine  the

contacts.   Let us say, there are 20 contacts.   Then  we

issue  a  Home  Quarantine Order  on  each  of  these  20

contacts.   These  20  contacts will have  an  incubation

period  before  they become infectious.   The  incubation

period is between three and 10 days.  But we insist  that

he  stays at home so that, whenever he has a fever or  he

shows  symptoms and becomes infectious, we will pull  him

out  to  TTSH.   The adult family members  will  not  get

infected  until  the  contact gets infected.   Then  they

themselves will take another incubation period  of  three

to  10  days before they become infectious.  So the other

family  members  can continue with their work  and  their

life,  because they are not infectious and they will  not

be   infectious  until  the  contact  becomes  infectious

himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we not do the same for children? Medically,

we  should  do the same for children.  But  knowing   the

sensitivity of parents over the children in the  schools,

we  decided that, for children of a contact, we  will  be

extra kiasu and we also issue a Home Quarantine Order  on

them.  When we started, of course, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>

stipulated  it  as a requirement in the  Home  Quarantine

Order, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised.  This has caused  some

confusion  in  the public's mind.  Recently,  we  decided

that   we   would  actually  issue  an  individual   Home

Quarantine  Order  on each of these children.   There  is

another situation where a family member is a probable  or

a suspect SARS case, in which case all the family members

are  contacts and all the family members would be  issued

Home  Quarantine Orders, including the children.   So  to

minimise this confusion, nowadays, when a child is  asked

to  stay  at home, we will issue a Home Quarantine  Order

and there would not be any confusion among the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked what about financial support for

this  group.   If the contact is given a Home  Quarantine

Order  and the other family members are not at risk until

the  contact  becomes infectious, then the  other  family

members can go about with their life as usual, go and buy

grocery,  etc.   But  we do have a  situation  where  the

entire  family is served with the Home Quarantine  Order.

Then  of  course  we will come in to provide  support  to

them,  in  case they need grocery, etc.  But if they  can

make  their own arrangements, ie, if their relatives  can

bring  the food to them and leave it outside their  door,

it  is all right.  This is just to be extra safe because,

if  they follow the rules that we set for them, they  are

not  infectious until they exhibit the symptoms.  So  the

workman  can go to their house and do the repair as  long

as  these people are responsible.  If they do not exhibit

any  symptoms, they are not infectious and life goes  on.

But  the minute they have a fever and they have symptoms,

then they will call us and we will bring them to TTSH for

screening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we serve the Home Quarantine Order on a person,

the  CISCO  police who serves the order will set  up  the

camera  and give the instructions.  I accept Mr  Tan  Soo

Khoon's  point that we should give it in four  languages.

We  will  do that.  But the CISCO police will explain  to

the person, who is served with the Home Quarantine Order,

what  he has to do and how he reports through the  camera

whenever we call him up.  At the same time, we will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>

send  a  nurse to visit the person under Home  Quarantine

Order and the nurse will have a kit with a thermometer, a

face mask and also instructions, so that he knows how  to

take  his temperature on his own and, if he is sick, then

he  puts  on the surgical mask and wait for the ambulance

to  come.   So, this is the way we explain to the  person

what he has to do and, of course, it would help if we put

it in four languages, and we will do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group of questions which I thought is

important for me to elaborate on is the situation in  Tan

Tock Seng Hospital and why Singaporeans fear going there.

We  have come out several times to explain the very  high

level of infection control in Tan Tock Seng Hospital  and

that  it has been screening hundreds of people since  the

beginning  of  the  SARS outbreak, and people  have  been

discharged, they go on with life as usual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, cross-infection in Tan Tock Seng Hospital has

not  taken place.  If, after screening, the Tan Tock Seng

clinicians  feel  that you should be warded  for  further

observation, then you are kept in an isolation room.  You

will  not  infect others and others will not infect  you.

And  the  healthcare workers who come to look  after  you

will all be fully gowned and fully protected.  So, again,

a very high level of infection control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are down with SARS, as I explained in my

statement,  the  main treatment is to  give  you  medical

support and allow your body's immune system to combat the

virus  itself.   The  problem  is  when  you  have  other

complications.   Then you need the full  medical  support

system  to address these medical complications.  But  the

actual  combating of the SARS virus would really be  done

by the person's own immune system.  Of course, if you ask

yourself,  logically  the earlier you  come  forward  for

treatment,  the better your chances of recovery,  because

if  you  do not have the full medical support, especially

in  the  ICU, when you have congestion in your lungs  and

you  cannot breathe, then no oxygen gets into your  blood

stream

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>

and  your chances of survival are very low.  But  if  you

are  in  the  ICU, then they can intubate you,  they  can

force  oxygen  into  your lungs and cause  your  body  to

continue to absorb the oxygen, and so you have a fighting

chance.   So,  people  can stay in  the  ICU,  intubated,

ventilated, and then the body will have a chance to fight

the virus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the earlier Singaporeans who are down with SARS

present  themselves  for  treatment  and  for  this  full

medical  support to help them fight the SARS, the  higher

the  chances of survival.  If you track the kind of cases

that  come to our hospitals, when they come in very, very

sick  and  very, very late, and they have to  go  to  ICU

almost  immediately,  then I think the  chances  are  all

very,  very  slim.   If you have been following  stories,

those  who  come very late and very sick and  go  to  ICU

straightaway, they have much lower chances of recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our recovery rate is still very good. 85%

fully  recover.   Those who go to  ICU,  more  than  half

recover  too.   So,  again, I urge Singaporeans  to  come

forward  if you have SARS.  Seek early treatment and  you

will  have better chances of recovery, you do not  infect

your  family,  and  you  do not cause  infection  in  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee asked whether we need special

accommodation  for the people on Home Quarantine  Orders.

As I explained, it is not necessary, because these people

are not infectious.  We just want them to be isolated  in

their  own  homes  and, if they have  a  fever  or  other

symptoms,  then  they present themselves immediately  for

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of issues is really the level of

information  that  we  give out, ie,  whether  we  should

publicise  the  names  of patients  and  people  on  Home

Quarantine Orders.  Generally, we are reluctant to do so,

because  I  think  we  should  try  to  preserve  medical

confidentiality as much as possible.  But where there  is

a  public health need, then we will do it.  If we need an

accelerated contact tracing because the way we  go  about

it  through detective work takes 24 or 48 hours and  that

takes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>

too  long  and the risk is too high, then, of course,  we

will publish the names in the media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for recalcitrants and defaulters, I think we

should  publish  their  names  and  shame  them  because,

otherwise, such Singaporeans will continue not to do what

is  necessary of them.  So, although we try  to  preserve

medical  confidentiality, people who default and wantonly

break the rules, we will definitely name them so that  we

can shame them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply of equipment, eg, masks, gowns,

goggles, thermometers, etc, there is a shortage of  masks

worldwide.   But we are using all our resources  that  we

have in Singapore, eg, from MINDEF, MTI, IE Singapore, ST

Logistics,  to  get ourselves the necessary  supplies  to

keep   our   healthcare  workers  protected.    So,   our

commitment  to  our healthcare workers is  that  we  will

leave  no stones unturned to get this equipment for them.

Thermometers are less of a problem.  We have ordered more

than a million.  I think these will be available over the

next few months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether there is a difference

in  the  minimum  number of days in the  Home  Quarantine

Orders.   We  have  used  10 days  because  that  is  the

incubation  period.   But  some employers,  for  example,

impose a voluntary quarantine of 14 days to make it  even

safer.   I think there is nothing to lose if you want  to

extend  it to 14 days.  But, for us, we use a minimum  of

10 days because that is the incubation period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the sort of resources that we have. As you

have  heard  from  the  DPM, the full  resources  of  the

Government  are behind the Ministry of Health  to  combat

this  problem.  We have used resources from every agency.

From MINDEF, we have used the medics; we have people from

the  People's Association to help us in contact  tracing;

we  have  used  detectives from the CID  to  help  us  in

contact  tracing;  we  have used  all  resources  in  the

Government to tackle this problem.  And as you would have

heard from the responses of the various Ministers, all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>

the  Ministries  are gearing up to tackle  the  different

aspects of how to deal with SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked about the treatment regime. When

we started off, as I said, there is no specific treatment

regime.   The  Hong Kong experience, they  tried  to  use

Ribavirin, the anti-viral regime.  But as we all know, it

has  toxic  side effects and so we have to  use  it  very

carefully.     The   American   clinicians    are    more

conservative,  and  they prefer  not  to  use  this  very

aggressive  approach.  So, our clinicians  have  to  make

professional judgments, ie, when to use the full array of

antibiotics and anti-viral regimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about the situation in NUH Wards

55  and  68.  These are the kinds of problem that we  are

confronted with nowadays, because our threshold of  alert

is  now set very, very low.  When you have two staff with

high  fever and patients with high fever, everybody  gets

very excited.  So, in SGH, on Good Friday, we transferred

Ward 74 to TTSH because of this combination of staff  and

patients  having fever.  It was a precautionary  measure.

We transferred lock, stock and barrel, ie, one whole ward

across  -  a lot of resources and effort.  As  it  turned

out, it was, thankfully, a false alarm.  The fever of the

staff  came down, and the patients in that ward,  because

of their other medical problems, were showing this fever.

But we would rather be safe than sorry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for NUH Wards 55 and 68, we had been

tracking the situation, and it is a combination of  staff

and patients having fever.  Some days the fever is up, on

other  days  the fever is down.  The patients  there  are

diabetic  and kidney patients and, according to what  the

doctors  tell  me,  fevers  in such  situations  are  not

uncommon.  But, at the same time, we are always  on  very

high  alert, and we have to make a professional  decision

when  a  combination of red flags comes up.  Do  we  just

ringfence  them  in  NUH or do we  physically  move  them

across  to  Tan Tock Seng Hospital?  So the  Director  of

Medical Services and the Chairman of the Medical Board in

each hospital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>

are  confronted  with such professional  decisions  every

time they are faced with situations like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered most of the questions. I am

sure there will be many other questions which I have  not

answered, in which case, I will respond later on.   I  do

not want to hold up the others.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sorry to

disappoint you with more answers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just focus on four or five main points which

the  other Ministers have not yet covered before Mr  Wong

Kan  Seng  tells us what he has been doing in the  Ex-Co.

Most  of  my issues have to do with our policy  measures,

our  response and commitment of resources and  effort  to

this task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether we have enough resources.

We  will have enough resources.  Speaking as Minister for

Finance, what is needed will be given.  Do not waste  it,

but if you need it, it will be given.  If you need drugs,

masks,  gowns,  thermometers, treatment facilities,  they

shall  be  provided.   We can afford  it.   This  is  the

national priority.  But it must be properly used  and  we

must get the problem under control.  Of course, there  is

never  enough, and Members have asked for more.  I  would

have been disappointed had they not asked for more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked why not go all the way to the

limit,  ie,  do it like reservists' allowance or  make-up

pay  -  whatever your salary, make up 100%.  We  are  not

quite making up 100%, but we are not doing 50%, which  is

what  Mr  Steve Chia said.  I think he may have  misheard

me.   We are doing 100%, up to a cap.  The cap is  $70  a

day.  But, below that, whatever your pay is, you get  it.

And  if  you are self-employed, we will just give  you  a

flat rate of $70 a day.  We will give you the benefit  of

the doubt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is our philosophy? I think we are in a

situation where the economy is going

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>

to  hurt,  many  Singaporeans are  going  to  hurt,  many

businesses are going to hurt.  The Government cannot take

it  upon  itself to make good everybody's loss.   Because

from 4% growth we will go down to 1% or 0% growth.  Where

does the Government find $6 billion, which is equal to 4%

of  GDP, to make good?  It is not possible.  But, at  the

same time, where the Government's action directly impacts

somebody - I shut your company, I put you out of work,  I

ask  you  to  stay at home, or I close the  company  and,

therefore,  you  also have to stay  at  home  -  we  will

provide  assistance.   If  we  do  not  do  something  to

mitigate the pain, to help you out, then you are going to

try your best to escape quarantine. And that is going  to

make  our public health problem worse.  So where  we  act

and  there is hurt, we will try to make good.   I  cannot

always  compensate fully, but I can extend some allowance

or some gestures to address the hurt.  In the case of the

PPWC,  we are going to waive rentals for 10 days  and  we

are  going  to  give  them another ex-gratia  payment  of

$1,600  per stall, more or less covering up the  cost  of

the vegetables which became spoilt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it dollar-for-dollar? I think that is not

possible,  because this is a situation where there  would

be  ups and downs, but to the extent that we can help, we

will.  So when it comes to the HQO allowance, if you  are

in  the  lower income group, I will give you up to  100%.

In  fact, if you are self-employed and a hawker, you  may

not earn $70, but I am going to gloss that over. I do not

want  to  have  to examine your income tax returns,  your

employer's  records, or whatever the records  there  are,

and  audit them. What I have suggested to my staff to  do

is that when you are served with a HQO, you will be given

a  form.   If you are an employee, give the form to  your

company.  Your company will deal with the CDC and make  a

claim.   If  you are self-employed, you submit the  form.

We  will  process it quickly and if we can, we  might  be

able to give you part of the allowance early and then the

other  part  after you have completed your HQO,  just  in

case you do not complete your HQO.  So, what we can do to

alleviate the hurt we will do it, but we cannot say  that

we will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>

compensate everybody 100%, because that is not realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic assistance, this is an issue where, like

Oliver  Twist in the musical, he would ask, "Can  I  have

more?"   The  question is:  what is the solution  to  our

problem?   Will  we solve our economic  problem  or  SARS

problem  by having an economic stimulus package?   Is  it

that kind of a problem?  Is it because our wages are  out

of  line, our market has disappeared, our costs  are  not

competitive,  or  there is insufficient demand?  So  what

happens if the Government spends $1-$3 billion?  Well, we

will  all  have  a  warm feeling -  we buy  each  other's

things,  sell each other's things.  But we do  not  solve

the  problem. The fundamental problem is a public  health

one.   To get the economy going, you have got to get  the

medical,  public health part solved.  And that is  not  a

question  of money, but of the organisation,  the  social

responsibility, the discipline and the commitment we  put

to  it  to  fix the SARS problem and restore  confidence.

Then the economy can pick up again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Wall Street Journal coincidentally today

has  an  editorial on this subject. The  title  is  "SARS

Bailouts  are a Bad Idea" and the editorial explains  why

it is a bad idea.  It says that if you have an earthquake

or typhoon, you compensate everybody.  They rebuild their

shops  and stores.  Then you go back to business as usual

again.   But this is not an earthquake or typhoon.   This

is a change of the landscape.  Will the businesses be the

same  at  the end of this?  What kind of businesses  will

come back?  How should you adapt and move your people and

your capital and your workers, and find new jobs?  You do

not know yet.  So, if you help people stay in the tourism

industry, even though hotel occupancy is 10-20%, what  if

the tourists do not come back for quite a long time?  You

cannot  afford it.  Supposing we give tax rebates.   Will

that  solve  the  SARS  problem?  Will  that  get  people

spending  again?  As the editorial says,  they  are  more

likely to stash their money away to get them through  the

difficult times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial noted that various countries are

looking at budget packages.  Hong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>

Kong  announced  a big package yesterday, which  prompted

this  editorial. Singapore had a small package.   So,  at

least, (according to the editorial) it could be said that

Singapore  has  the  wisdom to resist micro-managing  the

economy  through  this crisis and it is hanging  back  in

order  to allow the market mechanisms to work.  In  other

words,  we have to adjust.  We do not know where, but  we

would have to see how the epidemic goes, what happens  to

the regional economy and the global economy, and then  we

adapt.  To pour money out now does not solve the problem.

It is premature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think their conclusion is worth reading. They

say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is full of risks, and disease is one of them.

...  When things go badly, especially all at once as with

SARS,  there  is a natural temptation for  government  to

step  in.  But that means that the next round of  choices

are  distorted by the expectation that there  will  be  a

safety net.  In a crisis which is ongoing like SARS, that

changed perception could be particularly damaging.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true role of government is in protecting against

dangers  to  society as a whole which  the  market  isn't

capable of addressing.  SARS is just such a danger."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight SARS, to get people quarantined, to change

people's  attitudes,  to  persuade  them,  is  what   the

Government has to do.  The economic cost will continue to

grow  as long as the virus is on the loose but if  it  is

contained, recovery should soon be coming.  So, the  best

way  to solve the economic problem is to concentrate  the

maximum  possible  resources on the medical  problem  and

that  is exactly what we are doing.  Of course, a request

will  arise.  I fully expected Mr Low Thia Khiang to  ask

about the GST.  He would be remiss if he did not do so at

every  opportunity.  But is that our  problem?   The  GST

increase  is  for  the end of the year, something  to  be

dealt  with then.  And I hold out no promises  that  that

will change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen pointed out that this is a problem

of  human  psychology.  He is absolutely right.   We  are

dealing  with people.  We are dealing with human  beings.

They are frightened.  They are worried for themselves and

for  their  children.  They do not know how to react  and

they  are looking for leadership and guidance.  There  is

fear.  There is denial.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>

And  as  the Chinese and the Hongkongers point  out,  the

fear  of  SARS is more damaging to the economy than  SARS

itself.  Because when you fear, you stay at home, you  do

not go out, you do not spend, you do not do anything, and

everything grinds to a halt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to overcome this, and understand that these

are  human problems.  We are all afraid of getting  sick.

Nobody  welcomes illness.  Your fever goes  up  a  little

bit, you say, "Something has gone wrong. Better take  the

temperature  again."   We have been  taking  temperatures

daily  in MTI and MOF. The first day, I was 37.1.  My  PA

said,  "You  are the champion."  I thought that  was  bad

news  but  I  still passed.  The next day, it  was  37.3,

stuck in the right ear.  So I said, "No, no.  Let's check

my  left  ear."   The left ear was lower.   It  is  human

psychology.   You wish not to believe.   Today,  it  went

back down to 36.8, so I am standing here.  That is just a

small example of how frightened people can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I have SARS? I wish I did not have. Maybe I am

mistaken.   It  is  not really a fever.   If  I  see  the

sinseh,  he  may  give me some banlangen  or  some  magic

potion.   Or  take some garlic and vinegar and  then  all

will  be well. So, you have people who go from sinseh  to

sinseh  and GP to GP, anything but confronting the truth,

the  awful  possibility that maybe you do have  SARS  and

need  to  go  to  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital.    And  that

psychological  hurdle to, firstly, acknowledge  that  you

may have SARS, and, secondly, if you do have SARS, to  go

to  Tan Tock Seng Hospital before you infect your family.

Each one of those is a very big psychological hurdle  for

people  to  take.   So we have got to make  it  easy  for

people  to  make  these steps.  And it means  explaining,

showing them Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  I hear all sorts of

Hokkien  meanings that have been attributed to  Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital, but it is a perfectly safe place  and  we

have to get people to understand that.  If you have SARS,

going in early is your best chance of coming out.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also have to help people to be willing to take

proper  measurements of their temperatures. And  we  have

got  to get people to watch out for each other - at work,

in  their families.  So even if you are in denial,  which

is a natural human reaction, your spouse, your parents or

your children would say, "No, I think you are sick.   You

better  go."  And they will badger you, harangue you  and

nag  you until you go and see a doctor - not a sinseh,  a

doctor.   Through  this community support,  we  can  hold

together and overcome this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no medical cure for SARS. We are not

absolutely  sure if the treatments will work except  that

they  will help to support you through the very difficult

stage  of  the  illness.  But there is  a  public  health

solution  which  can  keep the disease  down  as  low  as

possible  and  keep the transmission under  control.   We

will give everybody a thermometer.  I do not truly expect

that  100%  of Singaporeans would take their  temperature

every  day.  But if I can get 90% of Singaporeans  to  do

that,  and  if  a  super-spreader can be  detected  after

spreading  to 2-3 people instead of 50, then  we  have  a

chance  to bring the whole epidemic under control.   SARS

may  still be in the population, but the infection  level

is something that we can live with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings have lived with such illnesses for

generations.  Until this post-war generation, when  there

were   antibiotics,  people  lived  with  it  -   plague,

diphtheria, polio. It is quite common that you  will  get

ill, you will die at quite young ages, 30s or 40s - it is

part of life and death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Second World War, with antibiotics,

suddenly  people  felt  that  they  have  conquered   all

diseases.   They are eradicated, they are safe.   If  you

are  sick,  you  go  to a doctor.  The doctor  gives  you

medicine.  Take the injection, and you will be well.  And

it  was  good  for about one generation.  Then,  you  had

antibiotic   resistance.   You  had  malaria   which   is

resistant.    Now,   you  have  tuberculosis   which   is

resistant.  You have Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus

Aureus (MRSA),

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>

something  which  is  terrible, if the  hospital  is  not

careful,  you  can get it.  You have got AIDS,  which  is

also  a viral disease like this one.  After 20 years,  it

is still around.  There are treatments but no vaccine. It

is  a  shock  for  this generation.  But  for  the  older

people,  life used to be like that, and so life goes  on,

even  with these problems.  And I think we have  to  have

that attitude.  After a while, the reality will sink  in.

We  can deal with it.  We can cope with it.  We can fight

SARS and we can have life going on normally, fully and we

will  be able to come out on top of it.  So I think  that

is  the  approach that we have to take and I will ask  Mr

Wong  Kan  Seng  to explain to you some of  the  specific

things that he has been doing in his ExCo.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know many Members have raised some

issues which, as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee, I

will try to answer them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SARS problem we face today is the most serious

threat to our healthcare system, economy and society.  As

far  as my experience goes, it is unprecedented.   It  is

here   to  stay  for  some  time.   The  Government   has

marshalled  all its resources to deal with  it  and  will

spare  no  effort  in  containing  and  controlling   the

problem.  We have to continue to function and to carry on

with our lives, or we will come to a standstill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the Ministerial Committee has thus been

to  put in place all the possible measures to return life

in  Singapore as near to normalcy as possible, with  some

changes  to the way we do things.  At the same  time,  we

have also been thinking through and working out plans  to

address  all the possible scenarios that could arise,  to

prevent them from occurring if we can, and if not, ensure

that  we  are  well prepared to deal with  them  if  they

occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health has dealt in depth on the

measures that have been taken on the medical front and in

our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>

hospitals  to  help  contain  SARS.   The  Deputy   Prime

Minister  himself  has  outlined the  many  precautionary

measures that the Ministerial Committee has put in  place

at our airports and land checkpoints, workplaces, markets

and  hawker  centres,  to allay  public  concern  and  to

prevent the spread of SARS.  He has also outlined some of

the scenarios that we have made plans for, if they should

occur.  I will not repeat them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one point that I want to emphasise is that the

Government  is  going all out to contain  the  spread  of

SARS, to protect you and your family's health. For us  to

succeed  in  containing the SARS problem and  to  restore

life  in  Singapore  to  an  even  keel,  we  need  every

Singaporean  to  play  his  part.  Everyone  must   adopt

socially responsible behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out, the

entire  Government machinery has been mobilised to tackle

this  problem.  We cannot allow all these efforts  to  be

undone  by some irresponsible individuals.  On a personal

note,  I find the behaviour of some of these Singaporeans

on  Home  Quarantine Orders very disappointing,  eg,  the

well-publicised  case of the irresponsible  and  cavalier

attitude of the family of eight who are related to the 70-year  old  SARS  case in Pasir Panjang Wholesale  Market.

This  kind of behaviour is something that should  not  be

condoned, as people like them are putting many others  at

risk.  These individuals either clearly do not understand

the  seriousness of the situation or simply do  not  care

about  the  dangers  that their  actions  could  pose  to

others.   We  will  come down hard on such  irresponsible

individuals from now on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have decided that we would no longer issue a

mere warning when an individual is found to have breached

his   Home   Quarantine  Order.   We  would   immediately

electronically   tag  anyone  who   breaches   the   Home

Quarantine  Order.   All individuals on  Home  Quarantine

Orders  are  checked regularly via the electronic  camera

that  is installed in their homes.  The camera is on only

when  they are told to switch it on and, therefore, would

not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>

invade  the  privacy of their homes.  The CISCO  officers

will then call these people on the telephone and ask them

to turn on their camera.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Deputy Prime Minister said that he

received a letter from somebody who said that some  smart

alec  may do call-forwarding on his mobile phone, so that

he  can be roaming around, while pretending to be on Home

Quarantine Order.  Let me tell them:  Do not try!  Anyone

who  is on Home Quarantine Order and uses call-forwarding

will  have  that  facility cut off.  In other  words,  he

cannot  do  call-forwarding.  That is what we have  asked

SingTel  to do.  In any case, when a person is  asked  to

appear  before the camera, he or his other family members

who  are  on  home quarantine will also appear.   At  the

other end, which is the CISCO office, CISCO officers will

be  able to match the faces and background with what they

have  taken  at  the  time  the  electronic  camera   was

installed.  So, unless a person can put a big picture  of

his home background and pretend to be there, it is purely

impossible.  Whatever it is, he cannot try that any  more

because  he will have no call-forwarding facility  during

the  period of his home quarantine.  So, when CISCO calls

the  person, he will be asked to turn on the  camera  and

that is how he will be checked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who thought that they can pretend

not to be around.  So when CISCO calls, the telephone was

not  answered.   That  was one  of  the  things  that  my

officers  have experienced.  Let me tell them about  this

too.   The moment he does not answer the telephone  after

three  calls,  and  they  will call  three  times,  CISCO

officers  would  be  at his home and he  will  be  tagged

electronically.  So do not try that too.   Also,  do  not

pretend  not  to be at home when you do not  want  to  be

bothered.   There were people who were being  called  and

said  that they did not want to be bothered.  Do not  try

that  also.   I do not think that all this is  worth  the

effort,  because once a person is on electronic tag,  the

moment he leaves the home he will be noticed at the CISCO

operation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>

centre.   He "chao buay lat".  So far, we have  put  nine

such  persons  on  electronic tag after they  refused  to

answer after three calls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act

to  allow  for composition fines to be imposed,  we  will

also  not  hesitate to impose fines on these individuals.

If  such  measures still do not work, we will charge  the

recalcitrant type in court and have them thrown in  jail.

If you read the newspapers today, we have prepared one of

our  prisons for this purpose.  I do not think it is very

comfortable to stay in prison during this period of  home

quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate that we have to resort to

such  tough  measures  to ensure that  Singaporeans  obey

their  Home  Quarantine Orders.  But this  is  a  serious

issue.   We  are  also  making  it  an  offence  for  any

individual  who lies to the doctor when the  doctor  asks

him  some  basic  questions provided by the  Director  of

Medical Services, eg, whether he has a fever, whether  he

has  come  into  contact with any  suspect  or  any  SARS

patient, whether he has been to a SARS affected country - other  than Singapore - of course, in the last  14  days,

whether  he has been doctor-hopping, and so on.   If  his

answers are: "no", "no", "no" to these questions, but  if

found  out later that he has done all those things,  then

he  will  be  committing an offence under the  Infectious

Diseases  Act.   Sir, we do not want  to  implement  such

measures  lightly, as we recognise the emotional  anxiety

and  fear  of  some  of  these people  who  are  on  home

quarantine.  They face anxiety and fear because  they  do

not  know whether they will become a candidate for  SARS.

But to win this battle against SARS, we cannot afford any

kinks in our armour, otherwise we put the whole community

at  risk,  and  the  consequential impact  will  be  very

disastrous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is an open economy. Our borders must

remain  open and we want to continue to welcome tourists,

visitors and businessmen to our shores.  However, we must

also  put precautionary measures in place to isolate  and

contain the SARS

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>

problem  at  our entry points.  Thus, while all  incoming

air passengers from SARS-affected areas and all points in

China   are  subject  to  temperature  screening,  health

advisories  and health declaration cards have  also  been

implemented  at the other checkpoints.  Since  yesterday,

we  have deployed three thermal imaging scanners  at  the

land   checkpoints.   One  each  has  been  deployed   at

Woodlands  Checkpoints and Tuas to check the temperatures

of  those  coming in by bus and those walking in  by  the

Causeway  or the Second Link.  Another has been  deployed

at Woodlands Checkpoint to check outgoing passengers.  We

will  deploy more of these thermal imaging scanners  over

the   next  two  weeks  at  the  airport  and  the   land

checkpoints.  In addition, manual temperature checks will

also  be  implemented  within  the  next  two  weeks  for

passengers  coming in by car or motorcycles  at  the  two

land  checkpoints.  It is simply not practical to  deploy

the  current thermal imaging scanners in the outdoor area

because  the  temperature will fluctuate.   These  checks

will  be  done  at  the secondary check area  where  100%

security checks are now in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible member of the international

community,  Sir, we have also taken steps to ensure  that

we  do not inadvertently "export" SARS to the rest of the

world.  Temperature checks have thus been instituted  for

all  outgoing passengers at Changi Airport  and  bus  and

foot  passengers at the Woodlands Checkpoint.  This  will

be extended to Tuas Checkpoint in the next two weeks.  In

addition, we will ensure that SARS patients and those  on

HQOs  are  not allowed to leave Singapore.   So,  do  not

think  that  they  can just run away and  go  to  another

country  because it will also be noted.   When  they  are

discovered  checking out from our immigration checkpoints

they  will  be picked up and the law will come down  very

hard  on  them.  We have also taken similar precautionary

measures at the ferry terminals, a point which one of the

Members raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working very closely with the Malaysian

government  to exchange information on SARS patients  and

minimise cross-border infection.  The Joint

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>

Border  Working Group, comprising health and  immigration

officials  from  both  countries,  has  been  working  to

establish  the agreed protocols and procedures to  enable

SARS  cases  to be detected at our land checkpoints.   We

are also keen to share information with the Malaysians on

suspected  and  probable  SARS cases  that  have  claimed

travel  history  to Singapore.  We read about  that  from

time  to time that they have been to Singapore.  We  need

such  information  because it would  tell  us  when  that

person  came to Singapore, where he went to and  whom  he

met.   All  this information is useful and  important  in

doing contact tracing and containing the spread of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11th April 2003, new work permit and

Employment  Pass  holders  from SARS-affected  areas  are

placed  on  a 10-day quarantine upon arrival.  Similarly,

by   next   week,  once  all  the  necessary   logistical

arrangements are settled, we will also place all new  and

returning  foreign  students who  are  attending  private

schools, and Professional Visit Pass (PVP) holders coming

in for a month or more from SARS-affected areas, on a 10-day   quarantine  upon  their  arrival.   Family  members

accompanying  the foreign students and  workers  will  be

subject to the 10-day quarantine requirement too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private schools and sponsors of the PVP

applicants   will   be  required  to   arrange   suitable

accommodation  where the student or  PVP  holder  can  be

quarantined.  These foreign students, PVP applicants  and

family  members  will  be subject  to  daily  temperature

checks.   The  private schools and sponsors of  the  PVPs

will also be required to hire doctors to conduct pre- and

post-quarantine medical check-ups for them.  The  student

pass  or  Professional Visit Pass will only be issued  at

the  end  of the quarantine period, and upon presentation

of  a  medical report to certify a clean bill of  health.

With these measures, we will minimise the possibility  of

transmission  of  SARS in the workplace, private  schools

and  living quarters of foreign workers.  We have to take

special measures to quarantine these groups of foreigners

as they are more likely to live

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>

and mix with the wider Singaporean community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also beefing up all our contact tracing

capability   by  seconding  more  officers   from   other

Ministries and statutory boards to assist the Ministry of

Health  and  the National Environment Agency  colleagues.

This will allow quicker and better contact tracing to  be

done  so that cases that have come in close contact  with

probable  SARS  patients  can  be  quickly  isolated  for

further observation.   A public communication campaign is

already underway to educate people about SARS.  Pamphlets

have  been distributed and new ones would be printed  and

issued.   We  have  also  put out  messages  through  the

television and radio to inform the public about SARS  and

what  they  themselves can do to prevent  the  spread  of

SARS.   The  radio will also be used to put  across  such

messages in dialect to reach out to senior citizens.   We

are  also organising dialogue sessions to be held by  the

Advisors for all the grassroots leaders and residents.  I

know  some  Members have already done this and many  have

planned  to  do this in the next one to two  weeks.   The

Prime  Minister himself will chair a dialogue on 2nd  May

to  talk to community and religious leaders, shopkeepers,

stallholders and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the public to remember the hotline numbers

for  SARS   -   I know that some say that it is  quite  a

mouthful  and they cannot remember the present number   - the  general  inquiry hotline will be  changed  to  1800-3339999, which is a toll free line.  I think Members will

like this number.  And the hotline number to call for  an

ambulance  to  send  somebody to Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital

should  that person need to check if he has got  SARS  or

not  will  be  changed to 993.  This  is  a  three  digit

number.   It is very easy to remember.  Members know  999

for   Police;   995  for  Civil  Defence  ambulance   for

emergency,   but for suspected SARS cases  going  to  Tan

Tock  Seng Hospital, please dial 993, and not 995.  These

two numbers will be effective from midnight this Sunday.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member asked how Cabinet Members ensure that the

Cabinet  can  function.  This is of greatest interest  to

us,  as Cabinet Members.  So, for a few of our colleagues

like  Mr  Khaw  Boon  Wan and the three  doctors,  Vivian

Balakrishnan, Ng Eng Hen and Balaji, we have set up video

conference facilities for them  -  for ourselves  in  the

Cabinet  room, and for them in a separate  room.   Should

they  decide to come to attend Cabinet meetings, but  not

inside  the  Cabinet room, they can go to this  room  and

talk  to  us  and  we can see them just  as  Members  are

looking at me on the screen now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the MOS says that they do not have a

problem  because  they are fully garbed, gowned,  masked,

etc, when they walk around in hospitals, they decided  to

take  this  extraordinary step not to attend the  Cabinet

meetings  while they are on this combat team, because  if

there  is  a minor possibility that we can get  infected,

the consequences will be quite bad for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same isolate and contain strategy must also

apply at the organisational level.  I just described  how

the  Cabinet  is  trying to do this, and  how  individual

Ministries are also doing it.  The Ministry of Trade  and

Industry   has  been  working  very  closely   with   the

businesses  to  advise and help them on the precautionary

measures  that  they should put in place to  prevent  the

spread  of  SARS  in the workplace, such  as  temperature

taking  every  day to check the staff and  the  visitors,

segregation  of  their  staff  into  two  teams  and  not

allowing  cross-contamination and so on.  They have  also

been  asked  to develop business continuity plans  should

something happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, such precautionary measures have also

been  put  in  place  for all Government  agencies.   For

example, we take the temperature of ourselves every  day.

Every  Government officer is now given a thermometer  and

he  is  required to take his temperature and he  will  be

supervised  by  his supervisor.  All Government  agencies

have  also  developed  detailed operating  procedures  to

safeguard the health of their front-line staff who may be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>

exposed  to  SARS patients in the course of  their  work.

These  include  the Immigration and Checkpoint  Authority

officers,  and my Immigration officers were quite  aghast

when  they  found  incoming  travellers  at  the  Airport

pulling two hand trolleys and then putting their passport

in   between  their  teeth.   So,  we  decided  to   take

precautions  so  that  they  do  not  inadvertently   get

infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also taking precautions for our Police

officers,   paramedics,  soldiers   and   so   on.    The

consequences  of a SARS infection spreading  through  the

public service will be a serious one and we cannot afford

to  shut down a Government department or a Ministry.  The

same  applies  to  the  others, particularly  those  that

provide  essential  services, because essential  services

such  as  water,  electricity and public  transport  must

continue to be provided, even during an emergency.   This

is  a very serious problem for us and we must continue to

run  these services in order to have life carry on as per

normal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also identified a temporary office site that

can be used for a Government department in the event that

the whole department has to be vacated and we need to  do

some    cleaning.     Back-up   information    technology

infrastructure  has  also been put in  place  to  service

this.  Remote access and telecommuting work solutions are

also  being developed for the public service.  The public

are  also  being encouraged to make greater  use  of  the

various electronic services that Government agencies have

launched  over the years, so that they can  minimise  the

level of physical interaction at the public counters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we take all the necessary precautions to

prevent  the  spread of SARS, we also  plan  for  various

scenarios for which quickness of response and the ability

to   muster  resources  at  extremely  short  notice   is

absolutely  crucial.  Even when reacting to a  situation,

we have to be very fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quote the example of the closure of the

Pasir  Panjang Wholesale Market.  Mr Lim Hng Kiang called

me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>

on  Saturday at about 8 o'clock, and we discussed what to

do  about the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market in  view  of

the  number  of  cases  there.   After  we  assessed  the

situation, we thought that we should close the  Wholesale

Market,  so that we can contain the spread of  SARS,  and

that  is  the best course of action we thought we  should

implement  immediately.  So, I directed the  Director  of

Operations, Police HQ, to marshall the Police officers to

get  to the ground with Environment, MOH and AVA officers

to  immediately  quarantine the place;  in  other  words,

totally  enclose the place.  And then we  cleared  people

out and registered them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to find about 3,000-4,000 people who were, in

one way or another, involved, connected or doing business

in the Wholesale Market, and it is a very large number of

people  to  be contacted.  So, to do that, the  following

day  we again got together a group of officers, this time

from  the Peoples' Association, because they have a  wide

network  on the ground, all the 84 constituency  officers

plus  their  staff were gathered together and  they  were

given  a list of names to do the contact tracing.   While

people  are being traced with the names and once we  know

where  they  are  and  are actually in,  CISCO  officers,

together with another 100 Civil Defence officers, went to

the  homes to serve them with Home Quarantine Orders  and

to  fix  the electronic cameras.  And we also  had  Civil

Defence  officers  to  volunteer to become  interpreters,

because  the people we contact may not speak Mandarin  or

English.  So we had to have interpreters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the immediate action that we took to

trace,  contact, to serve the Home Quarantine Orders  and

to  put  in the electronic cameras.  But there  are  many

regular  retailers who go to the Pasir Panjang  Wholesale

Market and we thought it would be a useful measure if  we

were  also  to do temperature taking at all our  markets,

and  that  is how we activated the PA network again  with

our  community leaders, merchant and hawker associations,

with  Town Council staff and many others, to quickly help

conduct temperature taking.  And the briefing was done on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>

Monday  afternoon.   Monday evening, they  went  back  to

discuss  with their own people together with the  hawkers

themselves  and  the following day, some  were  ready  to

roll,  and  by now they have covered many of the  markets

and  hawker  centres.  Because this  is  an  effort  that

depends  on  the  community, and we know  that  community

leaders  are  volunteers, unless they are  housewives  or

retirees.  So it is not possible to make this a sustained

effort  in  taking body temperature of  every  hawker  or

hawker   assistant.   From  tomorrow  onwards,   National

Environment Agency officers  -  although they  were  also

involved in the earlier task  -  will take over the  task

of  temperature-taking for about 20,000 stallholders  and

their  stall  assistants.   This  will  then  make  it  a

sustainable effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry of the Environment and the Town

Councils  have  done  thorough  checks  and  taken  extra

measures  to  ensure  that the  Hong  Kong  Amoy  Gardens

scenario  should not occur here, we take no chances.   We

have identified and prepared two HDB blocks to be used as

emergency  housing in the event that we have  to  move  a

whole block of residents to another block should the need

arise.   I hope that this will not come about, but should

it happen or has to happen, then at least we are prepared

for  this eventuality.  This is to protect the residents.

I  know  that they will be inconvenienced but that cannot

be  helped because investigations have to be carried  out

smoothly and without hindrance for us to identify whether

there  are other causes that could lead to, say,  several

cases  of unconnected residents living in the same  block

having  SARS.   We hope that there would not  be  such  a

case.  But should that be the situation, then we may have

to activate a plan like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logistics and utilities as well as the

operational  plan to effect such a mass  evacuation  have

already   been  worked  out.   So,  while  we  take   all

precautionary measures, we cannot afford to be complacent

thinking  that everything is fine with all these measures

in place.  We still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>

have  got  to think through and review and refine  as  we

gain experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the actions at the individual and national

levels  are not enough, because SARS is a global  problem

-   in  Asia,  America, Europe.  To fully  contain  SARS,

international cooperation is essential.  Such cooperation

is  already happening on the medical front where  medical

professions  share information; they share  the  research

that  they have done and so on.  The significant  strides

made  on  this  within a short time in the fight  against

SARS shows what could be achieved if nations are prepared

to  work  together to overcome this problem, provided  we

all work on it together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the ASEAN Leaders will be meeting in Bangkok

next  Tuesday  together with their Health  Ministers  and

Ministers  in charge of immigration matters,  to  discuss

the  measures that ASEAN member nations could take  as  a

collective group to keep our borders open and to  contain

the  spread  of SARS. Ideally, we should also  get  to  a

position  where we can assure the rest of the world  that

it  is  safe to travel in and out of ASEAN.  Furthermore,

it  is encouraging to note that China and Hong Kong  also

recognise the importance of global cooperation  and  they

may also be joining the meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whether we like it or not, SARS

will  be with us for some time.  It is important that  we

do  not allow ourselves to be defeated and continue  with

our  normal life with suitable adjustments.  As  long  as

the  necessary  precautionary  measures  are  taken,  all

activities can and should continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the majority of Singaporeans

have  already  made the adjustments and are  carrying  on

with  their normal lives.  This is evident from the  many

mass  community events that are going on  as  planned  as

well as the crowds at hawker centres and food courts.   I

myself was at a restaurant last Saturday and it was full.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, the Government is treating this

threat very seriously.  Attention is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>

paid  at  the highest level, and the Government will  not

let  up  on its efforts to contain and overcome the  SARS

situation.   If  all  Singaporeans  cooperate  and   stay

united,  we  will  weather this crisis like  many  others

before.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Two supplementary

questions, Mr Speaker, Sir.  For the Minister for  Health

-  if  people are afraid of going to TTSH because of  the

irrational fear that TTSH is highly contagious, will  the

Ministry  consider setting up an intermediate testing  or

holding  centre at a different location for  suspect  and

probable   cases?   This  will  actually  alleviate   the

public's  concern and encourage more people  to  be  more

willing to approach this intermediate medical centre  for

SARS  testing, rather than to avoid it totally.  This  is

human psychology at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question for the Minister for Home Affairs - how much is one thermal imaging scanner? If private

corporations  are  interested to  install  one  at  their

business  premises to check for SARS, will it be possible

and allowed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I was a bit interrupted

there.   But  as I understand it, Mr Chia is  asking  how

much  does  each  thermal  scanner  cost.   Is  that  his

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Yes, and whether it would

be  allowed  for private companies and corporations  that

want to install it at their premises to test for SARS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, this thermal imaging scanner

is  a scarce resource.  Right now, we do not have many of

them,  and  we have to depend on the company  to  produce

this.  But because of the urgency of this matter, we have

decided  to  take from them first and started  to  deploy

them at our airports and land checkpoints.  How much does

it  cost?   I  was  told  it is  more  than  $100,000  or

thereabouts.  So it shows that we are sparing no efforts,

including the price of this scanner, to install  as  many

as we can, because we have to deal with this immediately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> When the supply is more in

the future, and because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>

SARS  is  going to stay with us for quite some  time,  if

private   companies  request  to  install  it  at   their

premises, will that be allowed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we have to see how we want

to  maximise this scarce resource.  Since we do not  have

many of these around, we have to put them in places where

we can create the most effect.  So the idea now is not to

deploy this in the companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned that I am encouraged that China

and  Hong Kong are attending the meeting.  Well, that was

my impression, but I do not think that has been confirmed

yet.  So I would withdraw that part of my statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. Just

now  I  think  Mr Lim Hng Kiang was under the  impression

that  I questioned the validity of the home as a suitable

place for home quarantine.  I fully agree with that as  a

medical practitioner.  I was actually trying to refer  to

people   who  were  recalcitrant  in  trying   to   break

quarantine,  and  Mr Wong Kan Seng has told  us  what  he

would  be  doing for that group of people.  But, perhaps,

he  might want to address the group who is given  a  Home

Quarantine Order because of a contact at work,  and  then

because  they are living with maybe distant relatives  or

actually  renting  a  room, find  that  the  relative  or

landlord saying, "Look.  Please, I don't want you  to  be

in the same household."  What do they do then?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I seek clarifications, Sir? The

Minister  for Health earlier mentioned that we  have  had

this  epidemiological study group all this while.  May  I

ask him what kind of study results have been obtained  so

far  and  could he share that with us?  The Minister  for

Health  also said earlier that all the medical  staff  in

our  public  hospitals  are protected  with  face  masks.

Could  I  ask him whether face masks are sufficient?   Or

should  they  don  space suit outfits as  well?   Is  the

conjunctiva  of the eyes not an entry route for  viruses?

Could I also ask him whether Tan Tock Seng Hospital could

share their good practices with other hospitals?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health also said earlier that anti-viral drugs are being used by our doctors in our public

hospitals.   Can I ask him whether it is correct  to  say

that   there   is  no  medicine  that  can  combat   SARS

coronavirus?   Why  then  are  our  doctors   using   the

available  anti-viral drugs now that they have many  side

effects?   The  Minister also did not answer  my  earlier

question on public directives for better containment  and

contact tracing of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said earlier that those

under  quarantine can claim $70 a day.  But it  has  also

been  mentioned that they can claim $70 from the  Courage

Fund.  Does it mean that now they can claim $140 a day?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Steve Chia asked whether we

can  have a different facility as intermediate care.   In

fact, that is possible by going to the polyclinic.   But,

of  course, if you know that you have contact with a SARS

patient, then I think you should go directly to TTSH.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee asked whether we can have alternative

home   arrangements.   As  I  have   tried   to   explain

painstakingly,  the person who is on home  quarantine  is

well and is not infectious until he has the symptoms.  So

he  can  continue renting a room or staying at home.   It

would  be  very  difficult for  us  to  make  alternative

arrangements  for  accommodation for all  people  serving

HQOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked about the epidemiological study.

I am no expert.  I will get my staff to give her whatever

they  have  found out.  For the staff who are  in  direct

contact  with  unknown or potential SARS  patients,  like

people  in  the A&E, ICU and emergency departments  where

they have to deal with potential SARS patients, then they

put  on  the  full suit, together with the goggles.   For

those who have to do actual interventions, then they  put

on  the  hoods.   That  is how I  have  explained  in  my

statement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cure for SARS. In the early stages,

Hong  Kong  thought that Ribavirin would be useful.   The

clinicians  in Singapore are not as aggressive  in  their

approach  as the Hongkongers.  I think we are  closer  to

the  American  clinicians and, therefore,  we  have  used

Ribavirin  very, very conservatively, because we  realise

the toxic side effects of this anti-viral regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public directives - we are building up the contact

tracing setup, organisation, data collection, as Mr  Wong

Kan  Seng  explained.   And when these  things  are  more

systematic,  of  course, we will then be  able  to  issue

these out in proper public directives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some confusion on the Courage Fund. The

Courage Fund offers up to $70 per day for people who come

forward   for  screening  and  who  are  then  held   for

observation.   Because we felt that  for  some  of  these

people  in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, especially

the  casual  workers,  if they are  served  with  a  Home

Quarantine Order, then what DPM announced today will kick

in,  and  they will be given the financial support.   But

even  just to come forward for screening, and you have  a

temperature  and you are held in Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital

for  observation for a few days, there may be a  loss  of

income  for these people.  So the Courage Fund  has  come

forward  to say that for screening and observation,  they

will also provide the financial support for up to $70 per

day.   So  there  is  no  double  payment  for  the  Home

Quarantine Order people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Companies Act was last amended in July

2002.   At that time, I informed the House that a private

sector-led committee, called the Company Legislation  and

Regulatory Framework Committee, was doing a comprehensive

review of our company law.  The Committee was chaired  by

Dr  Philip Pillai, Senior Partner of Shook Lin & Bok, and

comprised  lawyers, businessmen, academics and Government

officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After extensive deliberations, including two rounds

of public consultation, the Committee submitted its final

report to the Government in October 2002 with a set of 77

recommendations.   All  the  recommendations  have   been

accepted for implementation.  These recommendations  will

help to simplify business regulations,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>

create  a more conducive business environment, and  lower

the   costs   of  capital  raising  and  maintenance   in

Singapore.   They  also  improve  Singapore's   corporate

governance  and  regulatory  framework,  and  align   our

practices with the leading jurisdictions.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.42 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Committee's

recommendations will require amendments to the  Companies

Act,  the Securities and Futures Act, and the SGX listing

rules.   It  will  also  require  the  enactment  of  new

legislation, such as the Limited Partnerships Act and the

Limited  Liability Partnerships Act.  The  amendments  to

the Companies Act will be done in two phases.  This Bill,

which   seeks   to   implement  20  of  the   Committee's

recommendations,   is  the  first   phase.    The   other

recommendations  require more complex amendments  to  the

Companies Act, and will be implemented later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments

proposed in the Bill.

<br><br><i>Reducing Business Costs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote entrepreneurship, our company law must

not impose unnecessary regulatory burden on start-ups and

small  private companies.  Unlike public companies  where

there  are  greater  public  interests  to  protect,  for

private  companies we need to strike a different balance,

in  order to maintain acceptable standards while  keeping

business  costs low.  I shall now highlight some  of  the

Committee's  recommendations that  will  help  to  reduce

business  costs  for  small  and  private  companies   in

Singapore.

<br><br><i>Removing the Statutory Audit Requirement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all companies in Singapore are required

by  law  to  have their accounts audited by  an  external

auditor.  Clause 35

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>

amends   section  205  to  remove  the  statutory   audit

requirement  for  dormant companies, as  statutory  audit

serves  no  public purpose and imposes unnecessary  costs

for  such companies.  A dormant company is defined in the

Companies Act as a company with no significant accounting

transactions during the financial year.  The  removal  of

statutory audit for dormant companies is in line with the

practices in UK and Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 35 further amends section 205 to remove the

statutory  audit  requirement for  small  exempt  private

companies.    An  exempt  private company  is  a  private

company  with not more than 20 shareholders who  are  all

natural persons.  More than 75% of companies in Singapore

are  exempt  private companies.  Most of them are  owner-managed.   This means that all the shareholders are  also

directors of the company.  For such companies, audit will

be  left as a business decision, instead of being imposed

as a legal requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee had initially considered removing the

statutory  audit  requirement  for  all  exempt   private

companies.    However,  after  receiving  feedback   from

businesses and auditors, the Committee decided  to  adopt

the  approach in UK and Australia, where statutory  audit

is   removed  only  for  small  private  companies.   The

threshold for defining small companies will be  based  on

turnover,  which could be raised over time.   After  much

deliberation,  the  Committee  recommended  removing  the

statutory  audit requirement for exempt private companies

with  annual  turnover below $5 million.  The  Government

has  accepted the Committee's recommendation, but decided

to  implement  it  in  two steps, to  give  the  business

community and the audit firms some time to adjust to  the

new  arrangement.  The prescribed revenue threshold  will

first be set at $2.5 million when this Bill becomes  law,

and raised to $5 million one year later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the public consultation, there were some

concerns  that the removal of statutory audit would  lead

to a deterioration in corporate governance standards.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>

This  should not happen.  For public companies and  large

private   companies,  audit  would  remain  a   statutory

requirement.   For  small exempt  private  companies,  it

makes sense to leave audit as a business decision.  There

is  no  public interest at stake.  In addition,  adequate

safeguards   will   be  put  in  place.    For   example,

shareholders  representing at least 5% of  the  company's

shares   can  compel  the  company  to  prepare   audited

accounts.   All  companies  must  also  maintain   proper

accounting records and prepare "true and fair"  financial

statements   that   comply  with  prescribed   accounting

standards.

<br><br><i>Professionally Qualified Company Secretaries</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, professionally qualified company secretaries.

Another  move  to reduce business cost is to  remove  the

statutory  requirement for private companies  to  appoint

professionally   qualified  company   secretaries.    The

private  company must still appoint a company  secretary,

but  this  person  need  not be a lawyer,  accountant  or

professional company secretary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all companies in Singapore are required

to  appoint a professionally qualified company secretary.

In  contrast, in Australia, Hong Kong and UK, there is no

such  requirement for private companies.  The requirement

in Singapore was instituted in 1987 as a means to improve

the  quality of corporate records of Singapore companies.

While  the  requirement is a useful safeguard for  public

companies, it is not necessary to impose this on  private

companies.  Such companies can choose to have an employee

or director to perform the company secretarial functions.

Alternatively, they can outsource to firms which  provide

company secretarial support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some company secretaries and accountants have

expressed  concerns that the Committee's  recommendations

would  lead  to job losses for company secretarial  firms

and  audit  firms.   The Government is mindful  of  these

concerns.   However, we do not think that the demand  for

services  provided by audit firms and company secretaries

would disappear as a result of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>

these  changes.  According to a survey conducted  by  the

Association  of Small and Medium Enterprises,  more  than

50%  of the companies surveyed indicated that they  would

continue  to  engage  professionally  qualified   company

secretaries, even if the law does not require them to  do

so.   In  addition, 78% of the companies said they  would

continue  to  have  their  accounts  audited,  as   their

shareholders  or  external parties,  such  as  banks  and

finance companies, would require audited accounts.

<br><br><i>Simpler Business Regulations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight some of the amendments that

will help to simplify the regulations faced by companies.

<br><br><i>Written Resolutions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the shareholders of a private company can

pass  a  resolution without having to meet  face-to-face.

However,  the  passing  of  the resolution  requires  the

approval  of  all shareholders.  This is  not  consistent

with  the  approval thresholds for resolutions passed  at

face-to-face  meetings,  where ordinary  resolutions  and

special  resolutions would require 50% and  75%  approval

respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 amends section 184 to allow private

companies  to pass ordinary and special resolutions  with

50%   and   75%  approval,  regardless  of  whether   the

resolutions are passed at a face-to-face meeting  or  via

written  means.   The amendment will also  allow  written

resolutions  to be passed through the use  of  electronic

communication channels, such as email.  This will  enable

private  companies  to make decisions more  expeditiously

and conveniently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safeguard, a shareholder or a group of

shareholders representing at least 5% of the total voting

rights  can  require the company to hold  a  face-to-face

meeting  to discuss and vote on the resolution.  This  is

to   ensure  that  the  company  does  not  use   written

resolutions as a means to deprive dissenting shareholders

of the opportunity to be heard at a face-to-face meeting.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Annual General Meetings</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, private companies are required to hold

annual  general  meetings every year.  Clause  26  amends

section  175 to allow a private company to dispense  with

its annual general meeting if all its shareholders agree.

This  change is consistent with the practice in  the  UK.

It will benefit private companies, especially those where

all the shareholders are also directors.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, company law reform is an on-going process. The review by the Company Legislation and

Regulatory  Framework Committee marks a significant  step

forward,  but  it is not the end.  We need  to  regularly

review  our  laws and regulations to ensure  they  remain

business-friendly and keep up with the practices  in  the

leading  jurisdictions.  Such reviews  will  require  the

collaboration  of the private sector and the  Government,

and the active interest of all stakeholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support

the  provisions  in  the Companies (Amendment)  Bill.   I

welcome  the  various moves which are undertaken  in  the

spirit  of  ensuring that the company law and  regulatory

framework  for Singapore is modern, accords  with  global

standards  and  one  which  will  promote  a  competitive

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this same spirit that I will focus on

the  issue of definition of substantial shareholding  for

compliance  purposes.   The  interpretation  of  the  new

section  83,  as  described in clause 10,  like  the  old

section 83, will continue to have far-reaching effects on

capital markets here, not least of all, our stock market.

Any  over-zealousness, witting or unwitting, to  apply  a

more  conservative  interpretation than  necessary,  will

serve  to  stifle  our  own  stock  market  growth,   and

ultimately  to limit the ability of our listed  companies

to raise capital.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to elaborate. Clause 10 of the Bill

repeals and re-enacts section 83 to require the reporting

of   changes  in  substantial  shareholding   where   the

shareholding  exceeds  discrete 1% threshold,  above  the

minimum 5% threshold, the 5% level being defined as  what

would constitute a substantial shareholding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an improvement from the present position,

which  is, I believe, similar to that being done  in  the

UK.   But,  Sir, this does not address the dilemma  being

faced  by  funds,  particularly big funds,  investing  in

Singapore.  The underlying challenge is one of  the  need

for   international  fund  managers  to   aggregate   the

interests of the various funds which they operate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the approach has been, like in the UK, to

aggregate  shareholdings across all associated  entities,

including funds, within a corporate group.  This approach

requires  review,  especially  in  the  context  of   our

circumstances where our companies are relatively  smaller

in  terms  of  market capitalisation and where  there  is

insufficient breadth of investible companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, international fund managers manage a variety of

funds,    comprising   typically   mutual    funds    and

institutional  funds for which they serve  as  investment

advisors.   These funds are developed for investors  with

varying  needs  and  requirements  subject  to  different

investment   objectives,  time  horizon  guidelines   and

restrictions.  The funds also invest in a wide  range  of

investments,  such as equities, bonds  and  money  market

instruments.   No  two funds within the  same  group  are

identical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real test of control, which is essentially the

underlying focus, is in the voting of shares.   Within  a

corporate  group,  there may be  a  number  of  entities,

including companies, funds and managed investment schemes

which hold voting shares in the same listed company.   In

deciding  how  to  vote  their shares,  the  entity,  for

example, a fund, must act in the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>

interests  of  its members.  This may not necessarily  be

aligned  with the interest of the corporate  group  as  a

whole nor of the other entities within the group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in light of the differing nature of the funds,

shareholdings should not be aggregated across  the  funds

for   the  purposes  of  complying  with  the  disclosure

requirement of substantial shareholding interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight this unsatisfactory treatment in

real  operating terms, to bring home the extent to  which

we   are   imposing  unduly  high  compliance  costs   on

international fund managers investing in Singapore.   One

major fund manager recounted how his group's filings  for

Singapore  accounted  for 17%  of  the  total,  when  the

group's  holdings  represented a mere  1%  of  the  total

exposure.  Another fund manager has a department of  four

individuals  dedicated to ensuring such  compliance,  but

with  no clear idea of what the value-add is.  Of course,

it  can be argued that a similar trend can be drawn  from

the  UK investments.  However, the practical question is:

can these fund managers ignore the UK market?  The answer

is  no.  Can they ignore the Singapore market?  I do  not

think  we should be deluded into thinking that they  have

to be invested in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this is not the only cost. The real cost

is  in  the consequential curtailing of the liquidity  of

our own listed companies and their ability to tap capital

from  a  wider shareholding base.  Investors of Singapore

equities  fight shy of raising exposure in the fear  that

they  may  breach  the  law as a group  even  though  the

decisions are frequently undertaken independently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose that, in instances where

international fund managers acquire listed shares not for

purposes  of  control  and where the  funds  are  managed

separately,  they  be allowed to apply for  an  exemption

from aggregating the interests in respect of funds.  This

can be done on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that we keep pace with changing

market practices.  My proposal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>

should  reduce the compliance burden of the international

fund  managers and result in more meaningful  disclosure.

It  will also go a long way towards enhancing Singapore's

position as a wealth management centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Companies

(Amendment) Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present first instalment of amendments to the

Companies  Act  comes  not long  after  the  Government's

announcement of its adoption of all 77 recommendations of

the Companies Legislation and Regulatory Framework Review

Committee   (CLRFC).    That   it   comes   so    quickly

demonstrates,  to  many  in the business  community,  the

seriousness  of intent on the part of the  Government  in

trying to reform and review the companies regulatory  and

legislative  framework  in Singapore,  just  to  make  it

relevant  and  to help enhance the value  proposition  of

Singapore as a place to do business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, the focus on reducing the cost of

business  in  Singapore could not have  come  at  a  more

appropriate  time.  Against the backdrop  of  an  already

weakened  economy, businesses in Singapore are  presently

bracing  themselves for tougher times ahead.  The effects

of  the deadly SARS virus are beginning to bite hard into

our economy.  Already, we are seeing how people have been

laid off in the airline industry because of poor business

prospects  and  taxi drivers having to  take  home  less,

because of a general public fear of contracting the virus

while riding in a taxi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time like this, any move by the Government to

reduce  cost, and in particular business cost, is welcome

news  indeed.   In this regard, the move  to  change  the

legislative  and  regulatory framework for  companies  in

order to keep business cost low is a positive step in the

right   direction.   For  too  many  years,  businessmen,

especially  those  running small and medium  enterprises,

have been suffering under the weight of rising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>

business  cost and becoming uncompetitive in the process.

It  is  indeed true that every regulatory hurdle that  is

put  in  the  way  of  businessman  is  a  cost  to  him.

Streamlining  our rules and regulations  would  not  only

simplify our compliance procedures but would also help to

bring   down   our   costs   and   hence   increase   our

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud, Sir, the present initiative by the

Government in moving to change our company law  framework

and  regulatory  regime  to make us  more  efficient  and

competitive, I do wonder whether we are doing  enough  by

just  focusing  on the subject so narrowly.   Can  we  do

better?   Sir, we should remember that the issue  of  the

cost  of  business, even from a company law  perspective,

goes  beyond the subject matter of company law.  A review

should  also  cover other similar regulatory  regimes  as

well.   For  instance, we should review the SFA  and  the

listing rules of the Singapore Exchange with the specific

view  of reducing our cost, if that is the intent of  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, you will recall, Sir, that at the

last Committee of Supply sitting, I did mention that  the

listing  rules  in Singapore, while they seek  to  create

greater  transparency in the market place, have  in  some

ways  contributed to the cost of doing business here.   I

am   referring  in  particular  to  quarterly   reporting

requirements  which listed companies  in  Singapore  must

comply  with over time.  I may have mentioned  then  that

many listed companies here find quarterly reporting to be

unduly burdensome and may not be entirely appropriate  in

some cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I did a survey amongst my firm's existing

clients   to  determine  whether  they  agree  with   the

sentiments  as expressed.  In this regard, Sir,  I  would

like  to express my interest in the matter as a solicitor

and   may  have  an  interest  in  the  outcome  of  this

legislation.  All who replied were unanimous  in  telling

me  that  they find quarterly reporting to be burdensome.

In   some  cases,  there  is  very  little  variation  in

information provided from quarter to quarter.  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>

applies   especially   to  property  investment   holding

companies.   I  understand that not all  stock  exchanges

around  the world require quarterly reporting from  their

companies.  It is significant to note that the main board

of   the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  does  not  require

quarterly reporting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did also mention earlier that imposing quarterly

reporting  requirement may affect  our  ability  to  sell

listings  in Singapore as a value proposition.   In  this

regard,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  the

Government   has  come  to  any  decision  on   quarterly

reporting requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quarterly reporting is just one example of how,

in  our  effort  to  be transparent,  we  may  have  gone

overboard.   I  will cite another example.   The  present

practice  in the industry requires companies that  depart

from  the  Code of Corporate Governance to give  detailed

explanations   for  its  departure.    In   the   present

regulatory climate in Singapore, and being afraid of  the

rap  on the knuckle, companies have gone to great lengths

to explain every instance of departure from the corporate

governance code.  Such an undertaking is also thought  to

be  unduly burdensome.  This, unfortunately, demonstrates

the  carrying  out  of the desire to be  transparent  and

accountable  to  the extreme.  You will appreciate,  Sir,

that  every endeavour to comply with the regulations will

come with a price.  In this regard, I would also like  to

ask  the  Minister whether the MAS could issue a  further

directive  to specify the extent to which explanation  is

required  for  not complying with the Code  of  Corporate

Governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary that if we are to

undertake  a  review of the Companies Act to help  reduce

business costs, we should also at the same time undertake

the  review of other relevant legislation and regulations

with the same view in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank

Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua and also Mr Sin Boon  Ann  for  their

contributions.   I  have  a lot  of  sympathy  for  their

approach  and priorities, and let me explain our position

and what we can do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of substantive shareholding which

Mrs Lim raised, currently, an investor holding 5% or more

of  the  voting shares of a listed company has to  notify

the  company  and the SGX of any changes in  shareholding

within two calendar days.  For example, if it moves  from

5.3%  to  5.5%, he has to tell the company and SGX  about

this  0.2%  change.   The aim is to make  sure  that  the

company   and  SGX  are  aware  of  who  the  substantial

shareholders  are  and what are the  movements  in  their

shareholdings.    In  a  takeover  situation,   this   is

important information for everybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computing this shareholding, the investor must

include both his direct interest and his deemed interest.

In  other  words,  he  has  to  aggregate  several  items

together - very likely.  Direct interest is what he holds

himself.  But, if he is in a corporation, deemed interest

will  include  shares held by related  corporations,  eg,

subsidiaries   and  associates.   This   requirement   to

aggregate their direct and deemed interests is similar to

the  practices  in the US, UK, Australia and  Hong  Kong.

So, it is not just the Commonwealth jurisdictions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a rationale, which is to improve the

level of transparency by allowing the company and SGX  to

know  who  exercises effective control over the company's

shares.   Otherwise, you will have a front, a dummy,  and

then  you  operate a wayang kulit from behind,  and  that

causes problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we need proper disclosure, we also recognise

it  is important to reduce the reporting burden for  fund

managers  and  investors.  That is why  we  accepted  the

recommendation to make the changes which are in the  Bill

today:  first,  to require notification  only  when  your

shareholding changes by one percentage point, a  discrete

1% threshold above the minimum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>

5%.  So, if you go from 5.3% to 5.5%, you do not have  to

report.   But if you cross the next threshold,  which  is

6%, then you will have to report, which is like what Hong

Kong  and  the UK are doing.  And instead of two calendar

days,  you  will have two business days.   So,  over  the

weekend, you do not count those days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are minor improvements. But, as Mrs Lim

pointed  out,  there will still be reporting requirements

that  may  still  be  onerous.  So,  we  will  study  her

suggestion to see whether it is feasible for us to exempt

certain  categories of investors and fund  managers  from

the   requirement  to  report  their  direct  and  deemed

interests.   We will have to study it, because  it  is  a

grey area.  There are reasons why we want to know who the

substantial  shareholders are.  For sensitive  companies,

there  may  be  a  double reason.   But  even  for  other

companies, we must have an effective definition  and  one

that   is   not   too   difficult  and  whose   reporting

requirements are not too burdensome.  But we  will  study

this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann raised two questions:</b> one, on

quarterly reporting, whether we have made any decision on

amending  this.  He had raised this in the  Committee  of

Supply and I had promised to look into the matter,  which

I have done, and he has kindly given me the response from

his survey of his own clients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarterly reporting will enhance Singapore's

transparency  and standing as a world-class business  and

financial  centre.   As  we move  to  a  disclosure-based

regime,  it  becomes more important for investors  to  be

informed  more  frequently of the progress  of  publicly-listed  companies.   Developed  economies  like  the  EU,

Canada,  US  and  Japan, and also some  developing  Asian

economies like China, India, Malaysia and Thailand,  have

all  implemented  quarterly reporting  for  their  listed

companies.   We introduced mandatory quarterly  reporting

for  listed  companies  from 1st  January  this  year  to

further  improve Singapore's transparency and  disclosure

standards.  But quarterly reporting does impose  cost  on

companies, particularly the smaller ones.  And it is  not

just the financial aspects, but also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>

a  significant amount of management attention is required

to  prepare  the  quarterly statements to  the  necessary

standards   for  public  release.   And  these   can   be

burdensome,  especially  when  business  conditions   are

difficult and profits are down.  Considering the  current

conditions,  it makes sense to defer quarterly  reporting

for  some  smaller  companies to help them  reduce  their

business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, listed companies with a market

capitalisation  above  $20 million  are  required  to  do

quarterly  reporting for financial years  starting  after

1st   January  2003.   Companies  that  fall  below  this

threshold have been given a 1-year deferment.  They  will

start  quarterly reporting for financial  years  starting

1st January 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to make the following changes to the

quarterly    reporting    requirement.     The     market

capitalisation threshold will be raised from $20  million

to  $75  million,  based on the 31st  March  2003  market

capitalisation  data published by SGX.  This  will  defer

quarterly   reporting  for  about  half   the   mainboard

companies and nearly all the Sesdaq companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, quarterly reporting will also be deferred

for   a   newly-listed  company,  if   its   IPO   market

capitalisation is $75 million or below.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will review the quarterly reporting

requirement for these smaller companies in mid-2005.   We

will  review it and we will decide at that point what  to

do.   Thus, quarterly reporting for these companies  will

be  deferred  by  at least three years, compared  to  the

larger companies.  SGX will be implementing these changes

with immediate effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Code of Corporate Governance, Mr Sin asked

whether  the requirement for listed companies to  provide

an  extensive explanation in their annual reports for any

deviation from the Code is unduly burdensome.   The  Code

contains 15 principles and 55 guidelines.  The guidelines

serve to illustrate and elaborate on the principles.  The

companies  are encouraged to comply with the  guidelines,

as they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>

good  corporate  governance  practices.   But  these  are

guidelines, not requirements.  Nor do we intend companies

to  publish pages of detailed legalistic explanations  of

their  corporate  governance practices,  as  some  listed

companies  have done in their annual reports  this  year.

So,  to  explain why you did not comply, you  would  have

another long turgid small-print document.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in their annual reports, companies should

focus on how they have applied the principles of the Code

which  embody its spirit, rather than the many individual

guidelines.   They should, however, disclose and  explain

any  deviation from the guidelines, which is  similar  to

the  disclosure obligations in jurisdictions like the  UK

and  Australia.  But it is up to the companies to  decide

how  detailed their corporate governance statements  need

to  be.   The  market  will judge  the  quality  of  each

company's disclosures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this approach, SGX will not routinely review

and   query   the   contents  of   corporate   governance

disclosures  in their companies' annual reports,  but  it

may act, if it receives a complaint, a tip-off, or if  it

has cause to suspect that a company has not complied with

the  listing  rules or if there is a false or  misleading

disclosure.  This approach is consistent with the move to

a disclosure-based regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if companies understand that this is a guide,

and  they put into their annual report a statement  which

they  judge appropriate as to how they have complied with

it  and  where they have not complied with  it,  that  is

sufficient.   We will not, for example, go and  ask  them

why  the  explanation for item No. 53 out of 55 items  is

not  long  and  detailed enough.  I hope  that  makes  it

clear.   I think the SGX also would be very relieved  not

to   have   to   burden   itself  with   these   detailed

supervisions, and these moves should make it easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that, in order for the regulators to be

able to supervise the system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>

sensitively,  we need to have good feedback  from  people

and  from  companies for us to know what is  working  and

what  is not, what is tiresome without serving a purpose,

and  what  is just form without substance.   It  is  very

difficult for the regulator on his own to get this  feel.

We   will   try  our  best,  but  we  are  not  ourselves

practising.   We  are  regulating  or  supervising.   So,

unless   the  participants  are  willing  to   speak   up

effectively and forcefully and press their point, and  if

they  are  not heard the first time, to try  again,  then

sometimes we may not get their message and we may end  up

with an outcome which does not really work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these two cases, the matters have been discussed.

There  has been feedback, the matters were debated,  some

adjustments  were made but, actually, further adjustments

were   necessary  because  I  think  the  situation   was

changing, and the business conditions change.  When  this

happens, it is incumbent on the participants, the  people

who  are affected, to speak up and let us know.  And,  as

we  have said many times in Parliament and elsewhere, you

have  to  have the confidence to speak up and  not  worry

that  if  you speak up you may be blackmarked or  knocked

down or some other thing may befall you.  Because if  you

do  not speak up, then we would not know and it would not

be fixed.  So, we have to have that mutual confidence and

rapport  and,  if  one  avenue  does  not  work,  to  try

different avenues.  Finally, we may or may not agree, but

I  think  it  is important that the issues  have  a  full

airing  and the decision is a considered one, taking  all

views and all facts into account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for hearing  out

the people in industry and making the necessary changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the other point about explanations

for  departures from the corporate governance code, would

the Deputy Prime Minister not agree with me that part  of

the  reason why people have gone to the other extreme  of

giving detailed explanation is because they fear

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>

the  heavy hand of the regulator?  What the Deputy  Prime

Minister has just said earlier was that you leave  it  to

people  to  form their own judgment as to the appropriate

level of disclosure and explanation and they will have to

justify afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will take a while in the engagement

between  the regulator and the people concerned  to  find

the appropriate level that they are comfortable with.  In

the  interim,  until such a comfort level is established,

can the MAS give the assurance that there will be a light-handed   and   light-touch  approach  in  enforcing   the

regulations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We have said so many times, but

<div align="center"><b>STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill collates a number of minor amendments

to several Acts. They are mostly technical amendments but

let me highlight the key ones.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Arbitration Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 3 amends the Arbitration Act to

empower  the  High  Court  of  Singapore  to  enforce  an

arbitral  award  irrespective of  whether  the  place  of

arbitration  is  Singapore or elsewhere.  This  amendment

was recommended by the Legal Services Working Group under

the  Economic Review Sub-Committee on Service  Industries

and is modelled after the UK and Hong Kong legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of our drive to make Singapore an

international arbitration hub, we want to attract  people

to  conduct their arbitrations in Singapore. For this  to

happen,  it is important that arbitration awards made  in

Singapore  are enforceable in whatever country assets  in

question  are found.  This is not a problem for countries

that  are  parties to the New York Convention, where  any

signatory  country's awards can be enforced in any  other

signatory  country. Singapore is a signatory country,  as

are most other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises when awards from Singapore are to

be  enforced  in a non-New York Convention  country.   In

such  cases,  there  is  no automatic  recognition  of  a

Singapore award by that country.  However, many of  these

countries  have  laws that allow recognition  of  foreign

arbitral   awards  on  a  reciprocal  basis.   Thus,   if

Singapore   is  able  to  recognise  awards  from   these

countries,  they  will  likewise  recognise  awards  from

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this amendment to make it possible for

foreign  awards  that  cannot currently  be  enforced  in

Singapore  to  be enforced here.  There will  not  be  an

automatic right to enforcement, as the leave of our  High

Court  will be required.  Of course, this does  not  mean

that  the Court will automatically grant leave to enforce

foreign  awards in all cases.  The award  must  first  be

subject  to  the  requirements in section 46(1),  namely,

that  there must be an agreement by the parties to submit

the  dispute  to  arbitration and the  award  must  be  a

decision  on  the  substance of the dispute  made  by  an

arbitral   tribunal.   For  example,  the   Courts   have

developed  rules for the enforcement of foreign judgments

and  arbitration awards, and similar principles would  be

considered by a Court in deciding whether to grant leave.

Thus, leave to enforce an award may not be granted if the

person  against  whom it is sought to be  enforced  shows

that    the    arbitral   tribunal   lacked   substantive

jurisdiction  to make the award, or that the  enforcement

of  the award would be contrary to public policy.   Also,

if  the  composition of the arbitral tribunal is  not  in

accordance with the agreement of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>

parties or the applicable arbitration law, the Court  may

decline to enforce the award.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Business Registration Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Business Registration Act. Section 22 of

the Act currently makes it an offence for an undischarged

bankrupt  to  take  part  in  or  be  concerned  in   the

management  of  any business required  to  be  registered

under that Act without the leave of the High Court or the

written permission of the Official Assignee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends the Act by extending the existing

law  to  cover  persons who are adjudicated  bankrupt  in

another  jurisdiction.  Such a person will also  have  to

seek  the leave of the High Court or permission from  the

Official  Assignee  before  he  can  take  part  in   the

management  of  any business required  to  be  registered

under the Business Registration Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment was proposed following a case

where  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  was  unable  to

prosecute  a  person  as he was adjudicated  bankrupt  in

another  jurisdiction.   This amendment  will  bring  the

Business Registration Act in line with section 148 of the

Companies Act.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Prisons Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 12 amends the Prisons Act to address an

existing  uncertainty.   Prisons  Department  has  always

given  one-third  remission for sentences  for  prisoners

serving  imprisonment  in default  of  payment  of  fine,

although it is not clear from section 224 of the Criminal

Procedure  Code  that  such  prisoners  are  entitled  to

remission.   This amendment will make it clear  that  the

Minister  for Home Affairs can make regulations  relating

to  the granting of remission in respect of sentences  of

imprisonment  and imprisonment in default of  payment  of

fine.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Amendments to enhance District Court's sentencing power</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 16, read with the Schedule, amends the

Acts  listed  in  the  first column of  the  Schedule  to

empower  the  District Courts to impose the full  penalty

prescribed under these Acts. Such empowering is not  new.

It is already found in many other Acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there have been cases where the

District  Courts have found that the merits of  the  case

warranted the maximum punishment provided under the Acts.

However,  they  were  unable to mete out  the  punishment

beyond  that  provided under the Criminal Procedure  Code

(or  CPC).   In  particular, under the CPC, the  District

Court  can only impose a fine of up to $10,000 while  the

maximum  fines provided in many of the Acts range between

$20,000 and $250,000.  This amendment will therefore give

the   District  Courts  the  flexibility  to  impose  the

appropriate punishment up to the maximum allowable  under

the Acts.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Land Acquisition Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 8 amends the Land Acquisition Act to

allow the Collector of Land Revenue to waive, in suitable

cases,  the  need for appellants to deposit security  for

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such deposits are required whenever appeals are

made  to the Appeals Board against a compensation  award.

The  deposits  will be used to satisfy the costs  in  the

event  that  the  Board  makes an  order  awarding  costs

against  the  appellant.  Currently, the Act  requires  a

deposit  equivalent to one-third the amount of the  award

or  $5,000, whichever is lower.  However, there have been

cases  in  the past where the deposits are of such  small

amounts that it does not make sense to collect them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will allow the Collector to waive

such  deposits in cases where the amount is insignificant

and  relieve  the  Appeals Board from the  administrative

task  of  maintaining  the  accounts  for  such  deposits

collected.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Payment and Settlement Systems (Finality

and Netting) Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 11 amends the Payment and Settlement

Systems  (Finality  and  Netting)  Act  to  empower   the

Monetary  Authority  of Singapore  to  compound  offences

under  that  Act  that  are  prescribed  as  compoundable

offences.   This  is to move away from prosecuting  every

breach  of  the provisions by offering the  offenders  an

opportunity to compound the breaches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 also amends the same Act to confer

jurisdiction on District Courts to try any offence  under

that Act and to impose the full penalty or punishment  in

respect of the offences.

<br><br><i>Miscellaneous amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to wrap up, let me take the

House briefly through the remaining key provisions of the

Bill  which  are  in  the nature of  facilitating  better

administration of the Acts in question.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Interpretation Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 2 amends the definition of

"prescribed" in the Interpretation Act to facilitate  the

use   of   electronic   forms   in   appropriate   cases.

Regulations often prescribe forms to be used for  various

processes or applications.  The amendment will allow such

forms  to be made available on websites, rather  than  be

printed  in the Regulations themselves.  This is in  line

with the move towards more electronic communications  and

transactions, as well as increasing e-Government.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Companies Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends the Companies Act to require the

liquidator  of a company that has been wound up  to  keep

the relevant books and papers of the company for a period

of 2 years instead of 5 years as is presently the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will relieve the burden on liquidators to

maintain the books of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>

company after dissolution, and will avoid further storage

costs  upon  dissolution.  So  far,  there  has  been  no

request  to  inspect  the books of a  company  after  the

winding up order has been made.

<br><br><i>Amendments  to  the  Mutual  Benefit  Organisations  Act,

Societies Act and Trade Unions Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10, 14 and 15 amend the Mutual Benefit

Organisations Act, the Societies Act and the Trade Unions

Act  respectively  to substitute all  references  to  the

Official Assignee with the Official Receiver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Official Receiver deals with the winding up

of  companies, he would be the more appropriate authority

to   deal   with   the  winding  up  of  mutual   benefit

organisations, societies and trade unions rather than the

Official   Assignee   who  deals   with   bankruptcy   of

individuals.   The  amendment  will  allow  the  Official

Receiver  to apply the same powers that he has under  the

Companies Act in the winding up of a company.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Public Trustee Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends the Public Trustee Act to allow the

Minister  to  assign to the Public Trustee functions  and

duties  relating to victims of motor accidents and  their

claims  to  compensation.  This will  enable  the  Public

Trustee  to  handle  duties  such  as  administering  the

agreement  between the Government and the Motor Insurance

Bureau  relating  to the compensation of  motor  accident

victims.

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Bankruptcy Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends the Bankruptcy Act to clarify that a

private  trustee  does  not have the  power  to  issue  a

certificate of annulment where a composition is  accepted

by  the creditors or where a proved debt and the expenses

of  the  bankruptcy  have been fully paid.   Such  powers

should  only  be exercised by the Official  Assignee.   A

private  trustee  who feels that an annulment  should  be

made could refer the matter to the Official Assignee  for

consideration.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Civil Service College Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is a minor technical amendment to the Civil

Service  College  Act to effect a change  in  terminology

from  the existing "Board of Governors" to the "Board  of

Directors".

<br><br><i>Amendment to the Moneylenders Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 9 amends the Moneylenders Act

by  deleting  the information that is currently  required

for  the  proof  of  a  debt due to  a  moneylender,  and

providing  instead for such information to be  prescribed

by  rules made under the Bankruptcy Act.  This is to give

more  flexibility and clarity to the process of  defining

requirements for proving a debt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Land Titles Act to provide

the legal framework necessary to implement Singapore Land

Authority's Electronic Lodgement System (or ELS).  It was

drafted  in  consultation  with the  relevant  Government

agencies and statutory boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight the main changes to the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will allow the electronic lodgement of

documents  affecting  land to update  the  land  register

through electronic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>

means;  namely,  the  Internet (clause  4).  The  current

framework  of  the  Act only allows manual  lodgement  of

documents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are clear benefits in switching to ELS.

Let  me cite some examples.  Lawyers using ELS will  save

on  manpower and transportation costs, as there  will  be

fewer  trips  to SLA for lodgement.  There will  also  be

lower  incidence  of  documentation  data  errors,  which

attracts additional fees.  The new system has an in-built

automated checking mechanism that will assist lawyers  in

their preparation of documents by minimising data errors.

Also,  lawyers will be able to offer better  services  to

their clients through more effective case management, for

example,  by checking their accounts with SLA  concerning

lodgement fees and the status of their lodged documents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finally, Sir, they will also be able to use

value-added  services such as being alerted  to  expiring

caveats  which  will help to ensure that  their  clients'

interests are not left unprotected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land registry's perspective, ELS will do

away with the need to re-key data at the SLA's end as the

data  is  transmitted from the lodging party.  This  will

effectively   ensure   almost  100%   accuracy   of   the

information  captured.  This will  better  safeguard  the

integrity  of  the  land  register  and  enhance   public

confidence in land dealings in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the types of documents that can be lodged

electronically,  for  a  start,  when   the   system   is

implemented, only caveats, writs of execution and  orders

of   court  can  be  lodged  electronically.   These  are

documents  that do not pass title to the  land  from  the

registered  owner  to  another person.   Other  types  of

documents  will still need to be submitted physically  to

SLA even after the electronic format of the documents has

been transmitted to SLA via ELS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we are limiting the application

of  ELS  to  these  documents is because  the  Electronic

Transactions  Act does not apply to documents  that  pass

title in immovable property.  As land is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>

probably  the  most valuable asset to most  Singaporeans,

there  are concerns in extending the application  of  the

Electronic Transactions Act to land documents  that  pass

title  or  interest from the landowner to other  parties.

Nevertheless,  these land documents  will  still  benefit

from ELS because the priority of their lodgement will  be

secured  at  the  point  in time  when  their  electronic

formats are transmitted to SLA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, also, the Bill will enable the Registrar to

dispense with proof of execution of documents.   At  law,

execution  of  land  documents has  to  be  witnessed  by

someone other than a party to the document.  This  is  to

prevent  any  doubts  being  raised  subsequently  as  to

whether  the  document  was  properly  executed  by   the

parties.  Given the nature of the documents covered under

ELS, which do not pass title, we have decided to dispense

with   attestation.   This  amendment   will   not   only

facilitate easy usage of ELS, but also obviate  increased

business costs of arranging for witnesses to sign  either

electronically or by way of digital cards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will also deal with the execution of

companies.  Currently, the Bill provides for companies to

execute  by  way  of  affixing the  common  seal  in  the

presence  of  two  of its officers.   In  the  electronic

environment,  this  will not be possible.   Instead,  the

Bill  will  allow the Registrar to prescribe  such  other

acceptable  manner  of execution.   One  such  manner  of

execution  would  be  for them to execute  the  documents

through their authorised officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, this Bill will help Singapore to

achieve  its vision of implementing eGovernment services,

wherever  possible,  to  ensure  easy  accessibility   of

Government services via the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to seek a

clarification  on clauses 13 and 14 which  are  to  amend

sections  161 and 164 of the Act.  The original  sections

161(1) and 164(1) of the Act allow the public access

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>

to  the  Land Register and to obtain a certified copy  of

any document lodged with it upon payment of a fee.  These

sections  will be amended to allow the public  to  search

and  obtain  a copy of such electronic documents  as  the

Registrar  shall  determine.  This  means  that  not  all

electronically  lodged documents can be accessed  by  the

public.   My  question is: which are the  documents  that

will  no  longer be available for public inspection,  and

why  is  there a need to limit public access  to  certain

documents  which  will result in less  information  being

available to the public?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I understand it,

it  is  not the purpose of this amendment to limit public

access to the documents but rather to save public time in

checking.   Also,  possibly, because  of  the  electronic

environment,   the  clause  gives  flexibility   to   the

Registrar to protect the integrity of the database.  Just

in  case there is a need to limit, there is the power  to

do so, but the intention is not to limit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification. If the

intention is not to limit, but the amendment states  that

the  Registrar will now determine what kind of  documents

will be available, is it not clear enough to say that  it

is  to limit?  The Bill says that it is to limit.   So  I

wonder  why  impose such a limit and give  the  Registrar

such  a  power to determine what document to release  and

not  to release.  So where is the right of the public for

information in the database?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I said, Sir, we are

doing  this in phases.  The important thing is to protect

the  databases.   So,  in terms of even  how  the  public

accesses  the documents, it is better to give the  powers

to  the  Registrar  to implement any steps  that  may  be

needed, for example, to ensure the identity of the public

accessing the documents.  I think it is good to give  the

Registrar  these  powers,  which  can  be  exercised,  if

necessary.   But  the intention is not  to  limit  public

access,  but  for him to ensure that whoever accesses  it

will  not,  for  example, corrupt or abuse the  database.

This  is  a  technical point.  If Mr  Low  wants  further

clarification, this can be sent to him.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Senior Minister

of State agree - and this puzzles me - that these are two

different  issues?   How  do  you  prevent  people   from

accessing  the database to try to do something  funny  to

it,  damage  the  database, and  to  restrict  access  to

certain documents?  I do not understand why they have  to

be together.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, like I said, what is

important  is to clarify the policy intent.   The  policy

intent  is  not  to  restrict whatever  level  of  public

accessibility  that is currently enjoyed.   That  is  the

main  point.  I think that is the point Mr Low is  trying

to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS INVOLVING CYCLISTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs in the last five years, what is the  number

of  (i)  cyclists involved in traffic accidents and  (ii)

cyclists who died from the accidents.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cyclists involved in traffic accidents

rose from 266 in 1998 to 363 in 2002. However, the number

of    fatalities   involving   cyclists   has    remained

consistently fewer than 20 per year for the same  period.

Table  1  shows  the  breakdown of cyclists  involved  in

traffic accidents for the period 1998 - 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Under the Road Traffic (Bicycle) Exemption

Rules,  a bicycle is defined to mean a pedal bicycle  and

includes pedal tricycles and trishaws.  The figures above

reflect  the number of accidents and fatalities involving

bicycles, trishaws and tricycles.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the rise in the number of cyclists

involved   in  accidents,  the  Traffic  Police  conducts

regular  talks  and exhibitions on safe  cycling  habits.

For  example,  a  total  of 237  road  safety  talks  and

exhibitions,  including a segment on safe  cycling,  were

conducted  last  year.  These talks and  exhibitions  are

conducted  at  primary and secondary  schools,  community

centres and SAF camps, and have reached out to more  than

92,000 pupils, SAF personnel and members of the public.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Traffic Police also conducted 232

sessions  of the Shell Traffic Game training at the  East

Coast  Road  Safety  Community Park.  These  primary  and

secondary   school  pupils  were  put  through  practical

lessons  on  safe  cycling and taught basic  rules  while

cycling on the road.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talks and exhibitions on safe cycling cover safe

cycling tips, such as wearing protective gear, and taking

extra care when approaching road junctions. The talks and

exhibitions  also cover basic do's and  don'ts,  such  as

using   hand   signals  and  not  cycling  on  pedestrian

pavements.   The Traffic Police will continue to  educate

cyclists  and  other road users, including motorists,  on

safe cycling. Road safety is everyone's business.
