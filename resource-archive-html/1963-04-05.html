The following Member has, under the provisions of

subsection (2)  (g)  of section 42 of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, obtained from

the Speaker, permission to be or to remain absent from

sittings of the Assembly:-

<br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Geylang West), Minister for Education - from 7th to 15th April, 1963.

<div align="center"><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a Ministerial Statement be taken before

Questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that Members of the House are aware

that there are a number of questions on the Order Paper

today  which  seek  to enquire into the  constitutional

arrangements  between Singapore and the Federation.  It

is  therefore  appropriate and cogent  that  the  Prime

Minister  makes a report to this House on the  progress

of the talks which have been made so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a Ministerial Statement be taken before

Questions.

<div align="center"><b>PROGRESS REPORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR SINGAPORE IN FEDERATION OF MALAYSIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHITE PAPER CMD. 33 OF 1961</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have to report to the House on the progress that

has  been made in working out the form of words for the

constitutional   provisions  for   Singapore   in   the

Federation   of   Malaysia  in  accordance   with   the

provisions contained in White Paper Cmd, 33 of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



1961 and as amplified or amended in formal exchanges of

letters  between  the  Federation  Prime  Minister  and

myself. I am making this Statement before answering the

several  questions that have been tabled in order  that

when I come to answer these questions, Members can  see

the issues against a wider perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the White Paper and the formal exchanges of

letters  were  all  finalised  in  November  1961,  the

working party of officials did not start meeting  until

5th December last year. This was because the Federation

officials  were  occupied with the  Sabah  and  Sarawak

negotiations  and  they wanted  to  complete  the  main

framework  of  the  Borneo  side  before  tackling  the

details of the Singapore side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team of officials, which consisted of the State

Advocate-General,  the  Permanent  Secretary   to   the

Ministry  of Home Affairs (Mr Stewart), the  Permanent

Secretary, Finance Division (Mr Howe Yoon Chong),  the

Acting  Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of National

Development   (Mr  Sim  Kee  Boon)  and  the   Cabinet

Secretary (Mr Wong Chooi Sen), met the Federation team

on  22  occasions  from  5th December,  1962,  to  14th

February   this   year.  They  reached  agreement   and

submitted   joint  recommendations  on  most   of   the

provisions  to be incorporated in the new  Constitution

of  the  Federation of Malaysia and  of  the  State  of

Singapore.  However,  on  a  number  of  points   which

included   banking,  insurance,  shipping,  navigation,

broadcasting, television, constitutional guarantees and

finance,  the  Federation and the  Singapore  teams  of

officials were unable to reach agreement. These matters

were  therefore  referred  to  the  Ministers.  Plenary

meetings of Ministers and officials took place on three

occasions - 28th February and 1st March in Kuala Lumpur,

21st  and  22nd March in Kuala Lumpur and 2nd April  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report that except for finance nearly

all  the  points left unresolved by the official  teams

have now been agreed. There remain only a few points to

be tidied up by the draftsmen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



One of them is the question of Singapore retaining day-to-day  control  of  programmes and  administration  of

broadcasting  and  television whilst following  overall

Federal policy. A special constitutional agreement  may

have  to  be  drawn  up to spell  out  the  rights  and

obligations of the State Government of Singapore vis-a-vis the Federal Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the spelling out of State autonomy

with   the   consequential  provision  that   Malaysian

citizens  who are also Singapore citizens  cannot  have

double  enjoyment  of  both State autonomy  in  matters

like  education  and labour and at the same  time  have

full  enjoyment of education and labour rights  in  the

other States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but by no means least remain the financial

arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to report to the House in brief

and broad outline the points that have been agreed.  At

our first plenary meeting of Ministers on 28th February

and  1st  March, the important questions of acquisition

and  deprivation  of  citizenship were  discussed.  All

Singapore citizens will become citizens of Malaysia  by

operation of law. The Federal Government shall have the

power  over  acquisition  of Singapore  citizenship  by

naturalization  after Malaysia. All  such  acquisitions

shall   be   with   the  agreement  of  the   Singapore

Government.  There shall be a provision in  the  Second

Schedule of the Federal Constitution to the effect that

the  Singapore  Government  must  be  informed  of  all

acquisitions of citizenship by naturalization  approved

by  the  Federal  Government. The Singapore  Government

will,  however,  retain power over the  acquisition  of

citizenship  by  registration. As these  citizens  will

automatically become Malaysian citizens,  it  shall  be

the  responsibility  of  the  Singapore  Government  to

inform  the  Federal Government of all acquisitions  by

registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deprivations of citizenship are on national

considerations, and hence the Federal Government  shall

have power of deprivation on all grounds. The Singapore

Government should have the right to deprive on  grounds

of fraud



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



on  the  State  or  under  Article  25  (1)   (c)   on  a

conviction. There will also be a provision  in  section

10  of  the Second Schedule of the Federal Constitution

to  the  effect  that  both the Federal  and  Singapore

Governments   should  keep  each  other   informed   of

deprivations  of Singapore citizenship on all  grounds.

The  Federal Constitution should contain the  following

provision:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A citizen of Singapore shall by virtue of such

citizenship be a citizen of Malaysia;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A citizen of Singapore who renounces his

citizenship  of  Singapore except  on  acquiring

citizenship of Malaysia by registration  in  one

of  the other States shall cease to be a citizen

of  Malaysia  and  shall not,  except  with  the

approval  of the Federal Government, be eligible

for registration as a citizen of Malaysia or  of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Birth or residence in Singapore will count for

the purpose of acquiring citizenship of Malaysia

through citizenship of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Federal Government would have exclusive

authority     to     grant    citizenship     by

naturalization, but in the case of a  person  to

be  naturalized  as a citizen of Singapore  only

with    the   concurrence   of   the   Singapore Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The Federal Government would have authority to

deprive persons of Malaysian citizenship on  all

grounds;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Deprivation or renunciation of Malaysian

citizenship  of  a  citizen of  Singapore  would

involve loss of Singapore citizenship; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) A person who has renounced or been deprived of

his  Malaysian citizenship would not be eligible

to  be  registered  as  a citizen  of  Singapore

except   with   the  approval  of  the   Federal Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Constitution will contain the following

provisions  which  could  not be  amended  or  modified

without the approval of the Federal Parliament:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Citizenship of Singapore by birth;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Citizenship of Singapore by descent;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Citizenship of Singapore by registration of

citizens of Malaysia who are not citizens of Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Citizenship of Singapore by registration of

persons resident in Singapore on Merger Day with the

agreement of the Federal Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Citizenship of Singapore by registration on

marriage;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Citizenship of Singapore by registration of

minors;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) Renunciation of citizenship of Singapore; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) Deprivation of citizenship of Singapore on

the grounds of fraud, mistake and conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a subsequent meeting, it was also agreed that the

Government  shall for a period of two  years  after

Malaysia  Day have the power to deprive  anyone  of

Singapore citizenship on any grounds provided  such

grounds  arose before Malaysia Day. This  provision

will  take  care  of all pending and  future  cases

which come to light after Malaysia Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of acquisitions and grants or deprivations

of  citizenship should be common to the Federation  and

Singapore. Provision should be made to ensure that  the

Federal and Singapore Governments would keep each other

informed  of all grants and deprivations of citizenship

on all grounds. It has been agreed that there should be

no  relaxation in the Federal or Singapore  immigration

laws before Merger Day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt in some detail on this question of citizenship as I am quite sure Members of this House and the people outside will be happy to know that all their rights as citizens of Singapore and later as citizens of Malaysia will be duly protected in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference of Rulers: Article 38 of the Conference of

Rulers  will be amended to refer to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara and the Prime Minister of Singapore in the  same

manner  as the Governors and Chief Ministers of Malacca

and Penang respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power of Pardon: The Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the

Prime  Minister of Singapore will have the same  powers

of  pardon under Article 42 as the Governors and  Chief

Ministers of Malacca and Penang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal Legislature: There will be consequential

amendments  to Article 14 to provide that  citizens  of

Singapore  may stand for election only in Singapore  to

the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extent of Federal and State laws and subject matter

of  Federal  and State laws (Articles 74 and  77):  The

provisions  of  the  Ninth Schedule  will  have  to  be

amended  in  its application to Singapore in accordance

with  the Annexure as amended to the heads of agreement

for merger of Singapore and the Federation as contained

in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification of Articles 83 to 87 and Article 88:

There   should  be  a  provision  in  Article  88   for

modification in the application of Articles 83 to 87 to

Singapore in the same manner as Penang and Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 91: The National Land Council should be

amended  in  its  application to  Singapore  so  as  to

provide that any policy formulated should not apply  to

Singapore  without  the concurrence  of  the  Singapore

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 92: The national development plan should be

amended  in  its  application to  Singapore  so  as  to

provide  that  the concurrence of the State  Government

will  be  required  in respect of any development  plan

which  the  Federal Government proposes should  be  put

into operation in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 95A-National Council for Local Government:

The last phrase of Article 95A (5)  which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... and State Governments shall follow the policy so

formulated.',



<br><br>shall not apply to Singapore until such

time as the Federation Government with the concurrence

of the Singapore Legislative Assembly otherwise

provides. The representative of the Singapore State

will participate in the Council as a member without

vote until such time as the State has accepted

obligation to follow the advice formulated by the

Council under Article 95A (5) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 95A (5) should apply to Singapore and the

Singapore   Government  should  consult  the   National

Council   for   Local  Government   on   any   proposed

legislation dealing with local government. It is agreed

that  if and when Singapore agrees to be bound  by  the

decisions  of either the National Land Council  or  the

National  Council for Local Government and consequently

becomes  a voting member of the Council, the number  of

Federal  representatives may be increased  to  preserve

the existing balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 107 - Reports of Auditor General - should be

amended  to include "to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  in

relation  to  the  accounts of the State  in  the  same

manner as the present States of the Federation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 113 - Conduct of Elections - should apply to

Singapore  in respect of Federal elections  subject  to

necessary  transitional  arrangements  for  the   first

elections of the 15 representatives of Singapore to the

first Parliament of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviews of constituencies - the period of review as set

out  in Article 113 (2)  should continue to obtain after

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to vote - At the plenary meeting on the 21st

and  22nd  of  March, it was agreed  that  Article  119

should be amended to provide that citizens of Singapore

may   vote   only  in  Singapore  with  the  reciprocal

provision  that  citizens  of  Malaysia  who  are   not

Singapore citizens may vote only outside Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other matters relating to the judiciary, the courts

and  the  State Advocate-General's Chambers  were  also

agreed. They will all become Singapore branches of  the

Pan-Malaysian Federal Judicial and Legal Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed that the definition of "Malay" is

to  include Singapore Malays. The definition of "Malay"

in  Article 160 (2)  of the Federal Constitution will be

amended  by deleting the word "Merdeka" in the  present

definition and substituting therefor the word  "Merger"

or "Malaysia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 152 - National Language: Until the Singapore

Legislative   Assembly  otherwise  provides,   English,

Mandarin  and  Tamil  languages  may  be  used  in  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly only in addition to  the

National Language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other legal and technical matters relating to the

succession of property - Articles 166, 167, 169  of  the

Constitution - were also agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too Article 162 regarding existing laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So also Article 168 on legal proceedings and Article

173 on pending appeals to the Privy Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last plenary meeting in Singapore on the 2nd of

April, questions of fundamental rights were settled. It

was agreed that on fundamental liberties, the following

fundamental liberties in the Federal Constitution shall

be extended to Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 5 (Liberty of the person), Article 6 (Slavery

and  forced  labour prohibited), Article 7  (Protection

against   retrospective  criminal  laws  and   repeated

trials),  Article 8 (1) , equality before  the  law  and

protection of the law. Articles 8 (2)  and 12 (1)  should

be  modified  in  their application to Singapore  after

merger  to  enable the Singapore Government to  provide

for   the  advancement  of  Malays  in  Singapore.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to pause there and  explain

this.   Under   the  Federation  Constitution   it   is

unconstitutional  to discriminate in  education  policy

between  Malays and other races. However, in  Singapore

we have at present a policy which does discriminate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



between Malays and other races in favour of the Malays,

giving  them  free secondary and university  education,

and  therefore, Article 8 (2)  and Article 12  (1)   will

have  to he amended in order to allow this practice  to

continue. Article 8 (3) - no discrimination in favour  of

subject  of  the Ruler of any State. Article  8  (4) - no

discrimination  by  any public authority.  Article  11 -

Freedom of religion; Article 13 - Rights of property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 (1), which prohibits banishment of any

citizen, shall apply in Singapore. The same applies  to

freedom  of movement under Article 9 (2); but  subject,

in  respect  of  Singapore, to  the  proviso  that  the

Central   Government  may,  if  it   so   desires,   by

legislation in respect of labour or education or  other

matters  in  which Singapore citizens  enjoy  autonomy,

prevent  the double enjoyment of both rights  of  State

autonomy in Singapore and again full enjoyment of equal

rights  with  other Malaysian citizens  in  respect  of

labour and education again in the other States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other legal technical matters concerning navigation,

shipping, banking, insurance, have all now been  agreed

and  they  will remain as listed in the White Paper  as

concurrent   rights.  In  other  words,  administrative

powers  and  legislative powers will be with  Singapore

with  over-riding  legislative powers  in  the  Federal

Parliament. It has also been agreed on the 2nd of April

that, first, the provisions of Article 153 relating  to

education  should not apply to Singapore after  merger.

That  is  in order to allow us to continue giving  free

education  to Malays. At the same time, it  was  agreed

that  on application of Article 153 to Singapore  after

merger,  the following conditions will apply. In  other

words,  first,  no  proportion of posts  in  a  Federal

Public  Service  in  Singapore  will  be  reserved  for

Malays;  second,  recruitment in Singapore  to  Federal

Public  Services  will  be  open  to  all  citizens  of

Malaysia;  and  three,  no  proportion  of  permits  or

licences for the operation of any trade or business  in

Singapore  will be reserved for Malays; and  four,  the

definition of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



"Malays" for purposes of Article 153 will be amended to

include Singapore Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Mr Speaker, Sir, this means that Malays in

Singapore  will continue to enjoy their special  rights

as   at  present  with  particular  reference  to  free

education  from  primary school to university  and,  if

they  choose  to  go  to the other States,  will  enjoy

special  rights as for Malays there. In  this  way,  we

have  been  able  to  maintain the  principle  of  free

competition in Singapore for employment in  the  public

services  and  for businesses like taxi  licences,  bus

licences, trade licences and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to finance. This is one outstanding

problem which is basic to the whole of the relationship

between the State and the Central Government It is  the

view  of the Singapore Government that if Singapore  is

to  have autonomy, not only in name but in practice and

substance, in the many subjects ranging from education,

labour, social welfare, health and so on, then we must,

in  the  words of the White Paper, retain  the  present

machinery  for  the  collection of  taxes  and  make  a

contribution  to  the  Central Government  for  Federal

services. I quote these words from the White  Paper  in

the exchange of letters:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is our view that there is no equivocation that the

collection  of  taxes must he done  by  Singapore.  The

revenues  collected, whether they be Federal  or  State

taxes,  after  Malaysia should be  kept  in  Singapore.

Singapore's   contribution  to  Federal   services   in

Singapore like Police and Prisons and its share of Pan-Malaysian  services for the whole region  like  defence

and  external  affairs can be a  first  charge  on  the

revenues collected.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped by today to be in a position to report to

the  House on the agreement reached and to disclose the

formula  on which Singapore will pay for its  share  of

Federal services in Singapore and its proportion of Pan

Malaysian services for the whole region. I hope I  have

made   that   clear,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Police   and

Prisons - we pay in full for what Singapore maintains  in

Police  and  Prisons  Force  and  the  necessary  other

establishment and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



capital charges. Defence and external affairs,  we  pay

for our proportion of what Malaysia spends as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the 28th of

February  and  the 1st of March, it became  clear  that

there  was basic disagreement between the views of  the

Finance  Ministry  in Kuala Lumpur  and  those  of  the

Finance Ministry in Singapore. The Finance Ministry  in

Kuala  Lumpur  envisaged  an arrangement  whereby  they

would  take over the functions of the Singapore Finance

Ministry in respect of all taxes, and year by year make

such  payments to the State Government as is  necessary

for  its  discharge of its other duties. The  Singapore

Finance  Ministry's view is the exact opposite.  Having

all  these years efficiently and effectively discharged

its  functions, it has not the slightest doubt that  it

can  continue to do so as envisaged in the White  Paper

and   make  its  yearly  contribution  to  the  Central

Government for Federal services. I need hardly say that

strong  views  were held on both sides. However,  I  am

happy to say that this did not prevent discussions from

being  held  to  explore every possibility  of  a  fair

arrangement  whereby the Federal Government  will  have

complete  guarantees on the efficiency and efficacy  of

tax collection by the Singapore Finance Ministry and  a

faithful and accurate audit of every item collected and

expended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our second plenary meeting in Kuala Lumpur on the

21st and 22nd of March, we discussed a paper put up  by

the  Federation Finance Ministry on the subject.  I  am

sorry  to say that the paper was not acceptable  to  us

as,  in  our view, it was not in accord with the  clear

terms  of the White Paper with regard to responsibility

for   collection  by  Singapore  and  then   making   a

contribution  to  the  Central Government  for  Federal

services. We undertook to submit a paper for a  meeting

in  Singapore scheduled for the 1st and 2nd  of  April.

Our  paper  was submitted on Friday the 29th of  March.

Instead of the plenary session originally scheduled for

the  1st  of  April,  informal  discussions  were  held

between the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



Finance Ministers then in Singapore and between myself,

the  Deputy  Prime Minister of the Federation  and  the

Minister  of  Internal Security of the  Federation.  We

thought  on Monday evening the 1st of April that  broad

agreement   in   principle   had   been   reached    on

responsibility  for  collection  and  that   all   that

remained  was  an equitable method of working  out  our

contribution  to  the  Federal Government  for  Federal

services. In other words, apportioning money from taxes

like  Income  Tax and Customs duties which will  become

Federal  taxes and Pan-Malaysian after Malaysia between

(1)  the Federal Government for our contribution and (2)

the rest for our own use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plenary session was held on the 2nd of April.

Several  of the outstanding items regarding fundamental

rights  in the Constitution, establishment matters  and

continued   application  of  the  principle   of   free

competition  in  Singapore without special  preferences

were  agreed.  There was a great deal of  understanding

and  a  common  desire  for fair  play.  However,  when

discussions  were resumed on finance in the  afternoon,

we  discovered  that what we thought had  already  been

agreed    on   principle   on   1st   April   regarding

responsibilities for collection of Federal  taxes  was,

in  fact,  not  agreed  and the meeting  ended  without

agreement. The respective positions of the two  Finance

Ministries  remained  as on the  21st  of  March.  Sir,

Members  are aware that financial arrangements are  the

key  to  all the other relations between the State  and

the  centre. Amendments to the Federal Constitution and

the State Constitution of Singapore cannot be finalised

until  this matter has been resolved. The present time-table  is  that  all  these  constitutional  amendments

should be ready by May or, at the latest, by early June

in order that they can be tabled before and approved by

this  Assembly and then incorporated in a treaty to  be

signed in London in June so that, on the 31st of August

this   year,  all  that  remains  will  be  the  formal

proclamation of independence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are thankful for the practical approach of the Federation Deputy Prime Minister to these problems. But for his understanding that Singapore's autonomy in labour, education, health and social services should he accompanied by the financial means to implement our policies, further discussions at inter-governmental level would have been pointless. At

our  next meeting, we hope to work out the basis of the

formula to he spelt out to apportion funds collected by

the   Singapore  Government  from  Federal   taxes   in

Singapore  between  (a)   Singapore's  contribution  for

Federal  services, and (b)  the balance to  be  used  by

Singapore for State expenses and development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will realise the urgent necessity of our

finding   a   just   formula  for   working   out   our

contribution.  If this is not done before  the  end  of

May,  then the London treaty may be delayed to the  end

of  June  or  even the beginning of July,  since  after

agreement some time will be needed by the draftsmen  to

frame these amendments to the Federal Constitution  and

some  further  time will be taken by this  Assembly  to

debate and adopt them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Federation Deputy Prime Minister informed me

yesterday  afternoon that he would be  leaving  shortly

for  Washington  and  he  would  like  another  plenary

meeting  of  Ministers and officials  in  Kuala  Lumpur

before  he  leaves. We hope that these two meetings  on

the  10th and 11th of April will produce the basis  for

such  a  formula.  Our official party of  Treasury  and

Establishment officers will be leaving for Kuala Lumpur

tomorrow for preparatory talks to prepare the  way  for

this plenary session. Because of his heavy commitments,

these are the only two available dates the Deputy Prime

Minister has before he leaves for Washington. In  these

circumstances, our original intention to  proceed  with

our  Assembly sittings until the 11th of April (the eve

of the Easter holidays) has to be changed and the House

will  have to adjourn on the 9th of April. However,  to

make up for extra time, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



Leader of the House has already indicated to Opposition

Members  that we are willing to sit tomorrow (Saturday)

Monday and  Tuesday  everyday till midnight. However, I

understand from my Deputy that some Opposition  Members

are  not  enamoured  of  the  proposal  of  a  Saturday

sitting. On Tuesday evening, the House will adjourn  to

the 7th of June, but I undertake to reconvene the House

earlier as soon as the constitutional arrangements have

been finalised and a complete report can be made to the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the importance of the future

constitutional  provisions governing  the  relationship

between  the Singapore State Government and the Federal

Central  Government,  I  am  prepared  to  answer   any

questions  on this matter, and if Members so  wish,  to

have a debate on it.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

first  question  I  would  like  to  ask  is  to   seek

clarification  of  the remark that "Singapore  citizens

are  not  to  have  double enjoyment of  education  and

labour  conditions in other States."  Does  it  by  any

means  infer that Singapore citizens resident in  other

territories   would  be  unable  to  find   educational

facilities  for  their children  in  schools  of  those

States? Is there any suggestion that Singapore citizens

would be unable to find employment in other States?  It

is a somewhat ambiguous phrase and I would appreciate a

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Certainly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful for that question. The position is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way as we will extend to Malaysian

citizens who are not Singapore citizens educational and

other  facilities as of grace, not as of right, so  the

Federal   Government   will  extend   educational   and

employment  facilities  to  Singapore  citizens  as  of

grace,  and  not  as of right. It really  depends,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, on the ultimate development of industries

and educational facilities in the two territories after

Malaysia. If the present position is maintained, then I

say that we will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



in  a  position to continue to extend as of  grace  the

yearly credit balance that we acquire of about 7,000 to

10,000  persons per annum in the transfer of people  on

the  identity cards. But if, as a result of  a  massive

inflow from the Federation, it may not be possible  for

us  to  pay  for not only education but lots  of  other

items like housing and other social benefits: then,  of

course,  the Federation Government would also  consider

itself  not obliged to extend these facilities  to  our

citizens  as of grace and they will perhaps be  charged

for  their  school fees there, as we  may  well  charge

Federal citizens for their school fees here.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, it is very important. What

about   the   question   of  workers-no   question   of

grace-apart  from  Government  employment?   Will   the

citizens of Singapore be able as heretofore to go  into

the  Federation  freely? Will they be  able  to  obtain

private employment without limitation and vice versa in

so far as the Federation is concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so. Mr Speaker, Sir.

There  is no intention whatsoever to prohibit the  flow

of  labour  one  way or the other. But the  proviso  is

included  because  we  want to  make  provision  for  a

situation  in  which  we may well  have  to  refuse  to

shoulder  responsibilities which may he more than  what

our State finances can hear should the flow turn into a

flood.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker. Sir, on the question of Malay rights, I  think

the  Prime Minister said just now that with the  coming

of  Malaysia, Singapore Malays would enjoy not only the

privileges   of  being  Malays  as  embodied   in   the

Constitution of Singapore but also other rights in  the

Federation of Malaysia. At the same time, he also  said

that  insofar  as  proportion of posts  in  the  Public

Services  of  Federal Departments are  concerned,  this

privilege  would  not be applicable  to  the  Singapore

Malays.  Am  I  right? Now what other privileges  would

Singapore   Malays  get  by  being  citizens   of   the

Federation of Malaysia?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I can do no better than go back

to  the form of words that I have, I think, taken  some

care  to spell out. It means that in Singapore,  Malays

will  continue  to  enjoy their special  rights  as  at

present,  with  particular reference to free  education

from primary school to university and if they choose to

go  to  the other States, will enjoy special rights  as

for  Malays  there. In this way, we have been  able  to

maintain the principle of free competition in Singapore

for employment in the Public Service and for businesses

like taxi licences, bus licences, trade licences and so

on.  I  do  not think it is fair on a delicate  subject

like this to ask me to ad lib.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> In other words, Sir, Singapore

Malays  would  have  to migrate to  the  Federation  of

Malaya  in order to enjoy those privileges. As long  as

they  remain  in Singapore, they would  not  enjoy  any

privileges accorded to Malays in the Federation. Am  I

correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not think I can altogether

agree  with that proposition. In fact, I have  gone  to

great  lengths  to  explain that we are  affording  the

Malays  in  Singapore privileges which, if we  were  to

follow  the  Constitution of the Federation of  Malaya,

would  be unconstitutional, namely, giving them special

privileges in education.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like

clarification   of   the  phrase   "that   transitional

provisions   will   be   made   for   the   first    15

representatives  of  Singapore to the  first  Malaysian

Parliament".   Am  I  to  understand  that   those   15

representatives will he nominated by this Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do realise that from time

to   time   the  Member  for  Anson  gives  the   worst

construction possible. But I can assure him that  there

is  no  such  diabolical scheme. He is as much  in  the

running for one of the 15 seats as anybody else in this

Chamber or outside this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the same point?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The same point. Do I understand that,

in fact, those transitional provisions will provide for

elections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, obviously it

must be so. But I am not in a position to say elections

in  what manner, in what form, nor when. I am sure some

Members on the other side are extremely anxious to know

when,  because the date and the timing of these matters

have certain consequential results on those persons who

are  likely to appear in the Federal Parliament. And I

am sorry that much as I would like to allay the anxiety

of  hon. Members of this Assembly, I cannot really  add

anything more to what I have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I wish

to seek clarification from the Prime Minister about the

constitutional talks. What is the present  position  on

the   problem  of  the  common  market?  In   the   new

constitution, who will decide, for instance, the tariff

policy  applicable to Singapore, income  tax,  customs,

the  question of pioneer certificates, and the over-all

question of economic and fiscal policies of Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish

to  go into the details of what are extremely intricate

and   delicate   negotiations.  As  I   have   already

indicated, strong views are held on both sides  on  the

subject.  All I need refer the hon. Member  to  is  the

presence  of  the  Rueff  Commission,  the  World  Bank

Mission  here  to advise the respective Governments  on

the  conditions for a common market. I need hardly  say

that the financial arrangements, our contributions  and

the  balance of apportionment between the State and the

centre  all  hear very closely on these  common  market

matters.  I  would  like  to  state,  as  a  matter  of

principle,  that we would like to carry our fair  share

of  Federal responsibilities. Further, if common market

conditions are such as to make it possible  for  us  to

industrialise and increase our prosperity, then  it  is

our  intention  that that prosperity should  be  shared

with  the Central Government. The Finance Ministry  has

worked out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



a   formula  called  "The  Census  of  Production   and

Employment  Increases." [Interruption] No. The  Finance

Minister  drafted  it.  In some quarters  he  has  been

thought of as being academic: but in other quarters  he

is  believed  to have propounded an extremely  workable

and  very valuable incentive for the Central Government

to  ensure  that Singapore industrialises. Because,  by

this  formula,  as  more  industries  are  created   in

Singapore   and   more  workers  get   jobs,   so   our

contributions to the Federal Government will  increase.

As  less  workers get jobs and less factories open,  so

our contributions will decrease. Therefore. I think the

Member  for Hong Lim, as an accountant, will understand

that  these are related matters, and at the appropriate

time  no  doubt we will he able to disclose to him  the

formula by which we ensure that it is worth everybody's

while   to  make  sure  that  Singapore  survives   and

prospers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, according to the explanation of

the Prime Minister, I am of the opinion that one of the

major  issues in the constitution concerns language.  I

pose  this  question: why has it not been explained  in

the  Assembly  that  it  is the policy  of  the  P.A.P.

Government  to  follow the footsteps of the  Federation

Government  to make the national language  an  official

language by 1967 at the latest? The special position of

the Malays is only extended to free education, but they

still have to pay for textbooks and sports fees.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind hon. Members that

this is Question Time. If the hon. Member carries on in

that strain, that will develop into a debate. I take it

that  all  these agreed provisions will  ultimately  be

written into the draft constitution. There will be room

for debate then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I have indicated, Sir, I am

quite  prepared  to debate now or later,  whichever  is

more convenient to Members of this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has asked a question.

Perhaps the Prime Minister would like to answer that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Might I answer in English, in case

my  Malay  is  inadequate for the rather tactful  reply

which it requires?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that, on principle, we are all committed to

Malay as the national and official language but whether

we  should go one step further and name a specific year

by  which all Members of this Assembly and many  people

outside  are deemed to have a knowledge of the national

language is another matter altogether. In spite of  the

great  inducements that have been made  to  Members  of

this  Assembly - free tuition: a teacher going  to  their

houses,  and  their being paid transport  allowance  in

order  that  they  can  improve  their  knowledge   and

capacity to express themselves in the language - not very

many  have  persisted in these endeavours.  I  feel  it

would be straining realities if we were to name 1967 as

the   date  by  which  we  are  all  supposed   to   be

sufficiently  knowledgeable in  Malay  to  conduct  the

business of government in Malay, let alone the business

of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Regarding the

revision   of   the  constitution  after  merger,   and

especially  about  the division of the  constituencies,

will that be done by the Singapore Government or by the

Federation Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I can do no better than read

from  my  text. The words have been drafted  with  some

care, and all it says here is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Conduct of Elections



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 113-Federal Elections



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 113 should apply to Singapore in respect of

Federal  elections  subject to  necessary  transitional

arrangements  for  the first election  of  the  fifteen

representatives of Singapore to the First Parliament of

Malaysia.  The period of review set out in Article  113

(2)  shall continue to obtain after merger.'



<br><br>In other words, but for the first transitory provisions

the  constituencies will be delineated by  the  Federal

Elections Commission. For the first election, as I have

told Members just now, they must contain themselves.  I

know this is a matter which excites a great deal of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



interest, and in some quarters even anxiety, and  I  am

sure  everybody will be fully acquainted of the  matter

in  due course and can decide which is the best way  in

which they can make their way to the Central Parliament

in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will pass on to Questions.

<div align="center"><b>DRAFT CONSTITUTION FOR MALAYSIA</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Date of publication)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister when

it  is  anticipated  that  the Draft  Constitution  for

Malaysia will be published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, although the constitutional

provisions have been agreed upon in the White Paper and

in  the  exchanges  of letters between  the  Tunku  and

myself,  there  has  been  some  difficulty  over   the

financial arrangements as I have explained just now, in

particular,  the cost which will represent  Singapore's

fair   share  of  Federal  services  in  Singapore   as

Singapore's  contributions for  Pan-Malaysian  services

like  Defence, Foreign Affairs, and a few other  items.

We  hope  that  this vital question of finance  can  be

resolved  soon  in  time  for  us  to  table  all   the

constitutional amendments for adoption by May in  order

that the treaty can be signed in June.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I am

misunderstood. The phrase there is "Draft  Constitution

for   Malaysia",  not  merely  that  section   of   the

Constitution  for Malaysia referring  to  Singapore.  I

would  inquire  when it is anticipated that  the  Draft

Constitution  for  Malaysia  will  be  published,   and

whether  the  Government will give an  opportunity  for

debate here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry the Member for

Anson  again has misconstrued me. He has given  me  the

worst  possible interpretation. There are only  certain

sections of the Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



Constitution  which  will  require  amendment,   either

because   of   Singapore  or  because  of  the   Borneo

territories. And there will he, therefore, the  Federal

Constitution - a copy of which I have here and  which  I

hope  Members  of this House interested in  the  matter

will  familiarise themselves with. Then there  will  be

the   amendments  which  will  be  inlaid   into   this

Constitution.  That, together with the Singapore  State

Constitution,  will  provide  the  whole   picture   of

Singapore in Malaysia. There is no intention to fob the

Member  for  Anson  off with just a few  constitutional

amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, perhaps it was an oversight that

the  Prime Minister has omitted to indicate whether the

Government  will give this Assembly an  opportunity  to

debate  the  whole  Draft Constitution,  including  the

Constitution  of  Singapore  in  the  context  of   the

Constitutions for the Borneo territories.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have to check the

exuberance of the Member for Anson here. I remember  on

one famous occasion he ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is not the time for debate. I

ask the Prime Minister just to give a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed my reply, Sir,I have

already  on one famous occasion over the radio reminded

the  Member for Anson that it is not my duty to explain

what proportion of Brunei's responsibilities go to  the

centre  and  what proportions remain in  Brunei.  I  am

concerned  with Singapore, in the context of the  whole

of  the Malaysian Constitution and Singapore. I am  not

obliged,  nor is it my responsibility, to  explain  the

constitutional arrangements which have been  agreed  to

by  the  Council Negri of Sarawak or by the Legislative

Council  of  North  Borneo or by  the  Sultan  and  his

advisers  in Brunei. That is not my problem. I  am  not

charged with these responsibilities and I see no reason

why  I  should  move  their State  amendments  in  this

Assembly or allow it as a subject for debate, in  which

ease I shall have to defend or condemn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



it.  But I will certainly allows the fullest debate  on

the  whole  of the Malaysian Constitution  and  on  the

Singapore  State Constitution but not the Constitutions

concerning Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei.

<div align="center"><b>IN MALAYSIA AS CONTAINED IN PAPER COMMAND 33 OF 1961</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Representations for alterations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether,  in the context of the terms for incorporation

of  the  Borneo territories in Malaysia, the  Singapore

Government   has   made   or   will   consider   making

representations  for any alteration in  the  conditions

for  the incorporation of Singapore contained in  Paper

Command 33 of 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Singapore Government

consider  it  unwise and against the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore in any way  to  depart  from  the

published terms and conditions for merger contained  in

the  White Paper and amplified or amended by the formal

exchanges of letters between the Prime Minister of  the

Federation  and myself. These terms had  been  publicly

debated  and  voted upon by the people.  Any  departure

from  these  terms will make it necessary to  have  the

whole matter redebated and re-endorsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know that there have been some strong

feelings   and  some  strong  statements  about   these

financial  arrangements  between  Singapore   and   the

Federal  Government after Malaysia. Whilst  it  may  be

preferable for the Federal Government to have Singapore

on  par  with  the  Borneo territories  in  respect  of

finance,  we  do  not consider it either  practical  or

advantageous to us to depart from our agreed  terms  in

which we shall collect all the taxes, including Federal

taxes  in Singapore, and the present machinery will  be

retained  for  that  purpose.  We  shall  then  make  a

contribution for Federal services in Singapore and  for

our fair share of Pan-Malaysian services like Defence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



and Foreign Affairs. There are at present some delicate

discussions  on  the formula for the  payment  of  such

Federal services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of the Member for Anson, who I trust

is  one of the more interested Members of this Assembly

on  constitutional matters, I would like  to  draw  his

attention to the relevant parts of the White  Paper  in

paragraph 17 and the exchange of letters. There he will

see that paragraph 17 of the White Paper says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In view of the larger measure of local autonomy and

the  consequent large expenditure on Singapore services

and development' ---



<br><br>and development, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`--- the financial relations between the Federal

Government  and  the  States set  out  in  the  Federal

Constitution  will not he applicable in their  entirety

to  Singapore..The present machinery for the collection

of taxes in Singapore will be retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds of the national taxes will be used to pay

the cost of Government and Public Services in Singapore

and  the  Contribution  to the Federal  Government  for

Federal services. The details of the apportionment' ---



<br><br>that  is, apportionment between contributions and  what

we keep:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`--- will be worked out by the Joint Working Party.'



<br><br>In the exchange of letters we stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Finally, we have agreed that Singapore would keep

more  than  three-quarters  of  her  revenue  for   the

discharge  of  her  responsibilities on  education  and

labour,  social  welfare,  health  and  all  the  other

matters set out as state or concurrent responsibilities

in  the  schedule  annexed to our  memorandum,  and  be

entitled to 15 seats in the Central Parliament  of  the

new Federation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether the Member for Anson, when

drafting  this question, was alluding to the  40  seats

which have been awarded to Borneo and Sarawak -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Inter alia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Perhaps he was. We welcome this

generous  brotherly  approach  to  unity  in  Malaysia.

However,  we think it to be inappropriate for Singapore

to have arrangements in which for several years to come

the  40  Members of Parliament from Sarawak  and  Sabah

will be elected not on a universal franchise but on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



collegiate  system  suitable to Borneo  and  her  long-houses. We have none here. It would, in fact, mean that

30  out  of  the  40 of these members from  the  Borneo

territories  would be in part nominated  as  chiefs  or

otherwise  leaders of their communities, various  long-houses  and rivers and so on, tribal territorial chiefs

and  so on and so forth. I am quite sure the Member for

Anson,  who has travelled in these then foreign  lands,

is  conversant with the tribal customs and mores of the

people there and he will appreciate that the Federation

Prime  Minister did the right thing in  taking  such  a

generous  attitude. However, I must assure him  that  I

think the people of Singapore would not take kindly  to

any suggestion that the various clans should foregather

and  elect  various representative; or that  we  should

have  Hokkiens,  Teochews, the Huay Kuans,  the  Jewish

synagogue  elected members and so on. I  think,  having

been  accustomed to the one man one vote from the  base

upwards, it is better that we stay that way. And in any

case,  I have the feeling that if we multiply ourselves

by  three  from 15 to 45, we may end up by having  even

less  say in the centre if this system were applied  to

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I have no doubt the Prime

Minister  finds  himself amusing in  misconstruing  the

question I sought to ask. May I repeat it a little more

clearly? It is this: we have from time to time received

news,  seeping  through the newspapers,  of  conditions

applying  to  merger  both of Borneo  and  Sarawak  and

conditions extremely favourable to those territories in

respect  of  the  powers  that they  have,  inter  alia

indicating  that  they will have 40 representatives  in

the  Central  Parliament, thereby having a very  strong

voice  in  the Central Parliament quite apart from  the

representation that Brunei would have, of which  we  do

not have details yet, which would add to about three to

four  times  per  capita representation that  Singapore

would  have  in the Central Parliament irrespective  of

the   manner  in  which  they  are  elected,   reducing

Singapore  and  its  people to  insignificance  in  the

Federal   Parliament.  In  that   context,   does   his

Government consider that - not looking at Singapore in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



isolation hut looking at it in the context of the whole

of   Malaysia - it  would  be  appropriate  to  ask   for

justice - for  fair play for Singapore from  the  Federal

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is exactly what we are

doing,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir. We are  insisting - not  only

asking - on fair play. I think the city of Singapore that

has  thrived for over 100 years under solemnity of  the

contract  will  appreciate the point  that  a  contract

having been made has to be honoured. In this case,  for

the  reasons  I have enumerated, we feel - regardless  of

what  the  Member for Anson feels - that  the  people  of

Singapore  are  with  us  in  this,  that  it  is  more

important we control our finances and retain more  than

three-quarters of our revenue and pay our  contribution

to  the  centre  and have 15 seats as  agreed  than  to

reopen any of those items, running the risk thereby  of

reopening the financial arrangements which have already

been agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody knows that if you sell rubber short and the price goes up, then you lose money; and vice versa. Singapore understands this. If

you  go to Change Alley and buy an imitation Parker  61

for  $5  and  the day after that the market is  flooded

with  more imitation Parker 61s and the price goes down

to  $1, you cannot go hack to the shop and ask for your

money  back.  Similarly in this case, we have  come  to

this  agreement  in which we feel we bought  a  genuine

Parker  61  for a sum of money and we are keeping  more

than three-quarters of our revenue, and I mean keep.  I

do  not mean that this Assembly will remain a truncated

appendix of some Central Parliament. We shall have  the

power of dispensation. The Member for Anson will, after

31st  of August, have the power to have his say on  the

expenditure of a vast sum of money every year  -  more

than  $500  million. Of that, an estimated $70  million

may  go  to  the  centre for Federal services,  police,

posts, telecommunications and so on. It may be more: it

may  be less. We will have to work it out. If he  wants

the Borneo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



terms in which these powers are delegated for the  time

being -d elegated, which is a different thing  from  ours

as of right - then it is a different proposition. Then  I

would  say  the whole of these merger arrangements  are

scrapped;  we  start  afresh; we redebate  afresh;  the

Barisan runs around afresh -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister and

all  Ministers should realise that this is not the time

for debate. The Prime Minister, by those statements, is

now  inviting  a debate and a debate is  not  permitted

during   Question   Time.   Any   other   supplementary

questions? No? Mr David Marshall.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been watching with interest

that  the Prime Minister takes sips from a glass  which

will be too much if - it is all right if the questioner

is non compos mentis, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I think the

to good speaking and good thinking.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You need it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed I do, Mr Speaker, Sir,I

to oblige everyone.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Anson is

now  inciting a debate on beer or tea. I  do  not  know

which.  Let  us  get  on with the business.  Mr  Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, besides playing

golf   over  the  week-ends,  I  made  visits  to  nine

constituencies up to date and they are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong, Saturday, 24th November last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomson, Saturday. 15th December last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Kembangan, Saturday, 12th January this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jalan Kayu, Saturday, 19th January this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paya Lebar, Sunday, 3rd February this year.



<br><br>Sir,  I will give the Member for Cairnhill a full list.

He need not bother taking down these little notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bukit Panjang, Sunday, 3rd March this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nee Soon, Sunday, 10th March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sembawang, Sunday, 24th March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tampines, Sunday, 31st March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not clear, Mr Speaker, Sir, as to what the

Member for Cairnhill means when he talks of the cost of

each  of  such visits. In my estimation, it  must  have

cost  a  lot  of  time and money to the people  in  the

constituencies  who  subscribed  for  the  arches,  the

banners, silk scrolls, the tea, the food and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



refreshments,  and  the souvenir gifts  which  are  all

properly  surrendered  to the Treasury  for  valuations

such as a gold-plated shield valued by the Treasury  at

$60,  the wood carving of a ship valued at $25  and  so

on.  I will give a complete inventory of such items  if

required. I am unable to give the exact sums  spent  on

each  visit as it would not be good manners to ask  the

various  reception  committees  how  much  money   they

actually  spent for the friendly welcome they  accorded

me,  nor  is  it possible to include the  cost  of  the

crackers which were fired by housewives and shopkeepers

along the routes of my visits -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I did not hear them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you. I am sorry to have

disturbed the Member for Anson from time to time on his

peaceful  Sunday  morning. My visits, Sir,  which  will

continue  till all the rural constituencies  have  been

covered  will eventually cost the Government  over  $30

million  which  have been earmarked for development  of

rural  roads,  stand-pipes, electric  supplies,  street

lamps,  drains, irrigation canals and another estimated

$20  million  for clinics, veterinary service  stations

and  community  centres.  Sir,  these  monies  will  be

charged   against  the  respective  votes   for   rural

development,  health and veterinary services.  Sir,  in

case - I do not know - the Member for Cairnhill intended to

know  the  cost  of  each  such visit,  the  travelling

expenses  of  the  Government on each occasion,  I  had

asked  for a careful check to be made of my last visit,

because  by then this question had come in.  The  visit

was  to  Tampines. It came to $23.35 being the cost  of

petrol  for  the  land rovers, the station  wagons  and

other vehicles of the official party. Mind you, Sir, it

is  not possible to estimate the cost of wear and  tear

of the tyres and the paint work and so on.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Prime  Minister is trying to evade the issue by  giving

an  answer  that is not asked for. Surely it  cost  the

Government  some  money to make  preparations  for  the

Prime  Minister  to  be  there.  Surely  it  cost   the

Government some money in sending members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



Work  Brigade who were paid out of Government funds  to

he  there  to cheer the Prime Minister. All I  want  to

know is how much did it cost the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have told the

Member for Cairnhill. When I got his question before my

last visit. I made the point of asking my Secretary  to

note  our travelling expenses and it came to $23.35.  I

have told him that I cannot check up on tyres and paint

work  and  so  on. He asks about the Work Brigade.  The

Work Brigade did not get paid on that day. I went there

on  Sunday.  I think they were paid - I do not  know -

paid no more, no less.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> They

were off duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They were off duty on Sunday. So

the question does not arise on the Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister did therefore

admit  that  members  of the Work  Brigade  attend  his

visits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Cairnhill

was misinformed. I have got the itinerary somewhere and

I  think the Member for Tampines was with me on Sunday.

In  the case of Tampines we did not even visit the Work

Brigade  Camp. We had so many places to go to  and  did

not finish till about nine o'clock. So the Work Brigade

did not come in at all. I will bear that in mind for my

next  visit, Mr Speaker, Sir. But then it will  be  to

the  Southern Islands and there again there is no  Work

Brigade. But when my next rural visit ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, it must be the tea

that  is  having this effect on the Prime Minister.  He

said that all the expenses were borne by the public. Is

the  Prime  Minister aware that before his visits,  his

agents  go round the constituencies telling them,  "You

know,  our great Prime Minister is coming. You must  do

something  about  it."  With that  kind  of  suggestive

intimidation, what could they do? Yes, $30 and ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, according to my social

the 2nd of February, 1963. One on the 16th February  to

the  farmers  who gave warm support for the  Veterinary

Services  Extension Station at 9� m.s.  Tampines  Road,

and  the  other  on  the 19th March in  honour  of  the

expended.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> State hospitality.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed, Sir, I hope from time to

time  the  Member for Anson would grace  the  occasion.

These people have graciously accepted my hospitality in

spite  of the sparse and the frugal fare, and no  point

is  served  by publicly underlining this fact.  If  the

hon.   Member  is  sincerely  interested   in   factual

information,  he  can  get  the  exact  cost  of  these

receptions  and I shall supply him with the  number  of

persons invited and present so that he can work it  out

per  head from the representative of his Party  on  the

February?  And my social diary shows two. He can  check

up  with the sentries. If he wants, I will get a  check

properly  made.  I myself do not keep  a  note-book  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol Road, in answer to Question No. 7, Sir, is 4

miles  long,  and parts of it are mangrove  swamps  and

very  sparsely populated. The Urban and Rural  Services

Consultative  Committee have a  provisional  scheme  in

hand   to   supply  electricity  to  the  more  densely

populated areas, houses in the vicinity of Jalan  Buang

Kok, and Punggol Road 9 milestone. A final decision  on

these  points  will be taken after the  residents  have

made  their  views and preferences known when  I  visit

their constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Does the

Prime  Minister know that at the 11 milestone  Yio  Chu

Kang  Road the population compares less favourably with

the population at the 9 milestone Punggol Road? In this

area, there is a Malay school and other facilities.  So

the  facilities  do  not compare less  favourably  with

those at Yio Chu Kang 11 milestone.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I quite get the

last  part  of it. I suppose the question is:  has  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I must admit I have not as

yet  paid  a formal visit to this constituency.  It  is

part  of  Singapore. But I do receive reports  from  my

officials,  and, as I have said in my  reply,  I  shall

make  a  personal investigation into this matter before

more  cogently  and  forcefully  that  the  Member  for

Punggol can do.

mean that the Prime Minister must go there first before

such facilities can be granted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not at all. Often the case is so

obvious. The work proceeds and is completed without its

ever being raised in this House. The pity of it all  is

that  we  get  no  thanks  from  the  Members  of   the

Opposition  for installing lights, water,  electricity,

sanitation,  drains,  culverts  and  bridges  in  their

constituencies. However, no doubt the residents of  the

various areas know of the work that has been going  on,

and credit will be given to the proper quarters, in due

course.  But  when it is a borderline  case,  then,  of

course, one has to consider the preferences, and  as  I

say, there is nothing like hearing from people who live

iii the area themselves - the recipients of these various

benefits - as  to which particular project they  wish  to

have proceeded with first.

he  is aware that the land at Lot 972 S.G. 32557 at  6�

milestone  Upper  Serangoon Road is constantly  flooded

due to the present channelling of the main-road drains,

and what action does he propose to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The land referred to is a low-lying area which is flooded after a heavy rain by a run-out from 96 odd acres of land on the opposite side of

Upper   Serangoon  Road  between  the  6�  and  the   7

milestones. The run out converges into a culvert at the

6� milestone Upper Serangoon Road from where it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



flows  under the road into an earth drain which  passes

through Lot 97-2 and empties into the swampland  around

Sungei  Serangoon  further east.  Sungei  Serangoon  is

further  affected by tides and this aggravates flooding

at  high tide, The area affected is very extensive.  No

easy  solution can be found until the area between  the

Tampines Road Canal and the sea to the mouth of  Sungei

Serangoon is surveyed by engineers to decide  a  proper

alignment for a new canal to drain water away from  the

Tampines  Road Canal to the sea. A survey was commenced

in  January and will be completed in about six  months'

time. Meanwhile, the shallow earth drain crossing  this

portion  of  the  land  which silts  rapidly  is  being

cleared  and  will  continue  to  be  cleared  whenever

necessary  to alleviate the position. I hope  to  visit

Punggol  in the next few weeks and will see  what  more

can be clone about this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

According to what the Prime Minister has said, does  it

mean that this drain can only be looked into after  his

visit to this place? Before his visit, if there is  any

flood, is the Government going to pay for the damage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang did

not  listen  to  the  last part of my  answer.  We  are

alleviating the position by clearing the shallow  earth

drain  crossing  the portion of the  land  which  silts

rapidly. This alleviates the situation, and if there is

anything  more that can be done, I will do so.  Nothing

is being left to flooding.

<div align="center"><b>CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ALLOCATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF HOUSE NUMBERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> asked the Prime Minister what are

the  conditions and requirements for the allocation  of

house numbers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, a house number is allocated

by  the Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Property

Tax  Department) on production of an approved plan  and

certificate   of  fitness  issued  for   the   building

concerned by the Chief Building Surveyor. In  the  case

of a temporary structure, a house number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



is  allocated  on  production of a  temporary  building

permit issued by the Chief Building Surveyor. It is not

necessary to await the Prime Minister's visit to get  a

house number.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker. Sir, I understand that the position appears to

be  that if two houses are built at the same time, then

they  will be given the numbers, but that if  there  is

one  house  between  the two it will  not  receive  any

number. There is a rumour to the effect that this is  a

very unwise policy of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am astounded, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  Members on the other side, particularly the great

revolutionary  anti-colonialist heroes, have  now  been

reduced to becoming purveyors of falsehoods and rumours

outside.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Copying your Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if I take notice of the

Member   for  Anson,  perhaps  we  might  enliven   the

proceedings  in  this Assembly. But I  can  assure  him

that,  but  for  the  fact  that  scrupulous  care   is

maintained  to  see  that  everybody  knows  the   real

position  from  time to time, including gaols  and  the

thickness  of walls and windows and so on, there  would

not be the air of calm and confidence that there is  in

Singapore as to the reality of things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has mentioned what he

considers  the  curious fact of two  houses  getting  a

number  each  and a house in the middle not  getting  a

number.  As I have said, the conditions for  getting  a

number, if it is private land, are the production of  a

plan  with the owner's consent, an approved plan and  a

certificate   of  fitness  issued  for   the   building

concerned by the Chief Building Surveyor. If two people

on two different plots of land can produce certificates

of  fitness and approved plans, there is no reason  why

numbers  should not be granted. Where in logic does  it

follow  that  if  you  have two  "lawful"  houses  with

numbers and you build an "unlawful" one in between, you

should get a number? That



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



is  something which I do not understand. The Member for

Moulmein,  instead  of just repeating  and  becoming  a

relaying post for malicious falsehoods could go  around

and  explain - if he is sincere in his anxiety  for  this

gentleman  without  the house number - that  it  has  got

nothing  to  do  with  coffee  money  to  the  relevant

department.  He himself ought to know that things  have

changed  in  the  last  three  and  a  half  years  and

everybody  knows that no coffee money is  required  for

house  numbers. But what are required are a plan and  a

certificate of fitness. Produce them and you will get a

house number. I assure the Member for Moulmein that  my

Department  will give him every assistance in  pointing

out  how to get such a plan approved and how to  get  a

certificate   of   fitness  from  the  Chief   Building

Surveyor.  We  shall render him any  other  assistance,

either in language or surveying, or in any other of the

things required to get house numbers.

<div align="center"><b>(Completion date and facilities provided)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

to  state if the East Wharf Development project, begun

in  1959  and  due  for  completion  according  to  the

Development  Plan by mid-1962, has now been  completed,

and   whether  he  is  satisfied  that  the  facilities

provided are adequate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the East Wharf

Development project consisting of four new  berths  has

been  completed and the berths have been  in  operation

since  25th  April.  1962. The facilities  provided  by

these  berths  are on the most modern  scale  including

four  transit godowns, each of 100 feet clear span  and

each  giving 45,000 square feet of covered floor  area.

There  are  large open storage and parking areas,  road

and   rail  facilities  and  oil  and  water  bunkering

together with other ancillary services provided at each

berth.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Deputy

Prime Minister aware that ships about to unload cargoes

in

berthing space in that area?

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Is he aware ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already intimated to Members that

that  is  just volunteering, information,  it  must  be

followed  up  by  a  question. I  suppose  the  obvious

question  is:  does  the Deputy Prime  Minister  intend

doing anything about it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In view of the reported lack of

berthing  space,  will  the Deputy  Prime  Minister  do

anything about increasing the facilities there?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The supplementary question asked by

the  Member for Tanglin is, of course, unrelated to the

answer  I  have  just given concerning the  East  Wharf

Development  project. However, he has  volunteered  the

information  that there are some ships  which  have  to

wait  to  be  berthed. I have had no  information  that

there  is  a long queue of ships outside the  Singapore

Harbour Board. Nevertheless, I would like to inform him

that  we have development plans to build another  extra

four new berths in the East Lagoon.

whether he is aware that the Federation Government  has

raised  the  rate  of interest payable to  contributors

from  2�  per cent to 4 per cent, and whether  he  will

consider  introducing legislation to effect  a  similar

increase  in  the rate of interest under the  Singapore

Central, Provident Fund scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as soon as the Government  came  to

know  of  the  Federation's move to raise the  rate  of

interest  payable  to contributors  of  the  Federation

Employees  Provident Fund from 2� per  cent  to  4  per

cent,  immediate steps were taken to direct the Central

Provident  Fund  Board to look into the possibility  of

raising the interest rates in respect of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Board has considered the

matter  and  has recommended that the  Board  is  in  a

position to pay a rate of interest of more than 2�  per

cent,  but the Central Provident Fund Ordinance has  to

be  amended  so that this could be put into effect.  At

the  same  time, the Central Provident Fund  Board  was

also  considering  other  proposed  amendments  to  the

Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



and  it  was decided that the Ordinance should  not  be

amended  piecemeal  but should take into  consideration

all  other amendments to the Ordinance at one time. The

proposed  amending Bill to the Central  Provident  Fund

Ordinance  has  already been drafted  and  it  will  be

introduced early in this Session.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, will the amending

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, invites a debate,

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That has been answered, perhaps

unsatisfactorily. The Member for Anson can  pursue  his

question in some other way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you. Would the Minister

indicate whether, in fact, at any previous time - whether

under   the   Imperial  Government  or   any   previous

Government  any   detainee   has   been   in   solitary

confinement  without access to newspapers  and  writing

materials  and  without access to lavatories  for  more

than 50 days?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That topic, I think, is going to

be  touched  upon under item 12 on the Order  Paper - the

motion  standing  in  the  names  of  the  Members  for

Queenstown  and  Havelock. All those  details  will  be

touched  upon  then. I do not think they  ought  to  be

touched upon now during Question Time.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of order. He did

say  that  the  conditions are the same  as  under  the

previous Government in answer to my Question 22.  I  am

asking  whether,  in fact, he has any information  that

those conditions prevailed under previous Governments?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Those are details, as I say, which must

be  substantiated somehow and they do not arise  during

Question  Time.  Those details will come  out  when  we

debate  item  12 on the Order Paper. All those  details

can  be  alleged,  denied  or  admitted,  just  as  the

Minister deems fit. During Question Time, those details

will  excite  a  debate, and we can-riot  have  debates

during Question Time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 20, Mr David Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Question 22, Sir,I thought Question 20

was incorporated now in Question 22.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Therein I asked the reasons for the

policy governing the conditions of detainees. Could  we

have a reply to that part of the Question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the simple answer

is  that no charges are made for the services of police

personnel who are required to take lawful measures  for

preserving the public peace during a strike. It is  the

duty  of the Police Force at all times to preserve  the

public  peace, and whenever it appears there may  be  a

breach of the peace occurring at a place where there is

a   strike,  police  personnel  are  put  on  duty,  if

employees  taking  part in a strike  will  observe  the

rules  of peaceful picketing, and if employers  on  the

other  hand  will refrain from provoking action,  I  am

sure  all this diversion of police personnel from their

normal duties will not be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th March, 1963, when it became apparent that

trouble makers in the Toa Payoh area were inciting  the

people there to prevent the roadwork from being carried

out, it was necessary to send a detachment of 15 men to

the scene. In the course of the day, a radio patrol car

and a divisional patrol car paid periodic visits to the

scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th March, 1963, when the trouble-makers tried to

inflame  the people to violent action, it was necessary

to send a detachment of police consisting of 23 men and

to station in readiness near the scene one Reserve Unit

troop   consisting  of  45  men.  Four   women   police

constables  were  also on the scene to  deal  with  the

women  folk  involved in the disturbances, and  in  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply.

Six  rural community centres have been completed in the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member, there are in

Construction  of similar type of community  centres  is

going  on  in other rural constituencies. Their  number

may be more in other rural constituencies depending  on

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE HAIRDRESSERS UNION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(8-hour working day)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

what  action has been taken in regard to the Memorandum

submitted   to   the   Government  by   the   Singapore

Hairdressers  Union asking the Government to  introduce

legislation  to  provide that the workers  should  work

only  8 hours a day, and whether the Government intends

to introduce such legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the question raised is adequately covered

by  the  existing  legislation. May I  refer  the  hon.

Member  to  the  Shop  Assistants Employment  Ordinance

which  stipulates that a shop assistant "shall  not  be

required  under his contract of service  to  work  more

than eight hours in one day, nor for more than 44 hours

in one week." It also provides that the shop assistant,

with  the  consent of his employer, may work  up  to  a

maximum  of 12 hours a day, and if he does  so,  he  is

entitled to overtime wages. It can be seen that  within

these  provisions, a shop assistant may  not  work  for

more  than eight hours a day if he does not wish to  do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If legislation is introduced stipulating that

hairdressers  are required to work only eight  hours  a

day,  it would be a retrograde step as it would deprive

this  class of workers from earning overtime wages  and

would  be  construed as discriminatory legislation.  If

the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



Hairdressers  Union  is  concerned  about  hairdressers

doing more than eight hours' work a day, it could  take

the   matter  up  and  reach  a  mutually  satisfactory

agreement with the employers concerned.

earlier because the Registrar had to seek legal  advice

refused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question: the total number

of  candidates  who sat for the last Government  Senior

Middle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



III  Examination held in 1962 was 2,384. Of these,  898

passed  and  the  failures were 1,486.  In  respect  of

school  candidates from Government-Aided Schools  only,

there  were 508 candidates, and of these 261 or 51  per

cent passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated, however, that all the candidates,

without exception, were attempting this Examination for

at least a second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the third part of the question: Up to 31st

March,   1963,  1,114  have  been  admitted  to   pre-University I Classes in the English stream.  There  are

no  pre-University  Classes in the Chinese  stream  but

Upper Secondary Classes. Admission to Upper Secondary I

Classes in the Chinese medium is at present limited  to

those  who  have  passed  either  the  internal  School

Secondary   Four  or  the  Government  Secondary   Four

Examination.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Will the Minister please

state  whether all those who have passed  their  Senior

Middle  III  Examination and who  ordinarily  would  be

eligible  for  the  Upper  Secondary  Classes  or   the

equivalent of the pre-University First Year are able to

find places?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I believe every candidate who

wants  to be admitted to the Upper Secondary I  Classes

in   the  Chinese  stream  has  been  found  admission,

provided  he  has passed the Government Secondary  Four

Examination  or the School Secondary Four  Examination;

but  for  the time being we are not worried. Those  who

have already completed six years of secondary education

under  the  old 3 : 3 system will join Upper  Secondary

Classes,  because those who have passed the  Government

Senior  Middle III Examination can either get admission

to  Nanyang  University or the University of  Singapore

pre-University Classes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the

Cambridge  Senior School Certificate failures,  we  are

told  that  Grade II passes are not allowed to  repeat,

whereas  Grade III passes are allowed to take a  repeat

examination  in  order  to  enable  them  to  get  pre-University   qualification  to  get  admission   to   a

University. Would the Minister consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



that  a fair arrangement, in view of the fact that  the

Grade  II  passes are penalised whereas the  Grade  III

passes are given another chance?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Surely that is asking for an opinion. I

do  not  know whether the Minister would like to answer

that?  But  it is out of order as it is asking  for  an

opinion.

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Education   how   many  principals  and   teachers   in

Government and/or Government-aided schools had received

notices  terminating their services in 1962 and  during

the period 1st January, 1963 to 15th March, 1963.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1962, six

Principals  of  Government-Aided  Primary  Schools  had

their  services  terminated as Principals  for  various

reasons,  such as misbehaviour, inefficiency or  misuse

of  funds. They were, however, allowed to seek teaching

appointments in other schools. Five have since been re-employed as teachers and the remaining one has probably

decided to seek employment elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 1st January, 1963, to 15th March, 1963,

five  Principals of Government-Aided Schools  have  had

their services terminated also for various reasons; for

example,  detention by the Internal  Security  Council,

failure  to  report  the arrest of  a  teacher  by  the

Internal Security Council after a lapse of eleven days,

although  the teacher concerned was actually living  in

the  same premises as the Principal, and unsatisfactory

state of school accounts, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1962, 502 teachers received notices of termination

of service. The breakdown is as follows:-

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main grounds for termination of services of

teachers may be classified broadly as follows:-

<pre>

(a) Failing to obtain minimum academic

      qualificationas laid down in their

      originalletters of Appointment

      or  Letters of Approval                           400

(b) Refusing to sign Training Agree-

      ment when required to do so                        51

(c) Failing terminal re-examinations at

      the Teachers' Training College                     10

(d) Failing to pass medical examination                  18

(e) Unsatisfactory service                                2

(f) Non-selection by Public Service

</pre>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, do the words

"unsatisfactory service" mean that these teachers did

not go to welcome the Prime Minister when he visited

the rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The question can be ruled out as

being facetious.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, may I ask the Minister this question?

Did  the  Principals  whose  services  were  terminated

receive  one  month's notice, or did they  receive  one

month's pay in lieu of notice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the normal rules

of  termination  of  service  were  complied  with  and

adequate notice was given. Sometimes they persisted  in

hanging  on, then probably they were told to leave  the

premises.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

from  what  I  know,  among those whose  services  were

terminated were those who are detained. Now, when these

people  are released, will the Minister allow  them  to

continue with their teaching?

<div align="center"><b>BURSARIES TO UNDERGRADUATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF NANYANG UNIVERSITY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. <b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  why were bursaries awarded to undergraduates

of  Nanyang  University  later than  those  awarded  to

students  in  the  University  of  Singapore  and   the

Singapore Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The reason why 1962 bursaries

awarded  to  students of Nanyang University were  later

than  those  awarded to students of the  University  of

Singapore  and the Singapore Polytechnic was  that  the

Selection  Board  for recommending  awards  to  Nanyang

University  students sat much later than the  Selection

Boards  for  awards  to  students  of  the  other   two

institutions. The delay arose as certain  members  were

not   available  because  of  prior  commitments.   The

Selection  Board for Nanyang University  bursaries  was

originally scheduled to interview applicants in  August

1962,  but this did not take place till October.  Their

report  was  received by the Ministry in  November  and

awards were made in January this year.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  would  appear from the Minister's answer that  this

Selection  Board  was  discriminating  against  Nanyang

University students when they sat later than scheduled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am surprised at the Member for

Bras  Basah  in  thinking that the  P.A.P.  Government,

which  gives  equal  treatment  in  education  to   all

language  streams,  would allow discrimination.  It  is

just  that certain members of the Selection Board could

not  make it, especially the Chairman who had to attend

a  conference  in  Japan in August.  We  had  to  delay

holding  the  Selection Board until his return.  Rather

than say you cannot go to the conference, you must have

it  out, because it is purely voluntary work. So I hope

the Member for Bras Basah can understand the situation.

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When I was in the

the  Sand  Quarry at Jalan Damai, as the  one  at  Kaki

Bukit  has been closed down); an average of 80 men  are

Speaker, Sir, I beg to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



introduce a Bill intituled "An Ordinance to provide for

the  raising of loans from the International  Bank  for

Reconstruction and Development by the Government of the

State   of   Singapore   and  for   matters   connected

therewith."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

that  the Bill be read and proceeded with upon all  the

stages on a Certificate of Urgency. The Bill before the

House is a short and fairly straightforward one.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is one of the Bills which

require  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  recommendation.

Will the Minister please signify?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have the recommendation of the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara that the Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second  Time" and be proceeded with upon all the stages

on a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is a short and fairly

straightforward one. It is modelled on  Bills  prepared

for  dependent territories, such as we are  now  today,

which the World Bank requires before entering into  any

loan   agreements.  The  Bill  seeks  to   enable   the

Government  to  enter into one or more agreements  with

the World Bank for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



loans  to  finance  capital projects  undertaken  by  a

Statutory Authority. The World Bank will lend  only  to

member  Governments  or  to non-member  Governments  or

institutions if such loans were guaranteed by a  member

Government.  It is quite normal for the World  Bank  to

take one year or more to process a loan application. It

has  to  satisfy itself that the loan granted is indeed

to  finance  a  capital project. Such  a  project  must

contribute towards the reconstruction or development of

a  country.  It is also necessary to satisfy  the  Bank

that   such   a   project  will  be   implemented   and

subsequently managed by a statutory authority that will

be  efficient  and  competent. The statutory  authority

running  it  will not only be able to provide  for  its

proper supervision and management but will also be able

to  operate  on  a sound commercial basis  to  annex  a

return  of  profits not only to cover  maintenance  and

loan   repayments  but  also  to  provide  for   future

expansion. The World Bank will also have to ensure that

the  loan  is  made to a country that  is  economically

stable  and  that  the  guarantor  country  is   in   a

sufficiently  sound financial position  to  honour  its

pledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Government has been

negotiating with the World Bank for a loan for the  new

Pasir  Panjang  Power Station. These negotiations  have

reached  a stage when the World Bank is ready  to  sign

the  loan  agreement; and indeed, it was only two  days

ago  that the Singapore negotiating team returned  from

Washington  after  having completed their  negotiations

with the World Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank has expressly required that before such a

loan  agreement  could be signed  and  made  effective,

legislation  must  be  enacted  to  provide   for   the

establishment of a statutory authority -  in  this  case

the  Public Utilities Board - to which the loan will  be

made.  We  must  also have legislation  to  enable  the

Government to borrow from the World Bank and to  ensure

that certain of the requirements in regard to guarantee

are  sufficiently safeguarded. It is necessary for  the

Public Utilities Bill, therefore, to be passed, as well

as the Loans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



(International   Bank)  Bill  to  be   enacted   on   a

Certificate   of  Urgency  because  of  the   impending

establishment  of  Malaysia. The  Prime  Minister  will

today  introduce the Public Utilities Bill, also  on  a

Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is not a member of the World

Bank,  and al, though it has been negotiating with  the

World Bank for a loan, one of the requirements was that

a  loan  should  be  guaranteed by the  United  Kingdom

Government.  If,  however,  the  signing  of  the  loan

agreement  is delayed until very near to Malaysia,  the

United  Kingdom Government may find it embarrassing  to

stand  guarantee for this loan on the  ground  that  it

would  be  more proper for such a loan to be guaranteed

by   the  Central  Government  of  Malaysia  after  its

formation. In this case, the World Bank may want to re-examine  and  reassess  the whole  situation  all  over

again,  and  this may well mean that the  efforts  that

have been put in over the last two years or so would be

futile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary now to take both the Loans

(International Bank) Bill and the Public Utilities Bill

through all stages on a Certificate of Urgency in order

that  the  Singapore Government can enter into  a  loan

agreement that has been negotiated with the World Bank,

and  to complete the signature of this agreement at the

earliest  possible date in order that the loan  can  be

effective for the financing of the Pasir Panjang  Power

Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not rise to oppose

the   position  where  the  Government  seeks  to   get

authority to borrow monies from the World Bank,  hut  I

rise  to say a few things on what I consider to be  the

inherent powers of the Legislative Assembly insofar  as

loans are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Constitution, all public debts become statutory expenditure, and any statutory expenditure cannot be debated when the Estimates are presented to the House, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



by  virtue  of  the Constitution itself, any  items  of

statutory expenditure are by themselves passed  without

debate  in  this  Assembly.  If  that  is  the  correct

position  - and I submit it is the correct position - what

this  Bill seeks to do then is this. Under clause 3  of

the Bill it seeks to give to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

powers to borrow from the Bank such sum or sums as  may

be  required by a statutory authority for the  exercise

of  its functions. We all know, of course, that this is

merely  a  constitutional way of saying that where  the

Cabinet thinks fit then the Government of Singapore may

borrow from the World Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 3 (6), it

goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any of the provisions of the loan agreement are

inconsistent or in conflict with any law  in  force  in

the  State, the provisions of the loan agreement  shall

prevail.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, on page 4 of the Bill, in clause 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All sums borrowed under the powers conferred by this

Ordinance  and  all interest and other charges  thereon

shall he a charge upon and shall be payable out of  the

general  revenues  and assets of the  State  which  are

hereby appropriated to the purpose.'



<br><br>In  other  words,  these loan monies  will  be  charged

against  the Consolidated Fund in so far as  repayments

are  concerned,  and, as I have said  before,  once  it

becomes statutory expenditure, then the Assembly ceases

to have any control or say over such expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 8:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding any written law, the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara may exercise all such powers and authorities and

do or cause to be done all such things as appear to him

to  be necessary for giving full and complete effect to

the loan agreement.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, what this Bill seeks to do is to give

to the Government absolute powers of borrowing from the

World  Bank, and when the Government chooses to  borrow

from  the World Bank, the Legislative Assembly  becomes

absolutely powerless. I wonder whether that is  a  good

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise on the same issue.

I  am  in complete agreement with the principle of  the

Bill. I naturally support the powers sought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



for  purposes  of  obtaining loans for our  development

plans,  but  I  view with genuine alarm the  provisions

contained  in  the  Bill which  in  fact - maybe  not  in

intent - brush away at one stroke the entirety of the law

of the State. It provides not only for a loan agreement

to  be  made  with the International Bank but  it  also

provides   for   guarantees  by  the   United   Kingdom

Government and any other government. Incidentally, Sir,

it says -  attention has been drawn to it by the previous

speaker - "notwithstanding  any  written   law   to   the

contrary", anything that the Government may put in that

agreement  with  the  Bank and the  guaranteeing  State

would be law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be completely abdicating all our powers,

Sir, it seems to me, quite unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the Minister has indicated that the

Bill  takes the form of enactments in other independent

territories which "we have become", according  to  him,

but whether we are independent or not is not the point.

The  point is, are there really any such provisions  in

any   country?  Is  there  any  legislature  which  has

permitted itself to pass a law whereby it abdicates its

powers  and  puts  them  into the  hands  of  a  single

dictator who may do what he pleases?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, it will be urged, and no doubt properly

urged, that it is not intended to abuse the powers that

are  given,  for  the  Bank may wish  to  know  without

referring  to  our  laws that the  provisions  of  that

agreement will be binding. Sir, if necessary, it  could

be said, "notwithstanding any laws to be made", so that

you  could  not pass laws which prejudice  an  existing

agreement; but to say "notwithstanding any law", wiping

away  seemingly your own constitution and any laws that

are   in  existence,  I  find  it  very  difficult   to

understand, Sir, and I feel that this requires  further

clarification.  As  you see, Sir,  it  causes  me  some

anxiety,  and I have tabled amendments before  you  for

that  purpose. I do hope that the Government will  take

these  criticisms in the spirit in which they are being

offered as being helpful and for purposes of proceeding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



constitutionally. I am not suggesting that they  do  in

fact seek to obtain, through a Machiavellian manoeuvre,

powers whereby they can then destroy all our laws,  but

in  law,  that is what is happening, even  though  that

power may not be exercised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  heard the Minister for Finance giving his reasons

for  the  Certificate of Urgency on this Bill  I  would

like  to  point out that since the Government  came  to

power,  more  than three years have elapsed,  and  they

want  this House to pass this Bill in a hurry in  order

to borrow money from the World Bank. If a loan from the

World  Bank  is  in  the interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore,  then  on principle we will  not  raise  any

objection.  But in the context of the entire  Bill,  we

can see that the Bill seeks to ignore and disregard the

representatives of the people to raise questions on the

justifiability of the loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in the Bill that when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara thinks fit, that is, if the Government

thinks  fit, the Government may borrow money  from  the

World  Bank and enter into agreements thereunder before

the amount of the loan is made public to the Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided in this Bill that the Government

can enter into this agreement first, and then within 30

days   report  to  this  House  the  contents  of  this

agreement. But let us take this present Session of  the

Assembly.  There  has been a period of  several  months

when  we  did not meet. If during this period when  the

Assembly was not in session the Government had borrowed

some  money from the World Bank, we would not have been

able  to know how much the Government had borrowed from

the World Bank, and we would not have been able to know

the contents of the agreement entered into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that to get a loan of this nature we have to pay interest, and the interest has to be paid out of revenues of the Government collected from the people. The interest should be approved, in the first place, by this House before it can be paid by the Government to the party concerned. Since that is

the position, Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



the  House will have every right to understand,  before

the  agreement  is signed, what is to  be  incorporated

therein, what will be the conditions to he attached  to

this  loan by the World Bank, and what is the  rate  of

interest.  All such things must be made public  to  the

Members of this House. This is very important.  But  in

the Bill tabled by the Minister for Finance, all we can

see from it is that until the Minister for Finance,  or

the  Government  of  Singapore, has already  signed  an

agreement  with the World Bank or any other government,

then we will be able to know; so by then it will be too

late  for  us  to  raise any objection because  a  fait

accompli  has  already  been  made,  an  agreement  has

already  been  signed, and we cannot do anything  about

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point I would like to raise in connection with this Bill is that, according to the Minister for Finance, Singapore is not a member nation of the World Bank, and so to make a loan from the World Bank, we must have another nation to stand as guarantor before such a loan can be made available to

us.  I  want  to ask him if lie will assure this  House

whether   the   guarantor  nation,  i.e. the   British

Government,  will in the meantime have  any  conditions

attached to this guarantee when it is prepared to stand

as  guarantor. I would like him to tell this House  the

position regarding this matter. We would also  like  to

know whether the guarantee made by this nation will  be

against  the  interests  of the  people  of  Singapore.

Before  our people make great sacrifices, the  Minister

for Finance has to consider such a nation carefully.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand

the  urgency of having such a Bill in order  to  enable

the  loan  to  be raised with the World  Bank  for  the

development projects which the Minister for Finance has

in  mind. Surely it would not be difficult for  him  to

tell  this House now what loan he has in mind  and  for

which  purpose  this Bill is introduced,  so  that  the

Assembly will have an opportunity to know what the Bill

is intended to effect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



and  to what extent will it commit the Assembly. If the

Minister,   in  his  reply,  can  let  us   have   some

information  as to the loans that he has more  or  less

concluded  but awaiting signature, the House  can  then

pass judgment on the urgency of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the International Bank

is  competently legally advised. Its funds are from  an

international  source, and when  it  enters  into  loan

agreements with State Governments, it wants  to  ensure

that  the agreements into which it enters are not  held

to  be void by Municipal courts on the grounds that the

provisions  of the loan agreements are inconsistent  or

in conflict with any Municipal law. It is only on these

terms  that the International Bank is willing to  enter

into loan agreements with State Governments and the sub-clause  which has been challenged gives effect to  this

intention. The Bank will also not agree to granting any

loan  unless the Government seeking the loan  has  full

power to implement all the terms of the agreement. I am

advised,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, by  the  State  Advocate-General that such clauses appear in all Municipal Bills

providing   for   the  raising  of   loans   from   the

International  blank  and  we  are  not  in   any   way

introducing new precedents in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether I

can speak on a point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Too late. The Member may have his

opportunity in Committee. Dr Goh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think my colleague, the

Minister  for  Law,  has dealt with the  constitutional

position  in regard to certain clauses in the Bill.  We

have  two lawyers on the Opposition Benches who,  while

they agree with the general purpose of the Bill, are in

some  doubt  whether the absolute power to borrow  from

the  World  Bank is a good thing. Now, I think  in  all

arguments  regarding  the merits  or  demerits  of  the

clauses, one should remember that the World Bank  is  a

pre-eminent international institution in this world and

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



it  is extremely selective in regard to the loans  that

it  makes  to  countries. I can assure the  Member  for

Farrer Park that the tests that are required before the

World  Bank agrees to advance money to any country  are

extremely  rigid and there is absolutely no  danger  at

all  that this will open the flood-gates of finance  to

the State of Singapore. If only that could be the case,

if  only  the fears of the Member for Farrer  Park  are

genuine,  then nobody would he happier than  I  myself,

but the position is that the procedures are strict, the

criteria and standards set are extremely high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has raised a number of

points.  I  do  not propose to reply  to  all  of  them

because they do not seem to have any real relevance  to

the  issues  posed  by the clauses in  this  Bill.  For

instance,  he says that this Bill is defective  because

it  enables  the Government to enter into an  agreement

and  commit  the State before elected Members  of  this

Assembly - before the people's representatives,  in  his

own words - can pronounce judgment on whether the rate of

interest is fair and just and whether the loan  project

is  a  good one. With respect, Mr Speaker, Sir,  these

are  matters of administration and execution. They  are

not  matters  which could be properly debated  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has further raised the point about the

powers of the guarantor government - whether there is any

risk that some sinister strings or conditions might not

be  attached to the powers of the guarantor. The powers

of  the guarantor government are laid out and specified

in this Bill and they are quite clear-cut and precise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Cairn-hill. He asked

what loans we have in mind. Actually he was not present

when I was moving the Second Reading of the Bill. I did

mention  that  negotiations have been completed  for  a

loan to finance the Pasir Panjang Power Station.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> How much?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> How much?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The loan comes to some U.S. $15

million, or just over Malayan $45 million. Before long,

the  World  Bank will be sending a team to  assess  our

water  development  projects  on  which  they  have  in

principle  agreed  to make a loan,  and  they  will  go

through the usual routine of processing the application

in  great detail. These are the only two loans we  have

in  mind  to borrow from the World Bank. There  may  be

occasions  in  future where we may even  want  to  seek

loans for other purposes, but that I think we can leave

for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-[Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, if you will notice, the

definition  of "loan agreement" excludes the  guarantee

agreement that would he collateral thereto between  the

Bank  and the guaranteeing country; that is to say,  in

future, the Central Government of Malaysia, and at  the

present the United Kingdom Government. The significance

of  that is to be found in clause 3 (7)  which indicates

that  the  loan  agreement would he tabled  before  the

House.  I  would  enquire why the agreement  should  be

divided into two - an agreement between us and the  Bank,

and  an agreement between the Bank and the guaranteeing

country - and  why  it  is considered inappropriate  that

that guarantee document should not be made available to

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject, Sir, I would enquire, if you

think  it  appropriate, whether  the  Government  would

consider, for the purpose of meeting a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



legitimate anxiety on the part of the Opposition at the

suggested  unconstitutionality of  the  procedure  here

adopted  and of rendering it constitutional,  that  the

loan  agreement  should be such as  has  been  approved

beforehand  by  the  Assembly.  I  am  quite  sure  the

Government  has  no fear that it would be  refused  any

legitimate request for loans. In fact, I think  it  can

sense  the feeling of the House in the support  it  has

already received. But what we feel anxious about,  Sir,

is  the  question of taking complete powers  and  then,

without  the  knowledge  of the  people  of  Singapore,

concluding  agreements which may incorporate provisions

of a grave character affecting the country. This is not

a law for today only or for tomorrow, Sir.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I cannot see how those remarks arise on

clause  2.  They might arise on clause 3.  I  certainly

think  they  would  arise  under  clause  3  (7),   but

certainly not under clause 2, would they?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You see, Sir, if you will look at the

definition of "loan agreement", it refers to  clause  3

(1) -   in  fact  closely  associated - but  if  you  rule

otherwise,  Sir,  I  shall merely  ask  then  my  first

question:  would it be indicated why it  is  considered

inappropriate that the document of guarantee should not

be disclosed to this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the loan

agreement itself sets out the details of the terms  and

conditions  of  the  loan. It  sets  out  the  rate  of

interest, the period of payment, the amounts  by  which

it  should  be  paid,  and the general  policy  of  the

undertaking  which has to make use of  this  money.  To

that  extent,  therefore, these are matters  of  public

interest,  and it is right and proper that they  should

be made public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the guarantee agreement between the Bank and

Her   Majesty's  Government  or  any  other   guarantor

Government,  this  is a matter completely  between  the

Bank and the guarantor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



Government and does not really concern us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does the guarantor give certain

undertakings?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The guarantor gives certain

undertakings  in  case  of  default  by  the  borrowing

country.  The matter really is something which concerns

how  the  Bank  can then get money from  the  guarantor

Government.  It  is  not a matter which  concerns  this

Assembly at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Are we to understand that the

Government envisages a guarantee document in which this

State  is  not involved at all, because in  the  normal

course, Sir, it is a three party affair - the borrower,

the  lender and the guarantor - and mutual undertakings?

Are  we  to  understand  that  here  there  will  be  a

guarantee with no involvement on the part of this State

vis-a-vis the guarantor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The obligations insofar as the

State of Singapore is concerned are with the World Bank

and  they  will  be  contained in  the  loan  agreement

between  us  and  the  World Bank. The  guarantor,  for

either  reasons  of  charity or  otherwise,  undertakes

certain  liabilities  in case the Singapore  Government

defaults. We are in no way obliged to the guarantor  by

the agreement between the guarantor and the World Bank,

nor  do we incur any obligations. There is no agreement

between  the  guarantor  and  us,  or  any  strings  or

conditions which the Member for Choa Chu Kang may  have

suggested  in  his  speech.  It  so  happens  that  the

guarantor  in  this  case feels  that  we  are  a  safe

security and that we have sufficient assets in any case

if we default. There the position lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -

he is moving an amendment to sub-clause (6)  in page 3.

Does any other Member wish to move any amendments

before sub-clause (6)? This is the opportunity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In view of the statement made by the

Minister,  Sir, I should like to move an  amendment  to

sub-clause (5) .



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Sub-clause (5), yes. Will the Member

indicate the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In page 3, line 15, after "shall", to

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the words to be inserted could

simply be "after approval by the Legislative Assembly".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, if it please you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please move then.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of the

comments  made  in  reply  to  the  criticisms  on  the

somewhat unconstitutional procedure sought whereby this

Assembly should abdicate its powers and scrap its  laws

and put everything into the hands of the Government  to

do  what  it will, I now recognise, as I had suspected,

that  it  is  the  Bank that seeks protection  for  the

validity  of  its  agreement and is not  interested  in

investigating  our  laws  to  ascertain  it.  That   is

perfectly  legitimate on the part of the  Bank,  and  I

think  the constitutional position can be met  in  this

State  whereby both parties can be satisfied by  seeing

to  it that this Assembly is informed beforehand of the

provisions  of  the  loan and has  the  opportunity  to

debate  it openly. I do not think that there is  really

any  grave obstacle to that. Fortunately, loans, unlike

customs, taxes and income taxes, are not matters  which

need  be kept terribly secret until they are finalised,

and  here  no damage could possibly be done by advising

the Legislative Assembly beforehand of the exact nature

of  the  loan  agreement which would  be  tabled  as  a

document  and  which  could be  approved  by  a  simple

motion. Then the constitutional position would  be  met

whereby we have taken the responsibility for the  terms

therein      contained      and      therefore      the

words - "notwithstanding any written law to the contrary"

or "in conflict with any law in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



force  in  the  State" - those provisions are  no  longer

unconstitutional  because we have ourselves  considered

the  provisions  which might possibly be  conceived  as

being contrary to any of our laws, and we are satisfied

with  them and we have approved them; not that we would

approve  any  provision which is contrary  to  existing

laws, Sir,It would at that stage then be obvious  that

these provisions are not so much provisions whereby our

own  laws  are being set aside, but are provisions  for

satisfying the International Bank that in fact our laws

have   been   complied  with.   That   is   the   major

constitutional  distinction.  It  is  a   very   simple

procedure.  All I seek is that instead of  tabling  the

loan  agreement  under clause 7, which  would  then  be

deleted,  you  table the loan agreement  before  it  is

signed;  you  seek  the  approval  of  the  Legislative

Assembly and thereafter the provisions of clauses 6 and

8 will have effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be suggested that there may be matters of

urgency when the Assembly is not sitting. However,  you

have  heard, Mr Speaker, as indicated, that  the  Bank

takes  about a year to process our request for  a  loan

and  if we can wait a year for such processing, we  can

wait  a  year  and one month or maybe a  year  and  two

months,  Sir, in order to obtain that loan. But  I  can

say for myself, and I hope I can speak for the rest  of

the  Members  here, that where there  is  a  matter  of

urgency   requiring   a  substantial   loan   for   our

development  purposes, the Cabinet should not  hesitate

to reconvene this House exclusively for that purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do urge the Government to recognise that, as it

stands, the provisions here go against the grain of the

Rule  of  Law and that there is a very simple procedure

to meet the needs of the Bank and to meet the spirit of

the Rule of Law and that is to table the loan agreement

in  this  House and obtain approval by a simple  motion

before execution thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

inserted, be there inserted."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on the general observations

made by the Member for Anson that some of these clauses

really,  go against the grain, I think he, as a lawyer,

probably knows that it is quite invalid. In fact, it is

very  common for two parties to sign an agreement which

provides that notwithstanding any provision of the law,

they  will do such and such a thing. For instance,  the

parties  may say that they will send all their disputes

to  arbitration  in a certain manner although  the  law

provides that arbitration will be conducted in  another

manner. So to that extent, the Assembly itself  as  the

supreme legislative authority in this State can  decide

in  this instance that they will observe the conditions

of  the  loan agreement even though it might not square

with  some  minor  laws or Municipal by-laws  or  local

regulations that may be in force. I think my colleague,

the Minister for Law, has made that clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the proposal that the loan agreement

should  be approved in the Assembly before it is signed

on  behalf of the Government, I think it is a pity that

we  are  under  some difficulty over this.  First,  the

present  programme is extremely tight. As I have  said,

the U.K. Government is prepared to extend its guarantee

only within a matter of weeks from now: and if it comes

too  close to Malaysia, then they say it should he  the

Federation   Government  which  should  take   on   the

guarantee. That means a delay of some considerable time

because the Federation Treasury will want to go through

the  whole process all over again. The net result  will

be  very damaging to our expansion plan. But that is  a

practical difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one difficulty which will certainly stem

from  the World Bank philosophy itself. The World  Bank

has always wanted to make its operations independent of

political considerations. In other words, it  judges  a

country not by the colour of its Government but by  the

soundness  of  its currency, its economic institutions.

The last thing that the World Bank would want to happen

would  be  for  the terms of the agreement  to  be  the

subject  of  a  political  debate  in  the  Legislative

Assembly. It can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



well  happen  that certain parties may  take  political

advantage  of  some of the terms in  the  agreement  as

being unduly onerous or as being unduly difficult.  But

the terms of the World Bank are standard. They apply to

all  countries which want to borrow from the Bank,  and

variation is allowed only within very narrow limits.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, of course, if the Assembly were to make

any  variations to the terms of the loan agreement,  it

could well mean that the whole proposal then would have

to be abandoned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one of my difficulties here is that this is the

first  time  that we are negotiating a  loan  with  the

World  Bank  and it would be natural that  Members  may

think  they  are  being expected to  support  something

which is quite unknown. I can sympathise with that sort

of  attitude.  As  against  that,  I  put  forward  the

argument that the World Bank is a respectable authority

and  further that the terms and conditions  are  fairly

standard.  In  fact,  the area for negotiations  as  we

found   out  is  extremely  narrow  and  most  of   the

discussions that took place in Washington were  in  the

nature  of  discussing  the future  revenue,  cost  and

future  expansion  programme of  The  Public  Utilities

Board.  So far as the terms are concerned, as  I  said,

they  are pretty standard, and I do not think that much

purpose would be served by requiring that the agreement

be   approved   by  the  Legislative  Assembly   before

signature.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a valuable

Bill  and  I  can but regret that I seem to be  raising

technical  objections to it. But, Sir,  the  objections

are  of  a very grave charactor that go to the root  of

the constitutional concept of the Rule of Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has indicated that two parties can enter into an agreement, that despite an Arbitration Act, they will have a different kind of arbitration. But the fallacy there, Sir, is that it is two parties. In this case, it is not two parties who will be entering into agreement but one party with an agent of another party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



whose principal is unaware of the agreement because, in

this   case,   the  people  of  Singapore   and   their

representatives  would be unaware  and  would  thus  be

surrendering  completely their laws  and  their  power-making laws into the hands of the agent who is in  fact

then  told, "Irrespective of my wishes, go and do  what

you will." That is where the fallacy is and that is the

constitutional danger of these provisions. They  really

are  grave, Sir, when you ask the Assembly to say  that

despite any laws the Government can enter into any kind

of  financial agreement irrespective of the  fact  that

that  agreement is being entered into with an extremely

responsible and respectable body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this august Bank would not

wish  to  be  sullied by any debate in the Assembly  in

respect  of  the  terms  of  this  agreement.  But  the

Government has itself provided in this Bill under  sub-clause  (7)  of clause 3 that that agreement  should  be

tabled  and should be made public to this Assembly  and

to  the people, and consequently there is nothing  then

in  the  law to prevent a full debate on the  terms  of

that  agreement  and the conduct of the  Government  in

entering  into  it.  So  why are  you  preventing  this

agreement from being made the subject of a debate?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is suggested that there are practical

difficulties of an immediate character. I repeat,  Sir,

that it will be the duty of this Assembly - and I am sure

it will consider it a duty which it would react to with

alacrity - to attend when the agreement is ready, if  for

but  a  short  while and as a matter of  formality,  to

approve  that  loan agreement in order  to  enable  the

Government to execute it whenever it might be ready. On

the  other hand, if the Government is somewhat  nervous

in  the  context  of other political  animosities  that

exist,  then I suggest that this Bill should be limited

to  six months - an unhappy alternative. I would  rather

see  the  Bill,  to  whose other  features  I  have  no

objection, remain a permanent feature of our law, as it

should  be, and not a permanent breach of the  rule  of

law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

from the explanation given by the Minister for Finance, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



cannot  see  why  he cannot accept this amendment.  His

only  reason is that the British Government has  agreed

to act as a guarantor - this was only a few weeks ago. If

the  time were to be after this, the British Government

would not be willing to act as our guarantor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the Minister has said that

Singapore's delegates to negotiate with the World  Bank

have  just returned and that all terms of the agreement

have  been  reached. Therefore, I cannot  see  why  the

Government should not accept this amendment because the

delegates  can  still go there to negotiate  and  reach

agreement. At the same time, if in the next week or the

next  month the Government finds it necessary  or  very

urgent  to  get a loan, then I am sure that Members  of

this House will be very willing to have another sitting

convened to discuss the matter, say before the  7th  of

June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the loan by the Government from the World Bank will not be a very small sum; it will amount

to  several million dollars. According to the Minister,

$45 million will be borrowed for the development of the

Pasir  Panjang Power Station. Now, this is a  big  sum.

This  sum,  in  the end, will have to be  paid  by  the

people of Singapore. Therefore, it is necessary for the

Government  to let this House know the amount  and  the

conditions  of the loan to get the Assembly's  approval

before  going  ahead with the loan.  Without  such  an

approval  by this House, the Government will be  giving

the  impression to the people that there might be  some

inside  story - otherwise why can the Government not  let

the  loan be approved by the Assembly first before  the

Minister goes and signs the agreement for the loan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion therefore that the Government

should  accept  this amendment in order to  enable  the

representatives of the people and the people themselves

to  know exactly the amount the Government is going  to

borrow  and also the conditions to be embodied  in  the

agreement for the loan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Assembly is a

sovereign Legislature in that within its powers it  can

make  laws for the peace, order and good government  of

the State, and those powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



cannot under any circumstances be questioned. Sir, that

is a proposition which no constitutional lawyer, except

the  Member  for  Anson  who  is  well  known  for  his

eccentricities, would ever be prepared to challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Legislature is competent to enact that the terms

of an agreement entered into by the Government with the

International Bank shall have the force of law, and  if

there  is  any  conflict  between  the  terms  of   the

agreement and any Municipal law, the terms of the  loan

agreement shall prevail. The exercise of such  a  power

does not in any way derogate from the authority of this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I listened to the last

speaker  and I believe I understood him, which is  more

than  he  achieved, because I have at no time suggested

that  this  Assembly  is not competent  or  that  these

provisions  were  ultra  vires except  insofar  as  the

agreement might be ultra vires the Constitution. I have

not  suggested  that. I know that we are  competent  to

denude  ourselves of our powers and  put  them  in  the

hands  of the dictator. That is what I say goes against

the  grain  of the rule of the law. But it  is  not  on

technicalities  and I am sorry it is on  technicalities

the Minister has seen fit to try to reply and failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the question of the spirit of respect for

constitutional  procedure and for this House - and  I  do

appeal  to this Government to recognise that it  has  a

simple  way out - whereby the legitimate requirements

of  the  Bank can be met and the respect of this House,

adequate respect, can be shown and for the Rule of Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> When I raised the question, I was not

wanting  this  House  to sight  a  draft  copy  of  the

agreement  before the loans were made, Sir. All  I  was

interested  in was the proposition that this  Bill,  on

the  face  of  it, seems to confer on the Government  a

power whereby they could commit the Ex-chequer of  this

country to loans without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



the  knowledge of this Assembly, and I thought that was

a thing wrong in principle and I still hold to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the title of the Bill and from the manner in

which it has been drafted, it seems to me that the life

of this Bill cannot go beyond the 31st of August. 1963.

That  seems  to me to be the position. In other  words,

the  life of this Bill is for five months. Five  months

is the possible life of this Bill, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It could be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Up to 31st August? Could it go beyond

that? That is the point. So far as I am concerned,  all

I  am  interested in is this. The Minister for  Finance

has  told us that he has only two projects in  mind  on

which he is going to the World Bank for a loan: one  is

the  electricity project; and the other  is  the  water

project. I take it that the water project is the Johore

River  scheme  and  that the electric  project  is  the

extension  to the Pasir Panjang Power Station.  Insofar

as   the  electricity  extensions  are  concerned,  the

Minister  has indicated that the loan will  be  to  the

extent  of  $45  million. On  that  score,  Sir,  I  am

satisfied. The terms of the agree-merit, the manner  in

which repayment is to be effected, that is a matter,  I

think, we must leave to the Minister to achieve.  I  am

not  interested  in that. What I am interested  on  the

water side is, how much money does the Minister hope to

raise from the World Bank? If I am satisfied that those

amounts  are  well within the paying capacity  of  this

country,  so far as I am concerned, I will support  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Two points were raised by the

Member  for Farrer Park. First, the life of  the  Bill.

Well,  the  Bill will have validity after the  31st  of

August this year because after the 31st of August  this

year   the   Government  that  will  be  the  guarantor

Government  will  be  the  Central  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya, and therefore this  can  go  on

because  the British Government then will have no  more

responsibility to guarantee any loans asked by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards the water project. Perhaps I can

mention  that the World Bank will pay only the  foreign

exchange



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



content  of the total cost of the development  project.

For  instance, the Power Station in Singapore will cost

much  more than $45 million. But $45 million represents

the  cost  of equipment and services we have to  import

from abroad. In fact, this is really the payment of the

foreign  exchange  counterpart  of  the  cost  of  this

development  project. Now, so far as the power  station

goes, it is a very high percentage.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, for water it is a very low percentage

because most of the work consists of earthworks,  pipes

and  so  on which are made locally. So I am afraid  the

amount  of loan we can get from the World Bank for  the

water project will represent a very small proportion of

the total cost. How much it is I do not know. That is a

matter  which  their experts will come  and  work  out. [Pause]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot to reply to some of the points raised by the

Member  for Anson. The Member for Anson seems to  think

that  this is in some way unconstitutional and  against

the  Rule  of Law, that we are trying to close  a  deal

with  the  World Bank without the Assembly  giving  its

approval. I know of no independent country in the world

which  provides that a World Bank loan shall be subject

to the approval of the legislature. What the Member for

Anson  is  asking for the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  is

something unique in legislative experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, in page 3, to

delete the whole of sub-clause (6).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is with regret that I find that I have not been understood in my efforts to attract the attention of this Government to the appropriate constitutional procedure in a constitutional spirit, and that is that before this Assembly can abdicate its powers in respect of any particular law it should know what that law is and, if only nominally, that agreement

should be approved by it. I cannot, Sir, now that  that

provision  has  been  defeated, in  conscience,  permit

myself  to  agree  to sub-clause (6)   which  permits  a

Minister to sign an agreement which supersedes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



all  law. That is in flagrant breach of the Rule of Law

of which their own leader was allegedly an exponent not

so  long  ago  in  New Delhi. Our experience  has  been

before  and  after  Delhi that their  words  are  never

translated into acts. Actually you can always count  on

this  Government  to  deprive the  legislature  of  its

powers  and  to  channelise all powers  into  a  single

dictatorship.  This is it. Whether it  is  utilised  or

not,  in  law,  by  passing  sub-clause  (6),  we   are

abdicating  our  right to pass laws, because  we  would

give them the right not only to ignore any existing law

but to take precedence over any future law. I shall  be

voting  against this clause and I regret to inform  you

that I will be calling for a Division.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I can understand the anxieties

in  the mind of the Member for Anson. But if we look at

this  legislation in the proper perspective, we may  be

able  to  have a better appreciation of the reason  why

such  a  clause is necessary. Sir, this  is  a  law  to

enable   the  Government  to  borrow  money  from   the

International Bank, and the International Bank  is  not

just  a `business corporation where it will do its best

to  get the best terms possible out of borrowers. It is

a  bank of international standing meant to help develop

countries  which are in need of finance  in  regard  to

projects  in  which the International Bank  itself  has

confidence that such development would be in  the  best

interests  of the economy of the country. So the  Bank,

before  lending money to any government to help develop

the country, will want to satisfy itself that the money

is  going  to  help  the  country  in  its  development

projects  and  not  to  help the government  to  remain

longer  in  office, or to help the government  to  hold

some  more rallies around the rural areas to  meet  the

people.  This  is  for  a definite development  project

meant  for  the  economic uplift of the  country.  And.

therefore,  once  the  Bank  has  decided  to  lend   a

government  large sums of money to help the country  to

raise  its economic standard, surely I do not  consider

it  wrong that the lender should want to see that there

is sufficient protection that that money which has been

loaned i well protected by law. I do not think that the

World Bank will be wanting to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



demand  from  any borrowing government terms  that  are

immoral  or  terms that are going to tie the government

to   the  chariot  wheel  of  any  particular  country.

Therefore,  why all the worry at all? What we  want  to

know  is,  do  we want this money to help  develop  the

country? If we do, and if those are the terms on  which

the  International Bank can only lend us the money, let

us   face   it:  let  us  accept  the  terms   of   the

International Bank.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Sub-clause (7). May I draw the

attention  of the Minister to a procedural matter?  The

sub-clause  suggests that a copy of the loan  agreement

shall  be presented to the Legislative Assembly  within

30 days of the conclusion of the loan agreement, or, if

the Legislative Assembly does not sit within that time,

the copy shall be presented to the Legislative Assembly

within  15  days  after the commencement  of  its  next

sitting.  The  position here is that  a  paper  can  be

presented  to  the Assembly even when  the  Legislative

Assembly  is not sitting. It is only when the  Assembly

is  dissolved that no papers can be presented.'  So  if

the  Minister will consider altering the last  part  of

the sub-clause to read: "or if the Legislative Assembly

has  been dissolved, the copy shall be resented to  the

new  Legislative Assembly within fifteen days after the

commencement of its first session", that will meet  the

procedural position here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The copies are with the Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill  be  now read a Second time." I may add  that  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara has given his recommendation  in

respect of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill was introduced during the last Session of the Legislative Assembly. It was committed to Select Committee and reported by the Select Committee without amendment. However, the Assembly was prorogued before the Report could be adopted and the Bill read a Third time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains nearly all the same provisions as

the  Bill introduced in the last Session except for two

changes. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



first is contained in clause 40 (2)  which requires that

a  certificate be issued by the Minister as  conclusive

evidence of the transfer and the vesting in the  Public

Utilities  Board  of  the water,  gas  and  electricity

undertakings  of the City Council and their  respective

assets and liabilities should such evidence be required

in  a statutory form: for example, by the Registrar  of

Stocks in which the City Council has invested. This has

been done at the request of and after consultation with

the  City Treasurer and is intended to provide a  means

to  dispel  any  dispute  that  might  arise  over  the

identity  or  amount of the former City Council  assets

transferred  to the Public Utilities Board.  A  similar

provision  to  cover the assets to  be  transferred  to

Government  is also included in clause  5  (3)   of  the

Local  Government Integration Bill which is  not  being

proceeded  with  on a Certificate of  Urgency  because,

unlike  this Bill, it does not need to be so  proceeded

with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second new proviso is clause 40 (2) which gives

power  to the Minister to direct any person to transfer

to  the service of the Public Utilities Board, to  give

such  advice  and  to carry out such  acts  as  may  be

required  in relation to or arising out of the transfer

to  and the vesting in the Government of the assets and

liabilities  of the City Council and Rural Board.  This

provision  has been put in at the request of  the  City

Treasurer  to enable that officer, who will become  the

Chief  Financial Officer of the Public Utilities  Board

when  formed, to complete the winding-up of the  former

City   Council   accounts,  divide   the   assets   and

liabilities and transfer such to the Government and the

Public  Utilities Board respectively.  The  final  City

Council accounts were closed as at 31st December, 1960.



Mr  Speaker, Sir, I see from the notice of amendments on  this  Bill  that the Member for Anson has  proposed certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



amendments.<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19630405/19630405-fn-1963-04-05 Col 115.txt"">*</a>

May I say to him simply this? I  will  be

quite  happy  to consider the merits of the  amendments

and  I  give  an undertaking that after the  amendments

have  been considered, if they are valid, we shall move

an  amending  Bill in respect of those amendments.  The

reason  why  the  Bill  has been proceeded  with  on  a

Certificate of Urgency is that the World Bank will  not

lend  unless we move the Bill in its present  form,  to

which  they  have  agreed.  If  I  were  to  make   any

amendments,  even  though  they  may  not  affect   the

substance of the Bill insofar as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



they  are  concerned, it may lead to endless  arguments

with  the World Bank Authority as to whether or not  it

has  deprived them of their security on the loan. There

are  two conditions on which they give such a loan. One

is  that the public utilities are vested in a statutory

corporation,   which  is  sufficiently  divested   from

Government  control to a statutory body to ensure  them

certain  guarantees as to the economic running  of  the

corporation  which  will  take into  consideration  the

repayment of the loan. The other is the guarantee by  a

member  nation. My colleague, the Minister for Finance,

has explained the guarantee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I would like to say on the first point is that

whilst there may be merit in some of the amendments  he

has  proposed,  I  think I will be put  to  unnecessary

argument with the World Bank to show that, in fact,  it

has not materially altered the worthiness and guarantee

of  the  independent  statutory nature  of  the  Public

Utilities Board. I therefore ask the Member to consider

this  point, that we allow this Bill to go  through  in

its  present  form  and,  after  consideration  by  the

S.A.G's Chambers in consultation with the World  Bank,

if  there are any amendments which the Member wishes to

press, we shall proceed on an amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am startled by the

courtesy of the Prime Minister and I trust he will  not

take that as a discourteous reply. I am indeed startled

and I appreciate it. I would like to co-operate as much

as  I  can.  Can I have some indication,  if  you  will

permit, Sir? There is one matter of major gravity - I am

prepared  to  concede  the  others -  the  question   of

ministerial interference which I have sought  to  amend

in  departmental affairs, particularly  the  danger  of

having  the  Minister  responsible  for  salaries   and

emoluments, which would make it a political issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main value of having a public utility is that the

trade unions can deal with a statutory body and not  on

a  political  basis. Those are some  of  the  important

points.  But the major one is clause 20 which  deprives

the  citizen of his right to sue the Board, and I  feel

quite  certain that the intention was not there. But  I

am  satisfied in my own mind, Sir. They have copied  it

from section 396 of the Municipal Ordinance, which  was

modified'   in  section  50  of  the  Local  Government

Ordinance,  and now he has copied - just one copied  from

the other, Sir. They forgot that in the first Municipal

Ordinance,   they  were  dealing  with  human   beings - Commissioners -using the word "them",  whereas  in  this

Bill  they are using the word "Board", which  is  "it".

Forgive me for being technical for the moment. I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



satisfied that the gist of it is that neither the Board

nor  any of its members, nor any of its employees would

be  liable for any breach of contract or tort,  or  for

negligence in respect of any duties bona fide  executed

by  him. So that, Sir, if I am an employee of the Board

and  I go to test your meter and I ram your wall and  I

bring  down  all your furniture and I injure  all  your

children,  the Board is not liable, and  a  great  many

other  eventualities of that character.  I  feel  quite

certain,  Sir, that after the passage of the  1955  Act

which   repealed  the  Public  Authorities   Protection

Ordinance, that that is not the intention and  that  it

is,   shall  we  say,  inadvertent.  I  am  not  always

attaching the worst possible connotation to the conduct

of  the Government. I trust that I am at times, if only

at  times,  reasonable, Sir. Here this is a very  grave

inroad  into the security and rights of the  people  of

Singapore.  If  the  Prime Minister  will  give  me  an

assurance  that  an opportunity by way of  an  amending

Bill  will  be  given  at  the  next  sitting  of  this

Assembly, I will be very happy to concede, in  view  of

his urgent request that the amendments be not proceeded

with  today. And if I might have the further assurance,

which  I  feel  he would be prepared to give,  that  if

there  are  any  people  deprived  of,  shall  we  say,

legitimate  rights  in the interim  period  due  to  an

inadvertent  section  which  deprives  them  of   those

rights,  then  the  amending Ordinance  would  be  made

retrospective.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No Member wishing to speak on the Second

Reading? Mr Prime Minister, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I give the assurance, Sir,I

would  be  loath  to give an answer  forthwith  on  the

interpretation  that has been given by the  Member  for

Anson on this point. But I accept the point that if, in

fact, it was not intended to deprive any member of  the

public of a remedy which would otherwise have been open

to him as a result of the Public Authorities Protection

Ordinance, then we shall make it retrospective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

upon  the Table a Certificate of Urgency signed by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in respect of the  Rural  Board

(Unauthorised Buildings) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are typed

copies of the Bill available ?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. They have been given to the

Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill he now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Explanatory Statement puts it, the Local

Government  Ordinance provides for  summary  powers  to

deal   with   demolition  or  removal  of  unauthorised

structures and for penalties for the sale or  agreement

to  sell an unauthorised building. Unfortunately,  this

only  applies to the City Council area. The Bill  seeks

to provide for similar powers to deal with unauthorised

structures  in  the  areas administered  by  the  Rural

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are extremely concerned with the spate of

unauthorised  structures that are being  built  in  the

rural areas in utter disregard of structural and health

requirements,  and  even fire safety requirements.  The

difficulty  is that to go by the ordinary processes  of

the  law  would  take anywhere between  three  and  six

months, by which time somebody would already have  been

swindled  into buying the house, gone into  occupation,

and there is all the unpleasantness and the unhappiness

of  having  to  evict  him from  what  is  an  unlawful

structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are purely transitional. It re-enacts

sections 170 and 170A of the Local Government Ordinance

so  that  the  powers contained in these  two  sections

could be extended to the rural areas. The Bill will not

be  required  any  longer  when  the  Local  Government

Integration  Bill, the First Reading for  which  notice

has been given, has been introduced and becomes law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in connection with

the   Rural   Board   (Unauthorised   Buildings)   Bill

introduced  by  the Government, which will  extend  its

powers  to the rural areas, the time indeed is  reached

when  proper  control  is  required  over  unauthorised

structures. We have supported the steps to  look  after

the  interest of the public. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker,

because  the  power will be extended  to  the  Southern

Islands - the  Southern Islands comes  under  the  Rural

Board - I ask the authorities concerned to implement this

Bill  in such a manner as to give due consideration  to

the  conditions prevailing in the areas  concerned.  In

the  application of these -by-laws, no mercy should  be

shown   to   those  people  who  put  up   unauthorised

structures  solely for the purpose of  profiteering  at

the,   expense  of  the  innocent  victims.   But   due

consideration should be given to those victimised. What

I  mean  is that, firstly, the reason why such  victims

commit this offence is that they are in the dark  about

the  existing regulations. Also, because they are  hard

pressed with certain conditions. For instance, a family

which  is  increasing will require  more  floor  space.

Under  such  conditions, how car' they strictly  follow

the   regulations -  regulations  which   they   cannot

understand  and  which  they  break  intentionally   or

otherwise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that the officers implementing these by-laws should make the people understand these

regulations and not intimidate or threaten them. I know

of an instance where a resident in the Islands extended

his  dwelling house without complying with the approved

plan.  When  this  came to the notice  of  the  officer

concerned, the house owner was informed that his  house

must  be reconstructed to conform to the approved plan,

failing  which  action would be taken to  demolish  the

house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this method of implementing the rules or

regulations amounts to intimidation or threatening  the

people  who  do not know the rules and regulations.  On

such  matters, Mr Speaker, the officers concerned must

use  their discretion and enforce rules that should  be

understood by the people.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

about  this Bill relating to unauthorised buildings  in

the  rural areas, as has been explained by my colleague

the  Member  for the Southern Islands, we  cannot  deny

that proper control is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that this Bill is to be introduced on a

Certificate  of  Urgency. Therefore, I must  take  this

opportunity  to tell this House how these rules  should

be  enforced on the defaulters. What is the meaning  of

the  word "unauthorised" in the real sense of the  word

in  relation  to  dwelling  houses?  Does  it  mean  an

unauthorised dwelling built without a permit  on  other

people's land, and built without regard to lire hazards

and  health  considerations? In  my  constituency,  Mr

Speaker,  from  my  experience from  the  time  of  the

previous Government up to the present Government, it is

difficult for people to build houses, and those  houses

that were built were illegally built. Can we apply  the

term "unauthorised" to these houses, or can we allocate

them house numbers? Mr Speaker, most of the people  in

my  constituency at this moment have bought sites  from

lessees, and they have paid for these sites with  money - from  $600  to $2,000 - as "gratuity". What concerns  me,

Mr  Speaker, is that the intention of these people  is

to  build  houses,  but  the lessees  cannot  sign  any

documents for the purpose of obtaining permits from the

Building  Surveyor's Department. The  lessees  are  not

concerned,  and so the victims are the ordinary  people

who have been cheated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I appeal to the authorities, through the

Government,  to consider this aspect of the  matter.  I

have personally experienced it, and I think it has been

brought  to  the  notice of the Minister  for  National

Development  that the Government, as a Government,  can

consider the position of the victims. These victims not

only  paid  a "gratuity" or coffee money but they  also

paid  other expenses as well. So I hope the authorities

will  give serious consideration to this matter. It  is

because  these  people  have  become  the  victims   of

unscrupulous people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I agree with the

sentiments  expressed  by the Member  of  the  Southern

Islands and the Member for Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



I  think the purpose of this Bill is to make sure  that

the  innocent victim does not suffer. If we  can  smack

down  an  illegal  building  fast  enough  before   the

contractor or the illegal building operator has  had  a

chance  to sell it to the poor victim, the chances  are

that  only the illegal building operator who can afford

to  suffer  will bear the loss of having his  wood  and

nails torn asunder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, after listening to the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan  and  the Member  for  the  Southern

Islands, that, in fact, it is an indictment against our

society  that  many of these victims, in  buying  these

illegal  houses are consciously taking a risk.  Vaguely

they  know  that  something is  not  quite  all  right,

because the contractor usually wants them to move  into

occupation in the middle of the night. Usually they  do

move  in  the  middle  of  the night  because  building

operations  are  conducted  in  darkness  and  wherever

possible  on the following morning there is  already  a

family in occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this assurance to the Member for the Southern

Islands,  that where a family is already in  occupation

of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



houses,  then  of  course  humanitarian  considerations

apply. And in the administration of this Bill, we shall

have   to  consider  the  question  of  human  feelings

involved in having to evict physically a person from  a

building  on  which  he  has probably  spent  his  life

savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am happy to report that in the city areas,

where  similar provisions have applied, partly  because

of  the  promptness  of the Chief  Building  Surveyor's

Department  and partly because of the large  number  of

flats  which  have been built, such operations  are  no

longer profitable, and I hope similar provisions ---
