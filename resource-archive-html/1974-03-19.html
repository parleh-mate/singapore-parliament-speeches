<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head GA --



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head GA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1003*. (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the description of Singapore as

a  pragmatic society seems to be apt, judging from

Singapore's  hard-headed and no-nonsense  approach

to various activities, whether social, economic or

political.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the matter of labour, the Singapore

Government   has  never  allowed  itself   to   be

discouraged from carrying out its conviction.  The

unpleasant and unpopular employment legislation of

1968    bears    witness   to   the   Government's

determination and willingness to strive  for  what

it  considers  to  be  objectively  desirable  for

Singapore as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Employment Act of 1968, however,

provisions were made for the basic legal framework

of a comprehensive Employment Exchange. Up to that

time  the  Exchange,  then  known  as  the  Labour

Exchange,  was operated by the Ministry of  Labour

as  part  of  its ancillary services  for  clerks,

labourers and shop assistants. With the passing of

the  Employment  Act, it might have  been  thought

then  that a decisive advantage would be taken  of

the  new  Employment Exchange  to  regularise  the

situation  affecting  job seekers.  To  a  certain

extent  the  subsequent action of the Ministry  of

Labour  in  upgrading the Exchange  by  having  it

headed  by officers of administrative grade rather

than executive grade seemed to justify this hope.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost six years later, the Employment Exchange

which   the  Ministry  prefers  to  call  it   the

Employment  Service  seems to  have  been  stunted

since birth. True, the Employment Service can  now

boast  of a handful of registrants averaging  less

than  1  per cent of the total, who are university

or  college  graduates looking for administrative,

managerial  or executive openings.  But  the  fact

remains  that no employer is under any  obligation

to  inform  the  Service of  any  vacancy  in  his

establishment or to recruit new employees  through

the Service. Employers in Singapore mostly recruit

either directly or through employment agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overshadowing all these agencies and the

Employment Service itself is the machinery set  up

by  MINDEF  to  place  ex-national  servicemen  in

civilian    employment.    Granted    that     the

determination of MINDEF to look after the  welfare

of  ex-national servicemen is commendable,  but  I

think any emplacement of persons in suitable  jobs

should  fall  within the scope of  the  Employment

Service.  The  very  fact that MINDEF  thought  it

necessary  to  duplicate  the  functions  of   the

Employment Service gives rise to two inferences  - either MINDEF is engaged in empire building or the

Ministry of Labour is shirking its responsibility.

If  all  employment opportunities are notified  to

and  filled  through the Employment  Service,  the

first  priority  for  ex-national  servicemen  can

still  be assured, just as MINDEF can arrange  for

housing  priority for reservists in  the  National

Service through the Housing and Development Board,

without  MINDEF having to set up its  own  housing

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pertinent point is that the present

underdeveloped  form  of  the  Employment  Service

causes the Government to rule by guesswork  in  an

important  area  of labour. We have  comprehensive

data  on  the total labour force, the distribution

of  such  labour force by occupation, industry  or

sex and even the number of work permit holders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



But we have no reliable statistics on the rate  of

turnover  of workers in the whole of Singapore  or

in   an  industry  or  firm.  Not  too  long   ago

conditions  for  the issue of  work  permits  were

tightened because of some employers' complaints of

the  high turnover of work permit holders.  If  we

have  authoritative  and  reliable  statistics  at

hand, we can know whether the rate of turnover for

work  permit  holders in a particular industry  or

establishment is matched by the rate  of  turnover

for non-permit holders. If the rate of turnover is

just  as  high  for  work permit  holders  as  for

Singapore  citizens, then obviously  something  is

wrong in that industry or establishment. The  fact

that  workers are non-citizens does not mean  that

unscrupulous  employers should be allowed  to  get

away with the intolerable working conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, it is a matter of great regret that the

Employment Service has not availed itself  of  the

enlarged  scope  under Part XI of  the  Employment

Act.  The present Service is like putting together

a jumbo bus body with the engine of a mini-bus and

expecting  the ill-assembled vehicle  to  function

effectively.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, since there is

a   great  shortage  of  manpower  both   in   the

Government and the private sectors, it is time the

Government relaxed the ruling governing the  lower

income  group and allow them to work after  office

hours.   This  could  be  regulated  by   imposing

conditions,  such  as controlling  the  number  of

extra  hours  they work, etc. After all,  teachers

are  permitted to work up to six extra hours after

their  teaching hours, and yet the Government  has

not  relaxed the ruling for the lower income group

of  Government servants. The cost of living  being

so  high,  a relaxation in this ruling  will  help

them to reduce their sufferings; because there  is

evidence  that  many people are working  on  extra

jobs as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



gardeners,  cooks and drivers after  their  office

hours and are not detected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring to the notice of the Minister

the  exploitation  of both our citizens  and  non-citizens   by  many  employers.  There  are   many

factories  which employ workers who are below  the

minimum  legal  employable age.  To  make  matters

worse, many non-citizens are employed illegally at

reduced pay and with no benefits whatever. Most of

these misdeeds occur during night shift hours when

our  Labour  Ministry sleeps. It is time  surprise

checks  were  made at night so as to minimise  the

exploitation by some employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past there was a provision in the

Employment Act enabling workers to be entitled for

domicile leave after certain years of service. But

this  provision has been gradually withdrawn. This

withdrawal  has  caused many daily-rated  workers,

who  have  served many years of dedicated service,

to  pack up. Their decision was made because  many

of  them had to visit parents and relatives abroad

every four or five years. But now with the imposed

restrictions  they  have no other  choice  but  to

leave for good. Since Singapore is short of labour

now  and  until  such time as we have  an  optimum

labour  force, a relaxation of the law would  help

our  labour market to a certain extent.  Will  the

Minister consider the suggestion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year it was announced that non-citizens wishing to marry Singapore citizens

should  get the prior approval of the Commissioner

for Employment. What were the reasons behind this?

Is  it  true  that in every case the newly-married

non-citizens  will seek employment here?  Can  the

Minister elaborate on the subject?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more item which I would like to ask is this:

what  precautionary steps has the Labour  Ministry

taken against the incidence of silicosis among the

sand-blasting workers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  two amendments* to raise on the Ministry  of

Labour. With your permission, Sir, may I speak  on

them  now,  so that I need not raise them  at  the

proper time?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in regard to inflation and

rising cost of production which are threatening to

jeopardise the competitiveness of our exports, may

I  suggest  that,  since one of  the  contributing

factors  of  this high cost of production  is  the

present shortage of labour, we reassess the  basis

upon which our Employment Act rests. Since this is

a  difficult  year  it may be desirable  to  adopt

emergency  measures to tide us  over  the  present

crisis.   For  example,  overtime   is   now   not

compulsory, and to meet target dates if  employers

need  the services of some employees for more than

48 hours per week, it is often difficult to ensure

that   overtime  is  performed  because   of   the

restriction  imposed by the  existing  law.  As  a

consequence,  in order to meet the  deadline  some

employers are carrying more staff than they  need.

This  has  two adverse effects. Firstly,  it  will

aggravate the labour situation and, secondly,  the

cost  of production will be pushed up, thus making

our goods less competitive internationally.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore has to export in order to

survive,   it   may  be  worthwhile  to   consider

exploring  the  need  for compulsory  overtime  in

certain essential areas. While this may help  ease

our labour shortage as well as reduce costs, this,

of  course, can only be considered after full  and

exhaustive discussions with the NTUC.  I  am  sure

that  members  of our trade unions, who  have  the

interests  of  our young nation at heart  and  who

fully appreciate the need for our



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendments read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head GA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead HA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the total sum to be allocated for Head

GA in respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



survival,  may  be  prepared  to  accept   certain

restraints  during  this crucial  year  that  lies

ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue which I would like to draw the

attention  of the Minister is the applications  of

permanent residents to marry Singapore citizens. I

would  like the Minister to investigate why it  is

necessary  to  take  two  months  to  process  the

applications.  Once a person, who has  been  given

permanent  residence in Singapore, is prepared  to

renounce whatever citizenship he holds, he  should

be given permission without undue delay. Sir, I am

not  suggesting  that this permission  be  granted

indiscriminately, but a permanent resident who has

stayed  in  Singapore  for more  than  five  years

obviously  has  every intention to make  Singapore

his  home. And if he has regular employment during

the last five years, there should not be any undue

delay in processing the application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in affairs of the heart, the

Government should not take a hard line,  otherwise

the impression will be given that our Ministers do

not  know  what  falling in love  means.  All  our

Ministers  are  successfully  married,  and   they

should encourage permanent residents to marry  and

settle  down  instead of having permanent  affairs

with our Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has all along

stressed   the  point  that  we  have  reached   a

situation of full employment. In recent years,  we

even have to accept foreign labour into our labour

force  in order to keep up our production  in  the

various  trades and commercial lines.  This  is  a

fact.   At   the   moment,   many   factories   or

organisations engaged in production find that they

lack  manpower. From my own observation, I  notice

that  the  Ministry of Labour is also  trying  its

best to remedy this shortage of labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have discovered another fact, and

that  is  there are still many unemployed  people,

who  are  mainly  youngsters,  roaming  about  the

streets, doing nothing. By mentioning this,  I  do

not  mean  to blame the Government for not  having

done  anything  to help them, or to  provide  them

with any employment. My purpose is to find out why

there  are  so  many youths still unemployed  when

there are so many jobs available to them, and that

they  would  rather roam the streets like  loafers

doing  nothing, and complaining to everybody  that

they  are unemployed. Some of them even seek  help

from  Members of Parliament to get jobs for  them.

When  I  talk about this, I must avail  myself  of

this opportunity to thank the senior Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Labour  for  having

given a lot of help to MPs in this respect. He has

been  trying his best to get jobs for  these  job-seekers,  but,  however, they have  not  responded

well  to the job opportunities given by him.  Here

is  a fact which is normal to state, and I believe

the Minister will pay attention to it: because  we

do  not  have  natural resources,  therefore,  our

citizens should be our natural resources. If  they

are  wasting  away their time and eat  away  their

assets,  I  feel  that they  are  a  loss  to  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we should also encourage

savings.  We  should understand that these  youths

have been softened by circumstances. They did  not

work hard in school, so they were dropped out, and

they feel that they have no chance to be one-up on

others and they fight shy of taking up jobs  which

they consider lower than what they should take on.

On  the  one hand, they do not want to  study  all

over  again  to educate themselves. On  the  other

hand,  they are not willing to take up jobs  which

they consider are not suitable, not matching their

positions, or below their dignity to accept.  Thus

in  the  end  they roam the streets. They  do  not

believe in the philosophy that taking on any  kind

of job is honourable,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



provided  one  has asserted one's ability  and  is

earning  an honest living out of it. Perhaps  this

is  the  sort of philosophy of these people  which

should  be  understood first before tackling  this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about delinquents or those who are about to

become delinquents, the Government should try  its

best  to take immediate measures to save them from

becoming  delinquents or from degrading themselves

further.  Otherwise it will lead  to  a  situation

which will be beyond remedy. I wonder whether  the

Ministry  of  Labour has any plans  to  help  such

people.  In  the  past, I seldom  heard  from  the

Ministry  of anything relating to delinquency.  If

the  Minister  had neglected this problem  in  the

past,  I  would  like to take this opportunity  to

remind him and to urge him to take immediate steps

to  solve this problem so that the hard-won assets

and  fruits that we have got through the hard work

of our people will not be lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, to prevent these people from

becoming soft, I feel that the Ministry of  Labour

should  adopt harsher measures to get these people

into  our  production lines. In  this  respect,  I

suggest  that we incorporate this measure  in  the

Employment  Act so that every able-bodied  person,

particularly  our youths, would have  to  take  up

some  kind of job, otherwise they would  be  dealt

with  by the law. If we can do this, then we  will

be  able  to  go  one  step  forward  towards  the

solution  of employment problems and be closer  to

full  employment. Then every citizen or youth will

have a job and he will not have to waste his time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the fundamental objective  of  the

Ministry  of  Labour  Employment  Service  is   to

facilitate  employment  process  and  improve  the

efficient utilisation of the labour force.  It  is

open  to  every  citizen. On the other  hand,  the

Direction of Employment Department in the Ministry

of  Defence was set up with the specific  task  of

helping  national servicemen, who  have  completed

their  full-time national service liabilities,  to

look for civilian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



employment.  For  obvious  military  reasons,  the

Ministry of Defence would want to handle this  job

itself.  However,  in spite of the  difference  in

objective, the procedures involved in implementing

the  objectives  are  somewhat  similar.  In  this

connection, there has been close working relations

between the two bodies to ensure that no person or

establishment is inconvenienced as a result of the

setting  up  of  these two bodies  to  look  after

employment   matters.  There  is,  therefore,   no

necessity to merge the two to establish a  central

agency for handling employment matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised the question of

exploitation  by  employers of workers  below  the

minimum legal employable age. Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Ministry  is quite aware that there are  employers

who   engage  workers  below  the  minimum   legal

employable  age without first obtaining  clearance

from the Ministry. Labour Officers from the Labour

Inspectorate, on their routine or surprise  checks

on  factories,  are constantly on the  lookout  to

ensure  that  no under-aged workers  are  employed

without  prior  approval from  the  Ministry  and,

where  permission has been granted, to see  to  it

that  the conditions imposed are adhered  to.  The

conditions imposed include disallowing  the  young

person  to:  (a)  work  on any  service  involving

management  of  or  attendance  on  machinery   in

motion;   (b)   work  on  any  service   involving

management  of  or attendance on or  proximity  to

live  apparatus  not properly  insulated;  (c)  be

employed  as  a workman during the night;  (d)  be

employed as a workman on a rest day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson may wish to know that last

year, 19 employers were convicted for engaging  71

under-aged    workers   without    applying    for

certificates  of registration, and  were  fined  a

total sum of over $9,000. As for employment of non-citizens without work permits, I think the  Member

for  Anson  should  be  well aware  that  constant

checks by Labour Officers are being carried out in

factories and construction sites. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  is  fully  aware  that  there  are  many

industries operating on night shifts and that some

employers  are engaging non-citizens without  work

permits to man these shifts. The Member for  Anson

may  be  assured  that the Ministry  does  conduct

random  spot checks at night not only  to  prevent

illegal  employment of non-citizens  but  also  to

ensure  that  working conditions are  satisfactory

during the night. Labour Officers are required  to

carry out night inspections by rotation. With  the

recent  acquisition  of a Ford  transit  van,  the

Ministry  hopes to step up its night  enforcement.

For  the  information of the Member for Anson,  an

aggregate  of  103 employers were prosecuted  last

year  for  engaging 229 non-citizens without  work

permits,  and the total fine imposed  amounted  to

about   $46,000.   The  Labour   Inspectorate   is

therefore not sleeping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised the question as

to  why  marriage of non-citizens should seek  the

approval   of  the  Commissioner  for  Employment.

Presently,   a  large  majority  of  non-citizens,

wishing   to  contract  marriage  with   Singapore

citizens,  are  work  permit  holders   and   are,

therefore,  already in employment when they  apply

for  approval to contract marriage. It is presumed

that  most of them are likely to continue  working

after  marriage in order to increase their  family

income so as to enjoy a higher standard of living.

However,  this is not of major consideration.  The

reasons for the need to seek prior approval of the

Commissioner  for Employment for  marriage  to  be

contracted  between a citizen and  a  work  permit

holder  are  contained  in a Government  statement

issued  on  the  25th June, 1973.  I  presume  the

Member  for  Anson  has not read the  Government's

statement and, for his benefit and those like him,

I would like to read extracts of the statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One significant facet of Singapore's economic

growth has been the easy employment situation  for

young  school  leavers and others still  in  their

teens.  They come into contact with equally  young

workers on work permit in Singapore. It is natural

for  these  young workers on work permits,  having

found their bearings, to make friends and mix



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



freely in our society. After a time, many of  them

may  want to marry, settle down and raise families

in  Singapore.  This evolution  can  result  in  a

healthy infusion of vigorous and hardworking types

to  Singapore's  population,  provided  they  have

acquired  work  skills  and  are  industrious  and

thrifty.  These qualities are essential  if  these

young  people  are  to be integrated  successfully

into Singapore's society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it takes time for such attributes to be

proven   in  regular  and  successful  employment.

Unless  the work permit worker is adjusted to  the

different  and  faster pace of life  in  a  highly

disciplined  and  urbanised society,  and  to  the

ethos  of small planned families, marriage between

a  work permit holder and a Singapore citizen  can

lead   to   difficulty  for  themselves  and   for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour has decided to discourage

these   young   workers  on  work   permits   from

contracting early marriages until they have  shown

that they are able to settle down successfully  in

Singapore and to support a small family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st July, 1973, it will be necessary for a

work permit holder to first obtain the approval of

the Commissioner for Employment before contracting

marriage  with  a  Singapore citizen.  A  marriage

between   work  permit  holders  where   Singapore

citizenship or permanent residence in Singapore is

not  acquired  nor desired will not require  prior

approval.



<br><br>I  hope  the Member for Anson will appreciate  now

the  reason why prior approval is necessary before

a  marriage  is contracted between a  work  permit

holder and a Singapore citizen or resident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned about the

delay in getting replies from the Commissioner for

Employment   in   respect  of   applications   for

marriages.  I hope the Member for Bras Basah  will

appreciate  that  because  of  the  importance  of

personal  interest  attached to the  applications,

greater  care  has to be exercised  in  processing

applications from work permit holders to  contract

marriage   with  either  Singapore   citizens   or

permanent residents. This is to ensure that  there

is  no slip-up in approving non-deserving cases or

rejection of truly deserving ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, processing of some applications

may  take  a  longer time than usual  because  the

applicants themselves have not completed their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



forms correctly or had omitted certain significant

particulars.  It  is  because  of  this  that  the

parties  concerned will have to be interviewed  to

clarify  the  doubts  as well  as  rectifying  the

errors  where they occur. In certain cases,  extra

time  is  involved as investigations  have  to  be

carried  out  to  verify  documents  submitted  by

applicants  in  support of their  applications.  I

would  like  to assure the Member for  Bras  Basah

that the Ministry realises the importance attached

to   the  applications  and  that  these  will  be

processed   as  quickly  as  possible   to   avoid

unnecessary   delay  and  inconvenience   to   the

applicants.  If  the Member could supply  me  with

particulars  of  the cases where undue  delay  has

been  encountered,  these  would  be  looked  into

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah also raised the

question  whether  it  is desirable  to  introduce

compulsory overtime to meet the labour shortage in

order  to reduce the cost of production. Hours  of

work  of  employees are regulated by law  so  that

their   health  and  welfare  can  be   adequately

safeguarded. The present limit on normal hours  of

work  of  eight hours a day or 44 hours a week  is

considered  fair  and  reasonable.  Under   normal

conditions an employee must be given the choice to

accept  or  reject a request from the employer  to

work  overtime.  However, adequate safeguards  are

provided   in  the  law  to  ensure   that   under

exceptional  circumstances, such  as  work  to  be

performed   by   an  employee  in  the   essential

services,  or where urgent work is to be  done  to

machinery or plant, or where interruption of  work

occurs  for  which it was impossible  to  foresee,

employees must comply with the employer's request.

Making  over-time compulsory will not  be  in  the

interest  of  the employees. This  is  because  in

certain  types of industry or operations prolonged

hours  of  working  would expose  the  workers  to

hazards  which  may be injurious to their  health.

Furthermore, it would be difficult to ensure  that

employers  are justified in asking their employees

to work over-time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of labour shortage cannot be solved

by  forcing workers to work overtime at  the  whim

and fancy of the employers, without due regard  to

the  health  and  well-being of the  workers.  The

maximum  hours of work are specifically laid  down

in  the Employment Act to protect the workers. All

over  the  world  the trend is towards  a  shorter

working   week.  The  introduction  of  a  44-hour

working  week  in  1968  had  already  taken  into

account  the  need of industries as  well  as  the

health of the workers. Besides, the Employment Act

also  provides for a maximum over-time of 72 hours

a   month   and,   in  exceptional  circumstances,

permission  may  be sought to exceed  this  limit.

Instead  of compulsion, employers should think  of

offering  better incentives and working conditions

to  induce  the  workers to accept overtime  work.

However,  far  more  important in  a  labour-tight

economy   is  for  the  industry  itself   to   be

modernised so as to raise productivity by the  use

of  more  labour-saving devices and machinery  and

more  efficient management techniques. The  labour

intensive low technology industries which have low

value-added   per  worker  should   give   serious

consideration   to   switching   over   to    more

sophisticated    industries    employing    higher

technology which will give a higher GNP return per

head.  The present provisions in the law,  whereby

employees  may  be  required to  perform  overtime

under  conditions  which I have just  listed,  are

considered adequate at the moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister said that

the  Labour Inspectors are not sleeping  and  that

see  whether  there  are non-citizens  working  in

these establishments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the Labour Inspectors do

supply him with the information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

inviting   me   to  submit  particulars   of   the

applicant.  I  wrote  a letter,  on  behalf  of  a

constituent of mine, and sent it on 16th  January,

1974, to the Commissioner for Employment, and  to-date, after more than two months, I have still not

got  a reply nor an acknowledgement. I expect  the

Work  Permit  Office  to  have  the  courtesy   of

acknowledging my letter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Very inefficient!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member

for  Bras  Basah  will give me a little  bit  more

detail such as the name of the applicant, I may be

able  to  check  it  up for him.  If,  instead  of

waiting  for  two  months from 16th  January  till

today,  he  were  to take the trouble  to  make  a

telephone call to my office I am sure he would get

an  answer within a day or two. For two months  he

has not bothered to take that trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, for obvious reasons I do not

want to make a telephone call to the Commissioner.

The  reason  why I am annoyed is that this  letter

was  sent  two months ago and, before sending  it,

this  man  might have already waited for three  or

four  months. All in all, he may have been waiting

for   six  months  or  a  year,  but  nothing  has

happened. If the Minister wants me to give him the

applicant's name, I have it here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Member for Bras

Basah that about 10 more amendments have yet to be

dealt with, and guillotine time is 5 o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In that case, Sir, I will submit

the name to the Minister later on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  just  make  a  brief  point?  Speaking  of

telephone  calls, at the best of time it  takes  a

long   time  to  get  through  to  any  Government

department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, some factories have been  found  to

have   contravened  the  Labour   regulations   by

employing non-citizens without work permits.  Here

I  would  like to ask the Minister to be  fair  to

some factories. It does not always mean that these

factories like to employ non-Citizens. It is  just

because they cannot find enough workers. In  fact,

in  Jurong  I have received a number of complaints

from factory operators that their applications for

work  permits have not been approved. So  to  keep

their production going they have to resort to  the

employment  of non-citizens with work  permits.  I

would  like  to  urge  the  Minister  to  consider

liberalising   the  granting  of   work   permits,

particularly after the Chinese New Year season.  I

understand that many foreign workers returned home

for the Chinese New Year but have not come back to

Singapore to continue with their employment. As a

result, there has been an acute shortage of labour

in the Jurong factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Bras Basah has also raised

the  question of marriages. I understand that most

of  the  applications have not been approved.  But

the  rejection of the applications does  not  mean

that the applicants do not get married because the

force  of  love  is greater than the  approval  of

their marriages. They get married somehow, legally

or  otherwise.  That will leave us  with  a  great

social  problem,  and  a social  problem  of  this

nature is very serious because if we have too many

illegal  marriages,  then  it  will  be   a   very

unhealthy development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> How can marriages

be illegal, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

the  Member for Jurong that where two persons want

to  get  married,  nothing can prevent  them  from

doing so. I am not stopping them. If they want to,

they  can go ahead. The only thing is that if they

do, then they will have to suffer penalties in the

form of a withdrawal of certain privileges to  the

citizens concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is well aware that the Government, in

fact,  has  been  quite liberal in  granting  work

permits to non-citizens. This liberal policy  will

be  continued  as long as there is a  shortage  of

labour in Singapore. The Member will be aware that

the   Government  is  shifting  its  emphasis   in

economic development from labour intensive to high

technology  and  high skilled industries.  In  the

light   of   this   new  strategy  of   industrial

promotion, work permits will be issued more freely

to   skilled  workers  and  those  with   suitable

qualifications. Those who are unskilled and  those

who are applying for white-collar jobs will not be

favourably considered for work permits unless they

have  special merit. As I have explained just now,

it  is  best for the labour intensive low  skilled

industries  to think seriously now, if  they  have

not  done  so,  to  modernise  themselves  and  to

introduce   as   much  labour-saving   device   as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I seek

a  point  of  clarification from the Minister  for

Labour?  He  has just mentioned that  applications

for  work permits for white-collar jobs would  not

be  given favourable consideration. Do I  take  it

that  he  meant  to  include  those  holding  blue

Singapore identity cards as well?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. Permanent

residents  holding Singapore blue  identity  cards

will  get  work  permits almost automatically.  In

fact,  I  have not come across cases  where  their

applications have been rejected. When I  mentioned

that applications for white-collar jobs would  not

be favourably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



considered,  I did not mean that we would  exclude

them  completely. If the applicants  possess  good

academic   qualifications  or  some   professional

qualifications, the Ministry is quite prepared  to

grant  work  permits to them. In  fact  in  recent

months  we  have  approved more work  permits  for

white-collar  jobs. But, as I said, they  have  to

have something more than the others.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I am

not  entirely happy with the explanation given  by

the  Minister for Labour, I nevertheless beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head GA he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Government's low cost

housing  programme has achieved impressive results

since  the  Housing  and  Development  Board   was

established  in 1960. One of the most  significant

features  of the housing policy of the  Government

has been the assistance to the lower income groups

to  have  houses of their own by allowing them  to

utilise their credit in the Central Provident Fund

to pay for the flat or to meet the down payment or

part payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature of our public housing in helping

our  citizens  to  own their own  homes  with  CPF

savings  is  unique, but there remains the  middle

and  upper-middle  groups  of  employees  who  are

unable  to own their own homes because of  soaring

land  prices and building costs which  are  beyond

their means and who are unfortunately not eligible

for HDB fiats. Any housing development project  to

meet the needs of such people who individually may

find their resources too meagre to build their own

houses  or  flats at a reasonably economical  cost

must,  therefore,  be welcomed. These  people  are

also  contributing to the Central  Provident  Fund

but,  because of the fact that they are ineligible

for HDB flats, they are unable to utilise their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



CPF  savings to purchase their own homes. To  help

these  people, it is imperative that a plan should

be formulated to help them to own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB's endeavours in the field of housing

could  be supplemented by endeavours by the labour

movement itself to meet the needs of such  people.

The NTUC's proposal to embark on a housing project

is,  therefore,  a timely one and deserves  active

encouragement by Government and support  by  other

organisations both of the NTUC and the Government.

I  would  strongly urge that CPF savings  be  made

available to such people to purchase houses  which

are  built through projects organised by the  NTUC

or  other  building societies or private companies

which  are  approved by the HDB. To neglect  these

people  would mean their exclusion from  a  social

benefit  which they have every right to  enjoy  as

citizens.  I  would,  therefore,  call  upon   the

Government to allow these people to utilise  their

CPF  savings to purchase houses built by  approved

organisations  including projects  which  will  be

embarked upon by the NTUC.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am joining this  debate  to  add

emphasis  to  the need, I think,  to  assist  this

group  of  workers who are increasing in  numbers,

and  some of them reside in my constituency.  This

group   of   workers,   in  my   view,   comprises

professional and commercial workers  who  make  an

important contribution in the field of manpower to

the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught as they are in this difficulty, they will

be  that  much less motivated and I  think  it  is

important,  as suggested by Members  across,  that

Government  at  this juncture should  come  in  to

assist  this  group of workers.  If  they  receive

assistance   at  this  point  of  the   phenomenal

increase in the cost of living, they will at least

get the chance to own a home even if they have  to

stretch themselves financially.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wealth, I think, Sir, lies mainly in a

motivated  manpower, and it is in our interest  to

keep this group of workers motivated in order that

they   may   continue   to  make   a   significant

contribution to the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will recollect that

at  the Parliament sitting on 29th March, 1971,  I

had  indicated that it was not intended to  extend

the Central Provident Fund approved housing scheme

regulations to allow CPF members from  the  middle

income  group to purchase private houses built  by

housing  societies.  I  also  indicated  that  the

policy  might  be  reviewed in five  years'  time,

depending on the housing position then and the HDB

building capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the present need to encourage domestic

savings and marshal them for development purposes,

the question of allowing middle income CPF members

to  utilise  their CPF savings to purchase  houses

built by private developers, statutory boards  and

housing  societies will only be reviewed in  1976.

However,  I am sure that Members will be  glad  to

know that Government will be building, in the very

near  future, flats for this middle income  group,

i.e, the  middle income wage earners who  do  not

qualify under the present HDB housing scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, the proposals I made to the

Minister of State would give him a stone  to  kill

three birds, instead of two. (1) To make sure that

the  middle  income  group  who  purchase  private

houses  will not be charged exorbitant  interests.

(2) To make sure that the middle income group will

also be allowed to use their CPF contributions  to

purchase  their  own houses. (3) If  any  building

society,  not necessarily the NTUC or any  private

company, builds houses and is approved by HDB,  we

encourage  genuine ownership. In other words,  the

housing  developers  will not speculate  in  their

developing project.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, first I am

very  encouraged by the expression of the Minister

of  State  for Labour regarding this  new  housing

scheme that the Government has in store for middle

income  wage earners. Yes, quite rightly  so,  but

when  will  that be? Secondly, would ownership  of

these homes be governed by the same conditions  as

those  recently  circulated  by  the  Ministry  of

Finance;   where  there  is  an  insistence   that

whosoever moves into these flats will compulsorily

stay  on  in  Government service for the  next  10

years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, in answer to the Member for

Boon  Teck, I would say that as long as the middle

income  wage  earners use their own money,  nobody

will quarrel with them. But when they want to  use

their  CPF money, then I am afraid they will  have

to  follow rules and regulations as laid  down  by

the CPF Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the Government will proceed, I am

sure the Member for Kim Seng will realise that  in

planning to build houses a lot of time and  effort

is required. First, one has to search for suitable

sites,  and  then to find the necessary  funds  to

build  the  houses. To say what sort of conditions

would  govern the middle income wage  earners  who

purchase  these flats, I think it is too early  to

talk  about  rules  and regulations.  But  if  the

Members  have any suggestions to make, I  am  sure

the  relevant authorities will be glad to consider

their points of view.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish to point out to the Minister of State that

the CPF savings are, in fact, the money of the CPF

contributors themselves.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I think I should reply to

the statement made by the Minister of State. I  do

not  think it is too early for us to draw up rules

and regulations. Usually rules and regulations are

first  drawn  up  before  moving  ahead  with  any

project.  Certainly the Ministry  of  Finance  has

never   been  too  late  to  draw  up  rules   and

regulations. These have already been enforced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They are bad rules!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Yes, they are bad rules. This

is  one  of  the reasons why there is  a  lack  of

demand  for accommodations offered by the Ministry

of  Finance.  It is not because the middle  income

group  do not like to move into these fairly  good

flats,  but  simply because the  imposition  of  a

further  10  years' service does not  make  it  an

attractive proposition. If the Minister  of  State

really  wants  me to help him draw  up  rules  and

regulations, then I, and I think not just I  alone

but  all  my colleagues here, would be  more  than

willing to volunteer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has

not answered my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I thought the Member said

something  about  paying  exorbitant  interest  or

something like that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> I ask the Minister of State

whether  it would be to the advantage of  the  CPF

contributor to increase the CPF interest. In other

words,  he  pays a reasonable rate of interest  to

the  CPF.  That  is the first bird to  be  killed.

Secondly,  to make sure that every CPF contributor

can make use of his CPF savings. Thirdly, assuming

that all the building projects are approved by the

HDB,  we  can  check speculation  in  any  housing

development programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

the  purpose  of CPF savings is just  to  purchase

houses.  The original intention is for the members

to  save  for  old age after retirement,  and  not

really   for  purchasing  houses.  To   meet   the

requirement of the lower income wage earners,  the

decision  was made to allow them to  make  use  of

their  credits  in the Central Provident  Fund  to

purchase Housing and Development Board flats only.

But  if the Member would like the facility  to  be

stretched further, then the matter would  have  to

be considered in greater detail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Kim Seng, I am not

suggesting that it is too early to make rules  and

regulations.  I  am  saying that  if  he  has  any

particular  view-points and if he  would  like  to

submit them to the Ministry of Finance - not to me

as  I have nothing to do with it - then they might

be  able  to  take into consideration the  various

points that he and other Members have to make.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish to be more direct. If the  NTUC  Co-operative  were  to  build houses  meant  for  the

middle  income group, would Government  liberalise

the  rules  and regulations of the  CPF,  so  that

people  in this income group may purchase the  co-operative  houses? The Minister of State  supports

co-operatives, does he not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, we do not know what the NTUC

proposes  to  do,  or  what  are  its  rules   and

regulations governing the houses that  are  to  be

built  or purchased. So until such matters are  in

our  hands, I do not think I can comment  at  this

stage.   I   welcome  the  NTUC  to   make   their

application   and  submit  all   its   rules   and

regulations  regarding such a project,  and  I  am

sure    we   will   give   it   very   sympathetic

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head GA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BA 1l09.* (* The same

amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy, Hwang Soo Jin and Ivan Baptist.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to raise two questions. Firstly,

industrial  accidents, and secondly, the  question

of  insufficient number of staff  in  the  Factory

Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of industrial accidents has

attracted our attention every year. The reason  is

that  there  are  too  many  industrial  accidents

causing a tragic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



effect  on  the workers and their families.  There

are  people  who  say that with  great  industrial

development,  it  is  inevitable  that  industrial

accidents will occur. Although this may be so,  we

cannot say that because industrial accidents  will

happen,  we  should allow them to happen.  On  the

contrary,  we should try to find out how  best  we

can  prevent  or reduce the number  of  industrial

accidents.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Minister has often asked our

workers  to raise their productivity to  help  our

industrial development. This is indeed  the  right

thing to do. In order to achieve this, we have  to

provide a safer working environment to reduce  the

number of deaths due to industrial accidents. Last

year   alone   160  people  died  from  industrial

accidents. Although it shows a slight increase  as

compared with the figure for the year before, this

number is still very high. Of this figure of  160,

the construction industry accounts for the highest

number,  60.  Another industry  accounts  for  46;

transport  and related industries, 38;  and  other

industries,  16.  We can say that  the  number  of

people who died from industrial accidents is  very

high.  The number of our factories has grown  from

year to year because of industrial development. So

there is a great need to take positive action  and

all possible measures to reduce the number of such

accidents. On the other hand, there are many cases

of  deaths in construction sites, including  cases

of people falling off from scaffoldings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember last year the Minister ordered a

Commission of Inquiry into the cause of deaths  at

construction   sites  so  that   it   could   make

recommendations on safety standards to be observed

in construction sites, and ensure that all workers

follow such measures. Why is it that we still have

cases  of industrial accidents? What is the reason

for  the continuation of this state of affairs?  I

would  urge the Minister to take early  action  to

find out the real cause of these accidents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to refer to the number of

staff  in the Factory Inspectorate. We have raised

this  question  many times in this House  and  the

Minister  himself  has agreed  that  there  is  an

insufficient number of people in this section. The

main  reason,  according  to  him,  is  that   the

Ministry  of  Finance has not approved  additional

provisions  for  the  Factory  Inspectorate,   and

therefore  they could not increase the  number  of

Factory Inspectors. If that is so, I would like to

sympathise with the Minister for Labour.  Although

he is a man full of sympathy, we cannot expect him

to  pay  out  of his own pocket for the additional

staff  required  in  the Factory  Inspectorate.  I

think the responsibility lies with the Ministry of

Finance. I notice that the Minister for Finance is

not  here.  I would like to urge the Minister  for

Finance  to consider increasing the provision  for

the   Factory  Inspectorate  immediately.  At  the

moment,  the provision is only $365,000, which  is

an  increase of $73,000. This is not  a  very  big

sum. But we can prevent more than a hundred people

from  dying  and the consequent tragic effects  on

their families.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, on many occasions the

question  of  the  Factory Inspectorate  has  been

raised,  but no satisfactory reply has  ever  been

received. Is it possible for the Minister to  look

into the matter and give us a definite reply as to

the number of inspectors employed, and the type of

work they have been doing to uplift the morale  of

workers  and ensure better safety precautions?  As

late  as  a year ago, there have been a  spate  of

factory accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received complaints that some of the

inspectors are biased in their duties.  They  only

check  certain factories and find fault with them,

whereas   numerous   other  factories   committing

similar  offences were being overlooked. And  when

the  victim  draws the attention of the inspector,

they get rude remarks that it is not his business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether there is any discrimination

shown by the factory inspectors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the area

of  industrial safety, it is generally agreed that

prevention  is better than cure. When an  accident

occurs, there will, in fact, be no cure. The  very

mere  fact  that monetary compensation is  awarded

for  death  or  injury offers no  consolation~  to

those  who have suffered. In looking at the Labour

Ministry's Estimates, one gets the impression that

greater emphasis is placed on compensation  rather

than  prevention. I say this because I notice that

whilst it is proposed to increase the staff of the

Workmen's   Compensation   Department   from   the

existing  strength  of  16  to  22,  i.e, a  very

substantial increase of 6 or some 37 per cent, the

proposed increase for the Factory Inspectorate  is

only from 50 to 55, representing an increase of 5,

or only 10 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during past years much tougher rules and

regulations  had been introduced with  a  view  to

reducing  the  high rate of accidents.  But  I  am

sorry  to say that, as two hon. Members have  also

just  mentioned, the enforcement seems to be quite

inadequate. I am just wondering what the  Ministry

is proposing to do here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister in his Budget Statement

to  the  House has called for the cutting down  of

wastage.  Of  all forms of wastage,  the  loss  of

manpower  - human resource - through accidents  is

one  area  that we can ill-afford to allow  it  to

continue.  I  would  urge  the  Minister  to  give

serious  consideration  to substantially  increase

the  number  of staff for the Factory Inspectorate

so  as  to  ensure  that  the  relevant  laws  are

adequately enforced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to refer to Part VII, section 62, of

the  Factories Act. This part deals  with  Health,

Safety   and   Welfare  (Special  Provisions   and

Regulations). Section 62 empowers the Minister  to

make  regulations for the medical supervision  and

medical   examination  of  workers   employed   in

factories where cases of illness have occurred or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



risk  of  injury to health of the workers employed

are present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would be most grateful if I

could  be  informed whether this section has  been

utilised  by  the  Minister, as  very  clearly  it

should   have   been,   due  to   the   increasing

consultations  and  investigations  made  by   the

Industrial Health Unit regarding problems  related

to  chemical  hazards and dust.  In  addition,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am sure that  the  silica  dust

hazard faced by sand-blasters and other workers in

the  vicinity  during  sand-blasting  necessitates

regulations    for    medical   supervision    and

examination of these workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rapidly industrialising Singapore, most

certainly  many  health  hazards  are   faced   by

workers. Two of these, occupational dermatitis and

noise-induced deafness, are gaining prominence  in

industry,   although  figures   are   not   easily

available  due  to  the lack of investigations  on

them.  To  ensure that workers are safely  guarded

against these hazards. Sir, they will have  to  be

incorporated in the Sixth Schedule (section 60) to

the   Factories  Act,  as  notifiable   industrial

diseases.  In  this way, it would be possible  for

the  Government to take the necessary  precautions

to  ensure  that workers are safeguarded  and  for

employers  to be aware of their responsibility  to

minimise the occurrence of such diseases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

same concern expressed by the Member for Sembawang

that  despite the Government's extensive  efforts,

industrial accidents, particularly in the building

and  construction  sector, are  still  increasing.

However,  I  would like to stress that  there  was

only  a  marginal increase of 0.6 per  cent,  from

2,892  accidents  in 1972 to  2,910  in  1973.  My

Ministry is paying close attention to the building

and  construction  sector  where  the  number   of

accidents has increased from 463 in 1972 to 487 in

1973.  In  this  connection,  the  Government  has

accepted  the  recommendations  of  the   ad   hoc

Committee  on  Wood Scaffoldings, and  contractors

have been required to comply accordingly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will recall that I  have  on  many

occasions  stressed the importance of  inculcating

in  our  workers and employers alike the  need  to

observe  safety  rules  and regulations.  This  is

still    very   valid   today.   Although    sound

construction  of  scaffoldings  is  essential   in

preventing  accidents, it is more  important  that

employees  working  on these scaffoldings  take  a

keen  interest  in  their own  safety  by  double-checking  the  safety aspects of the  scaffoldings

and  by using the necessary safety equipment, such

as safety belts and life-lines provided for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view to educating workers and employers,

certain  measures are being taken by the Ministry.

A  Committee  on Safety and Health at Construction

Work-sites  was  set up some  time  last  year  to

advise on ways and means of curbing the increasing

number   of  accidents.  The  Committee  comprises

representatives  from  contractors,  associations,

professional  bodies,  statutory  boards  and  the

Ministry of Labour. The Committee has worked out a

code   of   practice  on  safety  and  health   at

construction  worksites, and  this  code  will  be

observed by all building contractors. The  various

professional bodies represented on this  Committee

will be signing an undertaking on the 26th of this

month to observe these regulations.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is a "Dos and Don'ts"

booklet  in  pictorial form, and we are  going  to

distribute this shortly. Members will find that it

is   very  attractive.  It  will  be  particularly

helpful to the workers because it will be put into

their  hands.  Members can  see  from  the  colour

drawings  in  the booklet the various  aspects  of

danger   in  construction  sites.  We   are   also

organising  a  "Safety  and Health"  campaign  for

construction workers. The opening ceremony will be

on the 27th of this month at the construction site

next  to  the  Ministry  of  Labour's  office   at

Havelock  Road,  that  is,  at  the  Lower  Courts

complex. The principal attraction of this campaign

is a mobile exhibition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



which  will be displayed at 26 selected work sites

throughout   the  Island  to  arouse  the   safety

consciousness  of all persons concerned  with  the

building and construction industry. Members  whose

constituencies are chosen for the exhibition  will

be  invited together with the community leaders in

the constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have brought out a new publication

entitled   "The  New  Worker"  with  emphasis   on

educating  the  workers  and  employers   on   the

preventive  rather  than the curative  aspects  of

industrial  accidents.  The  publication   is   in

English  and Chinese. This is the third copy.  The

first copy was published in August/September  last

year. It is a bi-monthly publication. Members  are

welcome  to a copy of this publication if they  do

not already have one. Further, a `Guide to Safety,

Health and Welfare in Factories' will be issued in

about two months' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also an industrial and health safety

expert from the UNDP ILO. He has been with us  for

over  a  year  now. He advises on all  aspects  of

industrial  health  and safety and  is  personally

conducting training courses for Factory Inspectors

as  well  as safety officers from the construction

industry. The response to the first course for the

safety officers from the construction industry was

very encouraging. Twenty-six of them completed the

course.  It is clear, therefore, that my  Ministry

does  not  let  up in its efforts  to  reduce  the

incidence of industrial accidents in the  country.

We  will  continue  to  deal severely  with  those

selfish  employers and workers who have no  regard

for the safety and well-being of others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the staffing position of the Factory

Inspectorate, I would like to thank the Member for

Sembawang for his support. As Members can see,  we

are  very  conscious of the need to  recruit  more

personnel  to cope with the extremely diversified,

complex  and  arduous  tasks  facing  the  Factory

Inspectorate and the Industrial Health Unit of the

Ministry.  A  total of 25 professional  and  field

posts  were  requested for, of  which  only  three

posts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



were approved. On further appeal, the Ministry  of

Finance agreed to add an additional post of  staff

nurse  to  be created by Establishment Warrant  in

the next financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised the question of

staffing.  We have 47 Factory Inspectors  gazetted

under  the Factories Act. These Factory Inspectors

enforce the Factories Act, make periodic visits to

factories  to advise both the management  and  the

workers on the safe and proper procedure to handle

mechanical  equipment  as  well  as  pointing  out

unsafe  acts  and unsafe conditions of  the  work.

They  also advise workers and employers on matters

relating  to  industrial health  and  hygiene.  In

addition, the Factory Inspectors also ensure  that

all  lifting  equipment and pressure  vessels  are

tested   to   the  requisite  standard.   It   is,

therefore,  clear that the duties of  the  Factory

Inspectors are primarily aimed at ensuring a  safe

and  healthy working environment in the  interests

of the workers. Recalcitrant employers and selfish

workers who have no regard for the safety of their

colleagues have been prosecuted and fined  in  the

law   court.  Besides  enforcement,  the   Factory

Inspectors   also   engage  in   promotional   and

educational activities, for instance, contributing

to the Ministry's publication, "The New Worker" or

compiling  the  booklet,  "Dos  and  Don'ts"   for

workers in the building and construction industry,

and organising safety campaigns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint that the Factory

Inspectors are biased and rude, I wish  to  stress

that  the  task facing them is, to say the  least,

onerous  and  unenviable. They are  certainly  not

popular with all the factory occupiers because  in

order  to  carry out their duties efficiently  and

conscientiously   they  have   to   impose   legal

obligations on the factory occupiers. These  legal

obligations  can be very costly in terms  of  time

and  money  to  the factory occupiers.  Under  the

circumstances,    it   is   understandable    that

complaints  have  been made  against  the  Factory

Inspectors. My Ministry is aware of this  problem,

and  field  officers are constantly reminded  that

they should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



be  polite, courteous and exercise impartiality in

the  enforcement of factory laws. However, if  the

Member  for  Anson  has  any  specific  complaints

against any particular officer, appropriate action

will   be  taken  against  the  officer   if   the

complaints are substantiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree more with the Member for Jalan

Kayu that prevention is better than cure. The last

increase   in   the   staff   of   the   Workmen's

Compensation Section - at least he seems to  imply

- indicates a corresponding increase in industrial

accidents. Although, as I have said earlier, there

was  a  marginal increase of 0.6 per cent  in  the

number   of  industrial  accidents,  the  Member's

inference is not correct, as the increase in staff

was to effect a smoother function of the Workmen's

Compensation  Section which  was  then  very  much

understaffed.  As  a  result of  the  increase  in

staff,   the   time  taken  to  settle   workmen's

compensation claims has been considerably reduced.

Moreover, not all accidents resulting in workmen's

compensation can be classified as accidents  under

the  Factories  Act.  Workmen's  compensation   is

payable  whenever a workman suffers an  injury  or

death by accident arising out of and in the course

of  his employment. It does not matter whether  or

not  he is working in an establishment which comes

under the definition of "factory" in the Factories

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw his attention to the fact

that  the  Factory Inspectorate made  a  total  of

9,995  inspections last year. As a result of these

inspections, 1,689 items of non-compliance of  the

provisions  of the Factories Act were spotted  and

referred   to  the  occupiers  of  factories   for

compliance. 128 occupiers and nine employees  who,

despite  advice  and warnings from  the  Ministry,

continued   to   flout  the   safety   laws   were

successfully  prosecuted in the law  courts.  They

were  fined  a  total of $84,990. I can  see  that

there  is still room for improvement in the  field

of  enforcement. The Factory Inspectorate and  the

Industrial  Health  Unit  of  the  Ministry,  with

additional  posts approved for the next  financial

year, would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



definitely  make  every effort in this  direction.

However,  I  wish to state that strict enforcement

of  the  safety laws is not the be-all and end-all

of  accident  prevention. In recognition  of  this

fact,  my  Ministry  has in  the  last  two  years

channelled   considerable  time  and   energy   to

promotional and educational activities in accident

prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir mentioned about

section 62, (Part VII) of the Factories Act. It is

true that this particular section has not yet been

invoked.  But  I can assure him that  it  will  be

invoked soon. We intend to introduce the Factories

(Abrasive  Blasting)  Regulations  in  due  course

under   this   section  to  control  sand-blasting

operations  in  view of the high risk  to  workers

contracting silicosis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the second

part  of my question has not been answered by  the

Minister   of   State,  i.e, the   inclusion   of

industrial  dermatitis and noise-induced  deafness

as part of the Sixth Schedule (section 60).



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I am sure we will look into

that too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point

raised  by the Member for Jalan Kayu has not  been

adequately answered. I believe what he  wanted  to

know  is  why  has there not been a  corresponding

increase  in staff, percentage-wise at  least,  in

the   Factory  Inspectorate  as  compared  to  the

increase  in  the  staff  dealing  with  workmen's

compensation. However, in his earlier reply to the

Member  for  Sembawang he has indicated  that  the

reason  for this was that the Ministry of  Finance

had  rejected  the request of the Labour  Ministry

for  an  adequate increase of staff in the Factory

Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: in view of the concern which

Members  have  shown  over the  persistently  high

accident  rate in industry, will the  Ministry  of

Labour  make  another attempt  at  it,  this  time

expressing   the   concern   and   sentiments   of

Parliament?  And  we  hope that  the  Ministry  of

Labour would have greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



success  in persuading the Ministry of Finance  to

grant the additional staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just

wondering whether the Ministry of Labour  has  any

intention    to   institutionalise   the    Safety

Committee,  which  has  been  set  up  within  the

Ministry,  and  turn it into a national  body  for

accident prevention. All interested parties  could

be  invited to participate in it. I think in other

countries  they do have such a body to  look  into

all aspects of industrial safety.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure we

would also consider the point raised by the Member

for  Jalan Kayu. As to the Member for Moulmein,  I

would like to thank him and the other Members  for

their  support.  He  is quite  right  that  I  had

indicated  earlier on that we  had  asked  for  25

professional and field posts but unfortunately  we

were  not  able  to get all of them.  As  for  the

increase  in  staff for the Workmen's Compensation

Section, I have already said that this Section has

been very much understaffed for several years  and

there  was a tremendous number of backlog of cases

not  settled.  So it was imperative that  we  have

more bodies to clear up all the claims. It is true

that  it  is  better  to  prevent  accidents  from

happening  rather  than to pay  out  compensations

later. But once accidents occur, we would like  to

see  the  victims'  families get  compensation  as

quickly as possible.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, the Minister intimated just now

that  there  is  an  increase  in  staff  in   the

Industrial  Health Unit. According to  the  FY  74

Estimates, it is still maintained at 28, as it was

last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, what I said about the IHU

was  an  additional post of Staff Nurse.  That  is

all.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, it is sad

to  hear, year after year, everyone speaking about

the   shortage   of  personnel  in   the   Factory

Inspectorate,  and again this year.  The  Ministry

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



got  one additional post of Factory Inspector  for

this  year.  The important thing is not  just  the

addition  of  one post but the number  of  Factory

Inspectors  that  remain  with  the  Ministry   of

Labour. That is the point, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an occasion to interview safety officers

for  a statutory board which is required to employ

safety  officers as a result of legislation  which

requires safety officers to be employed among  its

employees.   There  were  no   less   than   three

Inspectors from the Ministry of Labour who applied

for  this  job, and all of them had  been  in  the

Ministry  for  just one year, with practically  no

experience  in the job that they were expected  to

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem therefore is not just the number of

Factory Inspectors in the Ministry. What I want to

know  is  the sort of training that they  undergo,

and  how equipped they are to perform their duties

as  expected  of  them. I would be satisfied  even

with the present number of Inspectors only if they

could  remain  in the Labour Ministry consistently

and if they are sufficiently capable of performing

their duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree

that  we  should  keep the Factory  Inspectors  in

their  jobs and increase their efficiency. At  the

moment,  we  have something worked out  for  them,

i.e, the   day-release  for  training   at   the

Polytechnic   and  even  in  the   University   of

Singapore  for technical officers and  technicians

of  the  Inspectorate. I hope that with the  extra

training open to them they would be more contented

with  their jobs and stay with us. We all  realise

that  there is a demand for certain categories  of

workers,  and I think we cannot rule out the  fact

that  everyone would want to try and get a  better

post at any time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, although the question of industrial accidents

is  causing concern to all of us, however, what we

are  glad  to hear is that the Ministry is  taking

steps  and  measures to deal with it. I hope  that

next  year when we debate the Budget, we will  not

be raising the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



question again. I can only hope that in regard  to

preventive  measures against industrial  accidents

attention is being paid to the co-operation of all

parties  concerned,  namely, the  Government,  the

employers  and the employees, in order to  achieve

better effect. We all realise that at a time  when

we  are  short  of  manpower, the  safety  of  our

workers is particularly important and necessary at

this  juncture because they provide the  necessary

manpower  `for our production lines. I  hope  that

the  Ministry  of Labour could take immediate  and

effective  measures to promote  industrial  safety

for the benefit of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head GA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phenomenon that faces the trade union world

today  is  the rapid change that is taking  place,

and  will  continue to increasingly take place  in

the  years to come, in the age composition of  our

labour   force.  In  the  light  of  the   changed

composition of the labour force, the provisions of

section 29 (1) of the Trade Unions Act has  become

anachronistic.  Section 29 (1) stipulates  that  a

person  under the age of 21, but above the age  of

18,  may be a member of a registered trade  union.

This  implies that a person under the  age  of  18

cannot  be  a member of a trade union.  It  would,

therefore, be necessary to amend the law to  allow

membership  of  a trade union to a person  who  is

below 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now facing a situation in which the vast

majority  of employees in many establishments  are

below   the  age  of  21.  To  meet  the   changed

circumstances, an amendment to section 29  (1)  of

the Trade Unions Act is an absolute necessity.  It

would  be  pertinent to point  out  that  such  an

amendment  would  not be inconsistent  with  other

legislation. For instance, in the Employment  Act,

a  person who has completed the age of 16  is  not

deemed to be, by definition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



a young person and who, therefore, may be employed

without   any  restrictions  whatsoever   in   any

commercial or industrial undertaking. There  seems

to  be  no  reason, therefore, to  restrict  union

membership to only those who have attained the age

of  18,  for if a person under 18 can be employed,

then  by the same token he can also be allowed  to

join a trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next and more important point, Sir, is that

section  29 (1) of the Trade Unions Act  does  not

allow  any  person under the age  of  21  to  hold

office  in  a  trade  union.  Though  these  young

persons  may join trade unions, we are very  often

confronted  with the difficulty of forming  branch

committees  because,  invariably,  in  many  cases

elections   to   the   branch   committees   will,

unavoidably, have to be from amongst the rank-and-file  membership who are under 21. If  it  is  not

possible  to  form  branch  committees   in   such

circumstances,   trade   union   organisation   in

accordance  with the rules of the trade  union  is

inhibited and makes union membership a mockery for

on  the one hand these persons may become members,

but  on the other they cannot form themselves into

branch committees. This is an untenable situation.

In   the   circumstances,  I   ask   that   urgent

consideration  be  given  to  lower  the  age  for

holding office in trade unions to 18 as against 21

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also be pertinent to point out that for

workmen's compensation purposes a person who is 18

years  of  age and above is entitled to  the  same

quantum  of  compensation as any other adult.  The

unmistakable inference from this is that  for  the

purposes of workmen's compensation a person  above

the  age of 18 is deemed to have attained the  age

of  majority. It would not also be out of place to

mention that in the Factories Act, on the strength

of  section 62 (c), the fact that the Minister may

make  regulations  for  medical  supervision   for

persons  below  the  age of 18 employed  in  work,

which  may  cause risk or injury to their  health,

indicates that those who are 18 years of age and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



above  are for the purposes of the Act, considered

to  have attained the age of majority. All in all,

there  seems  to be no valid reason for  having  a

separate  set  of principles for admissibility  to

membership of and to hold office in trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, there are strong and valid

reasons  to urgently review the position and  make

the  necessary amendments to section 29 (1) of the

Trade  Unions Act and to reduce the age limit  for

union membership to 16 as against .18 now and  for

holding office in trade unions to 18 as against 21

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which deserves urgent consideration

is  the development of a policy towards those  who

benefit  from the organised labours of  others.  I

refer to non-unionised employees in establishments

which  are  unionised  and  represented  by  trade

unions. These non-unionised employees in unionised

companies  enjoy the same terms and conditions  of

employment  which  are obtained  by  trade  unions

through  collective bargaining with the employers.

Indeed,   in  the  collective  bargaining  process

itself,   the  facilities  offered  by  the   NTUC

Research  Unit  are extensively  utilised  by  the

workers  and  their unions whose  sweat  and  toil

result in better terms and conditions for workers,

but   non-unionised  employees  who  enjoy   these

benefits  make no direct contributions.  They  are

the  parasites of the right zone. These are people

who  live  in a social vacuum believing that  they

can  survive by living on the efforts  of  others.

They believe that society exists for them. Indeed,

to  them  all State agencies, social organisations

and    trade   unions   have   only   a    one-way

responsibility.  They believe that  they  have  no

reciprocal obligations or responsibilities to  any

social  organisations. They  are  the  silent  and

inactive   beneficiaries  who  are   parasitically

dependent  on the labours of organised labour  who

contribute  consciously and  tangibly  to  general

welfare and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is basically unfair and unjust and must be

remedied if social justice is to be achieved in an

equitable  manner. Though a closed-shop policy  by

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



unions   can   be   advocated   to   remedy   this

unsatisfactory  state of affairs,  such  a  policy

would violate the principles of free and voluntary

association  of  workers  in  trade  unions   and,

therefore, such a step is not socially desirable.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I suggest that there is nothing undesirable

or  unethical to make it obligatory for  all  non-unionised employees in unionised establishments to

contribute an equivalent of union subscription and

levies  to  a  special  Workers  Development   and

Welfare Fund which can be jointly administered  by

the  NTUC  and the Ministry of Labour.  This  fund

would  not  be used for the operating expenses  of

trade  unions  or the NTUC but would  be  utilised

wholly   to   provide   a  variety   of   welfare,

recreational  and educational facilities  for  our

working population as a whole. Indeed, there is an

obligation for non-unionised workers to  accept  a

certain measure of responsibility to their  fellow

workers  as  a  condition  for  the  enjoyment  of

benefits  secured  for  them  by  the  efforts  of

organised workers. We cannot afford to continue to

carry  them  as passengers dependent on  organised

labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come for serious consideration to be

given to this matter, and I would commend that the

creation  of  a  special Workers  Development  and

Welfare Fund be given active consideration by  the

Ministry of Labour and make it obligatory for non-unionised   workers  in  unionised  companies   to

contribute to this Fund.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, trade unions

are  important social institutions and trade union

officers  have  a  vital  role  to  play  in   the

development of a healthy trade union movement  and

the  economic  development  of  the  country.   To

discharge their duties as responsible trade  union

officers,  they must have qualities of  leadership

so  as  to be able to lead and command the respect

of  their  rank and file. Since they are entrusted

with  the responsibilities of managing the affairs

of their unions and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



have  to  negotiate with employers  on  behalf  of

their  members,  they should possess  keenness  of

mind  and maturity of outlook. This can only  come

about  with  age and with a sufficient  period  of

working  experience. It is therefore not  proposed

to  reduce, as a general rule, the minimum age  at

which  trade union members can become officers  of

trade unions, i.e, from 21 years to 18 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry is aware that there are

instances  where there is a high concentration  of

young  workers in certain establishments, such  as

the  garment  and  electronic industries.  If  the

present  law is rigidly adhered to, the union  may

not be able to find sufficient eligible members to

stand  for  election as office-bearers.  In  these

specific  instances, there would appear  to  be  a

case   for   the  Ministry  to  consider  granting

exemption to those between the ages of 18  and  21

years to enable them to hold office. However,  the

proposal  has  other important implications  which

require  further  study before a decision  can  be

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no compelling reason for lowering

the  minimum age from 18 to 16 years for a  person

to  be  eligible  for union membership.  To  begin

with,  the  average age for our youths, especially

our  young  men,  to enter the  labour  force  has

risen.  According to the 1970 Population Census  a

total  of  86,441 persons in the age  group  15-19

were  working. This represents only  about  7  per

cent  of the total work force. This is because  of

expansion  of  our  education  system,  which  now

provides  more  opportunities for  our  youths  to

pursue secondary and post-secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, should the new entrant to the

labour force be under 18 years of age, it will not

be  long  before  he reaches that  age.  Moreover,

young  workers  are more easily  misled  by  self-seeking    and   slogan-shouting   leaders    into

supporting undesirable or irrelevant issues  which

are  not  in  their interests nor in the  nation's

interests.  They  are  also  more  susceptible  to

manipulations by irresponsible trade unions, which

will undoubtedly use them to consolidate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



their   base.  For  these  reasons,  the  existing

minimum age of 18 years is considered adequate for

the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand the sentiments of trade

union  leaders against the nonunionised employees

of  an  establishment who pay no  union  dues  but

nonetheless enjoy the benefits of trade unionism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> They are social parasites.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes. However, my Ministry is

not  yet convinced that the best way to deal  with

the    problem   of   "free-riders"   or   "social

parasites", as the Member called them, is to force

them  to  contribute financially to a  development

and  welfare fund, as it would have the effect  of

forcing  non-unionised employees to  become  union

members  as they will then have to pay  an  amount

equivalent to trade union subscription  and  other

levies.  However,  much as we value  the  positive

contribution   of  responsible  democratic   trade

unionism, in our free society an individual should

be  able  to seek and accept employment  with  any

employer without having to pay tribute to a  third

party. If non-unionised workers are forced to  pay

the  equivalent of union dues to a development and

welfare fund, in effect they are forced to pay for

the  right  to  work, a right  which  they  should

freely enjoy as citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However much we may deplore the actions of "free-riders" who only want the benefits of trade

unionism  but without paying for them,  we  should

not  throw out fundamental rights in any  solution

to  the problem. A more positive solution would be

for  trade  unions to pursue even more  vigorously

their campaign to increase union membership. If  a

man can be voluntarily persuaded to become a union

member  and pay his union dues, he is far more  of

an asset to the union than an unwilling person who

is forced to pay the equivalent of union dues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a marked increase

in   the  number  of  unionised  members  in   the

Republic;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



their  number rising from 112,500 in January  1971

to  191,500  in  December 1973. With  the  dynamic

growth   of   co-operatives  and  other   services

provided  by the NTUC for its members, undoubtedly

more  workers will find it beneficial to join NTUC

unions. That, Mr Speaker, is a better way to solve

the   problem  of  the  "free-riders"  or  "social

parasites" as the Member called them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, since the Minister has said

that the percentage of workers below the age of 18

years  is very small, will he consider a temporary

exemption  for those companies which have  a  very

big  percentage, maybe 20-25 per cent, of  workers

aged  16-18? And when the minimum working  age  is

increased  to 18 years, he may then withdraw  this

exemption.  Will the Minister also  consider  this

fact:  that  in  a  unionised  establishment   the

nonunionised  workers are getting more  than  the

unionised workers? Assuming a $300 take-home  pay,

the  union  member  will  have  to  pay  $4  union

subscription;  in  other  words,  minus  $4.   The

unionised  worker, therefore, in effect gets  less

than the employee who is not unionised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

explained  just  now,  at this  moment  I  am  not

prepared  to  consider lowering the age  of  union

membership  to  those  who  are  below  18  years.

However,   I  am  prepared  to  consider  granting

exemption for those who are above 18 years to hold

office in trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quite convinced that the non-unionised

workers  in  a unionised establishment are  better

off  than  the  unionised members  at  this  time,

because  with  the  coming of the  National  Wages

Council,  whatever  advantages  the  non-unionised

workers  have  been enjoying in the past  will  no

longer  be able to continue any more. In fact,  as

time  goes on, I think the non-unionised employees

will  find  that it will be to their advantage  to

join the unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Point of clarification, Mr

Speaker, Sir. The Labour movement in Singapore  is

vigorously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



trying to increase its membership. I think we  are

not   doing   that  badly.  In  Japan  the   total

percentage  of unionised workers is  only  34  per

cent, as reported in the Japan Labour Movement  in

1973. In Canada it is 26 per cent. In West Germany

it  is  35  per  cent. Even in the United  States,

which  is  supposed to have the most advanced  and

powerful labour movement, it is only 25 per  cent.

In  Singapore I would say that it is more than  33

per cent. I think the union has done its part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am pointing out, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

non-unionised workers in a unionised establishment

purely have the advantage, and this is not fair to

the unionised workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

one  can  right an unfair and unjust act,  as  the

Member for Boon Teck has put it, by another unfair

and  unjust act. But, as I have pointed  out  just

now,  the  increase  in  trade  union  membership,

especially  in the last one year or so,  has  been

tremendous.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say the NTUC has succeeded in a large

measure in persuading workers to join their union.

In  fact,  I  have been looking  at  some  of  the

figures of certain unions affiliated to the  NTUC,

and  I  have noticed that the percentage of  union

membership in certain establishments has  gone  up

from  about  30-40 per cent in 1971 to  80-90  per

cent  today. So I think the unions are  not  doing

badly  and,  given a little bit  more  time,  they

would be able to achieve, if not 100 per cent,  at

least  90 per cent membership. I think that should

be a figure that one can hope for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of

the  favourable  reply to the  first  part  of  my

question, that is, our union members below the age

of 21 can get exemption to be union leaders, I beg

same amendment also stood in the names of

Messrs Ho See Beng, Hwang Soo Jin and Ho Kah

Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to question the basis upon which work

permits are issued to non-citizens. There seems to

be a lot of discrimination shown to persons and no

reason  is  given  by the officials  at  the  Work

Permits  Office  for rejecting an  application.  I

will  quote  an example. Two persons of  the  same

age,  and  coming from the same town, applied  for

the same type of job. One application was approved

while the other was rejected. No reason was given.

The present labour shortage is so acute that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



some  employers  are prepared  to  take  risks  by

employing   non-citizens  without  work   permits,

although  their  applications have been  rejected.

Would  it  not be better for the country to  grant

more  work  permits, so that the CPF contributions

they  make  and  the taxes they pay  would  be  an

indirect  earning  for us. It is  also  better  to

state the reason for the rejection of work permits

to  relieve heartaches. No doubt, skilled  persons

should  be issued with work permits. But  servants

are rare nowadays. So a relaxation in this respect

would help in the employment of valuable citizens,

who  have  to  give  up jobs to look  after  their

children at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gross waste when teachers and lawyers

have  to  resign  in  order to  look  after  their

children  at home. Their useful services  will  be

available  only if they can get servants  to  look

after  their children. Sir, to quote another case,

sometime  ago  a  personnel  officer  of  a  large

factory  in  Jurong  went to the  Labour  Exchange

outside  Singapore to recruit 100 male workers  to

work in Jurong. He hired 100 workers. The youngest

was  an 18-year old lad, the oldest a 34-year  old

man,  married  with a 3-year old child.  Each  was

required  to  work on weekly rotating shifts.  The

pay  was  $4.40  a  day for the first  and  second

shifts  and $5.20 for the night shift.  They  were

housed  in a 12-storey block of 3-room flats.  Ten

persons  were  allocated to a flat; four  beds  in

each bedroom and two in the living room, for which

each  person paid $8 rent a month. Since they  are

not  Singapore citizens, the company  applied  for

work  permits  for them to work in Singapore.  The

company  did  this. Two months later  the  company

received  a  letter from the Work  Permits  Office

stating that its application for work permits  for

79  employees,  which included the lad,  had  been

approved and that the application for work permits

for  the  balance of 21 employees was still  being

considered. Another three months later the company

was  informed by the Work Permits Office that  the

application  for  work permits for  the  21  which

included



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



the  34-year old married person with a child,  was

rejected.  No reason was given. They were  shocked

when  they  were  told that the company  could  no

longer employ them. They were given a week to move

out of the company's quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are cases in the

electronic  component factories where there  is  a

grave  shortage  of  daily-rated  workers.  As   a

result,  non-citizens  were recruited  off-and-on.

However,  many  of the employees had  applied  for

work   permits  on  behalf  of  their  non-citizen

workers  and  found that some of the  applications

were  rejected without reason being given. So much

so, I understand, that some of these factories are

employing non-citizens without work permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not see why all these applications for

work  permits are being rejected. After all, there

is  a  shortage  of  labour  in  these  factories.

Furthermore,  illegal workers in  these  factories

will  mean the employers are not contributing  any

CPF  for them. Further, may I also ask why our own

Singapore citizens shy away from certain types  of

work?  Can  these types of jobs be given  to  non-citizens   by  issuing  them  with  work  permits?

Sometime ago, I came across our citizens receiving

welfare aid and not preferring to do certain types

of  jobs  offered to them. It is time that  we  be

strict  with such people living at the  taxpayers'

expense.  Unless they are sick, or  physically  or

mentally retarded or aged, I see no reason why the

able-bodied cannot work and get out of  the  habit

of  living at public expense. Surely at this time,

people have no excuse to lay idle and live at  the

taxpayers' expense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is one

of  the members of ASEAN. Nevertheless, the Labour

Ministry's  Work Permits Office has practised  two

standards in regard to the issue of work  permits.

For  instance, a worker coming from Penang,  which

is  about  500 miles away from Singapore,  can  be

issued  with a work permit, whilst another  person

coming from, say, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



Rhio  Islands in Indonesia, the distance is  about

two hours' boat ride, cannot be issued with a work

permit.  They can only be allowed to  work  on  an

employment  pass. I just want to know the  reasons

for this double standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that it

is  proposed  to  increase the total  strength  of

staff  in the Work Permits Office from 23  to  37.

This  increase  of  14 is quite large.  Does  this

imply  that  there  will be  a  change  in  policy

regarding the issue of work permits, and that more

permits will be issued?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while on the subject of work permits, I

would  also  like  to take up a  point  previously

brought up by the Member for Toa Payoh, concerning

blue   identity   card  holders.  Hitherto,   this

category of persons who are permanent residents of

Singapore,  are,  in the same way  as  foreigners,

required to apply for permits. Of the large number

of blue identity card holders, I am convinced that

many  of them were born and bred here but, because

of   insufficient  documentary  proof,  they  were

unable to obtain citizenship. This is particularly

the  case  with those born during the  war  years.

These people have no family roots elsewhere. Their

only roots are here in Singapore. Many of them are

married  to  Singapore citizens and have  children

who   are  also  citizens.  I  feel  that  special

consideration  should be given  to  these  people.

They  should  be  allowed to work  freely  without

requiring them to apply for work permits. By doing

so,  we  will  give them a sense of  security  and

assist  them to make a better contribution to  the

country. Sir, there are no more frustrating people

than  those  who feel that they belong to  nowhere

and are not even allowed the freedom to make their

contribution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the various points  raised

by  the  Member for Anson. On the one hand,  while

there  is  an  acute shortage of  workers  in  our

factories, on the other hand, work permits are not

easily  obtained, so that employers have to employ

workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



without  work  permits. And  if  the  Ministry  of

Labour  finds  this  out, the factories  concerned

will  be  fined. I would like to ask the  Minister

for Labour whether this is the way to increase the

national revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to direct to the

Minister  for  Labour is this: just now,  he  said

that  only  those who are skilled will  be  issued

with work permits. However, there are many places,

such  as  barber  shops,  bakeries,  coffee-shops,

which  have  to  employ workers.  I  do  not  know

whether  or  not they are categorised  as  skilled

workers,  but  will the Minister issue  them  with

work permits?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

explained  earlier  that because  of  the  present

shift  in  our  economic  strategy,  from  one  of

promoting    labour   intensive   low   technology

industries  to  less labour intensive  and  higher

skilled  industries,  we  will  have  to  be  more

selective in our intake of foreign labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work permits, as 1 have said just now, will

continue   to   be  issued  liberally   to   those

applicants who possess the skills which  Singapore

needs,  or  who can be easily trained  to  acquire

these   skills.  On  the  other  hand,   unskilled

applicants  and  those applying  for  white-collar

jobs  will not be favourably considered  for  work

permits  unless  they have special  merits.  These

unskilled workers include shop assistants, coffee-shop assistants, and so forth, as mentioned by the

Member for Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-riding basis upon which work permits are

considered  is the skill and the qualification  of

the non-citizen worker. There is no discrimination

since  our  policy is based primarily on  economic

consideration.  Certain instances were  quoted  by

the Member for Anson. I am afraid I am not able to

give  him  an informative reply unless he supplies

me  with the particulars of those cases. I do  not

think that Budget time is the time for a Member to

raise  specific  cases concerning either  his  own

constituent or his friend. If he wants a reply, he

should raise a Question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has also stated that

with a relaxation of work permit policy, Singapore

could  gain  from CPF contributions and  taxes  -I

presume  income  taxes - derived from  non-citizen

workers.  I wish to point out that this, in  fact,

would  not necessarily be the case as the majority

of  unskilled  non-citizen workers if  allowed  to

work  in  Singapore, will be earning  salaries  of

less  than $200 a month, in which case income  tax

would  not  be  payable  by them.  Similarly,  CPF

contributions  need only be paid by  the  employer

which  goes  direct into the credit  of  the  non-citizen worker.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is also aware that some professionally

qualified  women  have  been  unable  to  take  up

gainful employment or have to give up jobs because

of   the   difficulties  in   obtaining   domestic

servants.  The Ministry had, in fact,  been  quite

liberal  in the issue of work permits to  domestic

servants. In 1971 there were 2,623 non-citizens on

work  permits working as domestic servants in  the

Republic. The number increased to 3.369  in  1972,

and   further   increased  to   3,964   in   1973.

Householders who intend to employ non-citizens  as

domestic servants would have little difficulty  in

obtaining  work  permits if both the  husband  and

wife  are in gainful employment or if the  husband

can  satisfy the Commissioner for Employment  that

his  wife  would  take  up  employment  within   a

reasonable  period  of  time  upon  being  granted

approval to employ a non-citizen domestic servant.

However,  in view of our current policy  to  bring

down  population  increase and also  marriages  of

work  permit holders, preference will be given  to

those  applicants who are middle-aged  or  already

married in their home country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu mentioned about the

increase in the staff of the Work Permits  Office.

I think he is aware that several new measures have

been  implemented  by the Work Permits  Office  in

recent months. In May 1973 the Work Permits Office

implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



a  scheme whereby skilled workers, technicians and

supervisors  may  have their yearly  work  permits

renewed for a three-year period if they pass trade

tests  conducted by the Industrial Training Board,

or   they  have  acceptable  qualifications.  This

policy  was  introduced to encourage skilled  non-citizen  workers to remain in Singapore. The  Work

Permits  Office has received a sizable  number  of

applications for three-year work permits since the

implementation of the scheme. Then  in  June  1973

the  Work  Permits Office, in a move to discourage

excessive  job-hopping,  introduced  measures   to

disallow   work   permit  holders  from   changing

employment  unless  there  are  good  reasons   to

support  their applications, for example, changing

to  a  higher  skilled job. The implementation  of

this policy has, to a considerable extent, reduced

undesirable  labour  turnover  among  work  permit

holders. However, it has increased the workload of

the  Work  Permits Office. Then in July  1973  the

Work Permits Office implemented a policy requiring

work  permit holders to obtain the prior  approval

of  the  Commissioner for Employment in  order  to

contract marriage with Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the above measures has

resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  workload  and

responsibilities  of the Work Permits  Office.  It

is, therefore, necessary for the staff of the Work

Permits  Office to be increased. In addition,  the

Work  Permits  Office  has  recently  computerised

several areas in the Work Permits Office in  order

to  improve the operating efficiency and to enable

the   speedy   compilation  of  statistical   data

required  for  the formulation and  assessment  of

policies. This has also resulted in the  need  for

increased staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has also asked whether

consideration  may  be given to  exempt  Singapore

blue  identity  card holders  who  have  no  roots

elsewhere  from the need to obtain  work  permits.

The  Ministry  of  Labour has  been  issuing  work

permits  freely  to  applicants holding  Singapore

blue  identity  cards. As a rule,  Singapore  blue

identity card holders are given work permits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



valid for two years, as against one year for other

categories of applicants. Further, Singapore  blue

identity card holders on work permit and who  have

family  roots  in  Singapore may be  granted  work

permits  for a five-year period. A review  is  now

being  made of the position of permanent residents

holding  blue  identity  cards,  with  a  view  to

granting  them  work permits valid  for  a  longer

period.  Meanwhile, it is proposed not  to  exempt

Singapore blue identity card holders who  have  no

roots  elsewhere  from having to  apply  for  work

permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will recall that sometime ago the

Ministry   of  Labour  announced  that   permanent

residents  who passed the appropriate skill  tests

or     who     possessed    acceptable    training

qualifications  would be eligible for  citizenship

if   they   satisfied  the  ten-year   residential

qualification. Holders of Singapore blue  identity

cards  who are unskilled should, therefore, strive

to  upgrade their skills so that they can  qualify

for citizenship under the scheme.

qualify for citizenship. I think it is easier said

than  done  because a lot of them are  quite  old.

They  are married and have children. How  can  the

Minister  expect  them  to upgrade  their  skills?

Nevertheless,  in  view of the not  unsatisfactory

<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir,If a network

of roads and streets can be likened to an arterial

system, then public transport may be considered to

be  the  most  important element  in  a  country's

bloodstream. For the majority of Singaporeans  the

public  passenger  transport service  is  a  basic

necessity,  whether  for  their  own  work,  their

children's    schooling   or    their    families'

recreation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that the recent increase in

bus  fares  was received with many complaints  and

grumbles.  Only the shareholders of the  Singapore

Bus  Service  Ltd.  (SBS) would smile.  While  the

Government may be able to justify its decision  to

permit  the increase, the bus commuters also  have

ample   causes  for  their  resentment  over   the

increase.  Apart from their, perhaps,  exaggerated

fear of the inflationary effect of an increase  in

bus  fares,  members of the public felt  that  the

increase  would  not result in any improvement  in

the bus service.

lines?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Sir, I have another amendment

under  the  head, Registry of Vehicles.  But  this

amendment is on policy matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus commuters in Singapore have, on the whole,

been  ill-served by the bus companies  during  the

last   two   decades.  The  performance   of   the

management of the SBS up to-date seems  to  be  in

the  grand tradition of mismanagement of Singapore

bus  companies.  1 would not, however,  bore  this

House  by listing out all the defects of the  SBS.

Let me touch on a few significant points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS is a huge, complex organisation as far as

Singapore  goes. Yet the SBS is run as  a  one-man

show  in  the style of a Chinese family  business.

The  1.7 million passengers carried daily  by  the

SBS, the several thousand employees of the SBS and

a  few hundred thousand other road-users, tend  to

direct against one another their frustration  over

the   shortcomings  of  the  SBS.  Only   if   the

management of the SBS were to loosen their  purse-strings  and  employ  more  executives  with   the

professional expertise, the SBS might be  able  to

meet its social obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be more symptomatic of the SBS's

mess   than   the  fact  of  only  one   qualified

mechanical  engineer, employed  early  this  year,

with  a few assistants and without modern workshop

facilities to service a fleet of 2,000 odd  buses.

The  result is for one reason or another that  the

SBS can put on the roads an average of 1,400 buses

during peak hours, when double that number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



is  required. I am reliably told that in  one  SBS

depot of 300 buses, --



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

order. I do not see how the management of the  SBS

has  got to do with the policy of the Ministry  of

Communications.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Aljunied please

stop  beating about the bush, and get on to policy

matters?



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it may be

that  the  road  transportation is a  complex  and

taxing responsibility which may cause the Ministry

to  overlook  some  matters  and  to  make  rather

conflicting  decisions. Before  I  deal  with  the

topic of taxis and taxi-drivers, I should like  to

touch  on  a  matter which is a  sore  point  with

Scheme A bus drivers. I refer to the reserved  bus

lanes originally for the exclusive use of the  SBS

buses  on  certain major roads. Now it seems  that

Scheme  B buses and lorries are also permitted  to

use  these reserved bus lanes. But Scheme A  buses

bringing  office  workers to the City  are  barred

from  using these lanes. Worse still, some  roads,

such as Robinson Road, have a reserved bus lane on

one side and traffic signs prohibiting parking and

stopping  during  peak hours on  the  other  side,

making it impossible for passengers to be set down

at  any point along the roads. The bus drivers are

angry   as   they   are  paying  the   same   tax,

registration   fees  and  additional  registration

fees, and performing similar services as those  of

the  Scheme B vehicle owners. I hope the  Minister

can  give serious consideration to the use of  the

reserved bus lanes by Scheme A buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I shall deal with the topic of taxis. Those

Singaporeans who drive taxis and who aspire to own

their  taxis  must  find the  Government's  policy

towards  them  rather puzzling.  I  refer  to  the

imposition of the additional registration fee  (or

ARF) on taxis. In streamlining the ARF in October,

1972,  the  opportunity was taken to increase  the

ARF to 25 per cent to discourage private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



car ownership by jacking up the price of each

car  by  about  25 per cent. Omnibuses  and  goods

vehicles, therefore, have been paying a much lower

rate  of  the  ARF  in line with the  Government's

policy to promote public transportation. But taxis

and mini-buses are not enjoying the same privilege

apparently  on the ground that they  do  not  form

part  of  the public transportation system.  Taxis

and mini-buses, however, can rightly claim to form

an  integral  part  of  the public  transportation

system  in  that they supplement the  general  bus

services  and  cater for persons  who  are  either

prepared  to  pay  more for  greater  comfort  and

convenience or forced by circumstances  to  use  a

faster  means  of transportation. Moreover,  taxis

and  mini-buses  are socially more desirable  than

private   cars  in  the  context  of   Singapore's

congested  roads  as an average taxi  or  mini-bus

carries  more persons than an average private  car

per trip or per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pleading for the reduction of ARF for taxis

and mini-buses, I have in mind the difficulty of a

taxi-driver to own a taxi. The life span of a taxi

is  statutorily limited to seven years.  With  the

recent  increase of the ARF to a total of  55  per

cent  and the higher rate of interest on loans,  a

taxi-driver finds he may have to buy a new taxi as

soon as he has completed paying his instalments on

his taxi. This is if he is fortunate enough to  be

a  member of NTUC COMFORT. But it is a fact that a

yellow-top taxi-driver cannot hope to own his taxi

in a lifetime unless he has a lucky windfall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of taxi-drivers beneficially owning

the taxis they drive in is socially desirable. For

one thing, the drivers tend to take better care of

their  vehicles, doing their utmost to keep  their

vehicles  clean  and  in  a roadworthy  condition.

Compare the average SBS bus and the average school-bus,  and one can see the difference. For  another

thing, the plight of taxi-drivers who have to hire

a taxi from day to day from unscrupulous owners is

most unenviable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, over the past few days in this House, Members

have  contributed a great deal of  views  for  the

benefit  of the Minister. I hope that the Minister

will  not  be  bedevilled or  puzzled  over  those

views.  What I am going to say is not  only  on  a

matter of policy but also of reality. I hope  they

will be of help to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past few months, the Ministry of

Communications  has adopted a number  of  measures

and   schemes  to  improve  the  public  transport

system.  The  introduction of bus  lanes  and  the

supplementary public transport service are some of

the  measures  that  have been taken.  The  public

transport  system  has  aroused  public  interest,

particularly from the working class.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this has nothing to

do with the policy of the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the public

bus  service should be improved. I asked  an  Oral

Question  in  this House a few days ago,  and  the

Minister in reply gave an assurance that  the  bus

service would be improved stage by stage.  On  the

basis of that assurance, I was gratified. But I am

still  waiting  to see an improvement.  It  is  my

belief  that the Minister will be able to put  his

plan into practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to propose some concrete

measures    for   consideration.   Firstly,    the

possibility  of  introducing a 14-seater  mini-bus

service  in  Singapore. These 14-seater mini-buses

can operate within a radius of five miles from the

City   so  as  to  facilitate  speedy  travel   by

commuters in the City area, instead of the use  of

lorries and omnibuses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Sembawang come

now  to  the policy of the Ministry? It  would  be

more comforting for the Minister to listen to  him

along those lines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you

for your guidance and advice. What follows will be

more on policy than on details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, at present the buses only display

the  Service numbers without indicating the routes

that  they  are supposed to run. The  destinations

are  not  clearly indicated on the buses  for  the

benefit   of  the  commuters.  I  hope   that   an

improvement  will  be  made  to  ensure  that   no

inconvenience is caused to passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, buses should be properly scheduled. Too

many buses are now usually found to congregate  in

one bus terminus. My proposal is that there should

be  a board indicating the bus that will be taking

off  or the first bus that will be leaving the bus

terminus, so that passengers do not have to  chase

after the buses at the terminus which would create

a dangerous situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

to   consider   the  employment  of   female   bus

conductors to relieve the shortage of labour,  and

possibly to improve the bus services. It has  been

proved that female workers are equal with the male

workers  in the performance of work. What the  men

can  do, the women can do too. For example, in the

early  days  of  Singapore there  were  few  women

police constables. Nowadays we can see many  women

police  constables  everywhere,  and  their   good

performance has already been acknowledged  by  the

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would ask the Minister to consider the

introduction of season tickets to relieve the work-load of bus conductors. We can have season tickets

at,  say, $5 valid for a month or a week, and  the

bus  conductors need only to punch the ticket  for

each trip.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my speech is

fairly  long and I hope the Minister will  not  be

angry with me. Many Members have already spoken on

public  transport and my speech  now  is  also  on

public transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead I would like to draw the

attention of the Minister to two important  items,

and  I  hope that he would take action to  rectify

the  deteriorating public transport system and the

bad state of the telephone exchange.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though last year many of my comrade Members had

much  to speak on the subject of public transport,

there  does not seem to be any results, but it  is

even  worse at the moment. At present, the  public

transport  service is one of the major  issues  in

our country. Whilst the Ministry of Communications

is  taking  steps  to alleviate  the  setbacks  by

introducing  supplementary  transport  schemes  as

alternatives, the Minister must make it a point to

succeed  in  having a better transport service  in

the future. It will be useless to waste much money

and sweat on anything that brings adverse results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are disgusted in having to read the

daily press of the numerous complaints against our

public transport system. With the introduction  of

the new revised bus services recently, the changes

have  not  shown any marked improvement.  Instead,

some  of the commuters experience further hardship

in  waiting for buses that finally appear  but  do

not  bother to pick them up. They have to wait for

a  considerable  time just to get into  the  right

bus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mornings and evenings there is a mad rush

of office workers and school children to board the

buses,  and many of them report late for  work  or

school.  To aggravate the situation, most  of  the

buses display only the numbers, some of which  are

small  and  illegible. The commuter has to  strain

his  eyes  to  make  out the numbers,  and  he  is

expected to know where the buses are heading  for,

just  by  looking  at  the numbers.  Some  of  the

numbers are even written with marker pens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the commuter is expected to be a

walking  `memory book' of bus routes. Let  me  ask

one simple question. Is it going to cost that much

more  just  to include the terminus and  the  main

routes  of  the  buses? How do you expect  a  poor

illiterate person to remember numbers and to  take

the right bus? Woe betide the traveller who boards

the  wrong bus. He will be a victim of insults and

shouts  from  bus  conductors who  have  generally

acquired   a  reputation  for  their  uncalled-for

remarks and intolerant behaviour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the route numbers appearing in front

and sides of the buses should be clearly indicated

with  luminous paint and the lighting  behind  the

route  number should be more effective. At  night,

many  bus  drivers switch on the head  lights  and

drive  at  deadly speed, so that commuters  cannot

see  the bus numbers and thereby cannot signal  to

stop and board it in time, even though the bus  is

empty.  Therefore, the driver is the wise guy  and

commuters  are left to curse the bus service.  How

much longer have the people of Singapore to suffer

and  tolerate  under the very poor mass  transport

system?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the bus drivers are very hasty in closing

the  exit  door  even  before the  commuters  have

alighted.  A  case in point is the incident  of  a

woman  whose  arm was caught by the sliding  door,

thus  preventing  her  from getting  down  at  the

correct  bus stop. When she finally got down,  she

had  injured her arm. This sort of incident  is  a

daily  occurrence, and nothing is  being  done  to

penalise the driver to correct his attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I spoke on the introduction of a

complete ban on smoking in buses. I am indeed glad

to   note   that  my  suggestion  has   now   been

legislated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is much room for further

improvement of the buses. There are too many buses

with  tickets  and bits of paper thrown  here  and

there,   litter  boxes  with  no  bottoms,  seats,

windows and doors damaged and smoky exhausts.  The

buses  are  often  very untidy  inside  and  dirty

outside. In fact, some of them are so filthy  that

they  are  no better than the rubbish  trucks.  We

have  been emphasising the need to keep  our  City

clean.  Yet cleanliness is certainly not a  virtue

with the Singapore Bus Service Ltd. There are  too

many breakdowns and many of them can be seen lying

at  the  roadside during peak periods. Day  before

yesterday one bus knocked down a tree. Yesterday a

bus  knocked down a tree and a lamp post,  and  on

the  same day another bus knocked down a bus stand

at Raffles Quay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring to the attention of the Minister

the  problem  of  re-routing of the  bus  services

recently. Firstly, some of the routing has  caused

considerable  delay  in commuters  reaching  their

destination as the buses take a roundabout route.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fare has also been increased by 10 cents for

the  benefit  of  the  bus company,  thus  causing

further  hardship to the people. Since  the  fares

had  been  raised,  the  public  expect  a  better

service.  But  then it is just the reverse.  As  a

result  of  the increase in bus fares,  I  observe

that there has been a sharp drop in the number  of

people travelling by bus. The routing of buses has

still   to   be  revised.  I  quote  an  instance.

Previously  there was a direct service,  No.  125,

passing  through the stretch of Alexandra Road  to

Keppel Harbour and the commuter had to pay only 20

cents.  But today the same commuter has to  change

service, that is, one service from the Lower Delta

Road  to  the  juction of Alexandra/Telok  Blangah

Road,  and  from there another service  to  Keppel

Harbour, and every time he changes a bus he has to

pay an extra 10 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bus there is no chart to indicate the fare

stages.  Many  of  the  commuters  and  even  some

conductors  themselves  do  not  know  the   exact

amount, and the various fare stages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine if a commuter has innocently short-paid his fare and is about to get down at an extra

stop. If the conductor is not a reasonable person,

which  happens many a time, the poor commuter  has

to  pay an extra 20 cents for the distance to  the

next bus stop. How costly is their extra stop!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major complaint is that the buses are not

travelling  according to schedule,.  What  is  the

point of having a schedule? What is the purpose of

having  a  bus guide, when the commuters  have  to

wait as long as an hour for certain services?  And

when they do arrive, one will not be surprised  to

see them coming in twos or threes in a stretch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know why the three former bus

companies had to merge. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



sense  that due to the amalgamation, there  is  no

competition  and therefore this state  of  affairs

has arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, greater emphasis and publicity should be

extended  to  the  supplementary public  transport

system.  Though a start has been made,  there  are

many  teething problems which should be  rectified

as soon as possible. I would also request that the

supplementary  public  transport  service   should

begin  at  6  a.m, for the benefit  of  the  shift

workers  in the port and in the factories  because

there is a mad rush for buses in the morning.  Can

anything  be  done to bring about a better  public

transport  system, especially when price increases

have  already caused great hardship to the people?

With  the recent rise in the price of petrol,  can

something  be  done to keep inflation  down  to  a

minimum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Telephone Board in the past

had  declared  proudly that its profits  ran  into

several millions. Yet the services provided to the

ordinary subscribers are extremely poor.  What  is

the  existing policy of the management of the STB?

Are  they  out to make profits from the City  area

and to ignore the rural areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New applicants for the installation of telephones

find  it  difficult to get a line. Some have  been

waiting for years, and yet the Board has plans  to

introduce telephones in cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STB encourages the public to use the digital

system  and  car telephones, though  the  services

provided  are quite often appalling. Some  of  the

operators  are  frequently  the  most  elusive  of

characters, and if by chance one gets through them

to inquire about a certain number, the quick reply

would be that the telephone is out of order.  That

is a very convenient excuse, I must say, but it is

done  too  often.  Either the  section  is  under-staffed or something is wrong with the operators.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, your ten minutes

are up. Mr Hwang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my speech is

a  sort  of  border-line case, as it is  sometimes

difficult to differentiate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



between  policy  and  departmental  administrative

matter. So I promise to be short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some two years ago when the bus services were

first   reorganised,  the  Citizens'  Consultative

Committee  of Jalan Kayu at my request  set  up  a

study group to look into the needs of commuters in

Jalan   Kayu.   A   memorandum  was   subsequently

submitted  to the Minister and he was kind  enough

to  agree and to direct a new route, 73/73A, which

provided a direct link between Jalan Kayu and  the

City    area.   Unfortunately,   at   the   recent

reorganisation of bus routes, Service  73/73A  was

unilaterally withdrawn from us without  any  prior

notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the opportunity of enquiring

from   the  Minister  whether  he  would  consider

directing SBS to reinstate the service to  us.  If

the route was considered necessary two years' ago,

I  fail  to  see  why  it is no  longer  necessary

because in the meantime the population in my  area

has expanded quite considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take the opportunity of

enquiring from the Minister what factors are taken

into  consideration  in deciding  upon  whether  a

route   should   be   extended,   maintained,   or

withdrawn.  Is  the  decision based  just  on  the

profitability  of  that  particular   route,   and

whether  or  not prior approval has been  obtained

from the Government?



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, food,

clothes, accommodation and transportation are  the

main   problems   of  living.   The   problem   of

transportation is the most important that  affects

our citizens. The need to improve the bus services

is, therefore, very great. Up to today we have not

seen  very  definite results from the  efforts  to

improve  our bus services as pointed  out  by  the

various Members of Parliament. The main aim of the

bus  service  is to provide efficient  and  timely

service. I am afraid that the present bus  service

is departing further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



and  further  away from this principle  of  cheap,

fast and good form of transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.

The  first one is the upward revision of bus fares

which  has  unfortunately increased the burden  of

our  people  in  the  midst of the  inflation,  in

particular,  the lower income groups  who  usually

travel  over  a  distance of less  than  four  bus

stops. Everyday they have to incur an increase  of

20  cents  in bus fares. I would like to  ask  the

Minister  whether  he is prepared  to  consider  a

reduction in bus fares for distances of less  than

four bus stops to restore the old price structure.

The  present  rates for the other  number  of  bus

stops may remain the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point has already been brought up by

the  Member  for  Jalan Kayu,  that  services  for

certain  routes in the old schedule  are  actually

necessary.  Unfortunately,  after  the   revision,

these routes have disappeared. The result is  that

those who used to travel in one direct service now

have  to travel on more than one service in  order

to  reach  their destination. This would  mean  an

increase of 40 Cents in bus fares. I would like to

ask  the  Minister  whether  he  is  prepared   to

reconsider this problem of minimising the need  to

take   a   second  service  to  reach   the   same

destination, or the commuters be charged according

to  old  rates  when they have to  take  a  second

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is related to the question of

bus  lanes. Some people say that the small  pirate

taxis  have  been eliminated but  the  big  pirate

taxis  have emerged in their place, and these  are

the big buses. Even before the introduction of bus

lanes, the bus drivers behaved as though they were

the   only  users  of  the  roads.  Now,  we  have

allocated  up to one-quarter of the width  of  the

road  for the exclusive use of the buses. We  must

remember that the construction of roads comes from

the  taxpayers' money. Is it fair to reserve  this

space  for  the  exclusive use of  buses?  Another

point  is  that  I  understand the  Ministry  will

confiscate  vehicles that violate  bus  lanes  for

more than three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



times. Is the Ministry prepared to reconsider this

point?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question is this. From the press we

learn   that   since  the  introduction   of   the

supplementary   transport   service,    the    SBS

immediately sent out a great number of  inspectors

to  assist  commuters at the  various  bus  stops.

Before   the  introduction  of  the  supplementary

transport service, we did not see any form of such

assistance.  It is only after the introduction  of

the  supplementary transport service that  we  see

this  improvement in service. The  SBS  sends  out

these  people in order to get more bus  commuters.

Is this not an example of better service resulting

from competition?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has

asked  the question: was the amalgamation  of  the

three  bus companies really necessary? That  is  a

valid question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth question is related to a point brought

up  by the Member for Sembawang as to whether  the

Minister  is  prepared to introduce the  14-seater

mini buses in Singapore. As we all know, Singapore

is  embarking on a "Conserve Energy" drive at  the

moment,   and  the  public  transport  system   is

inefficient. The introduction of these  mini-buses

would, I think, improve the services provided  and

also  conserve some of our energy as  a  mini  bus

carries more people than a taxi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth question: I would like to ask the

Minister whether he has noticed that roads in  the

vicinity  of  bus terminus, whether or  not  white

lines  or yellow lines are drawn are flooded  with

SBS  buses at night. This creates traffic  hazards

to  some extent. I would like to ask whether  this

would  not  be  an infringement of the  rights  of

other road users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh question is in regard to Jurong. In

Jurong  we  have  about 50,000  people.  At  least

20,000  of  them work in the factories. There  are

not enough buses which ply between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



various  residential  areas  in  Jurong  and   the

factories. The number of buses operating in Jurong

is  rather  small. The buses that come  to  Jurong

from  the  City are usually full when  they  reach

Jurong.  So  the residents in Jurong cannot  board

these  buses.  I  would like to  ask  whether  the

Minister  is  prepared to introduce  internal  bus

services  within  the Jurong  area  to  facilitate

travel between various areas in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eigth question is this: We know from the

announcement  of  the Ministry  of  Communications

that  the management of SBS is based on a clannish

and   family-type  of  business.  Is  this  modern

management?  Should we not help it to  update  and

modernise  the  various styles and  techniques  of

management?   Perhaps  our  National  Productivity

Board could lend a helping hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth question is: has the Ministry audited

or  examined  the accounts of SBS monthly  to  see

whether there is any irregularity in the accounts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is: If the SBS cannot carry out

the   instructions  given  by  the   Ministry   of

Communications,  for  example,  to  increase   the

number  of  buses, will the Ministry withdraw  its

licence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since

previous  speakers  have taken their  "bus  rides"

under the Head of the Minister, I wonder whether I

may  be  allowed  to  join the  "bus  ride"  as  a

passenger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Thank you, Sir,In the past

few  days, I have listened with great interest  to

the  spirited  exchanges of views in the  diatribe

between  the Minister for Communications  and  the

Member  for  Kallang over the  pros  and  cons  of

nationalisation  of  the  SBS.  To  my  mind,  the

problem of providing an efficient bus service does

not  hinge  on the fact whether it  is  run  as  a

private  monopoly or a public concern.  Running  a

complex  operation  to meet the increasing  demand

and  higher  expectations of service by  commuters

calls for (1) well-qualified management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



personnel,   (2)  well-paid  and   contented   bus

drivers, conductors, mechanics, and so on, and (3)

sufficient number of well-maintained buses  and  a

host of other things, to ensure the most efficient

running  of the bus service. All these  must  mean

additional  cost. The question is:  what  kind  of

service do we want, and how much are we willing to

pay for the efficient service and comfort that  we

expect? And the important question is: how is this

additional cost to be met -by the commuters or  by

a  subsidy from the Government? The Government has

already made known that it will not subsidise  the

running of the bus service. The Member for Kallang

has promised the Prime Minister yesterday that  he

will  move a motion on the public transport system

in Singapore. I will therefore reserve my comments

on  whether  the Government should or  should  not

subsidise  public transport when Parliament  meets

to  discuss the motion that the Member for Kallang

intends to table before this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, let me add my bit of confusion

to  the  already confused state of affairs in  the

public  transport system. The former STC collapsed

simply  because of poor management. The SBS  might

also collapse one of these days simply because  of

lack   of   management  expertise.   The   present

management of the SBS, which is nothing more  than

an  unholy  alliance of three parties  drawn  from

three  former  bus  companies  is  accustomed   to

running  small  operations  and  is  not  used  to

running a bus transport service on a scale of  the

SBS.  What worries me is that, with all the public

criticisms  levelled  against  the  SBS  and   the

inability of SBS to run a viable business  and  to

provide  at  the same time a cheap and comfortable

service demanded by the travelling public, we  may

just  witness the collapse of another bus  company

in  Singapore. The present management personnel of

SBS are just ordinary businessmen whose motive  is

to   make  money.  Most  businessmen  like  to  do

business  with  good  profit returns  and  without

being   subjected   to   public   criticisms   and

Government constraints. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



management  of  SBS  is  subjected  to  Government

constraints  such as the rate of  profit  returns,

etc.,  as  well as public criticisms. It  may  not

survive  under  such  hostile conditions  and  may

decide  to  fold  up. The wish of the  Member  for

Kallang  to  attend the funeral rites of  SBS  may

just  come  true. As the lyrics of a popular  song

go:  "What  then,  my love?", I wish  to  ask  the

Minister,  "What  then, Mr  Minister?",  when  the

present SBS management gives up the ghost,  so  to

speak. There will be a lot of wailing and gnashing

of  teeth at the Communications Ministry, and also

at  the  Labour Ministry because the  bus  workers

will   be  concerned  over  their  jobs.  I  would

therefore earnestly urge the Minister to treat, as

a  matter  of priority, the question of developing

the  necessary management expertise and  personnel

in  his  Ministry  as  well as  assisting  in  the

development  of  such expertise and  personnel  in

SBS,  as  a  necessary  precaution  to  abort  any

possibility of a total breakdown of the  transport

service.  The development of management expertise,

from  the  long-term point of view, is a necessary

adjunct to an efficient transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public confidence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, over

the  handling of the bus problems in Singapore has

been   shaken  simply  because  there  have   been

frequent   changes  and  shifting   of   policies.

Commuters,  being  human,  do  not  like  to  find

themselves  having  to  adjust  and  re-adjust  to

frequent  changes of timetables and bus routes.  I

would therefore urge the Minister to minimise  the

changes in bus routes, time-tables, etc.,  and  to

make such changes only after very careful planning

and assessment of the impact of such changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair to the Minister, since the

introduction   of   the  supplementary   transport

scheme, the bus service has improved. As a  matter

of fact, a letter was published in the man-in-the-street   column   of  a  local   paper   yesterday

expressing satisfaction over the new arrangement.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have

been  waiting  at the "Registry of  Vehicles"  all

this while



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



to  get into the bus. Everybody else has got  into

the bus. It is about time I got in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member for Moulmein has pointed out,

in  the past few days we have heard so much  about

the   inefficient   public   transport   services.

Complaints were made against the SBS, the Ministry

of  Communications, and even the commuters and bus

employees.  I  am  not going to touch  on  similar

issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications, Sir, has

categorically  stated that the Government  has  no

intention   of  taking  over  the  bus   transport

service. I am not going to pursue the matter as  I

too am not in favour of the Government taking over

the  SBS. However, Sir, the Minister admitted that

public transport is a public utility, and as  such

it  is the intention of the Government to see that

we  have a reasonable public transport service  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fear that from what we know of the

financial  position of SBS, I have no  doubt  that

the SBS will not be able to introduce the required

number  of  new  buses into  the  service  in  the

foreseeable future. In this respect, I welcome the

supplementary  lorry-bus  service  which  utilises

school   buses  and  goods  vehicles  for   public

transport.  I  also  agree  with  the  Member  for

Moulmein  that the commuter transport  system  has

been  a  relief  somewhat  as  a  result  of   the

introduction of the supplementary service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the heated argument about public

transport  in the last few days, we have forgotten

to  consider  the difficulties faced  by  the  bus

drivers   in  Singapore.  We  were  busy  accusing

everybody.  Sir, since the reorganisation  of  the

bus  services, the distance between terminals  has

been  lengthened. As a result, the bus driver  now

has  to  drive a longer distance than he was  used

to. This is not easy for him. Nobody would dispute

with  me if I say that driving in Singapore,  with

road congestions, is no welcome proposition. Those

of  us  who drive to office would testify to  that

fact. What makes it worse for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



bus driver is driving an old rickety bus over long

distances,  with frequent stops,  going  into  and

steering  out of bus bays, changing gears hundreds

of times during a journey. This can be killing for

the bus drivers. Can we really blame the driver if

at  times  he loses his temper? I lose  my  temper

hundreds of times driving in our congested  roads,

and I do not drive as often as the bus driver.  He

is  on the road for as much as 10 hours a day.  It

is  about time that we replaced new buses equipped

with  automatic  transmission and power  steering.

Let  me hasten to add, Sir, that this is going  to

cost the SBS more, and it is not going to be well-received,   considering  the  additional   finance

required. But at the same time, I am glad to hear,

Sir, that the jumbo buses introduced recently  are

equipped with power steering.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we accept that public transport is a public

utility,  and we are satisfied that SBS  does  not

have  sufficient  capital  to  provide  reasonable

commuter   transport  services,  and   they   need

improvement.  I would therefore suggest  that  the

Government  look  into the possibility  of  either

providing  tax  relief to the SBS  in  order  that

additional  funds  may be made available  for  the

purchase of new buses. Or if this is not accepted,

then   the   Government  should  look   into   the

possibility  of  providing  soft  loans  for   the

purchase of new vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Does the Member want the Government

to support the SBS?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I am sure the Member for

Katong will have his time, if he wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was about to say before I was rudely

interrupted,  soft loans should be  provided  with

sufficient  safeguards  to  see  that  Government-nominated officials sit on the directorate of  the

SBS to make sure that the loans given are properly

utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area, Sir, that has to be looked into is

the  management of the SBS. We have been told time

and time again by the Minister that the SBS is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



the  only  one  that has the expertise  in  public

transport  in  Singapore. Sir, I beg to  disagree.

From what we have seen of its expertise, that  is,

the expertise of the SBS, it is only vested in the

Managing  Director, if at all we can call  him  an

expert. It is commonly known that the SBS is a one-man  show. Sir, is it true that whenever there  is

any  problem between the SBS and the workers,  the

management  threatens to throw in  the  towel?  If

this  is  true,  then I fear we are  in  for  more

difficult times in respect of public transport  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have

your permission to jump on the buses too?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about the public

transport system in Singapore, especially over the

last  two  weeks and this evening by many Members.

However,  the discussions were centred around  the

improvement  of  the  public transport  system  in

relation  to  the provision of more buses  on  the

road,   less   breakdown  of   buses,   Government

takeover,  etc. The Minister has given answers  to

all these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also other aspects which have a

cumulative  effect  in  the deterioration  of  the

public  transport system. I would like  with  your

permission, Sir, to elaborate on them, and  I  ask

the  Minister whether he intends to adopt some  of

my  suggestions  or give reasons as  to  why  they

cannot be adopted or utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there is this business of commuter

discipline. I would not go into the sordid details

of  the  law  of the jungle that persists  at  bus

stops  during the rush-hour. Unless some  commuter

discipline  is  introduced,  it  will  be  utterly

impossible  for  the  public transport  system  to

improve.  I  would  like to know  what  plans  the

Minister    has   to   introduce   this   commuter

discipline, and when will it be introduced?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the matter of strengthening worker

discipline.  The  workers  on  the  public   buses

sometimes  adopt a devil-may-care  attitude.  Some

conductors treat commuters rather shabbily and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



some  drivers  skid along the roads  at  breakneck

speeds  emulating  grand  -prix  drivers,  causing

grave danger to the bus commuters, pedestrians and

other motor vehicles. On more than one occasion, I

have  noticed buses moving off bus stops when  all

the  passengers have yet to alight.  I  have  even

seen  many  a passenger with hardly a toe-hold  on

the  bus  hanging on precariously  for  dear  life

because to hang on is the lesser evil than to jump

off  as the bus rockets from the bus stop ignoring

commuters' safety. Time and again the buses do not

use the special lanes constructed for them at some

bus  stops. This not only causes great  danger  on

the   road  but  also  sparks  off  a  race  among

commuters who dash towards the bus in forlorn hope

that they may get a place on the bus, and be early

for work or an appointment. I am sure the Minister

is  working  closely with SILO to strengthen  this

worker discipline, and I would like to know of the

plans  which  are afoot to obtain  a  satisfactory

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is also tied up with the workers

and  plans  to  improve their working  conditions.

Working  conditions are tied up with  occupational

health  and  safety,  and I am  wondering  if  the

Minister is taking into consideration that fatigue

and boredom can be potent causes of accidents. One

of  the  disadvantages of modern  driving  is  the

boredom  produced  in  many drivers.  Fatigue  can

accentuate boredom and boredom can feed  `fatigue.

Is  there any plan by the Minister to ensure  that

the workers are adequately protected from this?  I

must  stress that particular attention  should  be

paid  to general working conditions to ensure that

bus   drivers  do  not  suffer  from  fatigue  and

boredom. Some of the things to be looked for would

be  to  have controls readily accessible and dials

of instruments in constant view without the driver

having  to change his position. The driver's  seat

must  be comfortable and adjustable backwards  and

forwards,  and upwards and downwards,  to  provide

for  individual  variation of the  length  of  the

driver's legs and body height.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



Furthermore, the back of the seat must  be  shaped

to  provide adequate support to the lumbar region.

Automatic  gears,  and power-assisted  brakes  and

steering assist the reduction of physical  fatigue

in  drivers. Attention should also be paid to  the

necessity  to  limit total driving time  for  each

shift and to ensure that individual spells of duty

are  not too long. Furthermore short breaks should

be allowed within each spell of duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to combat boredom the morale of drivers

must be kept high by providing sources of pride in

their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to stress that drivers should

receive  pre-employment  medical  examination  and

should  also  be  examined  routinely  at  regular

intervals,  with  increasing  frequency   as   age

advances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the display boards on buses are too

small.  One can see many a commuter squinting  his

eyes  as  he tries to discern the number on  these

display  boards to ensure that he flags  down  the

right bus. At night, due to the dimunitive size of

the   board,   the  darkness  and   the   blinding

headlights  of the bus, it is impossible  to  flag

down  the  right bus. Many a commuter  flags  down

every bus until he gets lucky. This irritates  the

bus  drivers and causes unnecessary time  loss.  I

will  just leave it to your imagination, Sir,  the

unmentionable words these irritated  drivers  use.

Is  the Minister taking steps to increase the size

of  these  boards and the size of the  numbers  on

them?  Will the Minister also consider  making  it

obligatory  for  all buses to display,  in  words,

their exact destinations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the Minister to

give  more  publicity to the monthly tickets  that

can  be  obtained by commuters from  the  SBS.  At

present,  these  monthly tickets can  be  obtained

only at the SBS office in Changi. There should  be

provision for these monthly tickets to be obtained

from all bus terminals. These monthly tickets will

cut  down  to  a certain extent both commuter  and

conductor inconvenience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since

some  Members  have  taken  pre-emptive  steps  to

discuss  whether  SBS  should  or  should  not  be

nationalised,  I wish to join in at this  juncture

just to make my stand quite clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have questioned the wisdom of Government's

policy in allowing a private monopoly to control a

public  service.  It  is  my  conviction  that  to

achieve   a  desirable  social  objective   public

transportation  must  be  in  the  hands  of   the

Government either in its own hands or jointly with

private  individuals or groups. Pragmatism  should

not   go   beyond  the  point  where  it  counters

achieving  a desirable socialist objective.  Carry

on  supervising and improving the present  service

as  much as possible, but what I am interested  is

whether  or not public transportation will finally

be  in  public hands and, if not now, will  it  be

later or never at all? I will always disagree with

the  Government if nationalisation never comes  at

all.  The  formation of a strong Government-backed

corporation  will  ensure  the  job  security   of

drivers  and  conductors.  They  will  always   be

needed.  There  is  no  fear  that  they  will  be

jobless. I am sure the interest of the public will

be taken into account. That is what the Government

is  for. Public transportation is a public utility

and  must  be run as a service. The administration

and  operation  of  the service will  be  directly

accountable to Parliament. Now we are debating the

administration and operation of a private company.

Fortunately,  the  Ministry of Communications,  at

least  through the ROV, had gone to the extent  of

supervising  the administration and  operation  of

the  SBS,  made policy statements, authorised  the

increase  of  bus fares, so much so  that  it  has

given  us  the opportunity to attack  the  SBS  in

Parliament.  If it had not been so, I  would  have

found it most difficult to discuss the affairs  of SBS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never proposed that as a firm condition

the bus service should be directly subsidised. The

point  I  have  taken up is:  should  the  SBS  be

nationalised? That is, should the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



take  over  the rights and interests of  the  SBS?

Subsidy is another thing. If you have to subsidise

a public service, if there is a necessity to bring

about  reasonable standards and efficiency, it  is

up  to  the  Government, the Parliament,  and  the

public  to decide. Taking the rights and interests

of SBS is the point I wish to make at this moment.

Whether  or not we will debate on public transport

at  great length, and whether or not it should  be

nationalised, I think we all look forward to  that

day, if it is all the more necessary.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, even if we go on debating

until the cows come home, I do not believe that we

can  really  force the issue asking the Government

to nationalise or to take over the SBS. We are all

very satisfied with the Government's reply that it

has  got  no intention of taking over  nor  is  it

backing the SBS. The only way we can put the issue

to  a  test is to hold a referendum to see whether

the bus service should be run by the Government or

whether  it  should be in the hands of  a  private

organisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just a few

points.  I  hope this would not be the straw  that

would break the camel's back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to a point that was raised

previously   regarding  the  operations   of   the

supplementary bus service and the competition that

this  supplementary bus service is affording in  a

very  small way to the Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.

There has been a very appreciative reaction to the

service provided by the supplementary bus service.

People  talk  about  the  comfort  in  which  they

travel, the smooth ride, the politeness that  they

are  met  with  when  they board  the  buses,  the

consideration  they  are  shown.  This  stands  in

rather  violent  contrast to the  experience  that

people  have  had and are still having  when  they

travel on the SBS. The improvement has really come

from  this competition, and commuters now  have  a

chance of choosing and the choice is an indication

of a vote against the SBS, so to speak. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



they  have the ability of saying: "We do not  want

to  travel  by  the SBS if we have  a  chance.  We

prefer  another  service." So  the  point  that  I

raised  yesterday  was: why  do  we  not  try  and

encourage  some  more  competition?  Perhaps   the

response has not been adequate so far because  the

incentives  for people to come in and compete  are

not  adequate. So why do we not provide some  more

incentives?   I   am   sure   the   Minister   for

Communications will not be hard put to,  to  think

of  such incentives, if he is thinking along  this

direction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Any suggestions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> One way would be to try and allow

them  to  pick up passengers all along the  route.

This  is one of the suggestions. It is up  to  the

Minister  to  consider it and see  whether  it  is

feasible.  He has asked me for suggestions  and  I

have given one as an example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then we would be going back to

the days of the pirate taxis!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Well, we have already gone back to

those  days as I pointed out when we had  mosquito

buses,   each   being  owned  by   an   individual

entrepreneur picking up passengers along the  way.

There  is not very much difference, going back  to

the  days  of the pirate taxis. Sir,  may  I  just

point out to the Minister that I am not suggesting

that  we go back to the days of the pirate  taxis,

knowing  how sensitive he is about this particular

subject.   In  any  case,  why  worry  about   the

competition that' this poses to the present SBS?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, again, I wonder whether the 8 per

cent  which we have been hearing so much about  is

an  adequate  incentive to hard-headed businessmen

who might be able to get the same amount of return

by just putting the money in fixed deposits. Since

this is so and since we cannot expect too much  of

a  service  from  the  SBS, as  has  already  been

indicated  by several comments in the House,  what

we  want  to  do  is  already being  done  by  the

Minister  monitor  very carefully  the  operations

with our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



own  staff  and with our own managers,  and  train

their managers in as thorough a way as possible so

that, should we be faced with the eventuality,  we

can  run  the bus services ourselves. I think  the

problem  of training our own managers, as well  as

managers in the SBS, if we trust them that far, is

one   that  we  have  to  look  into  very,   very

seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about improvement on the general

situation  and  people feeling a little  bit  more

relieved, but that is not because as I said of the

SBS.  Only  today we have had, in the  very  short

time  that I was in the Members' Room, one of  the

Members  complaining  about  the  behaviour  of  a

driver along a certain road resulting in the niece

of   a   Minister  being  now  in  hospital.   The

allegation  is that she fell from the bus  as  the

bus  was moving, prematurely. One swallow does not

make  a summer, but there have been many swallows!

This just dramatises the point that there is still

a  lot  to  correct where the present  service  is

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Sir, I would like to make a

statement.  In  fact, I would go  along  with  the

Member  for Telok Blangah and I disagree with  the

Government  that  it has no expertise  at  all  to

operate the bus service. I will also go along with

the  Member  for Katong on this. What we  like  to

know  is:  is  the Government going to nationalise

the  SBS now or later? If we cannot do it now  for

some good obvious reasons, I will be more patient.

That  is  the point we like to know.  But  if  the

Government says never, I will always disagree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru):</b> Sir, it was my

intention  to  raise  a  question  concerning  the

setting  up of the Motor Insurers Bureau  when  we

come  to  the Head, Registry of Vehicles. However,

since  previous speakers have already  touched  on

this subhead, I might as well do it now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the matter of setting up the Motor Insurers

Bureau  was raised in this House sometime  ago.  I

remember the Minister of State giving his  promise

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



matter  will  be looked into. I just  wonder  when

will this Bureau become a reality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think

it  would  be  a  failure on my part  as  a  trade

unionist if I do not make a few comments. I should

say   that  the  slight  improvement  of  the  bus

service,   after   the   introduction    of    the

supplementary bus service Scheme B, could coincide

with the improvement of the working conditions  of

the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Each bus worker is getting an

increase of about $42 since the formation of  SBS,

and  the incentive payment could have induced  the

workers to work harder. That may coincide with the

introduction of the supplementary bus  service.  I

say that: to be kind, we have got to be cruel.  If

the   minority   of  the  bus  workers   are   not

discharging their duty as expected, may I  request

the    Minister   for   Communications   to   make

legislation to punish the bus workers if they fail

to  go into the bus lanes. I think that if we want

to  be kind, we have got to be cruel. But, at  the

same  time, if commuters want to jump  down  at  a

road   junction,  i.e, if  they  want   to   kill

themselves, I think legislation has also got to be

made  to punish them so that they are disciplined.

The improvement has got to be all round. It is not

fair  to  apportion most of the blame on  the  bus

workers.  But  I do agree that it  is  a  minority

affair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is

a   field   day   for  MPs  on  the  Ministry   of

Communications.  As  there is  a  guillotine,  and

since  most  of the questions should  really  come

under the Head. Registry of Vehicles, if I am  not

in  a  position to answer all of them now I  shall

endeavour to do so when we come to debate  on  the

Registry of Vehicles tomorrow. I shall however try

to  cover as much ground as is possible on matters

of  policy, which is really what is expected in  a

Budget  debate  and not questions  of  detail  for

answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, may I answer the few comments by the

Member  for  Anson  in respect  of  the  Singapore

Telephone Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



It  is  not  correct  to say  that  the  Singapore

Telephone Board is not giving enough attention  to

the  rural  areas because a very large  number  of

underground cable schemes and exchanges have  been

implemented  and more have been planned  to  serve

the  rural  areas.  Sembawang Exchange  will  have

2,000  lines, and Woodlands Exchange, 2,000 lines.

Others that will be planned are Ama Keng Exchange,

which  will  initially have  1,000  lines  and  is

planned  to be in operation in mid-1975;  Yio  Chu

Kang  Exchange with a capacity of 4,000 lines will

be  operational in mid-1976; Ang Mo  Kio  Exchange

with  a  capacity  of  10,000  lines  will  be  in

operation  by  mid-1976; and  Changi  Exchange  is

currently  being expanded to provide 3,000  lines,

in  addition to 2,000 lines already in  operation.

Therefore,   the  rural  areas   are   not   being

neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, I would like today to touch on

one  aspect mentioned by the Member for Anson.  He

mentioned  "some of the SBS buses  are  no  better

than refuse trucks". May I give an explanation  on

the  sad state of these buses, which I would  call

"hippie buses" of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, 1973, the Registrar of Vehicles was

instructed  to  hold discussions with  the  Public

Utilities  Board (PUB) on the possibility  of  SBS

being allowed to use hosed water from PUB mains to

wash  buses. The PUB stated that it is its general

policy  that washing of motor vehicles with  hosed

water from PUB mains should not be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was observed that refuse vehicles of

the  Ministry of the Environment were  hosed  down

with  water  from  PUB  mains  in  the  Government

Transport  Centres, at Mackenzie  Road,  Henderson

Road  and Tannery Lane. It was explained  that  if

these  refuse vehicles were not hosed down  daily,

they would be too dirty and evil-smelling to go on

the roads. A request was made to PUB for a similar

exception in the case of the public bus fleet,  as

the  man-hours  and operational  cost  of  washing

public buses, by hand from buckets of water, for a

fleet  of  1,400 operational buses would be  high,

besides being ineffective in view



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



of oil and grease. This request was again rejected

by PUB.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB, however, agreed to consider allowing

mechanical washing of public buses using  constant

amounts of PUB water per bus, provided the  amount

of water used for each bus would be acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bus Services Reorganisation Committee has

accordingly  directed  SBS to  install  mechanical

washing  plants  for the cleaning  of  its  buses.

These  automatic washing equipment would  be  more

efficient and economical in the use of water  than

high  pressure hosing from PUB mains. Studies  are

also  being conducted to install water reclamation

systems in these plants to recycle the water  used

in the washing to reduce the amount of water used.

The cost of mechanical washing equipment would  be

about $40,000 for each washing bay and about 10 of

these  would  be  required at various  depots.  In

other words, a sum of $400,000 would be needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS has also commissioned its architects to put

up  plans  for  a  washing depot at  Jurong  where

industrial water is available. But it would not be

operationally  feasible to set  up  a  centralised

washing  depot at Jurong for the entire  fleet  of

1,400  or  more  buses. Depots for  washing  buses

would  also have to be located in areas not served

by  industrial water. If industrial water is to be

used  at these other depots, the water would  have

to  be transported in bowsers, each of which would

cost  $40,000  to $50,000. Storage tanks  for  the

water would also have to be built at each depot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of equipment for cleaning the passenger

compartments  is also being studied, besides  just

getting people to clean up with brooms and so  on.

When  the  washing and cleaning of buses is  fully

mechanised   and   the  present  inefficient   and

laborious system of washing buses with buckets  of

water is dispensed with, the fleet of public buses

will certainly not do injustice to our clean city.

But  until then would Members of the House  please

tolerate our "hippie buses" on the road?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much criticism has been voiced by bus

commuters  and now even by my colleagues,  Members

of  this  House,  over the present  state  of  our

public  bus  service. I do not deny that  quite  a

number  of  the criticisms over the inadequacy  of

SBS,  especially during peak hours, are justified.

But  to  be fair some of the outburst arises  from

other  causes, namely, grievances which our people

have   been  subjected  to  over  the  past  year,

especially in the rising cost of living mainly due

to  imported inflation and the public bus  service

happens to be a convenient scapegoat to give  vent

to  their frustrations and bruised feelings as  it

has  to serve the transportation needs of as  high

as  1.75  million  trips for a population  of  2.2

million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even had there been no upward revision of the bus

fares  on  10th  February last month,  Members  of

Parliament   would  be  voicing  their  grievances

during Budget time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first occasion that I have had to

face  criticisms  voiced by hon. Members  of  this

House on the state of the public bus service,  and

the  Member  for Katong had occasion to  refer  to

remarks made by me in May 1968 and concluded  with

the  words  "it is unfortunate that things  should

have come to an even sorrier pass today, six years

later".  It  would be useful to refer to  relevant

sections  of  Hansard as to what I  said  and  the

context  in  which it was made  to  get  a  proper

perspective.  The  Member  was  referring  to  the

debate  on  the President's Address on  14th  May,

1968, and cols. 235-6 of Hansard go as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Yong Nyuk Lin: Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member

for  Ulu Pandan (then MP was Mr Lee Teck Him]  has

raised  two  important issues during  the  current

debate on the President's Speech which fall within

the  scope  of my new portfolio, the  Ministry  of

Communications, may I be permitted to  inform  the

House,  as  well as members of the public,  of  my

views  on these subjects? I have arrived at  these

views  in  the  short period of four  weeks  since

assuming my portfolio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is nationalisation of bus companies in Singapore

the answer to our transport problem as proposed by

the Member for Ulu



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



Pandan?  Is  this  the panacea  to  our  transport

problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was, in fact, one of the recommendations of

the  Commission of Enquiry set up  by  the  former

Labour   Front  Government  in  1955,  under   the

chairmanship  of Mr L C Hawkins, a member  of  the

London  Transport Executive. Even  if  the  former

Labour  Front  Government had wanted to  implement

this  proposal, it could not have done so  because

Singapore's reserves had been run down to  such  a

low  level,  and  there was  no  second  Christmas

Island to be sold to Australia to find the tens of

millions  of dollars which would have been  needed

to nationalise the bus companies then operating in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the People's Action Party assumed the

government  of  Singapore in 1959, nationalisation

of  bus companies was not one of its platforms and

rightly so, even to this day!'



<br><br>Then,  may  I repeat, in the year 1974,  15  years

later, it is also not its policy. May I then  move

on to column 238? I quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Ulu Pandan next suggested that as

"pirate taxis" are providing service to the public

which  the bus services are not able to cope with,

therefore  such pirate taxis should be allowed  to

operate legally as "express taxis" and that pirate

taxi operators should, at most, be subject only to

a  fine  when caught and that their motor vehicles

should not be confiscated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the pirate-taxi problem came into

being for two reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the growing problem of unemployment in

Singapore so that those who do not wish to  go

on  the  dole -that is, to seek Social Welfare

assistance - turn to hawking or become  pirate

taxi operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the inability of the bus companies to

provide  an  efficient, regular  and  adequate

service for bus travellers.



<br><br>Unless  the  above two problems are resolved,  the

pirate  taxi problem will remain with us for  some

time to come, as both the problems of unemployment

and  a better organised bus transport system  will

need  considerable time and effort even to prevent

the  situation from worsening still further before

attempting to resolve the problems.'



<br><br>May I proceed to col. 240? I quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In conclusion, Sir, may I say that I shall be

guided   by  three  general  principles   in   the

discharge   of  my  duties  in  the  Ministry   of

Communications:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to ensure dependability of transport

service,  i.e.,  to provide a regular,  efficient,

clean and courteous service to the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, speed of service, i.e., as quickly as

possible consistent with safety for passengers and

goods; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, lower cost to the paying public, subject

however to both workers and management maintaining

high productivity and ensuring a reasonable return

for the capital invested.'



<br><br>May  I  add that these same principles still  hold

good?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took two long years of patient observation and

study  before  a three-year (July 1970/June  1973)

White  Paper plan for Reorganisation of the  Motor

Transport Service of Singapore (Paper Cmd.  21  of

1970) was produced and tabled in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now quote two relevant sections from the

draft   Final  Report  dated  June  1973  on   the

Singapore Mass Transit Study Phase 1 drawn  up  by

Wilbur    Smith   and   Associates,   Consultants,

appointed  by the World Bank on what they  thought

of the White Paper (page 1-5):-



<br><br>`Reorganisation of Motor Transport Service, 1970



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the fact that a critical review

of public transport services was long overdue, the

Minister  for Communications tabled a White  Paper

on  the  Reorganisation  of  the  Motor  Transport

Service  of Singapore to Parliament in  1970.  The

Paper  identified  the  problems  in  relation  to

various   forms   of  road  transport   and   made

recommendations  for  the  alleviation  of   these

problems,  particularly for the  redevelopment  of

public transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main recommendations for the improvement of

public transport services were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To increase the bus fleet with 600 new

additional buses over a three-year period, giving

a total fleet of 2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Pirate taxis to be eradicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Ten Chinese bus companies to be

amalgamated  into  three Regional  Companies  by

August  1970.  The other bus company,  Singapore

Traction Company, was to be reorganised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To appoint a transport consultant to make

a study as to how the bus services could be co-ordinated   and   rationalised   for   maximum

efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) To encourage the expansion of the school

bus fleet by granting of road tax concessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) To increase taxi licences from 3,800 to 5,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganisation was seen to be a

comprehensive plan which was to be implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



over  a  three-year  period  and  which,   if

implemented   with  sufficient   imagination   and

vigour,  would bring about a much improved  public

transport service for Singapore by 1973.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I turn to page 2-21?



<br><br>`Public Transport Development Since 1968



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1970 Government White Paper on Reorganisation

of  Motor  Transport  Service  provided  the  much

needed  impetus  for  the  improvement  of  public

transport service in Singapore. For the first time

in   many  years,  a  detailed  and  comprehensive

examination   was  made  of  the   many   problems

confronting   the  variety  of  public   transport

systems.  For each of these problems,  appropriate

remedial action was recommended and problems which

had  seemed  insurmountable began to  appear  less

formidable.  An  important factor  in  making  the

reorganisation possible was the great reduction in

unemployment in Singapore over recent  years.  The

pirate  taxi problem which threatened  to  cripple

the  bus  operators is a case in  point.  If  this

problem  had  been  eliminated  simply  by  strict

enforcement  of existing laws, a large  number  of

owner-drivers would have become unemployed  and  a

popular  service would have been lost~ If  allowed

to  grow  unchecked,  it would  have  led  to  the

eventual  collapse  of  the  privately-owned   bus

companies.'



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Bus Services - Having been assured of

Government's intention to remove pirate taxis from

the  road, the operating companies were encouraged

to  expand  their bus fleets. The ten Chinese  bus

companies merged into three groups: Associated Bus

Services (Pte) Ltd, United. Bus Company (Pte)  Ltd

and Amalgamated Bus Company Ltd. Together with the

Singapore Traction Company, they ran the scheduled

bus services from the time the new routings became

effective in April 1971 until the end of the year,

when  operational difficulties forced the  STC  to

cease  operations  and its vehicles  and  services

were taken over by the three remaining companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968 there were less than 1,200 buses in

scheduled service; of these 60 per cent were  more

than ten years old, and 28 per cent were more than

16  years old. The goal of 2,000 buses, set in the

reorganisation  for  1973, was  reached  in  April

1972. Only one quarter of the fleet was then  more

than 10 years old, and less than ten per cent  had

been  in  service longer than 16 years. They  were

operating on 141 routes, as shown for each company

in  Figure  2-10,  at headways varying  from  four

minutes  to one hour. Bus fares, which  were  made

uniform   among   companies   at   the   time   of

reorganisation, are distance-based;...'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two main targets were achieved under the

White Paper plan for 1970/73: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The target of an increased bus fleet of 2,000

was reached one year ahead of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The 15-year old intractable problem of

thousands of illegal `pirate' taxis which  were

blatantly defying the law and carrying on as  a

public  transport  service  was  resolved   and

thousands involved in this form of livelihood were

given a chance of finding respectable employment

either  as bus drivers, conductors, school  bus

operators, taxi-drivers or as owner-drivers  in

NTUC COMFORT mini-buses or taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all these had been achieved without any

special  vote from the Government to get  on  with

this massive task of reorganisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1973, it was time to plan for the second

and  final  phase of reorganisation of the  public

bus  service  by merging the three  bus  companies

into  one. This was envisaged in para. 4.2 of  the

White Paper which reads as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The ideal situation would be to have just one

single  Road Transport Authority, so that the  bus

commuter need pay only once and be able to  travel

on  any  service  or  services,  speedily  to  his

destination,  with  the  minimum  change  of  bus,

wherever possible. This will take time to  achieve

and may be considered to be an objective which  is

outside the scope of this paper.'



<br><br>This  was  achieved on 1st November,  1973,  when

SBS  came into operation -- only four months after

the completion of the three-year White Paper Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been explained how SBS was

established   with   an  unfortunate   number   of

inherited  problems, and it would  be  trying  the

patience of Members for me to go over them  again.

In  my view, if it was possible for us to overcome

what  was  considered  by many  as  the  insoluble

"pirate"  taxi problem of Singapore, and I  recall

the  number of Members in this House who  strongly

championed  the cause of the pirate  taxi  drivers

when we decided to take strong action against them

after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



the  publication of the White Paper, there are  no

grounds  for  pessimism why the  present  teething

problems  of Singapore Bus Service Ltd, given  the

same   determination   and  resolve,   cannot   be

resolved,  if  we are prepared to  work  hard  and

refuse  to  be  deflected from  the  objective  of

creating a public bus service worthy of its  name,

over the next three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak with reasonable confidence that such an

objective can be realised on two counts: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the existence of the tripartite Bus Services

Reorganisation Committee (BSRC) which will monitor

and  supervise  SBS operations under  my  personal

supervision and direction,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the establishment of the Road Transport

Action   Committee  (RTAC)  with  five   Permanent

Secretaries  from  four Ministries  involved  with

Road  Transport, soon after SBS was  formed,  with

the following two objectives: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) according high priority to the public bus

service; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) adopting various traffic management

measures to reduce the present congestion on

our streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now conclude my remarks by quoting the

relevant paragraph in the Budget Statement made by

my  colleague,  the Minister for Finance,  on  4th

March, 1974, [col. 76] --



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Meanwhile, the cost of running buses has gone

up  -  half  because of wages, half due to  higher

cost of diesel oil, spare parts and tyres. So  the

Government  has had to allow the bus companies  to

put up bus fares. There have been suggestions that

the  Government nationalise the bus companies  and

subsidise the commuter. But what happens when  the

Government  nationalises a company which  has  not

yet    got   institutionalised   management,   and

corruption  on  a  scale  rampant  in  the  former

Singapore Traction Company inevitably results? Let

us  first  get  management and  services  improved

through  tighter supervision from the Ministry  of

Communications.'



<br><br>That  clearly  states  the  Government's  official

policy  towards the SBS which operates the  public

bus  service. We are getting on with the  task  of

tightening up on the management and improving  the

services of SBS.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed is hard work in BSRC. It is in the

quiet back-room where the action is - raising  the

"nationalisation   bogey"   may   get    newspaper

headlines,  but  is not the type  of  constructive

criticism  which BSRC and my Ministry will  gladly

welcome  to assist them in their task of improving

the standards of our public transport service,  in

the quickest possible time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are

very  grateful to the Minister for having put  the

words  that  he had uttered in May, 1968,  in  the

right  perspective, and we are certainly impressed

by  the assertion that he has made in his apologia

just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to put

my  own words in their correct perspective. I  did

say  that the Minister had referred to the problem

of  transport at that time, in the words I quoted.

And I would like to use my own particular words if

I  may, Sir, and I am sure they are in Hansard

(Hansard, 15th March, 1974 (cols. 192-3) by

this time. These were the words I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have to look to the improvement of the SBS.

We  hope  the  Minister  for  Communications  will

eventually be able to contrive for us "a  regular,

efficient, clean and courteous service".  [I  have

no  doubt  about that. But let me  go  on.]  These

words   were   the   words   the   Minister    for

Communications used in May 1968, when he spoke  of

what  he  would  set out to do in respect  of  the

dependability of the transport service. [Now I  do

not  think  I have in any way distorted  what  has

actually  been  said.]  Even  at  that   time   [I

continued   during  the  debate  on   the   Budget

Statement]  the  Minister  was  already  answering

queries regarding the inefficient and poor service

of  our bus companies. It is unfortunate [and this

is  what  I  added; these are my own  words]  that

things  should have come to an even  sorrier  pass

today, six years later.'



<br><br>I  think that is a referential description of  the

state of things. But let me continue to quote what

I actually said, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Having said this, one must also admit that it is

no  use  wasting  time  over  laments  and  heated

argument.'



<br><br>Constructive criticism, as the Minister has asked,

yes,  but  it is no use wasting time over  laments

and heated argument.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



And I hope the boys up there will note this too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Communications is himself most

acutely  and painfully aware of our bus situation.

[Aren't you, Sir?] I have no doubt that, if it  is

necessary and feasible for the Government to  take

over  the bus service, then this will be done [and

I  am  not seeking any headlines when I make  that

particular  remark.] The Minister  has  shown  his

determination to maintain a course  of  action  he

deems  best under the circumstances. [Is that  not

correct, Sir?] Surely this conclusion has not been

reached  without  a total assessment  of  choices.

[That  is  correct also, Sir.] I do  not  see  any

alternative to giving the Minister and his aides a

chance  to  vindicate  their judgements  [that  is

correct,  too.  And, of course, we  shall  all  be

judges,  and  the  public will  be  judges  as  to

whether the Minister and his aides vindicate their

judgement, Sir.] At the same time I would like  to

be assured that, while every attempt is being made

to  whip up the necessary hardware - buses, repair

facilities, and so on - to meet the situation, the

matter  of  training of relevant  management  both

inside  and outside the SBS is also being  pursued

vigorously.'



<br><br>I  think  I  have  put my words in  their  correct

perspective, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like

the  Member for Katong, I am also impressed by the

rebuttal  given by the Minister to  criticisms  by

Members  of this House concerning the bus service.

It is difficult to take him on a debate because of

his  considerable  ability and  his  eloquence  in

putting across his point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we accept the fact that in this spirit of

reorganisation,  teething problems  are  bound  to

arise and therefore time must be given to see  the

successful  fruition of whatever  reorganisational

plans there are in this bus transport system.  But

I  wonder  if I could get some kind of  indication

from the Minister as to the period of time that we

have  got  to  wait. I did say in my remarks  that

there are already signs showing the success of the

introduction   of  this  supplementary   transport

scheme.  These are good signs. Will he be able  to

roughly guess the period of time that we have  got

to  wait before we see a vast improvement  in  all

the reorganisational plans?

seem  to  be repeating ourselves all the  time.  I

feel  that  it  is  beginning  to  look  like  the

`Watergate Affair' - plenty of noise. Where are we

going  to? I think, in all fairness, the  Minister

has  just given a very strong assurance that there

is  a determination to make good and the union has

given their promise. I mean, let us be fair. If we

go  on harping the same old point, we are going to

<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in

view of the satisfactory explanation given by  the

Minister  for  Communications,  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head HA be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (b) of  subhead AA 2730.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Post Office Savings Bank is a statutory

board in banking business, and it should be  in  a

position to lend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



money to others and to make more money. I have  no

doubt that the POSB is just doing that and is in a

very  sound  financial position.  That  being  the

case,  Sir,  my  query is, why  is  this  $20,000-contribution  from public funds made to  encourage

students to save money in the POSB? I am sure  the

POSB  can  well afford this as well  as  think  of

other  incentives  to encourage savings  not  only

from  our  students but also from  the  people  of

Singapore as a whole. In view of the fact that the

interest  in the bank rate and fixed deposits  has

increased,  would  the Post  Office  Savings  Bank

consider   increasing  its   interest   rates   to

depositors?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax exemption for POSB interest is not a

sufficient incentive for deposits in the  POSB  as

the  bulk of its depositors are in an income group

that does not pay income tax in any case.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1968 the

Post  Office  Savings Bank Advisory Committee  was

set  up to examine ways and means of improving the

Post    Office   Savings   Bank.   One   of    the

recommendations   of   the   Committee   was   the

introduction of the Students' Gift Account scheme.

The scheme was accepted, and it was introduced  to

Secondary  I students in 1969. Under this  scheme,

any  student entering Secondary I classes for  the

first time will be eligible to apply for a gift of

$5  from  the Government provided he has a minimum

of $5 in his POSB account. However, the sum of $10

can only be withdrawn after a period of five years

from the date of Government's contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Telok Blangah is interested, I

will mention the various amounts provided. For the

year  1971, although $60,000 was provided, $11,905

was   actually  paid  out.  In  1972  $50,000  was

provided,  and  only $10,625 was used.  Last  year

$20,000 was provided and $14,505 was actually paid

out.  The  amount provided for 1974  was  $20,000.

This is the amount referred to by the Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's contribution is rather small and

it   is  actually  a  worthwhile  expenditure   to

encourage   the  saving  habit  among  our   young

citizens.  The need to save is even more important

in  the  present inflationary situation.  However,

the  question whether the Government should  cease

to  make the contribution is a matter which has to

be  considered between the Ministry of Finance and

the POSB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the suggestion that the interest on

deposits  with the POSB be increased,  Members  of

the  House will recall that this same question was

raised  with the Minister for Finance  during  the

Budget   debate,  and  the  Minister  had  already

mentioned the reason for the present rate and,  if

necessary, the matter might be reconsidered.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I have no quarrel at all

with   the   incentives.  Let  us   have   further

incentives, if necessary. But the POSB is a money-making  statutory board. Use the  money  from  the

POSB  to  give  the incentives -  but  why  public

funds?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> As I have mentioned just now,

this  is a matter to be discussed between the POSB

and  the  Ministry  of Finance.  The  contribution

comes  from  the  Ministry of Finance.  If  it  is

willing  to  assist  the POSB to  promote  savings

among the young citizens, I think all the more the

encouragement should be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> It is my sincere hope that the

Ministry of Communications would take this  matter

up with the Ministry of Finance and perhaps advise

that the POSB is in a sound financial footing  and

that the POSB can afford to pay the incentives, if

necessary.  I  hope next year this provision  will

not appear under this Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this Head, I am again going to speak

on "flag of convenience" vessels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been listed internationally as a

country   that   welcomes  "flag  of  convenience"

registration.  Sir, I submit once  again  that  in

return  for  all  the  incentives  that  Singapore

offers  to  "flag  of  convenience"  ships,   such

registration brings no benefit to Singapore at all

other  than perhaps the dubious prestige of having

its  name appearing in the Lloyd's Register  as  a

country with a sizable shipping tonnage. I do  not

think that we should get into the Register at  the

cost  of  getting ourselves associated and  lumped

together  with countries such as Panama,  Liberia,

Somalia  and  Honduras, which  are  our  notorious

predecessors in allowing their flags to be lightly

used by shipowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned during the Budget debate,

ships registered under the flag of a country  need

not have to call at a port of the country of their

nominal   flag,   not   even   for   the   initial

registration at all. Many of the ships  registered

under "flag of convenience"

may  continue to sail the seven seas  but  without

ever touching the shores of the country whose flag

the  ships are flying. The foreign ship-owners  of

vessels  presently registered under the  Singapore

flag are birds of passage, who would not have  the

slightest  hesitation of changing to another  flag

of registration if there arc better pickings to be

made  under the new flag. I mentioned this, and  I

repeat,  that Singapore's good name and  its  flag

are being tarnished if we continue to tolerate the

practice of "flag of convenience" registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the registration of foreign vessels under

Singapore  flag, the owners only need  to  hire  a

desk-space and the use of an office address.  They

need  not employ Singapore crew. Many of  them  do

not.  They employ crew which is known as "crew  of

convenience." In other words, they register  ships

here  which need not come to Singapore shores  and

need not employ local crew. Even if the ships call

at  Singapore regularly, the ship-owners can still

employ  foreign crew openly and with the  blessing

of the Director of Marine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be claimed that the "flag of convenience"

has the same effect on organised seamen just as  a

red  rag is commonly supposed to incite a bull.  I

do  not  deny  that trade unions, particularly  of

seamen,  have  very strong views on and  are  very

firmly   opposed  to  the  "flag  of  convenience"

registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look at the problem in as an

objective  manner as we can. On the  one  hand  we

have the following disadvantages: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nothing much, if anything at all, is gained

by  Singapore by way of foreign exchange either as

investment   or  earnings.  The  investment   that

accrues  to Singapore upon registration is  wholly

or  mostly  tied  up  with  the  ships  which  are

extremely  mobile.  Although flag  of  convenience

ships  are required to maintain a business address

in Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



their actual operational office is situated

elsewhere to which their earnings are remitted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member for Telok Blangah

wants an answer from the Minister, could he please

make his speech short?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, that is why I did not

move my previous amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Flag of convenience ships do not have to

employ  Singapore seamen, irrespective of  whether

they  are union members or not. And if such  ships

take  on foreign seamen there i5 no assurance that

the  ships  will  observe  Singapore's  provisions

governing  safety  of ships. The odium  associated

with  the loss of life, of property in the sinking

of  a "coffin" ship registered under the Singapore

flag may outweigh whatever the benefit of allowing

flag of convenience registration to Singapore.  If

most  flag  of convenience ships do  not  call  at

Singapore  there  is  no means  for  Singapore  to

ensure    that   they   observe   certain   safety

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Having a large fleet of flag of convenience

vessels  does not mean our exporters and importers

would be able to obtain concessions on the freight

of  goods  to and from Singapore as these  vessels

would  be  either  tied to  one  of  the  shipping

conferences  or  be interested in making  as  much

profit as they possibly can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Our Port may not even benefit from the flag

of  convenience ships which may never have  called

at Singapore at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against all these disadvantages, we have (1) the

dubious  prestige of a nation with  a  substantial

mercantile  navy whose individual ship-owners  and

masters may not even know where Singapore is,  and

(2)  the revenue from the taxation on the earnings

of   the  vessels.  If  the  skill  of  land-based

enterprises   in   avoiding   taxation   is    any

indication,  the  revenue  from  this  source  can

hardly amount to much.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We have passed guillotine

time. But if the Member will stop now, I will give

the Minister two minutes to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> All right, Sir,I will just

tell the Minister this: if we want to have locally-registered  ships,  let us have  genuine  locally-registered  ships  and not ships registered  under

the "flag of convenience".



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, Members have heard what

the  Member for Telok Blangah has said  about  the

disadvantages, and that there are no advantages to

be  gained in the various aspects of this "flag of

convenience",  as he termed it, ship  registry  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, an open registry of ships was

established under which non-Singapore citizens and

companies could register their ships in Singapore.

It  was  decided  at  that  time  that  incentives

similar to those offered to the pioneer industries

should be introduced to encourage registration  of

ships  in  Singapore, and the major incentive  was

the   exemption  from  Singapore  income  tax   of

earnings   from   the  operation   of   Singapore-registered  ships and low registration  fees.  The

success  of  our  Registry can be  seen  from  the

tonnage figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> What for?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Just to tell the Member that we

do  derive  benefits from it by knowing  what  has

happened in a short period. In 1968, we had on our

register  253,000 tons and on 28th  February  this

year,  we  have more than 2.85 million gross  tons

registered in our Registry. What does this mean in

terms  of  benefits to us? First, we come  to  the

actual revenue which the Member mentioned was  not

much.  In 1971, the revenue was $885,000. In 1972,

it  was  $2.33  million. That is in terms  of  the

actual revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about other advantages that we have derived

from this registry of ships? We must remember that

we  have a port which is the fourth largest in the

world



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



serving  ships  of many nations and equipped  with

facilities for cellular container ships.  Then  we

have shipping and ship-repair industry which is  a

very  substantial  industry.  We  also  have   the

national  shipping line providing liner and  other

shipping  services.  In addition,  we  have  local

shipping  companies,  some  of  them  are   owning

substantial fleets. Then we have a whole range  of

associated activities from ship-breaking to  ship-chandlering,  ship  insurance,  financing,   legal

services,  inland transport services, and  so  on.

All  these  are  various aspects of  the  shipping

industry and the registry of ships is part of this

system.  Viewed  in  this  broader  context,   the

Registry can be seen to play a role in helping  to

promote  Singapore as a shipping centre. The  fact

that  the  earnings of Singapore-registered  ships

are  exempt  `from Singapore income tax  may  make

financial  institutions more  willing  to  provide

credit   facilities   particularly   against   the

security   of  firm  period  charters  since   the

possibility  of changes in tax level  is  removed.

Owners  of Singapore flag ships may then  find  it

easier  to  get  access  to financing  from  local

financial institutions. All these will help in the

development of Singapore as a financial centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ang, I must interrupt you now.

Does the Member for Telok Blangah wish to

withdraw his amendment, or does he want to put it

to a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I do not wish to withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head HB having expired, the

following amendment, standing in the name of Mr N.

Govindasamy, was not proceeded with -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head HB be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1401.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $795,470 for Head HB ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head HC --

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head HC be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1106*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of

Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Head, I would like to ask the Minister

of  State two questions. The first question is  on

the  taxi service at the Paya Lebar Airport.  Many

years  ago,  the Airport had a system  of  permits

which  were  issued to taxis to  ply  between  the

airport  and  the  city. Only those  with  permits

could  enter the precincts of the airport to  pick

up  passengers.  The number of  taxis  which  were

given  permits were selected from a  few  thousand

applications.  Selection was  done  by  the  Civil

Aviation Department, the Registry of Vehicles, the

Traffic  Police  and so on. With  this  system  of

permits,  I  am  afraid there is quite  a  lot  of

confusion at the airport at present. The reason is

that  there is inadequate control. However,  there

are also some taxis plying between the airport and

the city without permits. This defeats the purpose

of  issuing permits. I would like the Minister  to

investigate into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member for Sembawang wants

an  answer from the Minister, he will have to stop

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, I need only half a

minute more. The second question i5 on taxi stands

at  the airport which are inadequate. I understand

that  there  are more than 200 taxis operating  at

the  airport. But there are taxi stands  for  only

about  20-odd  taxis at the airport  precincts.  I

think this number is not enough. I would like  the

Minister  to consider whether the number  of  taxi

stands could be increased at Paya Lebar Airport in

order  to  improve  the service  provided  by  the

taxis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy is not here. Dr

Ang.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, at the moment, there are

308 taxis having this special permit to operate at

the Singapore Airport. The number is determined by

the  needs  and, if required, more taxis  will  be

allowed to operate there. Taxis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



without  permits  are  not  allowed  to  pick   up

passengers  at the airport. They are only  allowed

to pick up passengers going to the airport and not

from the airport to the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the taxi stands, the situation is

constantly  under review, and if there  is  actual

shortage  I  am sure the Airport authorities  will

provide the necessary space to see that there  are

sufficient  taxi stands to cater for  the  various

taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the control of the taxi traffic at the

airport,  we  have the Airport police which  makes

periodic  checks to ensure that only taxi  drivers

who have been registered are allowed to operate.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption. Mr

Teong, would you like to withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the  Minister  of  State  for  his  reply  to   my

questions. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $11,745,760 for Head HC ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,848,400 for Head HC ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b>

Sir,  I beg to report that the Committee of Supply

has   made  further  progress  on  the  Main   and
