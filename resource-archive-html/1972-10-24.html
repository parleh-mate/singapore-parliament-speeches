<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Law and Home Affairs, and National Development (a)

when  the  bus shelters (i) in front of Block  14,

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and Home Affairs, and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and Home Affairs, and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am happy to inform the Member that

in  front of the four blocks, referred to  by  the

Member  in his question, started recently and  all

of them are expected to be completed by the middle

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RENTALS OF HOUSING BOARD KIOSKS AND SHOPHOUSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Law and Home Affairs, and National Development  if

he  will ask the Housing and Development Board  to

review  its  current  policy of  computing  rising

rentals  on  the  basis  of  public  tenders  when

allocating  kiosks and shophouses to  resettlement

cases  and  to rationalise rentals in  respect  of

resettlement cases to a fair and reasonable  level

in comparison to rentals for such premises let out

by tender.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and

Development Board fixes the rentals of kiosks  and

shophouses  allocated  to  resettlement  cases  by

basing  the  rents on the lowest  of  the  several

successful public tenders for the type of trade in

the  particular  shopping  centre.  For  ease   of

reference,  I will hereafter refer to this  lowest

tender for rent as the public rental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1st July, 1971, a rising rental

concession  was  also granted whereby  shopkeepers

were required to pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



only 70 per cent of the public rental in the first

year  of  tenancy,  the  payments  of  rent  being

increased  at  the  rate of 10 per  cent  annually

until  the full public rental was reached  in  the

fourth   year.   To   further   assist   resettled

shopkeepers,  a new resettlement policy  increased

the  concession rate after 1st July, 1971, whereby

a  rental subsidy of 50 per cent is granted in the

first year, and the payments are increased at  the

rate of 10 per cent per year until the full public

rental  is  reached in the sixth year. Apparently,

even  this further increase of rental subsidy  has

not  worked out to be fair and reasonable  in  all

cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise hardship suffered by shopkeepers, the

policy  has  recently  been  reviewed  and  a  new

formula   worked  out  whereby  the   rental   for

resettlement cases for shops is fixed at a reduced

rate  of 90 per cent of the public rental. As from

July   this   year,  resettled  shopkeepers   will

initially  pay  only 50 per cent  of  the  reduced

public  rental  in  the first year  and  a  rental

increase  of 10 per cent per year until the  sixth

year.  The  rental  for the sixth  and  subsequent

years  is, in fact, equivalent to 90 per  cent  of

the  public  rental so that resettled  shopkeepers

will  continue to enjoy a rent rebate  of  10  per

cent  of  the  public rental from the  sixth  year

onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further safeguard against the rents being

set  too high by erratic public tenders, the Shops

Committee  of  the  Housing and Development  Board

will   fix   an  appropriate  rent  for  resettled

shopkeepers where the public rental is  more  than

twice  that of the minimum rental approved by  the

Board.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when a business partnership is formed,  will

such  a  partnership enjoy the  rebates?  Can  the

Minister please clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in the event of a partnership

being  introduced, resettled shopkeepers  are  now

allowed  concessional rentals but not at the  same

figures. The concessional rentals are at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



the  rate  of  75  per cent of the reduced  public

rental in the first year, rising gradually by five

per  cent annually to the sixth year, and  payment

of  the  full  public rental in  the  seventh  and

subsequent years. Under the previous policy  where

permission  was  granted for the  inclusion  of  a

partner  into  the  business,  the  rising  rental

concessions  were  withdrawn and  the  rental  was

immediately raised to the full public rental.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE OF ACCOUCHEMENT CHARGES FOR HIGHER ORDER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF DELIVERY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Health)</b></div>



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our

President's  address to this House emphasised  the

need  in the next five years to strive for  higher

standards in everything. We want higher quality in

jobs,  schools, hospitals, social and recreational

amenities and homes. The crucial pre-condition for

fulfilling  these objectives is smaller  families.

Only then can more resources and care be given  to

each child, by the parents and by the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Family Planning Programme has in the

last  six years been able to achieve some  measure

of  success.  It has brought down the  high  birth

rate  of  28.8 per thousand in 1966  to  22.3  per

thousand in 1971. But there are many people who do

not  practise family planning. These couples still

want large families. About 35 per cent of children

born  are of a fourth or higher order born to  the

family. The problem is made worse because most  of

these  children are born to families who are least

able  to feed them and nurture them. These parents

cannot give their children opportunities equal  to

those of children in smaller families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an industrialised and highly urbanised

Singapore  of  the  1970's, a large  family  is  a

tragedy  for  the  children,  a  burden  to  their

parents, and a drag



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



on   the   whole  society.  Infant  mortality   in

Singapore is one of the lowest in the world. It is

not necessary to have large numbers of children to

ensure the continuity of the family line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the incidence of anaemia cases among

children  revealed that 25 per cent of  the  cases

were  from  families with three or less  children.

Seventy-five  per cent of them were from  families

with more than three children. The majority of the

parents with three or more children cannot  afford

to provide their children with adequate and proper

nourishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children suffering from inadequate protein, iron

and vitamins during their formative years, tend to

be  seriously retarded in their brain development.

This is clearly reflected in a study of Primary VI

examination  results  among  a  group   of   1,123

children.  This  study showed that among  children

who are well-nourished 77 per cent of them passed,

and  only  23  per  cent  failed.  Those  who  are

averagely nourished 51.4 per cent passed, 48.6 per

cent  failed. But of those who are under-nourished

only  23.9  per  cent passed, and  76.1  per  cent

failed.  Health  and  malnutrition  factors   were

compounded by lack of maternal care and  of  books

and recreational toys of educative value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government plans to eradicate the present

pockets of malnutrition in children to ensure  the

mental and physical development of our young.  But

these plans can only be partially successful.  The

problem  must be tackled at source, by  preventing

such large families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy expands, wages will go up, But the

rise  in  wages  will not bring a better  life  to

those  families  who  increase  their  burdens  by

having more children to feed, clothe, and nurture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When parents have more children than they can

adequately feed and care for, these children  will

have  poorer diet and health. Their education  and

training will suffer and they will remain  at  the

lower levels of lower incomes in unskilled jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of subsidies by the Government can

remedy the lack of adequate food and care at home.

Subsidised  meals in schools cannot  make  up  for

what  they should get at home. Children do not  go

to  school  until the age of six,  by  which  time

permanent damage would already have been done. One

meal  in  school for slightly more than  half  the

year,   excluding  holidays,  cannot  repair   the

damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the greater the feather-bedding of large

anti-social  families, the  greater  will  be  the

numbers  of  large  families.  The  costs  of  the

subsidies  will be compounded all along the  line,

from  housing,  to  nutrition,  to  education.  In

effect,  the Government has to increase  taxes  to

subsidise  people  with  low  incomes  and   large

families.  It  is a vicious cycle  which  we  must

break.  It  is  kinder  in the  long  run  to  put

disincentives on large families. Certainly it will

carry  less danger of social tension, overcrowding

and   generally  lowered  standards  in  the  very

limited  space  of Singapore. The quality  of  the

environment  and  standards of  life  must  suffer

unless  we take strong measures now to stop  large

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, social friction and tensions will

increase  between those with small families  whose

children  will in turn do well, because of  better

health  and  social factors, and those with  large

families  whose numerous children will  do  poorly

because  they  are deprived of adequate  food  and

care.  To  bring up each child up to  his  or  her

fullest  potential,  we must  break  this  vicious

cycle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, too frequent child-bearing means

physical  exhaustion  and adverse  effect  on  the

mother's health. The incidence of women dying as a

result  of  child  birth rises sharply  after  the

fourth  pregnancy. Weakened mothers are unable  to

work and supplement the family income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our society is to become more just and equal,

smaller families must be actively encouraged,  and

large ones actively discouraged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accouchement fees, maternity leave, priority

points  for homes will be so adjusted to encourage

two  children  per family. The third  child  is  a

luxury  for all but those who can afford to lavish

the  same  care  on  three  as  they  can  on  two

children.  Singapore cannot afford the fourth  and

fifth  child  for parents without the  ability  to

bring  them up properly housed, clothed,  fed  and

educated.  The  results  will  be  disastrous,  in

juvenile   delinquency,  social  resentments   and

tension,   as   differences   in   earnings    and

circumstances  widen between the children  of  the

successful  small  families  and  those   of   the

unsuccessful large ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing Board priorities for allocation of flats

will  be  changed so that those with two  or  less

children   will   have  the  highest   priorities.

Families   with  three  will  drop   slightly   in

priority.  Families with four or  more  will  have

little   priority.   This,   however,   will    be

implemented  so  as  to be  kinder  to  those  who

already have large families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with this policy of encouraging

small  families, income tax relief in  respect  of

children  will  in  future be  reduced,  from  the

present  five,  to only the first three  children.

Those  who already are enjoying income tax  relief

on  five children will, of course, continue to  do

so.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance,  will

make  a  statement on this after all  the  details

have been worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid maternity leave both in Government Service

and  under the Employment Act will be reduced from

three  to  two confinements after 1st August  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's duty is to encourage family

planning  and  to discourage large  families.  The

Government    has   decided   to   increase    the

accouchement  charges  for  deliveries  of  higher

orders  of  children in the Government  hospitals.

Parents  must  be made more aware  of  the  actual

costs  of  bringing their third, fourth  or  fifth

child   into  society.  If  they  find   the   new

subsidised rates difficult to bear, then they will

never be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



to bring up the children properly to earn a decent

living. The new rates will be as follows:-

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Singapore resident" means Singapore

citizens  and  includes persons in  possession  of

Singapore  blue Identity Cards, or  married  to  a

Singapore  resident.  Non-residents  will  not  be

accepted  in  our  C and B class maternity  wards.

Expectant  mothers  who have come  into  Singapore

specially to deliver their children will be  taken

in only into the maximum fee-paying A class wards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out that these new rates still mean

heavy Government subsidies for the delivery of the

first and second child in C class wards. They  are

less for the third child and none for the fourth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a waiver of these fees on condition

the woman or her husband undergoes sterilization.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More use of sterilization as a means of family

planning  for  those  who  have  completed   their

families must be encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new rates will be brought into effect about

9 1/2  months from today, that is, 1st  of  August,

1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Family Planning and Population Board

have  made birth control services freely available

to  all  over  the  last seven years  through  its

network of family planning clinics in the Maternal

and  Child  Health  Services. A  nation-wide  mass

family   planning  campaign  was   launched   only

recently to urge parents to have small families.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



Abortion  is  available at little or  no  cost  to

those  who  need them, especially in  cases  where

contraceptives have failed. This policy of the two-child per family will be encouraged in all aspects

of  social  and  economic policy. Conversely,  the

large family will be actively discouraged in every

way.  This  is  for the good of our  nation  as  a

whole,  and  kinder to those who still  ignorantly

believe that the more children they have, the more

benefits they will get from them.

very  glad to listen to the Minister for  Health's

explanation on family planning. I quite agree with

what  he  has said. But what about the couple  who

have two girls? Therefore, if they want to have  a

boy,  then most probably they have to adopt a  boy

from another country, if the couple is limited  to

two   children.  This  restriction  is  very  bad,

because  we are going against nature. The Minister

should  consider this matter over  again.  He  can

tell  the  people  to  go  for  sterilization   or

abortion.  That  is  a different  matter.  But  he

should  not  introduce a policy saying  that  each

family should have only two children, because this

restriction  is bad for our country.  Why  do  the

Western countries, such as America, not have  such

a  policy?  It  is  because they want  people  for

national  service. If we have too many females  at

present, in future it may be difficult for  us  to

find the men needed for national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in accouchement charges is also

ridiculous.  This  is  very  dangerous   for   the

country.  I warn the Minister that if the  charges

are  raised, the people will cry out, saying  that

the PAP Government with full 65 seats are bringing

in  all sorts of measures. I do not object, but it

should be done step by step. This is unfair to the

people.  I  do  not know whether my colleagues  in

this  House  will agree with me, but  this  policy

should be modified in order to help the people.  I

hope the Minister will consider this Smatter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I fully support the necessity of having a

small family. But my personal opinion is that to

limit a family to two children is a little bit too

harsh. I strongly feel that the limit should go up

to three, for the simple reason that if something

befalls on one of the two children, then what will

happen? I strongly urge that the restriction be

amended from two children to three children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase of accouchement charges,

I  would strongly suggest that we spend more  time

educating  the people on the importance of  having

small families, rather than imposing the increases

in 9 1/2 months' time. I feel that the period is  a

little  bit  too short for them to be sufficiently

educated on the need for a small family. I  appeal

to the Minister to give the people at least one or

one  and  a half years of such education, together

with intensive campaigns on small families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

agree with the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. The  ones

which  we should educate are not the ones who  are

already  educated. It is the people in  the  rural

areas  who  are the unfortunate ones  we  have  to

educate.  But  to  drive  this  point  home,  hon.

Members and even the Minister for Health must have

a lot of time, energy and effort to spare. I would

like   to  suggest  to  the  Minister  that   more

intensive  propaganda be carried out in the  rural

areas,  in the kampongs, in the islands, in  order

that  this  policy  of having  small  families  be

driven home to the people. And that is why  I  say

we  should not exercise our power without rational

considerations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  fully  support these measures against  families

having  many  children.  I  also  agree  with  the

suggestions  made by the -Member for  Changi  that

adequate  propaganda  should  be  carried  out  by

making  use  of  all the mass media.  I  have  one

simple  question  to raise on  the  priority  for.

Housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



Board  flats:  How are we to prevent couples  from

having more children after they have been allotted

Housing Board flats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

beg  your  indulgence in allowing speeches  to  be

made  on  a  Ministerial  Statement  although  the

Standing Orders only provide for questions  to  be

asked?  With your permission, Sir, since you  have

been  lenient with other Members, may I be allowed

to  add  my  own comments although I  know  it  is

against the Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one must be very realistic in the situation

that  we are in. There are many basic factors that

none of us can change and through no fault of  our

own;   for  example,  our  land  area,  our  human

resources,    our   financial   capability,    our

vulnerability to factors outside Singapore. Having

a  large  family is, and I do not like to use  the

word  "feudalistic",  I think  basically  a  rural

psychology or philosophy - the larger the  family,

the more hands to work in the field. Naturally the

advantage  is evident in a situation like  in  old

China  and in India, and even in the greater  part

of  agricultural countries in Southeast Asia where

the  female  offspring is normally regarded  as  a

loss and economically non-productive, particularly

in  some  of  the  older fashions  of  the  Indian

community  where a handsome dowry has  got  to  be

paid  when they marry off a daughter. But that  is

applicable in a rural agricultural society. It has

no  relevance to Singapore, which is cosmopolitan.

The  less people we have, the less tension we will

create. Maybe in the next 10 or 20 years, for  the

next  generation, we have a duty to see  that  the

kind  of  society we leave behind for our children

and  their  children in the next 20  or  50  years

would be a place worth living in, a place which we

can show to the world that our human energy is not

only  confined to producing people of our own kind

but   that   we  are  quite  capable  of  creative

thinking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the relaxation of the rules as proposed

by  the  Minister, there is one fact,  I  think  a

painful  fact,  which  all  Members  must   agree.

However  relaxed  we are in the rules,  we  cannot

ensure  so-and-so that he would get a son  instead

of a daughter. The Minister is totally helpless in

a  matter  like this. If hon. Members can  find  a

solution,  as  a result of the relaxation  of  the

rules,  that  perhaps after having four  daughters

the  next  child  is guaranteed to  be  a  son  to

inherit  the family line, then I think that  might

well  be worth considering. But in the absence  of

any solution or a breakthrough in medical science,

I  think none of us here can be of any help at all

to ensure that everyone can have an offspring or a

child to continue the family line.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister for Health has mentioned  that  from

August 1973, the priority point system for Housing

Board  flats for those with more than two children

will  be  lowered. I was just wondering how  would

the  priority be affected, for those  who  already

have three or more children and who are already on

the waiting list.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

principle,  I  agree  that we Singaporeans  should

have a small family, but the method of introducing

this disincentive to a big family is, I think, not

fair and practical. I always believe that birth is

accidental and not incidental!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to support the spirit of the Statement

by  the Minister for Health. But I think there are

certain points that we have to consider. The first

and  foremost point is this: we must try our level

best  to  persuade  the people  of  Singapore  the

significance  of  having smaller families.  To  my

mind,  we  have not given sufficient attention  to

the methods of persuading our people. I think this

is one area where we must intensify our efforts in

order to have the maximum effect. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



can  move people much more by persuasion  than  by

imposing  additional fees or  any  other  measures

like  minimising  priorities  or  imposing  higher

accouchement fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention is that the family planning

programme  has not been sufficiently  intensified.

If  you  have  worked in, say, the Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital,  you will notice the degree of ignorance

of  many people who come from the rural areas.  To

them,   family  planning  means  nothing,  it   is

nonexistent, or they know nothing about it at all.

The  Minister  should, therefore,  intensify  this

campaign in the rural areas and also, in terms  of

the  future, get it across to the schools. I think

all our youngsters must know this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the accouchement fees which

the  Minister has mentioned. It seems to  me  that

there is hardly any difference in the accouchement

fee charged for the C class as compared with B  or

A  class. A person who can afford an A class  ward

need  pay  only $250 for the third child,  whereas

the one who goes into C class pays $100. $100 to a

C  class  ward  patient could  well  mean  half  a

month's salary, but $250 means nothing to one  who

can  afford  an  A  class  ward.  If  we  are   to

discourage  large  families,  we  must  discourage

everyone, not just the poor but the rich as  well.

I think there are many factors as to why we should

have  small  families. The family should  be  kept

small,  irrespective of whether he is from a  poor

social class or the rich. I therefore say that the

accouchement fee rates must be revised so that  if

we  are  to  discourage  the  poor  we  must  also

discourage the rich.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I take the point

brought up by the Member for Anson about a  couple

having  two female children? Although he is rather

vague and diversified in his comments. I think his

point is that if you have two female children, you

may  want  a  male,  then what  happens?  In  this

modern,  urbanised  and industrialised  Singapore,

the  sexes of the children should not count. After

all, we have the Women's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



Charter,  and so on. We have equal pay for  women.

So  we  should not discriminate between  male  and

female children He also mentioned that restricting

the   number  of  children  to  two  is  a  rather

dangerous  policy.  On the contrary,  and  I  have

stated this in my Ministerial Statement, if you do

not limit the number, particularly in the case  of

families  who  cannot afford  to  bring  up  their

children properly, you are going to create  social

tension  between  those who are  poorly  paid  and

unskilled, because their parents were not able  to

educate  or  nurture them, and  those  from  small

families because their parents have given them the

best.  Therefore, limiting the number of  children

per  family will mean that in 15 or 20 years time,

we  will have less social tension. We will have  a

more  just and equal society. If we do not do  so,

whatever we do in subsidies we cannot bring  about

a  more  just  and equal society. I  am  sure  the

Member  for  Anson wants to have a more  just  and

equal society in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Members for Bukit Ho

Swee,  Changi and Mount-batten, is that not enough

time  has  been  given to persuade the  people  to

confine  to  small families. As I have stated,  we

have just held a mass family planning campaign.  I

wonder what the Member for Changi was doing  then.

Did  he  go round to his constituents to propagate

the  concept  of  the  small  family?  As  far  as

publicity  about family planning is  concerned,  I

have  said  that  we have had the family  planning

service  since  1966, six years ago.  In  fact,  a

White  Paper  on family planning was presented  in

this  House by my predecessor. Campaigns on family

planning had been launched before and there is  no

excuse  for  members  of the public  not  to  know

anything  about family planning. Our surveys  have

shown that although they know what family planning

is, a percentage of them do not want to accept it.

Therefore, it is not the case of the public  being

ignorant of family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that was brought up is that we are

limiting  the number of children to two.  What  we

are advocating is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



two is the ideal. It does not mean that you cannot

have  three or four. If you can afford it, by  all

means,  have  three  or four. But  if  you  cannot

afford  to bring up two children properly, then  I

think it is criminal for you to bring up three  or

four. It might be satisfying to you yourself,  but

please  remember that the third and  fourth  child

you  bring forth may have no prospects of a better

life in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding accouchement fees, the Member for Kim

Seng  mentioned that there is not much  difference

between  the C class and the A class. Well,  there

is  a difference, but it narrows down to the point

when  the mother comes for her fourth child. As  I

have  said, this is a matter of cutting  down  the

subsidies.  We  subsidise the first two  children.

For  the third child, we subsidise slightly  less,

but  there will be no subsidy whatsoever  for  the

fourth  and  fifth child. As I  have  said  in  my

Ministerial Statement, if a person cannot pay  the

higher accouchement charges, how then can he  have

the  means and the ability to bring up a child  so

that  he  or she will have an even chance  in  the

future for a better life?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Member for Bras Basah

is  that  birth is an accident. I do not  think  I

should comment on that. I hope the Member for Bras

Basah has not come into the world by accident!



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

answered  my query regarding the priority  of  the

Housing and Development Board point system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sorry, I missed that point. In

fact,   I  have  already  answered  that   in   my

Ministerial Statement. May I just quote it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Families with four or more will have little

priority. This, however, will be implemented so as

to  be  kinder  to  those who already  have  large

families.'



<br><br>I hope that answers the Member's point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I wish to ask the Minister about the case of

twins. For example, twins were born to the family



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Member for Changi. How would the case  of

twins apply to these measures?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Well, if twins were born in

the  first  delivery, then it is  counted  as  the

first  delivery and you pay the fee for the  first

delivery.  Of course, after having got  twins,  if

you have a third one, then the fee will be charged

as  for  a  third delivery. But if the Member  for

Sembawang happens to have twins, then we  will  be

more flexible in our interpretation.

for the Speech which he delivered on behalf of

the Government at the opening of the First

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  President  mentioned  in  his

Address   that   we  should  not  "allow   foreign

interests   with  large  financial  resources   to

manipulate  our  internal politics,  by  financing

Singapore    political   parties,    professional,

academic  and  other  groups".  Because   of   our

geographical  position, our social  structure  and

the   changes  in  international  politics,   many

foreign   powers  would  like  to  know  or   even

influence our political trends. And some countries

even  do not like to see us succeed gradually.  As

in  the case of political parties, institutions of

higher learning in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



our  country will also be targets for manipulation

by  these foreign elements. There must be a reason

why our students become indifferent to the society

and  the country in which they live, and for  them

to  adopt  a hostile attitude towards our society.

If  we  are  not  vigilant  enough,  some  of  our

institutions and students may engage in activities

beyond the

scope  of  their  function under  the  pretext  of

cultural  exchanges. On the one hand,  we  welcome

international scholars to come here and  genuinely

help  us improve our academic standards, in  order

to  realise  what the President has  said  in  his

Address   that  "we  can  become  a   centre   for

excellence in all fields important to our economic

and  cultural life." On the other hand, we  should

guard    against   the   possibility   that    our

institutions of higher learning or even the  whole

of  Singapore  will one day become  a  centre  for

international  espionage  under  the  pretext   of

cultural exchanges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum relating to the

Ministry  of Education, we are happy to note  that

the  Ministry  has laid emphasis on  the  need  to

improve  the quality of teachers, teaching methods

for  the second language, and the quality  of  the

teaching  curriculum. This shows that the teaching

and  the curriculum of the second language in  the

past  were far from satisfactory; and my  argument

is well-founded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has issued a

booklet  of  certain simplified Chinese characters

which  are used by the Chinese press. This booklet

is  to help those who want to learn Chinese  as  a

second language. However, in the Primary I Chinese

textbook  used  in  English  schools,  though  the

characters  are  of  the simplified  version,  the

workbook,  however  uses characters  of  the  non-simplified version. Therefore, the same  character

appears  in  two  forms. If this is  already  very

confusing  to  those who learn  Chinese  as  their

mother-tongue, it will be even more  confusing  to

those primary pupils who learn Chinese as a second

language. I understand that after complaints  have

been made to the Ministry, the workbook



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



has  been withdrawn. The experts on the curriculum

committee  should  be responsible  for  permitting

such  unnecessary  difficulty to  creep  into  the

learning of Chinese as a second language. Besides,

in  the  Primary  II  textbooks  for  Chinese  and

Civics,   both  the  simplified  and  unsimplified

versions  are  used.  If such textbooks  are  used

again, changes must be made. Similarly, there  are

faults with the second language textbooks for non-English  schools.  In  the Ministry  of  Education

there is one specialist in teaching English  as  a

second language. He compiled a textbook for use in

primary  schools  as a textbook on  English  as  a

second  language. I do not know who  approved  it,

but before it could be used, there were criticisms

in   the  English  press  pointing  out  the  many

mistakes in it. As a result, this textbook was not

released  for  use. If textbooks  written  by  our

second  language  specialists  contain  a  lot  of

mistakes,  we  can  well imagine  the  quality  of

textbooks written by non-specialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the incidents I have cited,

in  order  to improve the teaching of  the  second

language,   first   of   all,   the   quality   of

administration  in  the Ministry,  the  curriculum

committee   and   that  of  the  second   language

specialists  should  be  raised  in  addition   to

improving  the quality of pedagogy and curriculum.

Otherwise,  there  will  be  repetition   of   the

incidents  cited and our second language  teaching

will  always  be in a confusing and  disappointing

state.  We are now going all out to implement  our

policy  of bi-lingual education in order that  our

next generation will be effectively bi-lingual and

that  the  society we are going to have in  future

will be more unified and cohesive. However, such a

policy  should not be exploited by publishers  who

are   out   to  make  money.  Otherwise  students,

parents, and the public will waste their money  in

buying textbooks which are dubious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the task ahead is to mobilise

our  human  and financial resources  in  order  to

achieve  in qualitative terms. Towards  this  end,

all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



Ministries and departments will largely  be  using

computers. This is inevitable. At present the  two

universities   are  equipped   with   only   small

computers  and  their capacities  are  limited.  I

would  advocate  that a National Computer  Service

Centre   be  set  up  so  that  all  the   various

Ministries  and departments can make use  of  this

computer   service,   and  thus   increase   their

efficiency.  This  will  also  prevent  Government

departments   from   scrambling   for    expensive

computers  which only have limited  uses.  I  hope

that  such a National Computer Service Centre will

be  set  up very soon. In this respect, we  should

not  be  wasteful  in our use  of  resources,  but

instead try to aim at raising the quality in every

field.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  the  President's  speech  outlining  the

Government's policies for the next five  years,  I

note with pleasure the acceptance of the necessity

for  the level of wages to rise in so far as  such

wage increases take place in an orderly fashion. I

note with further pleasure, and they do not assume

the  proportions  of  a galloping  inflation,  the

assurance  that tax increases are to be kept  down

to the barest minimum possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been the legitimate complaint of

workers  that whatever wage increases they receive

are  more  likely  than not swallowed  up  by  tax

increases  and price increases. While I appreciate

very much the particular concern of the Government

not  to  kill  the individual incentive  for  hard

work-  on which Singapore's prosperity is built  -

by raising direct taxation upwards to the level of

diminishing returns, I am somewhat disappointed at

the  Government's  recourse to indirect  taxation,

even though it be on the so-called "luxury" goods.

For  one  thing, I have my doubts  as  to  whether

there   is   any   general  acceptance   of   what

constitutes    "luxury"   goods.   For    another,

Government may give more serious consideration  to

the distinction between earned income and unearned

income for the purposes of taxation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite aware that as a Backbencher it is easy

for me to criticise and that the Government, being

much   better  informed  and  having  to  consider

factors such as the development of Singapore  into

a  financial  centre  for  the  region,  may  have

considered  and  dismissed  some  of  my   points.

Nevertheless, I feel it incumbent upon me to voice

what  I  consider  to be the rather  disappointing

features  of the Government's recent tax measures.

It  is  hard  to believe, for instance,  that  tax

increases  on  such luxuries as  beer,  stout  and

cigarettes affect the privileged class of  persons

more  than  the  wage-earners. Similarly,  in  the

matter  of motor car taxes, no attempt is made  to

discriminate  between  a family  of  wage-earners,

pooling  their resources together to buy  for  the

first time in their lives a medium-sized car,  and

a  tycoon  who  thinks nothing of  buying  several

limousines perhaps for each of his concubines. The

justification advanced by the Minister for Finance

for   such   taxation  -  to  discourage   private

ownership of cars - seems rather cynical, if I had

not known that he was sincere about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that taxation

measures  form  part of the fiscal policy  of  the

Government   and  that  such  measures   are   not

eminently suitable for the attainment of  socially

desirable objectives. The Government may  have  to

contemplate  more  direct and drastic  methods  of

keeping  cars  off the streets, especially  during

peak  hours.  One method may be the staggering  of

office  hours beyond the prevailing  limits  of  8

a.m. and  5  p.m. It would be in  line  with  the

rationale  underlying the PUB's  restructuring  of

tariff  charges.  But  if the  actual  purpose  of

increased  taxation is to raise  more  revenue,  I

have  nothing  more  to comment  upon  except,  of

course, how this estimated increase in revenue  of

$38.25 million is going to be used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his address made reference to,

and I quote him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a better life for everyone willing to work will

become  more  pronounced,  and  in  more  gracious

surroundings.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



May  I suggest that we pay a little more attention

to  those who are willing to work but who, because

of  mental or physical handicap or for some  other

cogent  reasons, are unable to work. The President

also   mentioned  that  "we  can  achieve   higher

standards  in  everything, with  the  emphasis  on

quality,  whether  in  jobs,  schools,  hospitals,

social  and  recreational amenities or homes."  He

went  on to say that there must be heavy subsidies

for  good  health and good education. I  certainly

subscribe to this principle. The trouble  is  that

not   all   citizens,  through  no  conscious   or

deliberate   fault  of  their  own,   have   equal

opportunities   to   avail   themselves   of   the

subsidised services of the Government in the field

of health or education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that one category of our

citizens  deserves  much more attention  from  the

Government than they have enjoyed so far. I make a

plea on behalf of the old-age destitutes, the deaf

and dumb, the blind, the mentally retarded and the

chronically ill. Most of these persons are  looked

after, within the limits of their personal ability

and   scant   financial  resources,  by  socially-conscious  individuals  and  well-meaning  private

organisations.  Have these underprivileged  people

benefited or received any improvements as a result

of  our  recent  mini-boom? I should  think  their

participation  in  Singapore's present  prosperity

is,  at  the  most, minimal. With  our  continuing

economic progress and the increased $38.25 million

that  the  Minister for Finance hopes  to  collect

from  increased  taxes, we should  also  be  in  a

position   to  improve  the  lot  of  the   under-privileged.  I  entirely agree with the  President

when he said that "everyone must work to earn  and

pay  for  what  he wants in life."  Not  everyone,

however, can earn through his own efforts  to  pay

for even the bare essentials for his own survival,

and  such  a  person ought to be assisted  by  the

State in finding work or other means of living.  I

am not advocating free services for all, as such a

policy may lead to abuse to the detriment of  all.

What I am saying is that the State should pay more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



attention  and provide more assistance in  looking

after the old destitutes, the chronically ill, the

mentally  retarded, the blind, the deaf and  dumb,

by   providing  State-sponsored  facilities  which

would  offer them training, education,  recreation

and a better life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I thank the Hon.

Minister for Finance for announcing that the  13th

month payment for the current year will be made in

December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 14th month!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> 14th month? I heard the

Minister  say  "the  13th  month."  A  14th  month

payment will be most welcome!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees of Government and Statutory Boards

would  certainly  appreciate the gesture  to  make

this  payment  just  before  the  festive  season.

However, Sir, the last 13th month payment was made

only  to those who were in the service during  the

time  of  payment.  May I make a  strong  plea  on

behalf of the employees of the Government and  the

statutory  boards? If we follow the  same  system,

some  of  them would not be eligible for the  13th

month payment if the month of their retirement  is

earlier  than  the month in which the  payment  is

made.  In  other words, if he retires in November,

he  would not get his December pay. Sir, this 13th

wage   is  paid  for  services  rendered  to   the

Government  whether they worked for 12  months  or

less. If they are compulsorily retired, then  they

should  be  paid. In the course of one year,  many

would retire, and as such I strongly feel that  in

the case of those who leave the service through no

fault of their own, a proportionate payment should

be made.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the President's address at  the

official opening of the Third Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech has laid great emphasis on

the  necessity to sustain the momentum of economic

growth  achieved in the last five years after  the

Republic  has achieved independence and become  an

autonomous  state.  In pursuing  the  same  policy

during  the  next five years, it is vital  in  the

interest  of  our country that the policy  adopted

does  not lose sight of the aspirations and  hopes

of our people. The two main objectives in inducing

more  and  more  industries  into  Singapore  are,

namely:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To achieve greater viability for the Republic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To make the Republic the centre of export-oriented and more sophisticated industries

with scientific and high technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign firms will come to Singapore and will

invest  in  our  Republic if  political  stability

continues,  our  trade unions remain  responsible,

level  headed, reasonable, adaptable and conscious

of the part they have to play in producing quality

products at competitive international pricing, our

currency continues to be hard and strong  and  our

Government   governs   and   administrates    with

clockwork  efficiency,  fairness  and  free   from

corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when these industries are attracted to and

established  in  the Republic and those  in  which

Government  has  substantial equity participation,

it  should he the conscious duty of our Government

in power to see that:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Our people at all levels of work in these

industries      are     genuinely      given

opportunities to upgrade their skills,  both

practical  and  managerial, and  to  acquire

the know-how of these industries brought  in

by foreign interests, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) after a period of time, by systematic

phasing,  some  of the more important  posts

at  the  upper echelon should be "localised"

by   appointing  local  incumbents   to   be

groomed  for  these key posts. It  has  been

found in practice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



that  in  some  of the existing  industries,

foreign  expatriates have tenaciously  clung

on  to  their posts by making all  sorts  of

excuses  and  ruses  to remain  as  long  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one particular country in this respect

in  which their nationals are very adept  in  this

kind  of  practice. Their main motive  is  not  to

assist Singapore towards greater viability but  to

exploit   our  Republic  as  a  base  for   future

operations  in  countries in Southeast  Asia.  Our

Government  should  study  their  modus   operandi

carefully and in depth and their methods of  canny

economic penetration, because unfortunately for us

their  nationals work harder than most of  us,  as

work  to them is God and is a means to mammon  and

building  a  huge  trade  balance  for  their  own

country without consideration for others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude my support of

the  President's speech, I wish to warn the  House

that  the  economic and industrial penetration  of

Singapore  by  this particular country  should  be

studied  with  extreme caution, and any  agreement

reached  with  them  should  have  safeguards   to

protect  the interests and to meet the aspirations

of  our people in the long term. We do not want to

be economic slaves of another country when we have

achieved freedom with so much sweat and toil.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the President's speech delivered  on

the  12th  of this month in this House portrays  a

new profile of our country in the next five years.

The  President has also stated that in our  lively

and  prosperous society, nothing can  be  obtained

for free. Everybody should get his reward from his

own  effort  in  proportion  to  his  ability  and

effort. Sir, the amplification of this concept  is

very  important. It should specially be inculcated

in  our student population. The reason is that the

younger  generation since birth have been enjoying

free   medical  care,  comfortable   homes,   free

education, and other modern social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



amenities. We should not allow them to  adopt  the

syndrome  of enjoying the good things in life  for

free.  We should also not allow our people  to  be

lax  in  their  enthusiasm and  effort  in  nation

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also remind the people that

Singapore is not a paradise outside of this world.

The  moderate prosperity that we are  enjoying  is

something  that we can be proud of, but we  should

not  ho  complacent. Our political  situation  can

always   be   affected   by  extraneous   factors.

Following  the normalisation of relations  between

China  and  Japan and the assumption of diplomatic

relations  between  China and America,  there  has

been  a  series  of changes taking  place  in  the

world.  All these changes will have an  effect  on

the  changing scene in Southeast Asia. Our foreign

policy  should be formulated step by step, and  it

should be modified to keep up with changing times.

Unless  we  cannot help it, I feel that we  should

not  lightly discard our neutral and non-alignment

policy in foreign affairs, which has proved to  be

quite successful up to now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in social development, we know that

Singapore  is  undergoing changes  all  the  time.

Whether it is in the towns or villages, not a  few

people  are  affected by resettlement.  They  have

established   themselves   in   their   respective

localities  for  quite  a  long  time,   and   are

therefore,    inconvenienced   by    resettlement.

However, they have to make some sacrifice so  that

our  country may progress and our economy may also

develop.  Therefore,  it  is  the  duty   of   the

Government to give special care to these people to

enable  them to resume their normal livelihood  in

the   shortest  possible  time.  It   is   equally

important  for the Government to look  after  them

during  or  after  their resettlement.  Where  the

Government has not done enough for them, I hope it

will do better in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is paying equal attention to

both  the  urban  areas and the  rural  areas.  In

recent  years  the rural folks have been  able  to

enjoy  the  taste of modern living, to  have  good

roads   and   to  enjoy  the  instant  supply   of

electricity and water. It cannot be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



denied   that   in  recent  years,   the   Primary

Production Department has been giving the  farmers

a  lot  of help. However, because of the technical

aid  and scientific knowledge given by the Primary

Production  Department  to  the  farmers,  certain

people who are not in the farming business but who

are well-off have come in to invest in agriculture

for profit. This has caused a flux in agricultural

produce. In the end the supply is greater than the

demand,  and  prices of agricultural produce  fall

below  cost, causing many genuine farmers to  lose

heavily.  For  instance, in March and  April  this

year  the  price of pigs had fallen below average.

Later  with  a lot of effort by many  people,  the

price  of pigs rose. However, that level of  price

could not last long. In recent weeks, the price of

pigs  has  fallen steeply again. The  Members  for

Sembawang  and Jalan Kayu mentioned this  in  this

House last week. Obviously, this is not a question

of over-production, but a question of a deliberate

manipulation to suppress prices. So the Government

should investigate thoroughly to find some measure

of  control.  Otherwise, if  the  prices  of  farm

produce  keep falling, small farmers will  all  be

made bankrupts. Only big farmers may hope to carry

on.  If  this is the care, the price of  pigs  can

more  easily be manipulated by a few people.  This

will mean that the citizen cannot hope to buy pork

cheaply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the authorities concerned have been

registering the farms for so many years, they must

be  quite aware of the conditions existing in  our

farms. Therefore, I hope they will make use of the

available  data  and, in keeping with  our  entire

development    plans,   formulate   a    clear-cut

agricultural  policy. More important  is  that  we

should  try  our best to safeguard the  prices  of

agricultural produce, to keep them steady so  that

the  farmers  may  not  be adversely  affected  by

falling prices of agricultural produce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years the Government has spent

much  money  on  construction work  in  the  rural

areas. But recently it is noticed that many of the

projects have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



not  been  done  satisfactorily. This  has  caused

people  to  suspect  whether there  has  been  any

malpractices such as the short-supply of materials

or  short-work of labour. Even in my  constituency

there  have been such instances. Take for example,

the  metalling of roads. Even before  four  months

are up, the surface of the road is damaged. On the

building  of bridges, holes appear on the  surface

of  bridges before they are several weeks old.  On

pedestrian walks, after repairs have been made  to

the  surfaces  they are washed away  by  the  rain

within  three  months and the exposed  gravel  and

sand make the condition of the surfaces even worse

than before. I have reported all these matters  to

the  authorities concerned. They are now  awaiting

repair  Sir, what needs our attention is the  fact

that  all  the  instances of damage  cited  by  me

occurred  shortly  after  the  projects  had  been

completed. I do not know whether this was  due  to

malpractices,     inadequate    supervision     or

unqualified  contractors. Anyway this would  cause

inconvenience and more expenditure on repairs.  It

should  not  be  so.  I do not  know  whether  the

authorities concerned could set up a "Committee of

Supervision"  outside the Public Works  Department

to strictly supervise every piece of tendered work

by   contractors   in   order   to   prevent   any

malpractices from taking places



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another point which is relevant to

rural  construction which I would  like  to  raise

here.  As  we  all  know, generally  the  cost  of

projects   is   estimated  by  the  Public   Works

Department.   Members  of   Parliament   for   the

constituencies   concerned   and   the   Citizens'

Consultative  Committee members are only  informed

of  the estimated cost but not the tendered  price

and actual cost on completion of the project. They

will  not  be given satisfactory information  even

upon  written requests. However, there  are  three

prices  relating  to  such a project  namely,  the

estimated price, the tendered price and the actual

completed costs. I am sure they must be different.

I do not know whether the Urban and Rural Services

Committee has looked into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



these  different  figures.  I  think  Members   of

Parliament for the constituencies concerned should

be  allowed  to know early what the actual  prices

are  for the completion of those projects and  how

much  money is left, so that before the  financial

year  is  up, the Members concerned can carry  out

more construction work in their constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, building construction has been very active

in  our  country. Many satellite towns  have  been

built  one  after the others. This symbolises  the

development and progress of a country, and this is

also  something which Singapore can be  proud  of.

However,  there  is a major fault with  all  these

satellite  towns because the authorities concerned

know only how to build dwelling accommodation  for

the  people  but have overlooked the supplementary

and necessary facilities such as schools, markets,

hawker centres, clinics, community centres, sports

fields,  etc. Because these social amenities  have

not  been  provided  in the building  plans,  many

social  problems have arisen relating to  hawkers,

gangsterism,  and worse, the problem of  education

which  bothers the parents very much.  Because  of

the  lack  of schools in the new satellite  towns,

parents  have  to send their children  to  faraway

schools.  This  is  both an  inconvenience  and  a

financial   loss.   Sir,  the  Addendum   to   the

President's  speech on the Ministry  of  Education

mentioned  about the intention of the Ministry  to

build schools in the satellite towns. However, the

question is not to build schools but when to build

them, and whether the number will be adequate  for

the  need  If schools are built 10 years  after  a

satellite   town  is  built,  or  the  number   of

classrooms  is  not adequate, it  will  still  not

solve the problem of inconvenience to parents. For

instance, in Jurong constituency there is only one

primary  school  with  a maximum  enrolment.  Last

month,  when registration for Primary I next  year

was opened, 500 pupils were enrolled. Luckily, the

school   had   earlier  on  built  six   temporary

classrooms  so  that  these  new  pupils  can   be

accommodated.  But, following the  development  of

Jurong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



Town,  it  is expected that more Primary I  pupils

will  be  enrolled  next  year.  So  how  can   we

accommodate all these pupils? This is the  problem

that   the   Ministry  of  Education  should   pay

attention to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is the foundation of nation

building.  In  order to raise the quality  of  our

citizens, the first thing we must do is  to  raise

the  quality of education. This burden  is  mainly

borne  by  the teachers for they are the ones  who

actually  implement educational policies. Teachers

are   mentors  and  exemplars.  They  are  in  the

forefront or the vanguard of educations. They have

to  be  cautious in carrying out their duties  and

should not fail in what is expected of them by the

society.  Teachers have a duty to impart knowledge

and  to  exercise  control over the  thinking  and

conduct  of their students. Because of this  heavy

responsibility  they  often  become   targets   of

criticism by the so-called "specialists".  Through

any  fault of the pupils, all the blame is put  on

the teachers. It is not fair. We must realise that

students  attend school either in the  morning  or

afternoon  for  five  hours  only,  and  for   the

remaining part of the day they are either at  home

or  elsewhere. So, to be fair, parents should also

bear  part of the responsibility of looking  after

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teachers should respect their profession,

and  should  also  be contented  with  their  job.

However, under the present circumstances, teachers

can respect their profession, but they do not find

it  easy  to be contented with their job, because,

other  than  having  to be in step  with  changing

curricula  and  having to teach the  normal  daily

lessons,  many of them have to be responsible  for

two or three kinds of extra-curricular activities.

So  how  can we make them happy when there  is  so

heavy  a  load on them? As for the students,  they

are  also  hard  pressed with  lessons,  and  they

strive  very  hard  in order  to  pass  the  final

examination so as to qualify for a certificate. As

such,  they  do not even have time left  to  study

books on extracurricular activities. Studying  has

become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



a  hard pursuit for them. We have often heard that

the  Ministry of Education would lessen the burden

of  the teachers and the tasks of the students and

would  reduce  the teacher-student ratio.  I  hope

these promises will not turn out to be castles  in

the  air.  I have noted in the Addendum  that  the

Ministry  of  Education is  going  to  revise  the

curriculum.  In actual fact, the contents  of  the

lessons,  teaching materials and teaching  methods

will also have to be reviewed from time to time to

meet  the  changing times and needs. In  reviewing

them, the authorities concerned should consult the

teaching profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the new Minister of

State  for Education, namely, the Member for Bukit

Batok,  in  his  maiden speech has  mentioned  the

effort made by the Singapore Chinese Middle School

Teachers'  Union  to promote the learning  of  the

second  language. I may inform the House that  the

Union has all along been supporting this bilingual

policy  of  the  Government. We  hope  to  make  a

definite  contribution towards this end.  We  know

for  a  fact that for the survival and development

of  a  particular ethnic group the  mother  tongue

embodies  the  cultural tradition,  ethics,  moral

concept  and cultural heritage and values of  that

particular group. In a prosperous Singapore, it is

not  enough to master one's own mother tongue. Our

citizens  should  discard  old  shackles  and  old

concepts  and  try  to master a language  commonly

used   in   the  fields  of  technology,  science,

commerce  and trade, so as to make it a  means  of

earning  a  living.  In view  of  this,  we  fully

support the policy of the Ministry of Education to

encourage all our teachers to be finally bilingual

In  this  respect I hope the Ministry of Education

can  compile a practical curriculum on the  second

language for study by those teachers who  want  to

learn  it. To start with, principals of integrated

schools who are not bilingual should be the  first

to learn a second language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of industrialisation, we have

created  a  lot  of employment opportunities,  but

vexing  problems have also cropped up as a result.

One  of them is air pollution. However, I am  glad

to  note  that  the Government has set  up  a  new

department  specially charged  with  environmental

control.  During the last session  of  Parliament,

several  bills  for the control of  pollution  had

been passed. But we have yet to see the effects of

enforcement  of these laws. However,  I  have  the

duty  to  urge  the authorities concerned  to  pay

attention  to pollution in the largest  industrial

area  in  our  country, namely  Jurong  Industrial

Town.  Up  to now, we can still see many factories

freely emitting black smoke and burning industrial

wastes  in  open  ground day and night.  This  has

caused the residents to worry because of the  high

state of pollution it has reached. The subject  of

pollution is new in our country. The people do not

have  an  adequate knowledge about  pollution.  To

what degree will pollution be harmful to man is  a

question  which I think the residents as  well  as

the factory owners would like to know. To be fair,

we can say that many factory owners are willing to

abide by the law, as they do not like to be caught

for  polluting the air. I do not know whether  the

authorities concerned can set up devices to detect

and to record the degree of pollution at strategic

places,  so  that  all  of us  will  know  whether

pollution of the air has reached a degree as to be

harmful  to man. These devices can help to  reduce

the   worry  of  the  people  affected.  Moreover,

factory  owners and the people concerned may  know

the  extent of pollution that is present, and that

proper  control can be exercised. The  Member  for

Aljunied,  at the last sitting of Parliament,  has

said that prevention of air pollution demands  the

effort  of all our people. But I feel that  it  is

important  that the Government should  be  in  the

position to guide and to control. I hope  the  new

Ministry  will  play its role  in  the  industrial

areas, particularly in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion to thank the President

for his address,

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, 1965 was the year when Singapore

created  history, and the 9th of  August  of  that

year  was  an  unforgettable  day.  Many  of   our

neighbours thought and hoped that this tiny island

country  of ours would perish. But their  thinking

and schemes were too simple. They forgot to make a

study   of   our   origins  and   our   historical

background; they forgot that we are the progeny of

a  long  and  variegated history, that  we  are  a

people endowed with a strong will to struggle  and

a  high  degree  of adaptability and creativeness.

Today, this tiny country of ours is like a diamond

shining forth in Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the President has pointed out in his speech in

this  House  on the 12th October, when  Parliament

convened  in  1968 we were faced  with  the  total

withdrawal  of the British forces and  a  loss  of

$400  million in revenue together with the serious

problem of mass unemployment. Our tasks then  were

to  promote our economy, to create more jobs,  and

to  maintain our efforts for a continued survival.

However,  today  we are in a different  situation.

There is political stability, economic prosperity,

and  social  progress. We have become the  "haves"

from    "have-nots",    and    "developed"    from

"backwardness" All this has come about through the

perennial probing and meticulous planning  of  the

national leadership, together with the efforts  of

the    whole    populace.   These   results    and

achievements,  we  should treasure  and  preserve:

this  correct plan for the benefit of our  country

and people, we must follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a developing country, we should note that

in  a  rapidly  developing  society  if  there  is

unequal  development  in  certain  areas  and   in

certain  strata of the society, i.e.,  classes  or

groups  benefiting more than others or some  lower

classes not benefiting at all, then such neglected

classes  of society will easily become the pockets

of  dissatisfaction or dropouts in the process  of

rapid  advancement as they tend to be dispossessed

of wealth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



and  position, technique and power, thinking,  and

organisation. This will naturally make  them  feel

insecure, lonely, tense and passive in their daily

lives,  Sir, between man and man, there are strong

links  such  as  the brotherhood of  man  and  the

ability   to   co-operate.   When   our   economic

development  reaches a certain point  of  success,

where   social  environment  permits,  we   should

assist,  guide  and care more for the  unfortunate

dropouts  of the present society, so as to  enable

them to advance with the rest of us, to think  and

to  enjoy the fruits of prosperity, to breathe the

fresh  air of the new society and to have a  sense

of  security.  We must enable all  the  people  to

develop  as  the  country  develops,  politically,

economically and culturally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from each according to his ability, to each

according   to  his  need.  Under  our  democratic

socialist  system, every citizen can  enjoy  equal

opportunity and rights, so that everything may  be

fully  utilised  for the speediest advancement  of

the society. This is correct. However, we must not

over-emphasise or encourage everyone to go up,  as

this  will  lead to keen competition between  men,

and  in  a  competitive society the  victors  will

become the cream of the society, monopolising  all

the   values  of  the  society  such  as   wealth,

position, fame and power. This will dissipate  the

principle of joint effort and collectivism. In its

place  there  will  be competitive  individualism.

This  will  cause more people to fail  and  to  be

frustrated, leading to inferiority complex and the

loss  of  courage and joy to live.  Sir,  to  lose

one's  aim  in  life  is to  cut  one  loose  from

society, thus making one lose faith in life and in

social mores. It will lead to self-abandonment, to

the  commission of crimes, and to the  development

of  a  peculiar  mode  of living,  thus  enhancing

social  burden and pollution of the society.  Sir,

the  newly established Ministry of the Environment

for  the prevention of pollution brought about  by

industrialisation  can use  effective  devices  to

prevent  the  direct material  pollution  of  air,

water  and  noise. But pollutions of the  society,

the spirit, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



thought cannot be solved by material means  or  in

the space of a very short time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, urban renewal for the better utilisation of

land  to increase national economic resources  and

to  promote the prosperity of the urban areas  are

necessary  forms of national development.  But  we

should  be  concerned  about profiteering  by  big

groups  of  private developers, which  has  caused

tremendous increases in land prices. As a  result,

our  medium  and  small traders are  hit  by  high

rentals  and they are either forced to close  down

or  to  be  swallowed up by big enterprises.  This

causes  more wealth and property to be  controlled

by  the few, and pauperizing the majority. This is

unfair.  Sir,  owing  to our political  stability,

increasing   population,   rapid   expansion    of

industries, prospering urban economy, in  addition

to   the   influx  of  foreign  capital  and   oil

exploration around the seas in Southeast Asia with

Singapore as the base, our economy is enjoying  an

unprecedented  booms This has  also  caused  rapid

increases in the prices of properties, houses, and

land.  Over  the last three or four  years  prices

have  increased  by  300 or  400  per  cent,  thus

creating  a boom in the building trade and  giving

rise  to  a  dearth of building materials  and  of

skilled  and unskilled workers. Sir,  we  want  to

develop  and  progress, but we should never  allow

any  one industry to over-develop at a pace  which

the  other  industries cannot catch  up  with.  We

should  have  proper  control  over  the  building

industry  anti  a  better allocation  of  building

units  after we have made a thorough study of  the

demand  for  public and private  housing  and  the

number of units to be built per year. In this way,

we  shall  be  able  to co-ordinate  our  building

workers, advanced technology and machinery, so  as

to  speed up the building of an adequate number of

public fiats. This will reduce the waiting time of

applicants and relieve them of any mental torture.

This will generally improve the provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



of  public  housing and effectively implement  our

democratic socialists' public housing scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the voting by the electorate at the

recent  general  elections, we can  see  that  our

public housing programme is successful. Generally,

the  scheme  of "Home for the Dwellers"  has  been

well  received by people in the middle  and  lower

strata.  As the population in the urban  areas  is

too  concentrated,  there should  be  better  land

utilisation of some empty State land and  of  land

occupied by old and low-level Government servants'

quarters, which take up much space. In their place

we  should  build more high-rise public  flats  to

improve the residential environment of the workers

and people of the middle and lower strata in those

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention should be paid not only to the building

of  so-called high-class shopping centres  in  the

city  area,  but  we  should also  understand  the

background  of and the actual needs of our  people

When the cost of living is rising day by day, will

most  families  with more than  four  children  to

bring up (unlike in the West where a family seldom

has  more  than four children), have  any  surplus

money  to  buy the so-called high-class  articles?

Sir,  I  am not against the building of high-class

shopping  centres under the urban renewal  scheme,

but  1  would  like to stress that we  should  not

build  too many modern shopping centres  in  close

proximity  in  too short a time. As  they  do  not

serve the actual needs of our people, they have no

business.  In the end, many of our local merchants

who  have  moved  into these new shopping  centres

have  to  close down because of poor business  and

because  of rising prices of properties  owing  to

impending   urban  renewal.  Sir,  the  Government

departments concerned should make a study  of  the

income and living conditions of the people in  the

locality  concerned, before setting up  plans  for

commercial centres to meet the daily needs and the

practical  demands  of  the  people  in  order  to

promote prosperity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the saying goes: "to start an enterprise

is  difficult, to maintain an enterprise  is  even

more difficult." Through our Constitution, we will

preserve the independence and sovereignty  of  the

Republic  of  Singapore.  No  foreign  forces   or

ambitious  elements will be allowed to "sell"  our

people  through local proxies. We should be united

in  our  effort to jointly preserve  the  hard-won

fruit of our economic progress earned through  our

years of hard struggle. Nobody must be allowed  to

tamper  with our achievement, as it would put  all

our labour to waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the people of Kampong Kapor

constituency,  I  would like to express  our  high

esteem  of  the President for his Speech delivered

at the opening of this Parliament.



<br><br>4.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

bold  and tough policies firmly implemented  since

1965,  and the intelligent response of the  people

in  terms  of  collective disciplined  work,  have

enabled  us  to  overcome the  stark  question  of

survival as an independent nation, so much so that

we should now be able to have a closer look at the

fundamentals  of  the  social  doctrine  that   is

shaping  the  nation. The President's  Speech  has

very   properly  raised  the  question  of   these

fundamentals  in terms principally  of  the  work-ethic  and remuneration for such work that  should

be instilled into the people. While the Speech has

suggested   the  broad  generalisations   of   the

emergent doctrine, it will be for this House  over

the  ensuing years to help in analysing  the  more

difficult  and  recondite  elements  of  the   new

doctrine  in terms, in particular, of  the  social

consequences that it generates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been our supreme virtue in the past not to

be   dogmatic  and  doctrinaire  in   social   and

political matters. This has enabled us, in holding

fast  to  the  central objectives  of  building  a

rational and just social order, to experiment with

different  methods designed both to create  wealth

and  to  generate  a  credible defence  capability

within the short time-span



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



available  to us. So, while other  countries

have  moved  backwards into the future by  playing

around   with  emotive  and  immaterial  questions

relating  to  language,  neo-colonialism  and  the

like, we have taken small but steady steps forward

into the same future. In a fast changing turbulent

area,  we would, for the next five years at least,

constitute a stable anchor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having wiped out unemployment, we now move on to

the  next  phase of our development in  which  the

provision of a higher standard and quality of life

for  all  would assume increasing importance.  The

phenomenon  of rising expectations  is  an  unruly

horse  in any system of democratic politics. There

would   be  measured  wage  increases  and   vexed

questions relating to the criteria to be  employed

in  establishing wage differentials. The procedure

of  achieving mathematical parities in  wages  for

different  types  of  work in  industry  need  not

detain us if it is recognised that "in some  small

degree  the standard of life of the great mass  of

the  nation depends not merely on the remuneration

which  they are paid for their labour, but on  the

social income which they receive as citizens".  In

this context the prospect of massive investment in

the  education and health of the nation is welcome

indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If then it is also assumed that a clear principle

of  demarcation should divide the needs which  may

properly  be  supplied by collective  action  from

those  which humans should be required to meet  by

their personal exertions, the aim of policy should

be   to   create   the  pre-conditions   and   the

environment that would provide the incentives  for

the citizen to maximise his personal exertions  in

providing for his needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really implied in this, Mr Speaker, Sir,

is  a social system where work and remuneration is

based  not  on  status but on contract,  with  the

state  stepping  in from time to time  to  correct

injustices that fail to be solved by the two sides

of  industry - management and labour. In this  way

the  work-ethic, so necessary for the regeneration

of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



developing  nation, would remain  unimpaired.  The

call  has already been made recently outside  this

Chamber  for the inspired creation of  a  profound

ethic  in  industry  that  would  obliterate   the

differences  and  distinctions between  management

and  labour  and provide the solvent for  wasteful

periodic  industrial  strife  and  discord.  While

legislation   in  the  shape  of  the   Industrial

Relations Act has provided the essential machinery

for  conciliation  and  arbitration  o  industrial

disputes,  it has failed, as it must,  to  provide

the  self-adjusting  social mechanism  that  would

minimise, if not, eradicate differences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed is the evolution in industrial

practice in Singapore of a new value of,  if  need

be,  non-political  mutualism  that  would  enable

management  and  labour to work  as  partners,  as

opposed   to  antagonistic  factors  in  industry.

Different  experiments to  achieve  this  end  are

being  conducted, with varying degrees of  success

and  failure, the world over. But it may be useful

for  us in Singapore to have a closer look at  the

principles and values that govern the organisation

and   functioning  of  industry   in   Japan.   If

paternalistic, Japanese industry appears to fulfil

the    duties   and   responsibilities   of   that

paternalism  by  securing  the  welfare   of   its

employees  over  and  above  the  monetary  income

earned by them. It has in this way taken over some

of  the functions performed in other countries  by

the  state.  If I may say so, we may have  reached

the  right  stage  in our political  and  economic

development to work some of the rudimentary values

of   the   Japanese  system  into  our  industrial

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the social unit of modern Western society is

the individual, the social unit of Eastern society

has  always  been  the  family.  These  two  basic

premises  produce  entirely  different  types   of

social   systems   and  duties.  The   astonishing

phenomenon  that  emerges  in  any  study  of  the

history of Eastern societies is the vast stretches

of time over which these societies have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



endured  and  developed without final  dissolution

and  disappearance; and I believe that one of  the

reasons for this is the strength and integrity  of

the  family system. We must quickly decide now  if

the  social  unit in Singapore is  to  remain  the

family,  or  if we are to go the way of  the  West

with everything that that implies; for any perusal

of  the  daily newspapers would indicate that  our

families  are  breaking-up  and  terms  like   the

generation   gap,  fashionable  in   some   exotic

societies of the West, seem to be the current coin

in  discussions in Singapore as well.  The  causes

and  reasons  for  the break-up  of  our  families

should   be  properly  studied  before  we   start

borrowing  descriptive and quasi-scientific  terms

from foreign theorists wholely inapplicable to our

situation; and in this context it may be useful to

review  the working of the Women's Charter to  see

if  it has been an unmitigated success; if it  has

secured the woman, discipline the man and save the

home.  I am sure that any such investigation would

reveal some interesting and unsuspected phenomena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past ten years we have

moved  and  gently swung Singapore from  stage  to

stage   in  her  political,  economic  and  social

development,  and  the area and distance  that  we

have traversed as a people in this decade has been

little  short of revolutionary. This  passage  has

been achieved not through the barrel of the gun to

the  chagrin  of one school of our opponents, but

through the ballot-box to the chagrin again  of  a

few other schools of our opponents; and we had the

opportunity   recently  to  test  their   relative

strengths among the people. That they have  failed

miserably  is not surprising, for the people  were

able to see through the simple scheme of fallacies

projected  by the opposition parties, and  we  now

know  that  the  people  have  advanced  in  their

consciousness  far  beyond  the  understanding  of

these opposition groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next decade will see us securing ourselves in

the emergent Southeast Asian state system and,  in

the  course of it, it may be necessary for us from

time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



to time to swing Singapore gently from one course

to the other depending upon the tide of the times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.
