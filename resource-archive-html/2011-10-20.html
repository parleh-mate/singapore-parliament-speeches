Mr Speaker, Sir, the capacity of a public infrastructure is a key
consideration when planning for the growth of our overall workforce.
We are therefore seeking to moderate the growth of the foreign workforce
at no higher than one-third over the long term. Besides the social
and economic reasons for this target, which I have explained yesterday,
there are also real physical and infrastructural limits that we
do need to take into account.</p>

introduced various measures to moderate the inflow of foreign manpower,
in particular, at the Work Permit and S Pass levels. We have announced
the schedule of Foreign Worker Levy increases which began from July
2010 and will continue
until July 2013. The increases in levies and other measures such
as the phased tightening of levy tiers send a clear signal to companies
to avoid growing our reliance on foreign workers and instead invest
in productivity improvements so that they can remain more competitive
in the long run. The Government is providing full support for this
productivity effort. At the Employment Pass (EP) level, qualifying
salaries were raised in July 2011. From January 2012, EP applicants
will be subjected to more stringent criteria including better educational
qualifications and higher qualifying salaries.</p>

of foreign workers has to remain a finely balanced exercise, our
key objective must be to ensure that our economy remains diversified

development plans to meet the needs of a growing population.</p>

I would like to thank the Minister of State for his response to
my question. Just one clarification. We all appreciate that Singapore
needs to remain open and vibrant in order to be a global city. However,
one concern is that when a foreigner comes and works in Singapore,
and he or she enjoys it, then, the family comes also. While we should
obviously be open to this, is the Ministry of Manpower looking at,
after someone comes and settles here, whether there is sufficient
infrastructural support in transport, in health services, to accommodate
the families coming also?</p>

Speaker, that is indeed the idea. Going forward, we do need to be
cognisant of the overall demands. Clearly, not every foreign worker
and person on Employment Pass who comes here, will bring the family,
but that is something that we do have to bear in mind. Going forward,
looking at the demands placed on our infrastructure would be something
we need to consider.</p>

there are currently 670,000 foreign non-domestic work permit holders
accommodated in a variety of housing options including purpose-built dormitories,
workers' quarters on construction sites, converted industrial properties, HDB
flats and private residential premises.</p>

in proper accommodation is a multi-faceted issue which involves
close collaboration between different Government Ministries and
agencies. A Foreign Worker Housing Coordinating Committee, jointly
led by MOM and MND, oversees this issue. Since 2007, the Government
has been launching new sites for dormitories
to meet the need for foreign worker housing. There are currently
over 140,000 bed spaces for foreign workers in purpose-built dormitories
which mainly house workers from the construction, marine and processed
industrial sectors.</p>

options available, there are irresponsible employers who continue
to breach the housing requirements and compromise on foreign workers'
well-being. In the worst instances, workers have been found, housed
in make-shift huts or bin centres. To ensure that foreign workers
are housed in acceptable housing, MOM, together with agencies such
as URA, SCDF and NEA, conducts regular inspections at locations
suspected as being used for illegal foreign worker housing. These
efforts are producing positive outcomes. Since 2010, almost 15,000
foreign workers have been relocated to acceptable housing. Over
the same period, enforcement action was taken against more than
2,300 employers for breaching the Work Permit conditions by housing
their workers in unacceptable conditions.</p>

conditions, we do put in place measures to relocate them, which
is why expediting the construction of some of these dormitories
and housing options is something that we are pressing ahead with.
We are speaking to the various advisers on this. Secondly, it is
an important feature in the construction of these living quarters
that we provide recreational and eating facilities, and so on, within
those premises. Going forward, we are putting those in place to
make sure that the foreign workers do have viable options. We think
that is one important step in providing them a hospitable and good
environment to not only live in, but to spend their free time in
as well.</p>

Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State to consider a proposal
I had put up during the last Parliament session: for employers who
do not house their foreign workers in appropriate accommodation
and do not provide proper bed spaces, then, going forward, that
they be penalised where their quota for employing foreign workers
in the years ahead is concerned. That would be a sufficient deterrent and
would ensure that proper bed spaces and accommodation are given.</p>

(Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, our assessment at this juncture is that the shutdown
of the Shell refinery on Pulau Bukom is likely to have a minimal
impact on the overall economy. And there are several reasons for
this assessment.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 338</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e98fdad0-5934-4a3a-ba1c-d813c5c5d033">
                  <a name="id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-e98fdad0-5934-4a3a-ba1c-d813c5c5d033"><!--a--></a>First, even though there is a loss of petroleum
output in the short term, the impact on downstream chemicals plants
is small as there are alternative sources of feedstock. Furthermore,
while the refinery accounts for a significant portion of the chemicals cluster,
the cluster as a whole accounts for less than 3% of Singapore's
GDP. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-eef69ce3-14be-4f17-bd8a-9a63a80cf629">
                  <a name="id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-eef69ce3-14be-4f17-bd8a-9a63a80cf629"><!--a--></a>Second, Shell's efforts
at restarting the refinery remain on track. On 10 October, Shell partially
restarted its largest Crude Distillation Unit which accounts for
20% of its refining capacity. Shell is working closely with the
relevant authorities to safely re-start additional processing units
of the refinery as soon as possible. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3546c395-ca98-4f0a-9585-760e9e6777cc">
                  <a name="id-16cdf09d-8c4f-46dc-89aa-293369475309__id-3546c395-ca98-4f0a-9585-760e9e6777cc"><!--a--></a>Third, the incident is not
likely to affect the chemicals cluster in the longer term. Investor
confidence in Singapore remains strong and new investment projects
will continue to be developed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8df5532a-a7f1-4934-9d22-434e79d27fe7">

fire incident does not affect Singapore's electricity supply. The
primary fuel for generation of electricity is natural gas. While
fuel oil is used for some power generation, our generation companies
do not have any existing supply contracts with Shell for fuel oil.
The generation companies also maintain a stockpile of fuel oil and
diesel, in line with the Energy Market Authority's licence requirements. These
are not stored on Pulau Bukom and hence the fuel reserve for electricity generation
was unaffected by the fire.</p>

to set our electricity and town gas tariffs. Members would be aware
that this is because of the link between the natural gas we use
for our power generation and fuel oil prices. The Pulau Bukom fire
has not had any impact on fuel oil prices, which continue to be
driven by global demand and supply trends. Based on currently available
data, we do not expect the Pulau Bukom fire incident to have an impact
on electricity and gas tariffs.</p>

Sir, two supplementary questions for the Minister. First, there
have been private sector economists' estimates about how much has
been lost to the economy due to the shut-down. The figures that
were cited were between $100 million and $200 million, depending
on how long it goes on and what facilities are affected. So, I would
like to ask the Minister whether the Government has an estimate
of how much has been lost so far, in dollar terms, to the economy
in terms of output. Second question, Sir, is: there are obviously
Singaporeans working in Shell and Singapore businesses supplying
services to the Shell operations. Given that these livelihoods are
affected, how is the Government working with Shell to ensure that
the operations come up online and in the safest way possible?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I thank
the Member for the supplementary questions. Let me take the second
point first. As far as the coordination of the recovery effort is
concerned, there are two aspects to this: one is the fire safety
and technical aspects, which we will address subsequently in another
Parliamentary Question. As far as the economic aspects are concerned
– because this is part of an integrated value-chain for us – EDB
is working very closely with Shell and with the downstream companies
that rely on some of the products in order to ensure that there
is a smooth transition. I think, in the first instance, the key
point is that there are feedstock supplies. So, in other words,
there are inventories that can support the activities. So, a lot
of the measurement of the outcome or the impact will really depend
on how smoothly and quickly Shell can restart its operations. So, when
the Member refers to private sector estimates, well, it really depends
on the assumptions on which they rely. As of now, the Government's estimation
is that the impact would be minimal but we are reluctant to put
an actual dollar value until we know the exact duration and rate
of response in recovery.</p>

think about the economy and the size of it – 3% of GDP and this
is just a component of that – and then we can do some estimations
based on that. But, really, this is guesstimation. I do not think
they are reliable numbers because you are not really looking at
what is happening on a day-to-day basis. You want to look at the
total impact. So, I would be reluctant to give a dollar value at
this stage, but I can assure the Member that we are working on this
and we are tracking the effects closely.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir,
the Royal Dutch Shell refinery at Pulau Bukom (Shell Bukom) is required
under the Fire Safety (Petroleum &amp; Flammable Materials) Regulations
to put in place appropriate safety measures to address the risks
inherent in its operations. One key requirement is to have an Emergency
Response Plan, which Shell Bukom is required to update regularly,
to deal with various types of incidents, such as spillage, leakage, accidental
discharge and fire. This plan is reviewed by the Singapore Civil
Defence Force.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9bc4e4ee-b1ad-4c83-8006-e1b28c64ba5e">

under the terms of its licence to establish and maintain an in-house
emergency response team known as the Company Emergency Response Team
(CERT). The SCDF conducts annual audits on the CERT to assess its
competency. Failure to meet basic standards may result in composition
fines or even the revocation or non-renewal of the licence that
permits the storage of petroleum and flammable materials.</p>

its contingency plans with Shell Bukom. These plans are validated
through joint exercises at least once a year. In 2011, two major deployment
exercises coupled with CERT audits were conducted by SCDF in February and
September. These exercises were critical in testing evacuation procedures, transportation
of SCDF assets to Pulau Bukom, and their respective command and control
systems.</p>

responders to the fire at Pulau Bukom, our preliminary assessment
indicates that both Shell Bukom and SCDF responded expeditiously
and in an organised
and well-coordinated manner. This was largely due to the close relationship
established between Shell Bukom and SCDF through their regular joint exercises.
Shell Bukom's CERT responded according to established protocols
practised in its regular training, while SCDF sized and deployed
its resources on-site quickly and appropriately. </p>

and will more detailed exercises be worked out in the light of the
experience of this incident.</p>

24 hours after the fire broke out, there was a press conference
held and at that press conference, even the Shell experts were quoted
as unable to say what was feeding the fire at that point in time.
So, my question is this. We know that Shell has a strong safety
record, but does this indicate that perhaps the complexity of the
operation on the island is running somewhat ahead of safety or scenario
planning? </p>

the interface between Shell and SCDF in the response. There was
an interview of SCDF officials reported in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> of
6 October. They were quoted as saying that when the SCDF first responders
arrived at the scene, Shell staff told them to protect two nearby
tanks at all costs, without telling them what the tanks contained.
My question is, in response to the operation, first of all, who
is giving the instructions; and secondly, does this indicate some
information gap, despite SCDF's annual audits, and do they really
know what the safety response plan of Bukom required?</p>

do not want to comment on what was reported in the media or the
press because it may or may not be accurate based on hearsay, but
what the Ministry of Home Affairs would be doing is conducting an
inquiry into the events, the events that led up to it, whether the
safety arrangements were properly followed, then the response, both
of Shell and SCDF, and whether those processes were properly followed.
And we will also look at whether the design of the safety regulations

we would then be in a better position to say what we need to do

Sir, I do not have the detailed figures of how many people precisely

Shell did carry out an evacuation. They have plans for an evacuation
and as far as we can tell, that evacuation was conducted smoothly
and expeditiously. And to back Shell up, if there is a need to do
so, there are other resources available to move people on and off
the island, including those from the Ministry of Defence.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, MINDEF had issued two public replies, in July and
August this year, relating to Dr Patrick Tan's disruption and deployment
during his National Service. In those replies, we stated that he
was treated according to prevailing policies. He was not given any
preferential treatment. Let me provide further details on how these
policies were applied to all full-time National Servicemen. I use
the term "NSFs" for full-time National Servicemen over the years.
I beg Members' indulgence as there are quite a lot of details because
the period is long. Please bear with me because I think details
are important. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5b32007e-a826-4070-990a-8fb1e901f3d8">

decades ago, MINDEF has allowed NSFs to disrupt from medical studies
in Singapore because we need military doctors to serve in the SAF.
This policy continues today. So, I think it is quite well known
that NUS medical graduates are disrupted while they are NSFs to
finish their medical degrees. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9f792b53-c199-4647-9a09-d8fb8e7956cf">

policy for medical studies was extended to allow NSFs to study medicine
overseas because the number of local graduates was insufficient.
From 1981 to 1986, 38 NSFs were disrupted for overseas medical studies. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7515b128-fd5e-40a2-b0d6-bf2325fc0770">

were tightened to take into account their performance during Basic
Military Training and Physical Employment Standards (PES) screening.
Eight-six applicants were disrupted under this latter scheme, including
Dr Patrick Tan in 1988. He had completed his BMT and was part-way
through Officer Cadet School. From 1992, disruption for overseas
medical studies was no longer allowed as the number of local medical
graduates met SAF's needs. All in all, in the 12-year period, namely,
1981 to 1992, when disruption for both local and overseas medical
studies was a prevailing policy, 902 NSFs were disrupted to study
medicine in Singapore and 124 for overseas medical studies, for a total of about 1,026
NSFs. So, in that 12-year period, 1,026 full-time National Servicemen
were disrupted for medical studies, 902 locally and 124 overseas.</p>

so long as the medical degree was recognised by the Singapore Medical
Council. And the length of disruption varied according to the time required
to obtain a medical degree. For those who studied medicine locally,
the period of disruption taken was typically seven years − five
years for the medical degree, an additional year each for housemanship
and hospital postings. </p>

almost all of the 124 medical students chose to study in the United
Kingdom, Ireland or Australia. And these were disrupted for about
seven to eight years. Only three NSFs applied and were approved
for disruption to study medicine in the United States of America
(US). By way of explanation, let me say that in the US system, the
medical course is a graduate programme. In other words, to enter into
a medical school, you will be required to have a pre-medical degree.
So, the disruption period is typically longer – four years to obtain
the pre-medical degree and then five more years for the medical
degree proper. </p>

applied for and were approved for medical studies in the US. One
of them was deferred and disrupted for nine years. He obtained his
US pre-medical and medical degree. The second case was deferred
for four years to obtain his pre-medical degree and then decided
that he did not want to do his medicine in the US but wanted to
do it in Ireland instead. MINDEF granted it to him, so he was deferred
and disrupted for a total of 12 years – four years pre-medical degree
in the US, eight years for medical degree in Ireland. The third
case, Dr Patrick Tan, was also disrupted for 12 years, for his pre-medical
course in Harvard University from 1988 to 1992, and thereafter,
for his combined medical degree and PhD program in Stanford University's Medical
Scientist Training Program. </p>

University to enquire if Dr Patrick Tan could shorten his course
for just an MD – a medical degree. Stanford University replied that
it was not possible, "the Medical Scientist Training Program is
an integrated MD/PhD program in which both the MD and PhD degrees
will be simultaneously conferred". </p>

disrupted to pursue medicine locally. After he obtained his medical
degree, he was disrupted again for his PhD studies in Oxford. He
did Onco-pathology under the Rhodes Scholarship. In total, he was

bright pre-enlistee entered University at age 14 and was accepted
into a PhD course in Cambridge before he was due for enlistment.
MINDEF allowed him to defer his NS until he completed his PhD at
the age of 21. There were two other servicemen enlisted in 1988
and 1993 respectively, who were disrupted twice, first to obtain
an undergraduate degree under the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship,
followed by a second disruption to obtain their PhD under the Rhodes Scholarship.
Both disrupted for a total of eight years. </p>

Tan was disrupted in accordance with prevailing policy to obtain
his medical degree. A longer period was granted to those who were
admitted to US medical schools. Disruption for overseas medical
studies has been discontinued since 1992. We also have not granted
disruption or deferment for PhD studies since 1999.</p>

Dr Patrick Tan's deployment in answer to Dr Lim Wee Kiak's question.
Dr Patrick Tan was re-enlisted in the year 2000, having obtained
both his MD and PhD degrees. He was deployed to the Defence Medical
Research Institute (DMRI), in view of his training and qualifications. </p>

and biomedical research aimed at enhancing the safety, survivability and
performance of SAF personnel. </p>

Servicemen had been posted to DMRI in the five years preceding Patrick
Tan's posting, from 1995 to 1999. Thirty-two NSFs were posted to DMRI,
including another MD/PhD holder, some medical officers and the rest
with A-levels, basic and Masters degrees. Fifteen of these 32 that
I have mentioned were combat-fit. Each case was again approved on
its own merit as having the qualifications that met the needs of
DMRI. Some served in DMRI for the bulk of their full-time NS, while others
were medical officers posted there on shorter stints of about six
months. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for clearing
the air on this particular issue. I have one supplementary question
with regard to Dr Patrick Tan. When he was serving in DMRI, if I
understand it correctly, he was serving in the capacity of a non-uniformed
medical officer. Currently, the Minister mentioned that he was deployed
to the Combat Support Hospital. May I just check with the Minister:
did Dr Patrick Tan go through the medical officer cadet course?
Did he undertake the necessary training as a military medical officer?
If he did not, then how was he going to perform in the Combat Support
Hospital, and in what rank was he performing his duties? </p>

                  </span>: Sir, MINDEF
decided to deploy Dr Patrick Tan to DMRI for reasons that were already
stated. After deploying him to DMRI, it was left to those in charge
of DMRI to decide for all those 32 NSFs that I talked about, how
to deploy them and what they would wear then. So, I do not have
details of what he wore on any particular day. I do not think Parliament
should be concerned about what they wore, unless there are reasons
that Dr Lim Wee Kiak thinks otherwise.</p>

two cases. As far as our records show, the two were deployed as
medical officers. The two went to NS and were deployed as medical officers.
So I think they went through the medical conversion course. Dr Lim
asked why for this particular case, Dr Patrick Tan had not undergone
the conversion course. The specific reason was having been deployed
to DMRI, there was no need for it. The medical conversion course
was to convert medical officers so that they could serve as medical
officers in the camps. Having made the decision to deploy him to
DMRI, there was no need for the conversion course for him to function
in DMRI.</p>

as to what was Dr Patrick Tan's deployment after NSF, in other words,
after he had finished full-time National Service. I think I have
answered that in the main reply. Let me find that paragraph. I said
that after serving his full-time National Service, Dr Patrick Tan
was deployed to the 3rd Combat Support Hospital and served his remaining
NS liability till 2009.</p>

                  </span>: The Member's
question was how MINDEF ensures that there is no preferential treatment.
That is a very important question. As I said in my reply, MINDEF is acutely aware that
in order for NS policies to be successful, to have buy-in from the general
public, equity of treatment for NS must remain a cardinal principle.
And we do it through a variety of ways, some explicit policy which
means that, in this case, for disruption of medical studies, because
it is in that sense a different treatment for a select group of
medical undergraduates, because SAF needs medical doctors, to make
sure that the criteria are upfront and explicit. To the extent possible,
we list them. For instance, we said that they must produce documentary
proof for admission to a medical school recognised by the SMC. In
the case of the US policy where we allow overseas medical studies,
we said that the pre-medical course does not lead to any other professional
degrees such as engineering or accountancy, they must furnish documentary
proof from the University and that the pre-medical course leads
to a medical degree. Where it is possible, we explicitly state so.
Then there are signalling mechanisms. Our commanders understand
that if you do not uphold this principle of equity, you are going
to undermine your authority because people think that if I have connections
and I have preferential treatment, it is going to be very hard to
be able to train men as a group or make them feel committed to serve
NS.</p>

that MINDEF understands this. We do not ignore that there are different
strata, but we hope that we can gel the men, regardless of their background,
into one unit. From to time to time – let us be realistic, Singapore
is small – we have anecdotes that someone thinks that because so-and-so's
son is in this particular unit, that the unit will be treated better.
And when they are punished, the converse is true that this unit
is punished because so-and-so's son is in the unit and they want
the unit as an example. We understand that, but I think, overall,
we deal with it on a day-to-day basis, and we tell our commanders
to make sure that when they apply a policy, they give good reasons
why it is applied, maintain the principle of equity and lead by
example. If Members of this House know of specific cases, where
there is preferential treatment, there is open access to you to
bring it up right to me, and we will deal with it.</p>

had outlined the key factors in my speech at the MOE Workplan Seminar
in September. I signalled a clear emphasis on students' centricity
and holistic education. First, we need to imbue in our children
those character traits and dispositions that will set them right
for life. These include resilience, respect for others, responsibility,
integrity, care and harmony as the core. </p>

in our history, we face unprecedented change. The more the world
around us shifts and tilts, the more we need to be firmly anchored
to a set of core values and to develop a quiet and well-founded
confidence about oneself and our nation. We will strengthen the
emphasis on values and character development. MOE has brought together
the various content and skills to be learnt in National Education,
Co-Curricular Activities, Civics and Moral Education under a Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) framework. We will work with schools
to co-create a new CCE curriculum, comprising a national curriculum
complemented by school-initiated programmes. This partnership is
important because CCE is not something to be taught, but lived as
part of the routine of everyday life in school.</p>

time for PE by between half an hour to an hour across all levels.
We have put in place new programmes such as the Programmes for Active Learning
(PAL) for Primary 1 and 2 students which offer learning experiences
that are active, hands-on, meaningful and fun. Beyond the curriculum
and programmes, we need the steady guiding hand of our teachers.
In recent years, schools have placed greater emphasis on helping
students acquire social-emotional competencies, largely through
the pastoral role played by teachers, especially form teachers.
At the primary level, schools have put in place the Form Teacher
Guidance Period which provides dedicated time within the curriculum
for form teachers to form positive relationships with their students.
At both the primary and secondary levels, we have advocated having
a constant form or co-form teacher with a class for two years to
guide their social-emotional learning. About 90% of schools are
putting this in place in phases. </p>

the right condition for primary school to be a good school so that
every child gets a positive school experience. It is worthwhile
for me to restate what I said in September. A good school is "one
that caters to the needs of the students well, given the diversity
of students that cannot be a single ruler to measure success. A good
school needs to know who the students are at the point of entry,
study their strengths and needs, states what you like them to become
when they leave the school, then exercises diligence and imagination
to get there. A good school creates a positive experience for each
student, allowing him to acquire the basics, but more importantly, making
him a confident and lifelong learner. It provides a supportive and
appreciative environment
for teachers to experience the joy in impacting lives. A good school
is student-centric and allows teachers to do their best for every
child".</p>

the education scene will know that schools are seeking to do just
that and introducing different types of programmes that meet diverse needs.
Some schools focus on turning around their at-risk students. Others
work on ensuring their very able students are imbued with a strong
sense of community service. Many provide the opportunities which
the homes are less well-able to afford, be it the chance to play
sports or musical instruments or to learn dancing. No two schools
are identical. In fact in my visit to schools, I have met many of
the students who have benefited from these programmes and you can
see the sparkle in their eyes when they tell me about their experiences
that they have been through.</p>

pathways and options for students. Primary school students no longer
get streamed but have a choice of Standard or Foundational subjects at
Primary 5 and 6 so that each student can learn at the pace most
comfortable for themselves. This allows everyone to play to his
strength and to develop confidence in himself. At the secondary
level, the choices open up even more. There are overlaps in subjects
offered in the Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic) and Express
courses, plus bridges and ladders to move between courses. This
has allowed learners with difficult inclinations, learning styles
and abilities to find something which engages and motivates them. </p>

dropout rates are low, the quality of students experience in schools
is rising and nine in 10 get into post-secondary educational institutions
funded by MOE. More than three quarters receive a high quality tertiary education
at our polytechnics and universities. More places are being created
at diploma and degree levels. Our system is one that caters to the
large majority of students and not just for a narrow few. </p>

their important work alone. We need parents and the wider community
to agree with us on the importance of developing each child holistically,
and support our schools and partner them in our endeavour to do
so. Such a partnership is even more important as we focus on values
and holistic education because these objectives cannot be achieved
by schools alone. Many teachable moments occur in activities outside
the school and classroom environment, and values need to be augmented
and reinforced by the community and parents. Indeed, the primary responsibility
for values education is with parents even as schools play their
parts.</p>

to help their children discover their strengths, develop these and
feel confident about what they are to become. At the same time,
we hope parents would also teach their children to deal with setbacks
and failures and to learn to persevere, to try again. By doing so,
we help them to grow, achieve fulfilment and enjoy their childhood.</p>

have also been hard at work, sharing their feedback, concerns and suggestions.
I discussed my priorities with them and got strong resonance on
key points. But they also challenged my team and I to make improvements.
MOE officials are hard at work within several aspects of our policies
and programmes. These cover a range of key issues. The reviews will

follow-up on my workplan seminar speech, MOE is working with schools
to enhance our current guidelines on homework policy. When done
well, homework serves to reinforce learning. Doing more is not always

this to students and parents so that everyone will have clearer
expectations. </p>

First, I would like to thank the Minister and all his teachers for
their vision to create a nurturing life-giving and confidence-giving environment
in our schools. Parents with whom I spoke to hold out a lot of hope
for this vision to be realised. So, first of all, I thank the Minister.
My clarification is this: the Minister talked about there being
chances for sports, music and dancing. My appeal is that these areas
for sports, music and dancing be areas where the students are not assessed
and where they can cultivate and nurture into their own selves and
within their own interests. When I was in school, I took part in
four different types of sports and I did not need to be in the school
team for them. Some parents have responded saying that, "my child
can only play basketball if he gets into the basketball team". Would
the Minister assure us that these areas he speaks of will not create
the pressure to perform, but give the ventilation needed for children
to reach their own goals? </p>

Sir, I am glad that Mr de Souza was such a keen sportsman and had
all the opportunities to play sports. Indeed, I agree with him.
First, let me say that the competition in our CCAs, the competition
in sports and allowing students to do their best is not a bad thing.
It teaches value of striving for excellence. It teaches value of
being gracious, in victory and in persevering in defeat. Therefore,
there will be a range of sports and other activities where there
will be a competitive element. Having said that, I fully agree with
him that in sports and other areas of music, arts and other areas
of CCA development, there is scope for us to encourage greater participation,
which is why during my workplan seminar speech, I also addressed
this issue that the Ministry will be reviewing the system of assessing
students' participation in CCA, moving it towards a focus on participation
rather than just achievements. I have also announced a review of
School Excellence model. Again, the purpose is to give our school
leaders more resources, more flexibility to deploy their resources
so that they may provide this student-centric holistic education
that we have set out.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>
                  </span>: I thank
Ms Denise Phua for the question. In the subject of high-stake examinations
and stress, I fully empathise with the parents and students. I know that
many working moms take leave during these high-stake examinations
to help their children, and dads, too! Many of us have gone through
examinations and gone through the stresses of high-stake examinations.
Indeed, in our meetings with parents, many have given us the feedback
on the issue of high-stake examinations and stress. We have given
it much thought and I have had many discussions with our school
leaders, and I have also spoken on this during the workplan seminar.
Let me restate a few points.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-746b41c3-d9b1-4357-9d3a-7eea82b5b17f">
                  <a name="id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-746b41c3-d9b1-4357-9d3a-7eea82b5b17f"><!--a--></a>First, the reason why we
put the focus on student-centric holistic education is to recognise
that each student is different, has different strengths and therefore
it is important for us to develop those strengths. Indeed, our education
system has over the years been moving in that direction. On the
examinations, let me say that if you are doing badly in examinations,
it is no longer like you are missing the last train, as it was during
our generation. Then, when resources were much more limited, the
system therefore had to be more broad brushed. Indeed doing badly
in the key high-stake examinations may mean a big difference in
one's life. But, over the years, successive changes have been made
in our education system to provide a variety of pathways: whether
it is going to the ITE, the polytechnics or the universities, or
even across the different parts of our system. For example, in the
Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams there are different
types of courses which students can take, even at a higher level,
transfers between the different streams, whether it is Express,
Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) are available. Therefore,
the system has many more bridges and ladders.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2b1d0f8e-4ff7-459d-92fc-341a7928f1aa">
                  <a name="id-94fcee12-20bc-45bf-81ac-45773b71f4d0__id-2b1d0f8e-4ff7-459d-92fc-341a7928f1aa"><!--a--></a>There will be more places
at the universities, more pathways which the Minister of State Lawrence
Wong is currently reviewing. To reduce some of these high-stake examinations,
admission into secondary school, for instance, has been changed
with the DSA. And so, a percentage of students can be admitted on
the basis of their strengths. The universities and polytechnics
too have the flexibility to look beyond examination results. So,
when you look at the totality of those changes, there are indeed many
more pathways that allow our students to develop at their pace,
and I would encourage parents and students to develop at an appropriate
path and take advantage of what we have in the system.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2a90266a-63b3-4c2e-a498-4c423cb33c87">

parents whom I have met and the feedback that had been given is
that nobody has suggested abolishing examinations. Examinations
well done serve an important purpose which is it assesses the extent
of learning and allows teachers and parents to gauge the extent
of that learning. As a result of this, we have a rigorous system.
Having said that, I have also been studying the experiences of other countries.</p>

I looked at what Japan was doing. They had, because of the stress
in the system, also reduced the curriculum content a few years back.
But within a few short years, standards had fallen so significantly
that they had to reverse course. The principals and teachers, whom
I spoke to when I visited the schools, told me that the text books
have become even thicker and because they had made the change so
quickly, teaching resources have been reduced and the teachers and principals
are facing greater stress.</p>

with my counterparts from the advanced countries, seeking to learn
from them but they were seeking to learn from us. They asked me
time and again how do we maintain standards, how do we have such
a rigorous system. And in many other countries, they are looking
at how they can raise the rigour and achievements of their students.
And if you look at many of the reports, whether it is in Europe
or US, you will see many of that. So, what I like to reiterate is
that I think we have a rigorous high-quality system, which should
encourage and motivate our children to succeed to reach the standards
but at the same time recognise that each student, each child is
different and there are multiple pathways for us to develop them.
The system has changed a lot over the years. Nevertheless, I would
say that ours is not a perfect system and that the Ministry will
continue to study ways to improve this. In my reply earlier, I mentioned
about how teams of Ministry officials have been hard at work looking
at various key issues and this is one of those issues that we will
be looking at.</p>

education is a long-term endeavour and whatever changes we make,
let us recognise that we have a high quality, strong system. Whatever
changes we make, let us do it systematically, thoughtfully and not
be rushed into doing the wrong thing because the consequences would
be hard to reverse. And the key focus for us in the coming years
is this: Student-centric values driven education because that is really
at the core of education. When we get that right, many parts of
it will be right and I am just continuing the very good work that
has been done by my predecessors to move the system. If you look
at the system, over the years, it has changed very significantly and
let us build on this and continue to evolve the system. I would
also like to appeal to parents to continue to work with our schools,
work with our teachers to bring out the best in every child.</p>

Thank you to the Minister for clarifying. I would like to ask the
Minister what he thinks of allowing students to take more than two
CCAs if they so wish and if he thinks that the current trend of
top schools allowing students to take nine or more subjects at "A"
levels is something he wishes to encourage? Or would he rather encourage
that they focus on taking more CCAs if they are academically able
to cope with the subjects. I think that CCAs do develop the students.</p>

                  </span>: Well, I think in my comments on holistic
and student-centric education, my key point is that everyone is
different and, therefore, we should not be overly prescriptive about
what that student should or should not be allowed to do. If a child
is able to do three CCAs and enjoy it, it is for the parents, the
student and the teachers to discuss and decide on this. I do not
think the Ministry should be prescribing how that is to be done.</p>

about whether students should take more or fewer subjects: it is
exactly the same philosophy. There are students who have done very
well doing many subjects; there are students who are better off
taking fewer subjects. So I think at the end of it, the heart of
it, is that the student and his or her parents must think about
this and think about how best to make use of the opportunities in
our schools, in CCAs and in other areas to develop themselves.</p>

thank you for allowing me to make some clarifications on my previous
reply. I think Dr Lim Wee Kiak had asked for Dr Patrick Tan's service during
his operationally-ready national service, in other words, after
national service, full-time national service. I was looking for
the paragraph, and I have found it. Dr Patrick Tan served as a Laboratory
Officer in one of the SAF's combat support hospitals. This is a
standard designation in the combat support hospital. The role of
the Laboratory Officer is to assist with blood and plasma storage
and supply and to conduct clinical analysis of blood samples. I
presume he was deployed there because of his qualifications.</p>

in terms of what Mr Yaw brought up in terms of the "white horse"

to ensure that there was no preferential treatment given to anyone

Mr Speaker, ASEAN-Japan relations have been built on solid foundation
based on the principles laid down by the late Japanese Prime Minister
Takeo Fukuda in 1977. Japan was one of ASEAN's earliest dialogue
partners and that dialogue partnership complements ASEAN's relationship
with other major countries like the US, Russia, Australia,China
and India. The Japanese, indeed, have contributed much to ASEAN's
development.</p>

has continued to broaden beyond the socio-economic sphere to cover,
for instance, the fields of counter-piracy and trans-national crime
as well as monetary
and financial cooperation. Japan is and will remain a key ASEAN partner.
I do not expect this to change irrespective of which personality
or which party is in power. </p>

adopt a Joint-Declaration for enhancing ASEAN-Japan Strategic Partnership for

an internal task-force to support the MPAC. We are confident that
Japan will continue to be a very important partner to ASEAN in years
ahead, regardless of the government in power. Japan is a natural

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said yesterday,
currently, there are 44,000 households living in HDB rental flats. Another
1,600 applicants are on the waiting list and the average waiting
time for a flat allocation is now six months. </p>

flats, with a view to shortening the waiting time further through
speeding up the allocation of flats to these low-income families.
Our supply of rental
flats will soon reach 47,000, to which we will add another 3,000
units next year. So, this should clear the outstanding demand while
meeting demand from new applicants. </p>

7,000 units. This will further increase the total stock to 57,000
by 2015, amounting to 5% of all HDB households. As we build more
rental flats, we must ensure that they are safeguarded for poor
and needy households who cannot afford to own a home, have no family
support, and do not have other housing options. It is important
that HDB maintains strict rules and criteria to do so. Nonetheless,
HDB will exercise flexibility to help those who do not meet the
rules but worthy of consideration. </p>

                  </span>: Obviously,
figures are dynamic and we have to be mindful of changing circumstances.
Fortunately, for rental blocks, the construction time is relatively
shorter, so we do have some lead time. I am ramping it up anyway,
hence the numbers – 7,000 new units, 3,000 new units. They are higher
than the normal projection of the annual demand. But I keep a very
open mind because we do not quite know how the situation will shape
up. Yesterday, I shared with the Member from Aljunied, Mr Low Thia
Khiang, in the Members' Room, that whatever we do, we must not unwittingly incentivise
the growth of these rental blocks. We need some, but I think if
you make it too easy for rental units to be accessed, you can unwittingly
create other kinds of problems.</p>

you ask me, I would prefer "zero rental units", meaning everybody
becomes a home-owner. We know that that is not possible but I think
we should always bear it in mind that the correct thing to do is
to prevent problems so that families do not get into a dire situation
when they become homeless and need to be temporarily placed somewhere.
The best is if they can organise themselves, and working with us,
work towards home-ownership. That I think should always be our target.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
think the Member was referring to another scheme which is a pilot
scheme called Interim Rental Housing (IRH). Let us back-track a
little. Ninety-two percent of Singaporeans own their own homes.
This leads us to ask, "What happens to the other 8%?"</p>

are living in a rented place. The bulk of them are in subsidised
HDB rental flats, which is the 44,000 that I spoke about – which
will become 57,000.
The rest are in various kinds of arrangements, most of them private
market arrangements. They rent a room, or they rent a place from
landlords. They are not subsidised. Then, there is a small category
which makes up a very tiny percentage of the total rental market.
MND started this scheme two to three years ago as an interim programme.
They were not sure how the project will shape up, so they asked
EM Services – which happened to be the joint-venture which the Member
spoke about – to test it out. They worked on a cross-subsidy model.
Some of the units are rented out at market rates, some are at subsidised
rates. The profits made from the market rates are used to subsidise
the other portions.</p>

but because those are contractual arrangements that have been made
to the company, I will see through the contractual arrangements.
My own thinking is eventually we will take over all the rental units
and leave the rest to the market.</p>

the first nine months of this year, developers sold about 12,000

despite growing uncertainties in the global economy. </p>

we have ramped up the supply of land through the Government Land

I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. My supplementary
question has to do with the fact that, while we understand we must remain
open as an economy to remain a global city, there is concern on
the ground that 20% home ownership of private property belonging
to foreigners may be a bit too high. And my concern reflecting the
ground sentiment is that it makes it fairly volatile because foreign
ownership is most likely to be given up in a downturn, and who is
left? The 80% of Singaporeans – the majority of whom are genuine
home stayers. So, would the Minister consider how the Australians
do it – although land rich, they still require the foreigners to
sell only to Australians and the foreigners buying property in Australia
are limited only to new developments. Would that be something the
MND would consider? Perhaps not now, but would it consider?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
am familiar with the Australian scheme. Countries have different
approaches and schemes towards private property ownership and management
because of their different circumstances and history. We have forged
our way just as Australia has forged its own way, for years. Policies
are never static. As I said, we keep a close watch over the situation
and it is not just watching over the property market. As I have
explained yesterday, while I need to make adjustments to housing policies,
even more important is to make sure our adjustments do not unwittingly damage,
do harm to our economy and our society because at the end of the
day they are all interlinked. So, it is a gingerly act of balancing
and making trade-offs. It does require some skill and hopefully
some wisdom. I try to impart some into this whole transaction. So,
the bottom line is: we are watching the situation closely. Remember
the larger equation is beyond me – what is happening to Europe,
what will happen next or this weekend when G20 leaders meet and
what will they agree on, etc. Unfortunately, all these larger equations
do impact us and we have to be watchful. But I assure the Member
that the concern the Member has expressed, I am fully mindful of
it because very often they appear on my Facebook wall.</p>

is very hard for wisdom to be translated into equations because
if you can do so, then computers can take over and you do not need
wise human intervention.
But I think much more [<em class="ph i">Interruption</em>] – sorry, Mr Low, what
was that? "Meditate? Go Bhutan and meditate!", he said [<em class="ph i">Laughter.</em>]
Bhutan would be too cut off from the rest of the world! You may
then not know what is happening elsewhere, and that would be highly
dangerous.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, in
last month's launch of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, the application
rates for 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats were 1.8, 1.6 and 2.4
times respectively. No 2-room BTO flats were offered. For the Sale
of Balance (SBF) flats, the application rates for 2-room, 3-room,
4-room and 5-room flats were 0.9, 8.2, 11.9 and 11.1 times respectively.
As the Member has correctly observed, the larger flat types tend to
attract higher application rates. </p>

flats to cater to Singaporeans with different budgets and life-cycle
needs. In planning the supply of the various flat types, HDB takes
into account changing demographic profiles, as well as housing needs
and propensities. The bulk of the new flats supplied are larger
flats to meet first-timer households' needs for space, to cater
to their growing family size. At the same time, we also need to
provide a good number of smaller flats to help lower-income households
become homeowners and second-timers right-size. The smaller flats
will also be needed for our ageing population, allowing more seniors
the option to move into smaller flats. Although the application rates
differ at the time of launch, all the flats eventually get taken
up, as they are completed. </p>

Mr Speaker, I have three supplementary questions. First, there has
to be a reason why there is a lower application rate at that time
that flats were launched. Is it because, firstly, the poor are not
able to navigate the application process, which involves a lot of
online submissions and receiving alerts when the launches are imminent?
Or secondly, is it because the price of these smaller flats is still out
of the income range of these applicants? And thirdly, if the answer
to the second question is "yes", would the Minister consider lowering
the price of 3-room and smaller flats in order to make them more
affordable to the lower income?</p>

                  </span>: Let me
try, starting from the last. Making 3-room flats more affordable
compared to larger flats – the answer is "yes". In fact that is
so. Yesterday, I gave Members some illustrations about the affordability
of 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats.
Generally, the BTO prices less the housing grants equal to about
five years of annual salary. But for 2-roomers, it is less than
three years of annual income, after all the grants. Members can
see there is a clear difference between the pricing of smaller flats compared
to bigger flats. </p>

about the lower application rates and what could be the reasons:
well, the application rate is a function of several factors such
as how many units are put onto the market, how many people apply.
And you cannot get it precisely matched. It is very hard to do it,
such that you get an exactly identical application rate for all
the different room types. I think that would be quite impossible.
Even if you are able to project to such precision, that also cannot
be the way we do things because when we design the housing estate
– let us say in existing Tampines – we have to know what is the
current housing distribution in Tampines and take that into account.
But as I said, regardless of the different application rates, at
the end of the day, no units get wasted. They will all be taken
up finally. As to whether a lack of IT skills was a deterrent for
the lower-income applicants, it should not be. At HDB Hub in Toa
Payoh, we have staff there to assist, if needed.</p>

Speaker, for the past few months, from my conversations with some
members of the Malay/Muslim community,
many have voiced concerns about employment and cost of living issues, due
to intense competition within the country as well as overseas. They
are also concerned with the fast pace of development in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 358</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-deb9d64a-75a2-461d-a42d-7279eeb99223"><!--a--></a>Over the years, our efforts
to make Singapore's economy relevant to face competition in the
global and regional markets required us to change the type of industries
we have. This resulted in changing needs in our workforce and in
the type of educational qualifications required. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8b1d3591-0f29-4362-807b-3c79d13e04ec">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8b1d3591-0f29-4362-807b-3c79d13e04ec"><!--a--></a>Our workers must stay relevant
and continue to add value in order to keep pace with the global
economic changes. Our Malay/Muslim workers are aware of competition from
the foreign workforce in Singapore, especially for those from the
middle-age group. It affects those without the necessary qualifications
even more. Many feel that competition is even more intense, especially
our students in our schools and institutions of learning. To them,
the pressure is huge.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6b73b020-434b-4f7d-86ba-ff58878597c8">
                  <a name="president-address__id-6b73b020-434b-4f7d-86ba-ff58878597c8"><!--a--></a>Many readily understand
that competition cannot be avoided, and Singapore's economy must
be open and global in nature. However, as the Government, we must explore
more ways to help our workers to be more competitive and, at the
same time, as far as possible, we must protect the workers' interests
so that they can earn a comfortable living in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b971a0a3-e6ad-444f-998a-aaa6da81e2b4">
                  <a name="president-address__id-b971a0a3-e6ad-444f-998a-aaa6da81e2b4"><!--a--></a>At the same time, the Malay/Muslim
community must also be proud of the great progress made. Many Malays
have achieved success in various fields, including new areas, because
they can overcome challenges and competition. However, competition being
competition, whether big or small, we must do our best to overcome
it.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28909796-956b-4f24-a459-6dfccc0ba8c5">
                  <a name="president-address__id-28909796-956b-4f24-a459-6dfccc0ba8c5"><!--a--></a>Just look at the experiences
of Taufik Batisah and Hadi Mirza, two of our popular artistes. Both
are winners of the Singapore Idol competition. They managed to prevail against
the competition from rivals of all backgrounds. However, in terms
of income, they still need to compete with artistes from the West,
China, Korea and local Mandarin artistes.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d374c5c7-2dd6-4e1d-984c-4b1c4b42fa20">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d374c5c7-2dd6-4e1d-984c-4b1c4b42fa20"><!--a--></a>Therefore, they have to
find ways – by exploring the regional Malay market. Their move must
be commended as they made use of their talents to beat the competition
by exploring new markets. They are still popular idols. Their hard
work allows them to overcome fierce competition. I have spoken to
them, and I am pleased that they are aware of the challenges in
front of them and continue to look for their own opportunities and
markets.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fc3acb42-23b6-45eb-9a71-5d3ee515ab71">
                  <a name="president-address__id-fc3acb42-23b6-45eb-9a71-5d3ee515ab71"><!--a--></a>Our community has similar
determination and drive. I feel that more can be done by the Government
and Malay bodies to help our community compete better and face the global
economy, especially in terms of shaping the community's mindset
to be ready to prevail against competition.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1371aea8-22b7-47c1-a8b5-d74184439dbd">
                  <a name="president-address__id-1371aea8-22b7-47c1-a8b5-d74184439dbd"><!--a--></a>The tightening of the criteria
for inflow of foreign workers is welcomed. It will help our local
low- and middle-income workers. However, we must also change the
way some employers employ their workers. Maybe due to the fact that
they can easily employ foreign workers for the past few years, there
are some employers who selectively employ cheaper foreign workers
compared to local workers. I understand that to the private company, time equates
to money. But all these depend on the work environment that we wish
to cultivate. We must ensure that local workers are not left behind
in the long term, whether in terms of lesser pay or uncertainty
in job opportunities due to competition from a foreign workforce.</p>

can help to instil an employment culture that takes into account
the value of local workers as well as the high quality of our education.
The fact that our economy is open, and the labour market must be
based on meritocracy, should not become a convenient excuse for
employers not to invest in the talent and career progression of
local workers.</p>

that we may hear stories about the presence of discrimination at
the workplace. It may just be grumblings among a small group but,
in reality, the Government had taken the correct measures to implement
policies that prevent employers from using race as a criterion for
employment, or language as a criterion. This effort must continue.
I also feel that the members of minority communities who feel discriminated
to be educated so that they report on irresponsible employers.</p>

made much progress in handling some of these concerns, including
certain multinational companies that sometimes act unfairly in terms
of employing workers from a certain race or profile. At times, the
upper management are not aware of the practices among their own
subordinates. But from what I know, most management act fairly and
follow the principle of openness and meritocracy.</p>

hard and make reasonable effort to get the relevant qualifications.
But what we hope is that we are given equal opportunities, in the
spirit of meritocracy. Hence, I urge members of the community who
feel that they are affected to work together with the authorities.
I am sure that the Government will investigate and study such complaints.</p>

has achieved a lot of progress, and in today's new political landscape,
members of the Malay/Muslim community from all walks of life are getting
more interested about Singapore's progress and their own progress.
I have been involved in many discussions and dialogues for the past
months, and one clear thing was the need for a wider approach. The
community wants their concerns about their future to be heard, whether
it is about daily issues like education and employment, or issues
like religiosity and the preservation of Malay culture.</p>

and bodies like MENDAKI, MUIS and other Malay bodies, to cultivate
better cooperation and consensus among the general public, and not only
among leaders of certain organisations, so that we can better understand
the community's aspirations, including their worries and concerns.</p>

more and more Malays are active on the internet, and there are many
forum groups and commentaries. Like other platforms on the internet,
we can also see many false and unfair statements. However, after
talking to many people, I feel that we cannot totally blame them,
because they may not have been engaged effectively and do not fully
understand the context behind policies, or why certain issues arise.
I am sure that many of them will understand the implication of Government
policies if they were engaged effectively.</p>

within Government and also Malay bodies to be more responsive and
use the internet to help the community further understand the available
channels of assistance, and explain how they can make better use
of policies. With that, it is hoped that feedback and suggestions
from members of the community will become more constructive, after
they understand the issues much better.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-2147f9f1-7559-424c-a806-ee52a00525f5"><!--a--></a>
                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Mr Speaker, Sir,
allow me to refer to the hon. Member, Mr Yee Jenn Jong's speech
yesterday with regard to SMEs. He mentioned an article published
in the <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> yesterday on issues that SMEs face.
I happened to be the adviser for that group, the Association of
SMEs (ASME), and have worked closely with a number of the ASME's
business leaders in the last few months. There are more pressing
issues that SMEs face today than GLCs. In fact, competition comes
in all forms, even MNCs would have the skills to offer cheaper prices.
Other SMEs, because businesses in certain tiers, find it hard to
differentiate as well. For example, in the real estate and construction sectors,
the competition from low-cost Chinese construction companies is
tough. The issue of business is a practical one – profitability,
human resources, costs of doing business. So, let us not try to
politicise the issue by targeting the GLCs and cooperatives and
focus on the real issues if you are truly interested in helping
the SMEs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-338b2ca6-19c9-4af2-a920-7c337cd08843">
                  <a name="president-address__id-338b2ca6-19c9-4af2-a920-7c337cd08843"><!--a--></a>In fact, one of the major
issues they face today is the lack of manpower and high cost of
business due to the tighter quotas on foreign workers, the levies
imposed on Work Permit holders and the higher wage criteria for
"S" Passes. And I certainly agree that we have to level the playing
field for our workers, as mentioned in my Malay speech earlier. But
if you speak to business leaders, as a result of some of these policies,
some have slowed growth plans, which means fewer jobs for locals.
Some are thinking of relocating, which also means even fewer jobs
for locals. Some already moved part of their operations overseas
where labour is less restrictive and usually at lower cost. So,
I think MOM and MTI have a tough job ahead trying to balance this
– the interests of our local workers, while trying to retain companies
here – locals as well as MNCs. And I am aware a number of MNCs have
also considered the same and a number have sought assurances from
the Government that we will continue to foster a favourable business environment. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f3ef0673-6138-40b8-9e1d-d8d986fdf0f6">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f3ef0673-6138-40b8-9e1d-d8d986fdf0f6"><!--a--></a>So, Workers' Party members,
Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Mr Yaw Shin Leong, are contradicting each other.
Mr Yee is concerned for the SMEs interests, while Mr Yaw would like
further restrictions to foreign workers in addition to what the
Government has put in place. I have not heard how Workers' Party
can assure SMEs and businesses in turn that Singapore is a place
where their business can flourish and not be viewed as restrictive.
Let us not forget the reality that businessmen are all practical
people and companies have options to relocate and what that means
is lost jobs for Singapore. I fear for the jobs of Singaporeans
because SMEs employ about 60% of the Singapore workforce.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a6dc786e-9f03-4db2-8f55-7688632b202a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a6dc786e-9f03-4db2-8f55-7688632b202a"><!--a--></a>But I do agree with Mr Yee
that many SMEs are struggling because of the high costs of doing
business here. As Minister of State Teo Ser Luck also mentioned
that there is no lack of grants but, in addition to the higher costs,
many are finding it hard to benefit from our productivity measures
because of inherent weaknesses in being smaller in size.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 361</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d5c4bac6-b976-413c-8857-930f086523b4">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d5c4bac6-b976-413c-8857-930f086523b4"><!--a--></a>I believe that SMEs also need a collective
voice so that they can be proactive like the larger companies to
voice the concerns of the sector more effectively, rather than individual,
fragmented viewpoints. Their interests are varied because this segment
is diverse, but they can focus on the major areas that the Government
can help and level the playing field.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-33f3c2dc-c775-43c4-bc26-4fb96759d3b8">
                  <a name="president-address__id-33f3c2dc-c775-43c4-bc26-4fb96759d3b8"><!--a--></a>The next gap I see is that
many have no skills, no HR functions, no CFO functions, so many
are not able to cope with changes or benefit from Government measures
or productivity the same way the bigger firms can. So, by helping
SMEs understand the Government better and working with the Ministries
closely, hopefully, both sides are better adapted to work together
proactively, being prepared for issues that are coming up.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c3da03e3-9506-4848-b426-026af7683e8f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c3da03e3-9506-4848-b426-026af7683e8f"><!--a--></a>But back to Mr Yee, I also
did not quite get the point of his argument about Bhutan. Many years
ago, we aspired towards the modern Swiss way of life. And, today,
is he asking Singaporeans to be more like Bhutan? The Workers' Party
seems fascinated with monarchies and dynasties – first aspiring
to be like the Tang dynasty and, now, the Bhutanese monarchy. Whatever
happened to First World Parliament and modern democracy?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5030e8d4-8e63-40b9-8354-74e5c078a44f">

Address mentioned that "we want a fair and just society that ensures
the well-being of every citizen", and I agree with this view. But
I would also add the sense of fairness of how the Government deals
with the people is also important. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-8477eea6-1d0f-46a6-b44e-4830503f7889"><!--a--></a>In the recent General Election
and Presidential Election, speaking to people, reading forums in
the mainstream media and online, one sentiment can be seen in common
– that the sense of fairness, social justice runs through the Internet
generation. This is something that the Government needs to come
to terms with, especially in these times of the "Jasmine Revolution",
the "Arab Spring" and "Occupy Wall Street" movements. The Government
needs to better demonstrate that we conduct our business, engage
and transact with our citizens in a fair manner. We can and should
do more to expose Singaporeans to the deliberations that have been
made in policies and what trade-offs we are making, and share measures
that are in place to assure them that the policy will benefit them
in a fair manner. This is especially true to emotive issues and
one fault of the Government is that many a time, we let doubts linger
and so, the sentiment of unfairness festers over time.</p>

the issue of boundary changes, where the PA was politicised, and

of Advisers will probably need a longer explanation from the relevant
authorities. But the difference in a Government appointee is that
in times when difficult Government policies need to be implemented
and where bonding between the Government and the people needs to
be fostered, this is where the difference is. This is where politicking
stops and real work happens. So, with issues like GST increases,
transport fare increases, and to explain housing and social welfare policies,
the Government can be assured of an aligned execution on the ground. </p>

do more and bring the community behind them to cushion the impact
of tough and unpopular Government policies. So, rather than take
political issue with how much MCYS gives for ComCare, the grassroots
and the Advisers raise funds, bring patrons into the community to
augment financial assistance, to help needy residents – in support
of the Government's "many helping hands" approach. The community
must do its part in addition to the Government's efforts.</p>

the issue of the President's son's deferment during NS raised questions
among many local Singaporeans over whether there was preferential treatment

that the system is fair, there is no preferential treatment. The

in the Addendum to the President's Address all came in quick succession,
that even as a MP, I had to keep pace. And surely, in those few
days, the ordinary citizen cannot appreciate the work that had gone
into all these policies, and the trade-offs taken. So, either we
slow policy implementation, which is not preferred, or we take more
time to prepare the ground in advance. Perhaps, this House can consider pushing
our Third Readings of Bills to the following sitting after the Second
Readings are completed. Show that the Government is willing to deliberate
on debates and arguments raised in the Second Reading. Then, allow
the public to consider the views presented, and allow the media
to carry follow-on views. And for the Third Reading, the Government
is in a better position to consider all viewpoints, adjust and rationalise
the policy better.</p>

Sir, before I begin, please allow me to congratulate you on your
election as Speaker of the House. Sir, in his speech to the House,
the President noted,
"we must find ways to use the new media constructively, to connect with
the digital generation and sustain fruitful conversations on issues
concerning us all". MICA's Addendum noted that the Ministry seeks
to find innovative ways to connect with citizens and it plays an
important role in driving and coordinating whole-of-government efforts
in fostering an informed and engaged citizenry.</p>

today relates to suggesting ways in which the Government can foster
an informed and engaged citizenry. It is divided into two parts. First,
I assess Singapore's mainstream media landscape, which directly
affects the online world. Secondly, I seek to provide suggestions
to the Government on how it can sow the seeds for a media and information
environment where Singaporeans are as far as possible, inoculated
from lies and misinformation online, and biased reporting from other
media outlets in general.</p>

does not exist in a vacuum. Some Singaporeans routinely wonder why
alternative political commentary websites are so popular among Singaporeans
– these include <em class="ph i">Singapore Recalcitrant</em>, <em class="ph i">Singapore Daily</em>, <em class="ph i">Singapore
Notes</em> and sites from across the centre-left of the political
spectrum like <em class="ph i">Yawning Bread</em>, The <em class="ph i">Online Citizen</em> and
even some articles from the discontinued <em class="ph i">Temasek Review</em>.
Could it be that because for every ounce of misinformation, perceived
or otherwise, these websites and blogs also ask serious questions
pertaining to governance in Singapore – questions that are side-stepped,
diluted or even ignored by the Government and the mainstream media?</p>

the last few years in particular, referred to the new media in largely
pejorative terms. The Prime Minister has referred to it as the "wild
west" and more recently, as a "cowboy town". But the reality is
this – the new media is here to stay, and it will continue to eat
into the mindshare of the mainstream media, no matter what the Government
chooses to call it. <em class="ph i">Temasek Review</em> may have gone offline,
but it is not going to be too difficult or technically challenging
to bring in 10 new incarnations of <em class="ph i">Temasek Review</em> online

the new media, Members need to consider how far the explosive popularity

with Dr Lam Pin Min's views that active citizenry in the real and

and judgment are needed in future. I also support Mr Edwin Tong
when he said Government engagement with Singaporeans can build a
new social compact and that what is required is trust and not blind
faith. Ms Sim Ann alluded to the "new normal" and said that voters
must be active participants so that rationality has the upper hand.
Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke of an emphasis in research and the interpretation
of information. Mr Cedric Foo arguably went the furthest when he
highlighted the existence of information asymmetries in Singapore,
suggesting that voters had no benefit of decisions made in the highest
echelons of Government. He also said that the Government's default
mode should be to share more information to secure greater buy-in
from the public, so that there
is less room for the truth to be distorted. And Assoc Prof <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Fatimah Lateef</span> noted
that government communication had to be enhanced and it was the

words from PAP backbenchers which I support, I will now move into
the second section of my speech that envisages specific legislation
that can protect Singaporeans from lies, misinformation and open
up new avenues for the new media and the mainstream media to promote
a more informed citizenry.</p>

of which call for more than the digital education suggested by Dr

with a view to promote active citizenry.</p>

legislation – an idea that has been repeated in WP's 2006 and 2011
manifestos. Mr Speaker, Sir, a prospective Freedom of Information
Act will allow any Singaporean citizen to make enquiries with any
public body for statistics and information at a reasonable price.
While I commend the Government for the recently launched website
data.gov.sg and the regular public release of information by the
Department of Statistics, these examples amplify the fact that it
is the Government that decides what it wants to put out.</p>

Act would do is to allow ordinary citizens to pull information from
public bodies that have not put the information sought in the public realm.
A Freedom of Information legislation is not meant to oblige the
Government to release sensitive data such as defence deployments
and procurements. Exceptions are routinely scheduled in Freedom
of Information legislation elsewhere, which prohibit Government
release of sensitive information. It is useful to note that Freedom
of Information legislation is very much the norm in countries which
host a diverse and plural polity.</p>

feel that such open-Government legislation only originates in Western
countries and that we Asians do it differently, the multi-racial Malaysian
states of Penang and Selangor have opened a dialogue on the induction
of such legislation. India passed the Right to Information Act in
2005, a high-water mark of the previous UPA government.</p>

Freedom of Information Act in practice in Singapore. In the event
some misinformation is being peddled on the Internet or the mainstream
media, even ordinary citizens and journalists can walk into any
Ministry, go to the designated information officer and seek official
statistics on the matter. With this information in hand, the peddler
of misinformation, either online or in the mainstream media, would be
found out, and the webpage or newspaper which hosted the misinformation
would lose credibility. No Singaporean will be able to accuse the
Government of selectively putting out information it wants to, since
ordinary Singaporeans will be empowered to seek the information
they require.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-5abedffe-4307-46ba-95da-5891502ffae0"><!--a--></a>A Freedom of Information
Act hosts other benefits too. Only a few weeks ago, MCYS launched
"Be the Change", an initiative, which invites "young Singaporeans
to step forward, share their ideas, and take the lead in turning
their ideas into reality." Such projects
are likely to be far more successful, popular and broad-based if
youth can make enquiries of Government on data and statistics to
ensure their ideas are workable and practical.</p>

of empowerment is an obligation by the Government of the day to
order the automatic release and disclosure of official information
at fixed intervals of 30 years or so. In the United Kingdom, the
Public Records Office manages this process. The disclosure of official
information and documents, apart from introducing substantive accountability
and transparency in Government-decision making processes, will likely
provide Singaporeans with valuable insights on why decisions were
made the way they were by political leaders in the past. Such a repository
of information is extremely helpful to ensure succeeding generations
of Singaporeans understand the circumstances behind the success
of their predecessors while avoiding the very same mistakes and
missteps.</p>

disclosure of official documents may necessitate a review of certain
sections of the National Heritage Board Act. The Government should
not see such changes as an attempt to criticise and expose previous
governments. But no politician should be beyond reproach and a commitment
to open government for historical scrutiny is an important feature
of a politically mature society.</p>

Tan, during his Presidential campaign revived interest in the office
of the Ombudsman, a proposal first made to the PAP Government by
the 1966 Wee Chong Jin Commission almost 50 years ago. The PAP Government
of the day rejected the Wee Commission's proposal. The current Law
Minister reiterated the call for an Ombudsman when he was a backbencher
less than 20 years ago in 1994. The office of the Ombudsman protects
the interests of citizens aggrieved by official decisions. Currently,
while the courts are available for this purpose, it is important
to remember that judicial review, as far as Singapore law is concerned,
only allows the court to adjudicate upon the process by which a
Government decision was made, not the decision itself.</p>

reflected an important philosophy of Government the 1966 Wee Commission

rights against Government too, and the very individuals they voted

the office of the Ombudsman symbolises a certain confidence and
trust a government has in its people and vice versa. Establishing
such an office today is likely to go some way to opening new channels
of communication between citizen and State, regardless of which
government is in charge in Singapore. And it is a proposal this
Government would do well to re-consider.</p>

in 2005, a <em class="ph i">Business Times</em> article reported that speaker after speaker
at a local conference called for Singapore companies to encourage
whistle-blowing, to help ensure good governance. These speakers
included Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, special adviser to Temasek Holdings, former
Senior Minister of State Mr Ho Peng Kee and former PAP MP Mr Davinder
Singh. Unfortunately, on 18 May 2011, a week or so after the 2011
General Elections, a Government spokesman with the Ministry of Finance announced
that the Ministry had considered and decided not to pursue a whistle-blowing
law to protect corporate whistleblowers. This was in spite of strong
calls by Singaporeans for whistle-blower legislation, partly because
of the banking disasters that came
to light in 2008, but more because of Singapore's acutely important
role as a financial and economic hub.</p>

target for economic crimes as much commerce passes through our shores.
Whistleblower and whistleblower protection legislation makes ordinary
Singaporeans part of the good governance process, not just the Government and
law enforcement agencies. It also protects ordinary businessmen
from rogue directors and employees.</p>

has included whistleblower provisions in their Corporations Act.
In view of the comprehensive review of our Companies Act currently

whistleblower provisions in our statute books.</p>

a lot of scope for this Government to take good governance to the
next level and divert the focus from misinformation and disinformation
online towards building institutions that promote communication,
transparency and accountability between the State and all Singaporeans.
Any sincere effort by the Government is likely to have significant
consequences online – positive consequences. Each of these proposals,
a Freedom of Information Act, the public release of official information,
the office of the Ombudsman and whistleblower protection are key
nodes in a system of trust that would give Singaporeans the tools
necessary to rely less on the Government for solutions and play
their part in active citizenship.</p>

the advent of the new normal, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

Goh Chok Tong era as opening the door to participatory democracy.
In the course of this debate, close to 10 PAP Members have called
for the Government to improve communication with ordinary Singaporeans.
Without doubt, the time has come for the Government to move decisively in
this direction, not in words but in deeds. Mr Speaker, I support
the motion.</p>

Sir, may I seek a point of clarification from the Member for Aljunied.
First, I am glad that the Member found some basis to agree with
me, but what I was saying is that we should be building a social compact
built on trust and I called for a greater sharing of information
from the Government in relation to fulfilling the trust. But that
is a far cry from saying that the Government is indirectly controlling
the mainstream media which is replete with misinformation and lies.
So, I would like the Member to please clarify, first, is he saying that
the mainstream media is replete with misinformation and lies, and

talked about the older generation of Singaporeans, they were probably
referring to Singaporeans aged 60 or above. According to the 2010 Population
Census, there are 508,850 Singaporeans aged 60 or above. They make
up 16% of the total number of Singapore citizens.</p>

60 years old this year were still high school students (14 years
old) when Singapore was forced to separate from Malaysia 46 years
ago. Singaporeans who are older have weathered the storms together
with us, endured many hardships and overcome many crises. Currently,
many of them have retired from work and are enjoying their golden
years, some are still working, while a minority of them are struggling
in life. Hence, when we talk about looking after older Singaporeans, we
should not limit this to familiar terms like "rebate", "concessions"
and "assistance".</p>

by bidding for auction items. They can also be seen at fund-raising
activities at community clubs, temple and church celebrations, singing

has implemented the Lift Upgrading Programme and Barrier-free Access
Programme, these are very popular with the elderly. Why? Because
they can now move around easily and safely, without fear of falling
down. Because of this, they are able to get out of their flat and
go downstairs often. The opening of the MRT Circle Line further
opened up their space. The emergence of budget airlines also expanded
their "space" to overseas. The other day, at the opening of the Parliament
session, I witnessed a filial son pushing his mother in a wheelchair
to Parliament, and he turned out to be the MP for Hougang, Mr Yaw
Shin Leong. I asked him where he lives, and if there are lifts and

there are 268,000 workers aged 50 and above working in various industries
and occupations. When the Re-employment Act comes into effect next year, more elderly
folks will join this segment of the workforce. However, when salaried
old folks talk about jobs, they will mention €˜the three cuts'. This
is because, once they reach the age of 50, their CPF employer's
contribution rate will be reduced from 16% to 12%, a decrease of
4%. When they reach 60, their wages will be reduced by 10%. When
they reach 62 and are re-employed, they will suffer another cut,
this time in medical benefits. </p>

to review the CPF contribution rate of older workers, and employers
and the Government have responded positively. At the moment, the
tripartite partners have started discussions on this issue, with
the hope that older workers will have enough CPF savings, whilst
not affecting the competitiveness of companies. At the same time,
it is heartening to know that some enlightened employers, especially
those who are unionised, have not reduced the wage of workers above
the age of 60. In fact, almost 1,000 companies have re-employed
older workers even before the Re-employment Act comes into effect
next year, the total number of employees re-employed exceed 9,000.</p>

employer. In addition, there are many statutory boards with many
employees. Many of these will be re-employed when they reach a certain age.
I hope that the Government ministries and statutory boards will
take the lead, such that when they adjust the job scope, responsibilities
and wages of older workers, they will be reasonable. If the worker's
responsibility is the same, and the workload is the same, they should
be paid the same salary as before. Of course, many older workers hope
that they can retreat from the frontline, they hope that the workload
will be less and they know that their salary will be reduced. But
so long as the adjustments are reasonable, they will accept it.
To a large extent, the officers in charge of human resources at
Government ministries and statutory boards should communicate better with
the workers and their unions. </p>

a good family environment because their children have either left
them, are not taking care of them or do not have the means to take
care of them. These old couples depend on each other, and when one
of them dies, the one left behind will feel very lonely. In Parliament,
we hear from MPs stories about old folks who have to sell tissue
paper, be a <em class="ph i">karang guni</em>, sell ice-cream, or work in low-wage
jobs. This is the group that I am referring to.</p>

a lot of assistance schemes to help them, and I am happy to hear

with a greater human touch.</p>

Chan, who comes from a poor family, will be able to empathise with

lonely old folks from their tiny living space to bigger spaces.</p>

old folks" is illness. They are afraid to see the doctor, they are
afraid that the doctor will tell them they have illnesses. They
are also worried that the medical costs are too high, that they
cannot afford it. I believe that the committee headed by Minister
Gan Kim Yong, who is looking into problems of the elderly, will
take note of this issue. </p>

of receiving letters from the Government. This group of old folks
are afraid to receive letters from the Government because they cannot understand
what is written in the letters. Secondly, they are worried that
their water and electricity supply will be cut off. When they receive
the letters, they will be so worried that they lose sleep. Only
when they see their MPs and grassroots leaders, realise that we
can actually help them, then they will feel assured. Hence, I suggest
that, when the Government is communicating with these old folks,
they should use more verbal communication and less English letters.
The activity centres for old folks can play an important role in
this aspect.</p>

needs to have a human touch when they implement their policies.
The Government has always emphasised consultation with the people
when they are drawing up major policies. But during implementation,
they should focus on applying human touch. </p>

servants who draft the measures, the measures will be effective
when implemented. But from the viewpoint of the common folks, they sometimes
lack the human touch, and this may result in dissatisfaction amongst
the people. For example, why do Singaporeans like to eat <em class="ph i">bak
kut teh</em>? <em class="ph i">Laksa</em>? <em class="ph i">Mee siam</em>? Because these dishes
not only look good, but also smell good and taste good. </p>

beneficial to the people and effective, but if we can add a bit of
human touch, it will be even better. For example, the ERP system.
Previously, the ERP hours along CTE in the evening lasts till 10.30pm,
yesterday, when we drove home, the IU does not beep twice anymore.

In the past, I used to go there to eat dinner but not any more,
because many friends whom I dine with said they do not want to go,
because they are not happy. The special part about Chinatown is
that there has to be many people, many cars, although we do not
want a lot of water. Chinatown does not need buffaloes or water,
but there has to be cars. Now that ERP hours are shortened, cars
will rush in to jam up the roads, then we can see the real flavour
of Chinatown. </p>

policy, although we have now tightened the immigration policy, we
should consider cases whereby Singaporeans marry foreigners. When
the non-Singaporean spouse gives birth and her relatives from another
country come to visit during the confinement period, we should also
relax the regulations. Here, I would like to thank the Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister for Home Affairs. I had a special case, her application
was not approved repeatedly. After I wrote in on her behalf, the
authorities finally allowed her relatives to come to visit her.
Imagine, if we have a daughter who is married overseas and is pregnant,
and we want to visit her, the government of the foreign country
should be humane too.</p>

main point he talked about is the peaceful and prosperous era of
Zhenguan. It is an era from history long time ago. When I went home
and did a search on Google, I found that there was a point of doubt.
The Member of Parliament Mr Chen hoped the Government would be like
Emperor Tang Taizong, but the PAP Government never wanted to be
emperor. On the other hand, according to Google search results,
Wei Zheng was originally with the camp that opposed Tang Taizong
and it was Tang Taizong who invited Wei Zheng to join him, as he
treasured good talents. So I wonder if MP Chen is saying that he
wants to join us from the other camp, I believe that is not the

principles should be adopted to create a national CPF framework
for all self-employed persons in Singapore. We should act now and
address these potential social problems of an inadequate social
safety net for self-employed persons. Sir, currently there are about
133,700 self-employed persons who have trade net income below $6,000. They are mandated
to contribute to their Medisave which can be used to pay for their
medical insurance to cover their medical expenses should they fall
ill. </p>

persons is inadequately insured against unforeseen events, such
as theft, permanent disability, critical or chronic illness. Unlike
employees, when such unfortunate things happen to him or her, the
whole family will fall into financial difficulties and experience
great distress because he does not enjoy paid leave for medical
or hospitalisation and cost of medical treatment. So, just like
the CPF Dependant Insurance Scheme, we should set up an automatic
opt-in for a basic Life Insurance scheme, which can be paid by the
CPF savings. This will further strengthen the social safety net
of the inadequately insured self-employed persons or, for the matter,
all Singapore citizens under the CPF scheme. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, "There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which,
taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage
of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full
sea are we now afloat, and we must take the current when it serves,
or lose our ventures." Written hundreds of years ago by Shakespeare
in Julius Caesar, this quote is remarkably apposite today. Every once
in a while, countries and nations come to a critical crossroads
and the choices that we make will change our futures irrevocably. </p>

today in terms of Singapore's future and the relationship between
Singaporeans and the Government. We may not have fully appreciated
it but the debates of the last few days had actually caused a much
bigger, global phenomenon. There is a tide that is sweeping the
world. We are riding this tide better than most but it has not left
us untouched and we have yet to plumb its depths for its true lessons.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-bbcfb99c-b7dc-4398-831d-5cefcfa11849"><!--a--></a>It began in spring, the
Arab Spring to be precise. The events in Tunisia which spread to
Egypt, Libya and Yemen, followed by the protests and demonstrations
in Israel, the Anna Hazare protests in India, the Indignants in
Spain, the riots in South London, and now the Occupy Wall Street movement in
New York which has spread to the rest of the US, Europe and Australia.</p>

old enough, there is a distinct sense of <em class="ph i">dÃ©jÃ vu</em>. It resonates of
Woodstock in the 1960s' hippie revolution, a movement which eventually
died out but which changed the world and left a lasting legacy in
its wake.</p>

about? It is, in essence, a collective outcry by the middle classes
and the poor about economic inequality. The sense that the things
they want are getting further and further out of reach, that wealth
is concentrated in the hands of a few − the rich are getting richer,
the poor are getting poorer, and wage disparity is increasing.</p>

over income inequality, high employment, cuts in social spending,
stagnant economy and lack of economic growth. The post-mortems of
the UK riots show that the rioters did so because they lacked the
belief that the political system represented their interests. They
lacked hope and they did not feel that they have a future to risk.
The <em class="ph i">Times of India</em> article reported that those who hit the
streets in India did so because of a sense of inchoate rage they
felt that the political system which displayed contempt for their
priorities. And in Israel, the sentiment was captured in a slogan
which said, "We are fighting for an accessible future."</p>

hold for us, especially in the wake of the recent GE? Well, the
first thing, if one considers our situation against the wider backdrop
of what is happening, is that all things considered, our Government
did well. The anger and disillusionment in other countries are accompanied
by a sense that their institutions and political systems have failed
them. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3e35d51f-42c1-4c79-adc9-7a03b6eb3b9e">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3e35d51f-42c1-4c79-adc9-7a03b6eb3b9e"><!--a--></a>When you consider our GE
results against the backdrop of what is now happening in the rest
of the world, then one would realise that 60.1% vote share is actually
a testimony that our Government did in fact get many things right
and that, unlike the other countries, our institutions have not
failed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-55c3c04c-3070-4774-9ef8-f61090534061">
                  <a name="president-address__id-55c3c04c-3070-4774-9ef8-f61090534061"><!--a--></a>It is, I believe, for these
same reasons that there has not been a desire to occupy Raffles
Place. However, at the same time, there are many reverberating echoes
of the global phenomenon in our last GE, in particular the concerns
of middle-class and poorer Singaporeans that things are slipping
out of reach and becoming inaccessible to them. It has manifested
itself in concerns over shortage of affordable housing, inability
to get places in local universities and rising costs of living.
And this was despite the fact that we had record economic growth
of 14.5% last year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5159a90a-90db-4e35-8a95-73add4c6fe4b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-5159a90a-90db-4e35-8a95-73add4c6fe4b"><!--a--></a>So, in the US, there is
unhappiness because there is no economic growth. In Singapore, we
have unhappiness despite economic growth. And what are we to make of
this? The reason for the unhappiness in Singapore was that many
Singaporeans felt that despite the 14.5% economic growth in 2010,
the fruits of that economic growth did not reach the ground and
was not spread out equitably. So the real lesson of the global events
and our GE is that we must continue to pursue economic growth but
we must also at the same time ensure that it is spread out and shared
equitably amongst all Singaporeans. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-32fc6a03-3756-42ff-95b9-8e6583719d90"><!--a--></a>The question of economic
growth has occupied the House over the last few days and the debate
has been positioned as economic growth versus happiness. That is
not quite correct.
The truth is that the two go hand in hand. One cannot just "don't
worry, be happy". The world does not work like that. If we want
more things for ourselves, if we want the Government to give more
things, such as transport subsidies and healthcare subsidies, that
needs money. The money must come from somewhere and, to get that money,
we need economic growth. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-d3da0a96-f4b8-4e1b-83b2-f9c0ead1bacc"><!--a--></a>We have to strike a happy
medium between Abba's "Money, Money, Money" and Jessie J's "Price
Tag". The Abba song is about girls looking for rich men. The underlying assumption
is that having money will buy everything she wants and bring her happiness.
The Jessie J's song, on the other hand, says that "it is not about
the money. We don't need the money. Forget about the price tag.
Money can't buy you happiness". I notice that everybody seems to
recognise Abba but there was a slight look of puzzlement when I
mentioned Jessie J, UK singer, list of top 10.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-126b8fe1-bbc9-44db-951a-50d7d9ffa718"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, I suppose
that contains another lesson for this Chamber, which is that the
MPs wish to be in sync with the broad spectrum of the Singapore
population, they have to tune in literally and metaphorically not
just to go 90.5 FM but also tonight's 100.3 FM.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9bdf8469-998a-471b-9c71-d0bb93d026c6">

and the Singapore Government is how to calibrate growth and social
spending and to get the balance just right. In the last GE, the
sense was that the balance was not right and now we need to correct
this. If not, then the result will be what we see playing out in
other parts of the world right now. In calibrating this balance,
I would urge the Government to look more at healthcare subsidies
and, in particular, education assistance for disabled as well as
for special children.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-69ffc741-0df3-480e-8b50-34ee1017ff70">
                  <a name="president-address__id-69ffc741-0df3-480e-8b50-34ee1017ff70"><!--a--></a>Another issue surfaced in
the last GE, which was the relationship between Government and Singaporeans.
The relationship between Government and people in Singapore is not
like that in other countries. The relationship between the Government and
people in Singapore is a special one. It is founded on trust and
confidence, of promises made and the sense of a shared destiny.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-27af4979-f361-4201-8066-4aa7622fce24">
                  <a name="president-address__id-27af4979-f361-4201-8066-4aa7622fce24"><!--a--></a>However, in the last GE,
it is clear that this relationship was strained and there was a sense
of disconnect and that the Government did not care. I do not actually
think the Government does not care. Why does the Government pay
so much attention to the economy? To ensure that Singaporeans have
jobs. Why do you do that? Obviously, because you care. Why have
Workfare? Why have Jobs Credit? Why have ComCare? Why have the Seniors
Mobility Fund? Why have all these things if the Government does not
care?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-939467fa-48c3-41a6-b67e-37be3932eb88">
                  <a name="president-address__id-939467fa-48c3-41a6-b67e-37be3932eb88"><!--a--></a> Sir, I think it does, but
why is it that, despite all these things and these measures, there
is this persistent feeling that the Government does not care? Well,
in some areas, it really was the case that the Government did not
act or act fast enough on feedback from the ground, leading people
to think that the Government was not listening to what the ground
was saying. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5bb0e33b-4af7-4425-a344-44a3c009e91f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-5bb0e33b-4af7-4425-a344-44a3c009e91f"><!--a--></a>However, I think there is
another reason and that is communications. That actually brings
me to this point about communications, the point that the hon. Member
for Aljunied GRC, Mr Pritam Singh, raised. The point that he made
was that, well, people turned to new media because they felt that
questions were side-stepped, because there is a sense of the politics of indirect
control over the mainstream media. And I think when he was asked
by the hon. Member, Mr Edwin Tong, he said that this sense of perception was
real or perceived, and he had set out certain suggestions on how
this could be redressed.</p>

view on how these issues can be addressed. But before that, I suppose
I wanted to ask the Member, Mr Pritam Singh, to clarify because
he has put forth proposals on Information Act, release of information,
and these are based on the statement that there are perceptions
out there, that there is indirect Government control of the media.
I seek the learned Member's clarification whether he believes that
there is indirect control of the mainstream media and perhaps that
can be addressed after my speech. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-4db14fc6-cda8-48ec-ac09-19fe7170deaf"><!--a--></a>But moving back on to the
point that I wanted to make about communications, it is this. We
have a well educated and thinking population and that is thanks
to the PAP Government's education policy of the last 50 years. But
the consequence is that Singaporeans no longer simply accept something
blindly or uncritically. It is no longer enough for the Government
to state its direction. What is imperative is the conversation that
the Government has with people so that the majority understands
and accepts that this is the direction that we must go. And if in
the course of the conversation, the sense is that the majority of
Singaporeans do not wish to go in that direction, then there must be
a re-evaluation of that direction. </p>

of the tone of the conversation between government and people. In
its desire to present substantive arguments, the Government has,
over the last few decades, managed to leech out all emotion from
its public communications. It is very often about facts, figures,
statistics. And official replies sometimes have a rigid pomposity
about them that immediately sets backs up. This has led to allegations
of arrogance and allowed detractors to paint the Government as uncaring
when this is, in fact, not the case.</p>

end result but the conversation that takes place between Government
and people and the tone of that conversation. It is not only what
you say but how you say it. That is why I think that there is a
lot of information out there, I am not sure we need another Act
for that. But I think that part of the issue thrown up by new media
is how Government communicates. And I believe that if the Government communicates
effectively, clearly and in an inspiring way, then that will in
effect address many of the concerns that Singaporeans have.</p>

policies that fit people and not make people fit the policies. There
are many examples of these but just one which I would like to ask
HDB to review is this policy of having co-tenancy of rental flats,
especially when you have the elderly. When rental flats were first
offered, the co-tenant policy made sense as people rented with their
friends or relatives. However, as they have grown older, many of
the co-tenants have passed on and now they are being asked to live
with strangers. If we can change this policy and have maybe rental
flats for one occupant, some for two occupants, some for families
and have some flexibility there, then we will fit our policies around
what people need.</p>

to look into creative solutions to offset rising costs of living.
One suggestion which I wish to put forward, far-fetched as it may
seem, is: Can we explore solar power for HDB flats? This is not
so far-fetched actually because the idea of the Marina Barrage was conceived 20
years ago. NeWater technology was not available then and the idea
of turning the whole island into a reservoir to capture recyclable
water at that time seemed like an impossible dream. But, today,
it is a reality. I would ask the Government to look at the possibility
of solar power for HDB flats because if you think about it, how
much we would be able to save in terms of cost and how much we could
add to the average family's disposable income.</p>

Obviously, there have been many things that have been discussed
in the House in the past few days, but these are some of the things
that we should look at to make the future accessible for Singaporeans,
young and old. It is not an easy task. It requires hard work, fiscal
prudence yet creative spending. It requires Government and people
to work together in tandem and hand-in-hand. It requires the concerted
energy of a nation galvanised in a common goal. </p>

the US so bad today? Why has it come to the stage of "Occupy Wall
Street"? Just three years ago, President Obama swept into Capitol
Hill on the ringing cry of "Change!" and "Yes, we can!" Three years
later, it is apparent "No! The US couldn't". Or at least to-date,
it cannot. The US is experiencing firsthand the words of Jean-Baptiste
Alphonse Karr, "The more things change, the more they remain the same." </p>

in Singapore. For us, it is not a matter of "we can" but "we can

is real. Remember the Re-making Singapore Committee ten years ago?
At that time, Singapore was criticised for not being a happening
place. We were compared unfavorably to Lan Kwai Fong. Madonna could
not have a concept here because there was too much red tape. Pubs
and nightclubs complained that they could not open past midnight.
In response to that feedback, we implemented change, so much so
that the pendulum has now swung the other way and I have to ask
the Minister for Home Affairs to do something about the side effects
of excessive partying at Roberston Quay.</p>

is what this GE is truly about. What this GE is truly about is that
we are at a crossroads. There are challenges for us and big challenges:
How to do what other countries have not been able to do, which is
to give Singapore an accessible future and to have a relationship
between Government and the people, not just of trust and confidence
but also of affection. If we can get this right, we will ride the tide

and these are words of encouragement for the Minister for National

the rest of Ministers, "The difficult, we will do right now; the

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, thank you very much. I refer to the hon. Member Ms Indranee
Rajah's request for me to clarify. I beg your pardon, it was not
a clarification. She wanted to know my opinion, how I felt, whether
the mainstream media was biased or not. Now, I wish the Member had
stuck to some of the points that I made in the speech about my proposals
for this Government to improve communication with Singaporeans,
rather than ask me what my view was as to whether the mainstream media
was biased or not. Be that as it may, let me just go through two
points that I made in the speech again for the sake of clarification,
nothing more.</p>

of the chief editor of <em class="ph i">The Straits' Times</em> last year again,
and this is what he said: "We are aware. People say we are a Government
mouthpiece or that we are biased." First point. Second point. The
remarks of former President Nathan in his memoirs, page 459, "Privately,
I was conscious that another outbreak of serious displeasure with <em class="ph i">The

or a return to the old idea of putting in a Government team."</p>

Singh thinks. What do we say about the comments made by the chief
editor of <em class="ph i">The Straits' Times</em> and our former President? The
fact of the matter is, there are Singaporeans – and I am sure Members
in their heart of hearts will know that – many Singaporeans are
concerned that because issues are not addressed in the mainstream
media across the political spectrum, you have popularity gaining
online and the biggest loser in all of these is the Government,
not Pritam Singh, not the Opposition, but ordinary Singaporeans
who actually want to hear diverse perspectives, diverse views.</p>

what it can do to improve communication between itself and ordinary
Singaporeans. Thank you.</p>

point of clarification. The hon. Member for Aljunied had put forward
a proposal. The proposal was to address a particular concern. The
concern was that there is a perception, or he said there is a perception
that the mainstream media is controlled. He has cited two examples,
the chief editor of SPH, being aware that people say, meaning that
is what is people think; President Nathan's quote – that is what people
think. </p>

is putting forward a proposal to have certain Acts which have extremely
important provisions. So, all I was seeking was clarification whether
that Member believes the reason for these Acts, in other words,
does the Member believe that the mainstream media is controlled
and is that why you are putting forward the proposal for these Acts?</p>

                  </span>: Yes, Sir. I basically suggested ways
in which the Government can foster an informed and engaged citizenry.
And I divided the speech into two parts: I first assessed the mainstream
media landscape which directly affects the online world. Now, that
is my contention. Now, if the Member does not believe that what
occurs in the mainstream media has no effect on the online media,
then I am not sure how far I can take this argument.</p>

informed this House that there are a number of legislation that
the Government can consider to actually improve the situation insofar
as lies and misinformation occur and this really is a reflection
of the President's Address and MICA's Addendum to that Address.
They are not referring to the mainstream media. They are referring
to the nexus – They are referring, I beg your pardon, to the online media.
I am suggesting that there is a connection and the Government would
do well to pay heed to that connection. This is not about Pritam
Singh's views on the mainstream media.</p>

about perceptions on mainstream media. There are many ways of avoiding
an answer to the question and Mr Singh has tried a number of them.
The question is a simple one. It is very important to know what
Mr Singh thinks because a whole series of proposals are being put
forward as to how the Government should deal with these perceptions.
A Member of Parliament, when asked a direct question as to what
he believes in, should either say he is prepared to answer or should
simply tell the truth, which is that, "I am not prepared to answer
the question". </p>

But I can only answer a question with my hand on my heart. I am
not here to score a political point. I am not here to suggest that
the Government is doing something wrong. But what I am saying is
that there is scope for this Government to reflect and, more importantly, reflect
on the words of the former Foreign Minister, the man who occupied
this seat that this Member currently occupies. And he said that
"the PAP needs to transform itself" and here you have a backbencher
who has stood up and suggested to the Government in all sincerity
not to score political points but just to suggest to the Government
that there is scope for improvement. And if they need any advice
or any suggestions, anything of that sort, I am sure I will be happy
to provide them. But I am not here to score a political point or
to teach someone how a question ought to be answered or not. This is
not my intention. And if the Member thinks that answer is so important
that it will have some effect on the real Singapore society, then
I think he is mistaken.</p>

point is a very simple one and it is this. Does the Member believe
that the mainstream media is controlled, purveys lies and dishonest
opinions? Why is it important to know that? When Members speak here,
their personal views and their integrity to speak their personal
views and speak from the heart, there are no games that need to
be played. The question is not about other people's perceptions only.
It is a very simple question capable of a simple answer. What do
you believe in? Then, we have a basis to move forward. Why is it
important to say what you believe in? As an elected Member of Parliament,
you come here and express your views, you got to put your hand on
your heart and say, "This is what I believe in". That does not require years
of experience as a parliamentarian. That simply requires telling
the truth.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the start of a new term of Parliament that
people have chosen us to be their representatives and it is our
duty to fulfil the trust that they have vested upon us. We have
debated the Government's programme for the next five years. MPs
have also raised many issues which affect Singaporeans, affect their
voters. But let us take a step back from all these detailed items
and to-ings and fro-ings to address how they all fit into a larger
picture.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bfef0afc-9d61-4943-acef-717586395237">
                  <a name="president-address__id-bfef0afc-9d61-4943-acef-717586395237"><!--a--></a>We all know the Singapore
Story. A dramatic transformation from Third World to First, apparently
effortless and inevitable but it was not just by luck, it was not
just by mere passage of time that this happened. It was the result
of hard work, strong determination from all parties and concerted
sustained performance over many years. As we look to the future, we have to ask
ourselves, it is a new environment as Ms Indranee said, we are at
a crossroads, and the tide is in full flood. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 382</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a455abd1-d41d-4ac4-a01f-fb5f768d810e">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a455abd1-d41d-4ac4-a01f-fb5f768d810e"><!--a--></a>Can Singapore thrive in
this new environment? Can we build a stronger society, a more inclusive
nation, a better home? Can we achieve what President Tan said in
his speech: the vision of providing a better life for all? As the
President's Address put it: we want every Singaporean worker to
hold a skilled well-paid job, every family to live in an affordable,
comfortable home, every young person to develop himself fully and
pursue his dreams, every senior citizen to stay active and to live
with dignity. And my answer is, yes. We can do it. But to achieve
this, we need an inclusive society that leaves no one behind. We
need a vibrant economy that improves all our lives. And we need
a constructive politics that put Singapore first.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4b247a76-60a9-417b-998f-a80bc98d8020">
                  <a name="president-address__id-4b247a76-60a9-417b-998f-a80bc98d8020"><!--a--></a>Let us take them one by
one. What is an inclusive society? It is one where everybody benefits
from the progress of the nation; it is one where everyone has a
say, a stake and a sense of belonging; and it is one where everyone
aspires to do better through their own efforts and feels that he
or she has a real chance to move up. Why is this important? Well,
firstly and most fundamentally, because we are one family, one Singapore
family. Then, it is because it is a reflection of what we are, our
values, what we stand for when we look at the mirror in the morning
– how we see ourselves, how we want others to see us. And it is
also a practical matter because if we are inclusive, if we work
together, we stand together and succeed. But if not, we fall apart
and we fail. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2fc995e2-c1a9-4c63-a408-bb1d311915a1">

New challenges have emerged to creating an inclusive society. There
are more different groups with sharper different interests and concerns: the
young, the old; the special interest groups; different socio-economic
groups: the professionals, the middle-class, those who think of
themselves as in the middle of the sandwiched, those who feel that
life has not quite been fair to them. </p>

than before. The most successful Singaporeans will continue to do
very well. The average Singaporeans will be able to make improvements in
their lives and are much better off than people in most other countries.
But at the lower end, incomes have risen too slowly, far too slowly,
especially in real terms. We are seeing our society stratifying
which means the children of successful people are doing better,
the children of less successful people are doing less well. And
fewer children from lower income families are rising and coming
up to the top of the heap. We are seeing ageing, visible all over
Singapore. We see this in our daily lives, we watch out for it because
we are shepherds and responsible for Singaporeans, but I think Singaporeans must
see it too.</p>

bright kids, the sparkle in their eyes, the excitement of their projects,
of the things they are planning to do, the places they are going
to. I do Meet-the-People sessions. We see families come, desperate,
anxious, worried about themselves but we worry more for their children
because when they have no home, no place to go, studying in the
void deck, how do you go from that to the kid dreaming in a laboratory
to be the next Nobel Prize winner?</p>

in Singapore, sharper than before. It exists in many other societies,
but it is something which we worry a lot about. Stratification is
an issue too because a generation ago, everybody was poor. Many
of the kids went on to school, university,
become professionals. One couple, one rental flat, seven kids, five
graduates. Many such stories. Today, not so common because the kids
are graduates already, they are not living in rental flats anymore
and their parents probably not living in rental flats either. So,
those who are left behind are finding it harder. </p>

before our eyes. I do not just mean when we look into the mirror.
Five years ago, I was preparing for a National Day Rally speech,
talking about ageing and I made a special effort to visit Radin
Mas, Mr Sam Tan's ground because Radin Mas had a more advanced stage
of ageing amongst its residents than the rest of us. But today,
when I come to Ang Mo Kio or many other estates, I do not have to
go to Radin Mas anymore. I look at the residents, you watch them,
they are active, they are happy, but visibly greyer than five years
ago. Just ask yourself: 10 years from now, where will we be?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7ae888db-54db-4462-8b47-43ca26138e5a">

tell me through freedom of information, one in five Singaporeans
will be about 65. Today, it is only one in 10. In 2030 – that means
18 years' time – one in five. It is an abstract statistic, but what
you see is what you can sense in every housing estate, in many hawker
centres when you walk around the streets and especially on Polling
Days when all the old folks come out, either with their walking sticks
or their wheelchairs, to vote. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-89eecf7b-9b0b-414d-b94c-d5bd92a2637f"><!--a--></a>We are not alone so there
is some solace, but we still are faced with the problem and the
question is how do we respond to this? After the General Election,
I asked Deputy Prime Minister Tharman to review social policies
comprehensively – set up a committee, oversee a comprehensive whole-of-Government
exercise, because this is not an issue just for MCYS, but many Ministries
are involved and, indeed, it is not just a multi-Ministry issue
on some of the major things. You need a national mobilisation for
it to come before a national consciousness as a priority which we
have to deal with. So, Manpower, Education, National Development,
Health, MCYS, even Home Affairs, because if we are talking about
kids with problems, MHA has a vested interest. And they have meeting,
discussing, tossing out ideas, getting a grip on the problem and
a sense of how we want to approach these problems. Today, I just
want to share some of their thinking with you which we have discussed
amongst all the Ministers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a4c36b30-5ab0-497c-814c-7203119c86aa">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a4c36b30-5ab0-497c-814c-7203119c86aa"><!--a--></a>I think the first priority
we would have dealing with these is to strive to maintain social mobility,
to create the best opportunities for our people to progress and
to encourage people to make maximum efforts for themselves. That
is how we have built our prosperity based on self-reliance, based
on personal endeavour. And I think that is still a right direction.
Because if you want a resilient Singapore, if you want a prosperous Singapore,
if you want a Singapore where everybody is doing well, we cannot
have passengers. Some will be the strobe setting the pace, some
will be the main might of the crew rowing hard. Others, even if
you are not able to pull your full weight, do what you can so that
nobody is just a passenger.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-636c298f-46a0-4d7f-8ec6-08425b563941">
                  <a name="president-address__id-636c298f-46a0-4d7f-8ec6-08425b563941"><!--a--></a>So, therefore, we have put
a major emphasis on education and training, on the Ministry of Education,
on the Continuing Education and Training which MOM is overseeing.
And that is one of the reasons why we have put a very strong team
into the Ministry of Education. When Ng Eng Hen moved to MINDEF,
I thought carefully. We put Heng Swee Keat into MOE who has been
there before, who understands education and has experience in the
Government at very senior levels and will be able to get going,
hit the ground running. And I supported him with a strong team --
Mr Lawrence Wong, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Ms Sim Ann so that education
is right up there on the front burner. And education, not just doing well what
we have already done but taking new initiatives, moving into new
areas and starting early in life so that children can get ahead
and do better than their parents. </p>

quality, affordable preschool education: how to support that, how
to make sure that all Singaporeans can get there. We are making
sure that every neighbourhood school is a good school. It is not
a slogan. It is a slogan but it is a reality and we make sure that
every neighbourhood school is a good school and any MP who feels
that his school is not quite up there, please let us know and we
will do something about it. </p>

Support programmes at Primary 1 and Primary 2 because when the kids
start with a deficit, we want to close that deficit. We do not want
the gaps to widen and have them falling further and further behind.
We are helping children with special needs – specialised learning
and therapy, expanded capacity and higher quality in their special
education schools. I think it is the right thing to do. I heard
Ms Denise Phua speaking earlier in the week with great passion.
I agree with her. We need to do more. I do not agree with her that
it should all come unto the Government's plate. But we will do more

about this and how there are children when in pre-primary or preschool

get into trouble. It is in the nature of kids, especially boys, and
we have to tackle these youth problems early because we want to
nip the problem in the bud before they get into the first brush
with the law, second brush with the law, exposed to hardcore drugs
or criminals, and then you are on a lifetime of crime. Wasted. And
that, again, is multi-ministry because it cannot just be done by
good intentions in MCYS.</p>

move, we must start early in life and we must keep the avenues open
so that it is free for people to move up. If you are talented, hardworking, have
drive and determination, however poor your background, there must
be no financial or social impediment for you to move. And I think
we can say that, institutionally, we have that: schools, bursaries,
fee remissions, universities. If you are able, you are willing to
study and you show the performance, the door is open.</p>

higher education, particularly university places where there are
25% going on to 30%, and we have Mr Lawrence Wong with his Committee studying
how we can widen access further in one form or another, so that
more students can make it to tertiary education. More bursaries
and scholarships will be given and, beyond the university, better
facilities in the polytechnics and in the ITEs at every level to
let students move up and achieve their best.</p>

The most capable, most reliable, the one with the most potential
to go into the most crucial job because we want to put the person
who is going to do it best so that the rest of us can be assured
that nothing will go wrong. But we have to see meritocracy widely,
not as a narrow one-dimensional definition of success as in examination and results,
but a broader range of abilities; many models of achievement, many
ways to make your mark. Whether it is arts, sports, science, as
a businessman, an entrepreneur or in the public sector, whether
as a leader or a specialist. Many ways to do well, and society to
recognise and celebrate all the different people who do well.</p>

tone for our society if we want to keep our system open. Because
the rules may be there, the scholarships may be there, but if between
the lower end and the higher end, there is a social gap – you are
not accepted, you do not feel comfortable, you are awkward or a
magic circle forms and you cannot get into the magic circle – I
think that is very damaging. So, we must keep our society open,
egalitarian, informal: people socialise together, people mix freely
together, people get to know one another in our State schools, in
our National Service, in life, in our hawker centres, able to mix
comfortably, able to integrate into one Singapore team.</p>

and there are many examples of students who have come up from poor
homes who have excelled. We have kids who took part in theatre for
the first time, discovered an aptitude, talent spotted, going into
SOTA next year. We have a badminton player who developed his academic
and athletic potential in the Sports School and will be representing
Singapore at the upcoming SEA Games. We have got budding talents
in the NUS Math and Science School excelling in Mathematics or Bio-medical
Olympiads, flying the flag for Singapore. We have sons of taxi drivers
winning a SAF scholarship to study in Imperial College in London.
There many more such stories and we must make sure that every time
there is a young boy or girl with potential who is from a poor home,
we identify him and we smooth the path for him and we help him to
make it. </p>

dealing with our social problems is to strengthen the ability for
people to succeed. But the second approach, which must complement
the first one, is to strengthen our social safety nets, because
there is a "<em class="ph i">yin</em>" and a "<em class="ph i">yang</em>". The "<em class="ph i">yang</em>" is
what you try to do for yourself, to compete, to achieve, to thrust
forward. The "<em class="ph i">yin</em>" – you are looking out for one another,
giving your peer a helping hand, helping the person who cannot quite
make it, "Welcome. Come along. I will help you take the next step."</p>

and the disadvantaged families, we have been doing this and we will
be doing more of this. In the last five years, we created Workfare,
we created ComCare during the economic crisis. We implemented a
Jobs Credit programme aimed mainly at the lower end. And with Workfare,
the Government is providing significant wage top ups. Every year,
400,000 workers benefit. Every year, they receive more than $400
million, all in. This means that it is about $1,000 per worker;
$400 million of benefits to the lower end. It goes into their Medisave,
goes into their CPF, goes to them in cash payments. A very substantial
measure. Not a minimum wage, but better than a minimum wage. And
something which we will enhance, as we gain experience, as we understand
how it works, as we see where we need to do more, just as we are enhancing
ComCare, as Mdm Halimah informed Members a couple of days ago. </p>

employers to help low-end workers to upgrade, to be able to earn
more. And that means what NTUC's Mr Lim Swee Say calls "best sourcing". It
is jargon. It means that when you outsource and you award a contract
to a firm to do work – cleaning, maintenance or security – you want
a firm which will have workers who are properly trained, properly
equipped and properly paid, not just a firm which will give you
the lowest tender and then, having made the lowest tender, who will
offer the lowest
possible wage to the workers and then do as little as he can without
getting into trouble on the contract.</p>

the unions are very focused on. Mr Zainal Sapari spoke at length
on this a couple of days ago and the Government supports this. And
I think the Government itself, as an employer, will have to see
how we will do this. I think we will have a problem with the lower
end workers because in the olden days, the lower end workers were
unionised. We had daily-rated employees, they worked for the PUB,
they worked for the Government, Environment Ministry or NEA. But
progressively, this unionised generation is not there anymore. The
daily-rated employees are not there anymore. And the low-end workers
today, the "<em class="ph i">sua kang</em>", the people who are the cleaners, they
are not unionised. So, there is nobody to speak for them, there
is nobody to fight for their rights, nobody to argue, advocate on
their behalf. It is not easy to organise them but I think it is
a problem we have which we have to find some way to solve. We owe
it to these low-end workers to make sure that they too can earn
a decent living in Singapore. </p>

end but we will extend the support beyond the low end selectively,
where it is deserved and justified, also to the not-so-poor – the
lower- middle-income, the middle-income workers. People who are
not so poor that they need help every month, but from time to time
run into difficulty and then they need some assistance to tide over
that period. And that is why we are paying attention to long-term care
for chronic sick and elderly, because I think many of the families
in the middle, they have elderly parents. If they are working, and
their parents are well, that is fine. If they are working, their
parents get ill, that can be quite a burden. And if the illness
is catastrophic – they have cancer – that is even more difficult.
Drugs are expensive and it can carry on for many years. </p>

have, we are focusing on and I think we understand that in an environment
where incomes are stretching out, where the middle-income sometimes
are having to struggle to make ends meet, some helping hand will
become necessary. </p>

we do for Singaporeans, of course, is to help every family to own
a home – the HDB flat. Mr Khaw Boon Wan spoke at length about it
yesterday and I am sure that would not be his last speech in this
House on this subject. I would just like to add a few words that
the house is much more than a secure roof over their heads. The
house in Singapore is also a major way for us to level up the less
successful and to give them a valuable asset and a retirement nest
egg. We are using the HDB flat as a means to give every Singaporean
household a stake: this belongs to me, this is what I am going to
work for and help pay for, this is what I am proud of, this is what
I will defend, and this is what I really should keep until retirement. </p>

sure that HDB flats are affordable even to lower income households.
If you earn $2,000, you can buy a flat. If you earn more than $1,500,
maybe a bit harder but we will help you to do that. Already we are
giving the poorer households more support when they buy flats. The
new Members of Parliament who may not have heard all the jargons
should know that there are Additional Housing Grants if your income
is not so high, and if your income is quite low, there are Special
Housing Grants on top of the Additional Housing Grant. And maybe
one day we will have an "Extra Special
Housing Grant"! But the purpose of this is to target the subsidies,
the assistance, the Government support, so that we give the lower
end an extra helping handout: "Here, this is yours. Please take
good care of it." </p>

a minority are not always taking good care of it. Some of them,
having bought the flat, are getting into debt. The flat is protected.
In fact, the creditor cannot foreclose and take the flat away from
you. But the creditor can put enough pressure on you that you feel
that you have no choice but to sell the flat and clear the debts
and go and see your MP and ask for another one. That is a very serious problem,
and that is one of the important reasons why we have a long queue
for rental flats, not because they did not have a house in the first
place but because they have lost the house which was theirs. The
money is gone and now they are homeless and it has become the Government's
problem again. </p>

address this problem. It is not easy but, to be honest, I think

to be tackled. </p>

be able to work longer, to help them to work longer, to help employers
to keep them at work productively. And I think if you look at the
numbers – the proportion of elderly working longer is going up and
will continue to go up, but most importantly mindsets are changing.
People are beginning to understand that it is good to work and employers
are beginning to understand that older workers have their advantages.
They are steadier, they may not be quite so strong and resilient
but they are reliable and, if you can keep them for a long time,
they can be productive for a very long time. </p>

tsunami, we need to contain and to share healthcare costs. This,
also, Ministry of Health is doing. Mr Gan Kim Yong has been focusing
on that. We need to build up care services so that there will be
more hospitals, many more nursing homes. But beyond hospitals and
nursing homes, also community facilities and homecare because, for
old folks, if you can stay at home, it is always much better than if
you have to go into a nursing home or have to be in a hospital.
You want the elderly to enjoy the care and the love of a family
and to be near friends and the community.</p>

initiatives which will be necessary over the next 10 years. I said
"national" because it cannot be done just by the Government. You
need VWOs, you need community groups, you need households – parents,
families -- all to participate and do their part to do this. We
can help to orchestrate this but it is something which has to be
a national effort.</p>

if we are going to help the lower income Singaporeans earn more,
if we are going to enable more of their children to do well, if we
are going to prepare for an ageing society. The trends themselves
will be hard to reverse but what we do will make a major difference
and will help to ensure that nobody is left behind. The social spending
by the State will grow. The items are good, as Ms Indranee Rajah
reminded us – they all cost money, and some of these money will
have to come from the State. And the Government is prepared for
this. We have made major revisions
to our revenue streams in the last term of this Government and I
think we will be okay for this term of the Government.</p>

enough money. You must have programmes which are properly designed
and must yield results. I wanted to say the programmes need to be cost-effective
– I was told that shows inadequate warmth – but the programmes have
to be effective. We have to worry about the cost, the programmes
have to work and, at the very least, they must not make things worse.
In social spending, it is quite possible for more money to make
things worse. If we look at the way families have completely broken
down in the West, it has a lot to do with the way the welfare state
was implemented and the money which was spent supporting single
mothers. So, we must make sure that we spend the money well and
the money goes to effective projects and they really are investments
in our people. We like to think so. We would like to try our best
to make it so but if we look at the US healthcare system, if we
look at the problems which the Europeans have with their welfare
state – the Greeks are the worst, but so too are many other European
countries – you know that more spending is not always better, and
just calling it investment does not mean it is going to yield you
a positive return.</p>

that somebody is keeping our system straight and sustainable. The
next five years, I am quite confident, we have adequate resources,
we can do what is necessary. Beyond that, it will depend on how
much our needs and our programmes go. But I can tell you that if
we do all the things which have been mooted over the last few days
in this Chamber, we will not have to wait five years before you think
about raising taxes. We will have to think now where the money is
going to come from. And so, I think we move, but have a care and
make sure that we get results.</p>

aspirations are important but so, too, is a vibrant economy. You
need a vibrant economy if you are going to create jobs, if you are
going to raise wages, if you are going to generate confidence in
a brighter future. Because if the economy is slow, if nothing is
happening, it is very hard to be optimistic to find new opportunities
and to have a zest for tomorrow. If we look at Japan: high level
of income, high technology, very disciplined, very well-educated
people – what is missing? A certain zest because the optimism is
not there, that they can grow, that tomorrow will be better. It
is an exciting journey that we are on and I think that is why growth
is important to us. Besides, without growth, as many Members have
pointed out, including Dr Amy Khor, it is the poor who are going
to be worst hit. So, when Members say we have over-emphasised growth,
I would say have a care. Focus on social issues. I have spent a
lot of time talking about them, focus on intangibles, focus on emotional
connection, but do not forget, we need to feed our people and we
need to grow our economy. </p>

is coming is threatening entire industries and jobs. We call it
hyper-competition. With the Internet, it pervades every nook and
cranny and it is reaching out to the world of what are called "PhDs"
– poor, hungry and driven people – everywhere. And there are many
"PhDs" in the world like that – poor, hungry, driven. We are not
poor, we are not hungry but I think we have to be driven. It used
to be called "outsourcing'. You find a company in India, you give
him the job, he does it for you, or China. Now, they call it "crowdsourcing".
I put it on the Internet, whoever can do the job, come, you take
the contract, you do the work.</p>

webpage design, writing a review. You can go to freelancer.com or
crowd-sourcing.org. If you have spare time and want some pocket money,
you can just take a job like that and do it. Others are complex
projects. The US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) has got a website which is devoted to crowdsourcing
that designed an UAV, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. They did not give
the contract to Boeing, Lockheed or Airbus. They put it up on the
web and you form your own teams and you post your design and people
will vote on it. The best design will get a prize and there is a
chance they will build the thing.</p>

of world. We would like to keep the competition away. Let us not
have so many foreigners here because they compete against us. Let
us give ourselves a bit more pay because the cost of living is high.
We would like to improve our lives but we cannot wish away the competition
just by doing that. It is there. And "there" is not across the ocean.
"There" is one mouse click away and that is the world which we live
in, whether you vote for the PAP or the Opposition. That is the
world that we live in.</p>

that and if we look within Singapore, you have to recognise another
very important fact and that is that our growth is likely to slow
down. Our economy is more developed. It cannot expand in the same
adolescent way as it used to, 7%-8% a year, effortlessly year after
year. We have domestic constraints of population and space. Population
growing, Singapore getting crowded, space being allocated. We have
to scramble to find space for new workers' dormitories, new factory
land, new space for highways, for parks. Everything which you put
in, something else has to be displaced. We are slowing down the
inflow of foreign workers and immigrants, but that means squeezing
out more businesses and reducing more growth. That is a very high opportunity
cost. There is a trade-off. Already, many employers are feeling
it, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and especially
those which are run by Singaporeans because they tend to be the
less generous pay masters and the first ones to run into difficulties,
not able to get workers.</p>

It is also in industries staffed mainly by foreigners serving Singaporeans,
like nursing homes. If you cannot find staff from the Philippines
or from Indonesia or wherever the nurses come from, you will not
find enough Singaporeans to do this. So, we are going to face slower
growth over the next 10 years. We have made 5.5% growth over the
last decade. Over the next 10 years, we have set a target of 3%-5% growth,
but I would say that we can make 3-plus % consistently over the
next 10 years if we have a good decade. We have to moderate, adjust
our expectations, understand what is possible within those parameters,
do the best that we can and do it as intelligently as possible.</p>

MTI has been pursuing this strategy for some time now. Restructure
the economy. What does that mean? Turn over the industries, phase
out those which are lower value-added, phase out those which are
low margin, not profitable, without a bright future. Phase in new
industries, new technology, new know-how, new skills, new trained
workers and therefore raise productivity in every sector and therefore,
we can share the benefits amongst all Singaporeans who have good
jobs. </p>

to do this? There is not one. By hard work, you can do it. Hard work
– educating our young, upskilling our workers. Therefore, raising
our level and raising above the competition, not meeting them head-on,
trying to be cheaper than them, but rising above them to be better
than them. And, at the same time, making a special effort to help
the older workers and the PMETs because I think we are going to see
more problems with them in the next 10 years, as Ms Low Yen Ling
and Mr Patrick Tay reminded us yesterday.</p>

can get investments, you can get good productive jobs and then,
you can have the wealth, you can have social measures which will
help the <em class="ph i">yin</em> part to complement the <em class="ph i">yang</em> part. And
we can get through and succeed economically. One advantage that
we do have when it comes to economics which is unique to us and very
valuable – and I am afraid often under-appreciated by Singaporeans
– is that in Singapore, we can make our whole system work well.
Not just individual pieces work, but the whole system works well.
Our unions work with our employers and the Government, we have tripartism.
Our business environment – everything clicks. You can register your
company for $2 and, in 20 minutes, it is done. You want telecommunications,
you can have it. If you want an SIA flight, you can have it. If
you want utilities, it is there. It is a tight, high-functioning
system where the whole is more than the sum of its parts. And this
is not just bragging rights. It is because of this, therefore, Singaporeans
enjoy wages beyond what they would earn if the same person, the
same skill goes to work somewhere else. If you cross the Causeway,
you work somewhere, or just go overseas, work somewhere, one of
our neighbouring countries, any of our neighbouring countries, you
would not get the same wage. In fact, many people come here to work
from those neighbouring countries because they are taking advantage
of our whole system performance, our entire system excellence and
we are taking advantage of them because they add to our numbers.
So, we have to keep that and, through that, I think our Singaporeans
can have a premium. And if they can strengthen that advantage, that
premium can go up.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e556545c-5dde-4e5f-a9cd-29d88ab960cc">
                  <a name="president-address__id-e556545c-5dde-4e5f-a9cd-29d88ab960cc"><!--a--></a>Many business leaders recognise
that there is this special Singapore premium. It is not just a figment
of our imagination. Therefore, they put major projects in Singapore even
though we are not always the lowest cost location or even the biggest
market or their home country. But they see us, they decide they
have confidence in us, they explain to their Boards the Singapore
performance and track record. Even though yesterday somebody said
past record is not a promise of future performance, in Singapore,
they say, "you have this past record, I think we will bet on them.
We have confidence that they will make the future work". They come
here and that is why now we have high quality investments even in
a quite difficult global environment. And, when they meet me which they
often do – I have met quite a number of them recently – they strongly
advised me to uphold the fundamentals, stay the course and never
lose this advantage. And what they
do not tell me, but which I know, is that of all the economic factors,
this entire system performance is the one which most depends on
our getting our politics right.</p>

society, an inclusive society, a vibrant economy, we must have a
constructive politics which puts Singapore first. Our politics are
not constant. It is evolving. It happens in every country. It is
happening in Singapore. Nothing is permanent – no situation is forever,
no solution works indefinitely. Our politics is evolving in response
to new economic and social realities because our economy is facing
challenges for the future, because our society is ageing, is having greater
income gaps, and is becoming more diverse. Therefore, our politics
is reflecting these social and economic conditions.</p>

and perspectives among different segments of the population. We
have a better educated population. They want to hear more alternative voices,
they like closer engagement, and they believe in a different relationship
with the Government. As one of them said, "In the old days, we were
here, the Government is here. Now we are here, the Government is
here, the gap is not so big, so therefore the relationship has changed."
I think that is correct, and the relationship ought to change.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-eb199ddb-02e9-4053-ac5c-bafd7a784298"><!--a--></a>The Internet is playing
a role. It is not just a passive medium but it also shapes our interactions.
And it redefines our sense of belonging and affinity, because on
the Internet, you are not necessarily interacting with your neighbour
or your fellow Singaporean or even your classmate in school. It
could be your special interest group who may live in California
or Australia. It could be a world of war craft opponent who might
be in Eastern Europe or Russia or China farming for money. It could
be a tiny little interest group collecting stamps or building model
aeroplanes but each person, each group fragmented into your little
narrowcasted sub, sub society, not one inclusive, cohesive Singapore
society. And that makes for different politics. We saw the effects
this year in two elections ‒ in May, the General Election; and,
in August, the Presidential Election. I think it is necessary and
healthy for our politics to adapt to changes in our society and
to be up to date and in sync with the times because, if we do not
adapt as the society goes, it is brittle and, one day, it will break.
But we cannot assume that just because you are changing, you are
moving forward. You could be going the wrong way, you could get
into a dead end. We have consciously to find the right way forward
so as to avoid problems which other countries have run into.</p>

same as other countries. Many things have changed, but one thing
has not changed,, and we still need a capable and an effective Government. We
are always a small country. We are successful, but our success is
always an act of will. Levitate, stay there, do not fall down, do
not lose that determination to keep levitating and keep performing
and rise higher. And if we have bad leadership, if we make the wrong
policies or do the wrong things, it can easily fail. Therefore,
we are different from other countries. </p>

Government, unlike, say, Switzerland where you just have a Council
of Ministers and the Ministers take turns to be the Prime Minister.
Or like the Scandinavian countries where it is a very homogeneous
society, your neighbours are so successful societies, homogeneous,
similar to yours and the society can run itself, civil servants
can run it and the politicians, well, you add to the system, but
life can go on. Least of all, can we afford in Singapore gridlock
or malfunction, which happens in many First World Parliaments? Belgium
is a very interesting case. In 67 years, they have had 45 governments,
so about once every year-plus. And for the last 500 days, since
the last election,
they have had no government at all because they have not been able
to form a coalition. There is no vote of confidence, so there is
no government. But the old Prime Minister is still there and he
is still conducting the business, and life goes on. Japan, a much
more established society than us, has had six Prime Ministers in
five years. I think if that happens in Singapore, we are in serious
trouble.</p>

this new political situation? First of all, we have to take a much
more open approach to Government and to governance − the way we
organise ourselves; the way we conduct our affairs; welcome different
views; reach out to diverse groups, including critics – hear them,
exchange with them, pick up ideas from them, persuade them; share
more information with the public, whether it is information on population
trends or information on employment figures, or foreign workers,
even GIC investments. We are publishing more information now than
we used to do, whatever we can. Not everything can be disclosed.
We do not want to tell the world the overall size of our reserves,
we cannot publish our defence plans. But wherever possible, we will disclose
more rather than less and, as we go forward, we will review the
rules and what we are putting out, and I am sure, over time, we
will do progressively more. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-61b6eba0-a2b8-44f8-9e3e-4240d8c49e05">
                  <a name="president-address__id-61b6eba0-a2b8-44f8-9e3e-4240d8c49e05"><!--a--></a>We need to engage citizens
more in the decisions affecting them, across a wide range − from
special narrow groups like VWOS helping special needs children,
nature or animal welfare groups. Specific issues which are important
but where there are specific groups which are concerned, like looking
at the CPF concerning workers, employers, and the older workers,
and they want their CPF rates revised. The Government is working with
NTUC and with employers to review the question. But even on broader
issues, like population and immigration, I think it is constructive
for us to have a discussion, to debate, to examine the facts, to
understand what the trade-offs are, to focus minds. A month or two
ago, the Institute of Policy Studies put up a paper showing various projections
of how Singapore's population will grow or shrink over the next
decade on certain different assumptions. It is not a conclusive
last word, but it was a very helpful contribution to the public
debate. I think it helped to educate people and make them understand
what this is about. I think over the next year, we will put up more
papers, we will discuss them, get people to focus their minds and
to understand that we actually face very serious trade-offs. There
is no free lunch. You can say you want to have fewer but, if you
have fewer, there are serious consequences.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-72487fa9-df76-4b23-a5f7-cc23dd5bd87b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-72487fa9-df76-4b23-a5f7-cc23dd5bd87b"><!--a--></a>But the public debate is
not a free-for-all and there are risks. The French tried this. They
had a debate on what it meant to be French because they wanted to
close over some of the fault lines in their society between the
immigrants, the Muslims and the non-Muslims in France. The immigrants
were mainly Muslims. But it took a nasty turn. It became a xenophobic
discussion. The government had to try and smooth things down and
distance themselves from the debate. So while we debate sensitive
things, we have to be very careful not to let sensible, moderate,
thoughtful views be drowned out by unthinking xenophobia. So that
is the first thing we do – take a more open approach to Government.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-329e2f0a-04b4-487a-94ef-baf40ab98714">
                  <a name="president-address__id-329e2f0a-04b4-487a-94ef-baf40ab98714"><!--a--></a>The second thing we must
do is to have more space for civic society and for the Government
to pull back wherever possible, so as to have more Singaporeans
take the lead and act on their own. I spoke about this at the National
Day Rally. I described the Yellow Ribbon programme and how volunteers
are doing a lot of good work, helping prisoners rehabilitate themselves.
But there are many other examples. When we are talking about ageing, an ageing society
and preparing for that, there, of all places, we will need lots
and lots of civic society to be involved, and some of them are already active,
doing good things. For example, there is a Young At Heart Community
College. Some of you may have heard of it. It is in Marine Parade,
started by the Marine Parade Family Service Centre and Southeast
CDC. They call it YAH! Although it has to deal with ageing, they
are young at heart. And the idea is to help the elderly to learn
more about being self-reliant and leading an active lifestyle. The
people who come for the courses are trained as Community Education
Ambassadors and they go out and promote awareness of wider issues.
So they are bringing in old people, giving them some useful knowledge
and skills, and then they can go out and they can be active in their community
and do good and feel useful, and I think probably improve their
mindset and their health. So we need many more of these, one in
every constituency, times 88 constituencies, and even more.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 393</p>

how our policies impact Singaporeans and are seen by Singaporeans.
Government is not only about doing things. Government is also about making
people understand what we are doing, getting people to support what
we are doing and knowing what people would like us to do, so that
we can do the right thing for them. Everything the Government does
is to benefit citizens. Why on earth do we want to do that? We are
voted by citizens. Our responsibility is to them. What we do must
be for them. But Government is complicated and, very often, the
link from the measures to the benefits are indirect and not obvious.
So the result is anxiety, sometimes opposition, sometimes a lot
of angst. We try hard to communicate. We make speeches. We have
dialogues. We listen. We talk. But as Members have not tired of telling
us, and I hasten to tell Members that I have heard you, we do not
always do it as well as we could. And we need to communicate better
– to listen, to engage, to explain, to be close and sense one another
better. If the policies are wrong or circumstances have changed,
then say so. And change the policies. We are on a new tack. But
if the policies are not wrong and we have to persevere, and it is
the perceptions which are mistaken, then I think we have to have
the courage of our convictions, preserve the core principles. We
can be flexible on the implementation. We can be flexible on the
details. But we have to work hard to persuade Singaporeans that
we are doing the right thing. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-b8db6a09-c426-492f-8451-b208c52c04cb"><!--a--></a>Take the ERP, for example.
I believe it is the right thing. I think the Minister for Transport
believes it is the right thing. I think some Members of the House
believe it is the right thing and more Members understand that it
is, although they wished it were not so. But it is something which
we cannot avoid doing. At the margins, we can adjust. Chinatown:
in the evening, if I can stop earlier, and the shops feel that maybe
their customers are less deterred, why not? Let us do that. Central
Expressway: people are going home, they are prepared to be stuck
in the traffic jam a little bit longer, all right, we can compromise
at the edges; let us turn it off at eight o'clock. I am not sure
that it will solve the problem but if people feel less angst, and
makes the policy more acceptable, I think it is the right thing
to do. Preserve the principles, adjust the details, politics is
the art of the possible.</p>

the power of the new media, to use it better to engage and connect
with citizens, to manage it better to encourage responsible and
constructive behaviour. We need to strengthen what is called "digital
judgment" and we need to set new norms and rules. What is "digital
judgment"? That means the good sense to know that what you saw on
the website does not mean it is real, just because it is on the website,
and just because it is a Wikipedia does not mean it is true. Ask,
find out, verify. We
did not invent the term "digital judgment". The British talked about
it because they did surveys and had found that actually people do
not have digital judgment. When they see something on the web, they
tend to believe it. If they hear it from the Government, they tend
to disbelieve it. They do not have control over media, neither do
we. But they have a problem, so do we. </p>

to be more sophisticated – to understand the Internet is very good,
the Internet is very interesting, many good things there – quite
a number of lemons. And we would need norms and rules to deal with
a new situation not envisaged in the norms and rules which had to
do with print media, with speeches in person, when now you have
anonymous stuff going around, when now you have instant stuff which can
proliferate and go viral. So the British and other countries, and
the Americans, too, have laws on cyber terrorism, cyber bullying.
They have laws to prevent people from misusing the Internet, to
sometimes very dire purposes. You would have heard of one American
woman who pretended to be a young girl and befriended another young
girl and tormented this other person until she committed suicide.
Why? Because there was some conflict between that girl and this
woman's daughter. So the woman pretended to be a young girl and
did this on the Internet. Are adequate laws existing? Not yet. Do
we need something? I think we have to study how we can do this.
It would not be 100% foolproof, but it will be necessary and is
something which MICA is fully focused on. </p>

a common space shared by Singaporeans. This is a broad continuing
effort. The Internet is pulling us in different directions, the
world is pulling us in different directions – so many opportunities
in so many countries, so many exciting possibilities for different
people to pursue. How do we pull everybody together so that we feel
Singaporean together, that we are anchored – this is home truly,

use of our schools, National Service experience, our HDB communities,
our National Day parades, events and major developments which we share,
things we go through together, whether it is SARS or economic crises,
so that we have shared reference points, shared memories, and we
feel one together. But it is a continuing effort and is something
which we must pick up. Again, the Government cannot do this. Really,
it is a national effort. </p>

of all these, in a "new normal", in a new environment, still has
a duty to run Singapore. Having heard all views, it has to decide
what are we going to do – this is the way we go. It is what we were
elected for, it is what the electorate expects of us to produce
results and to present our record to voters at the next election for
them to judge whether they are satisfied or not satisfied.</p>

our political institutions. Parliament is another, and the Presidency
is another. And we need strong political institutions to have a
good Government to work well. And it has to be strengthened and
kept up-to-date. Several MPs have talked about this. Ms Denise Phua
and Dr Janil Puthucheary suggested reviewing the NCMP scheme, the
NMP scheme and the Elected Presidency scheme and asked whether they
are still relevant to the new environment. We have amended these not
long ago. We last amended the NCMP and NMP schemes in the last term.
That is why there are nine NCMPs in this House. That is why we have
NMPs permanent and we will be appointing NMPs so that there will
be enough alternative voices in Parliament, and that is why we now have three NCMPs
in this Parliament because it is our intent to make it so. And the
NCMPs come from parties which say they do not believe in the system
but clearly not believing in something does not stop them from benefiting
from it. But we have just changed the rules in the last term, so
we will see how it works out before deciding whether further changes
are needed.</p>

we have just held the first contested election in 18 years. It was
hotly contested. After the election, there has been much thoughtful
commentary which has been published on the Internet as well as in
the print media. And the question is: how can we strengthen this
important institution of Singapore's government? In fact, Mr Chen
Show Mao interestingly argued the same a day before yesterday, which
I note is a change from the Worker's Party's position that the Elected
Presidency is wrong and should be abolished. But I take him seriously
and this is something which we have to consider very carefully. </p>

institution. The Government is accountable to Parliament and we
welcome vigorous questioning and debate in the House. So we look
forward to joining issue with the Opposition – I am sure the Opposition
looks forward to joining issue with us too. They declared that they
will be responsible and constructive – we will hold them to their
word. Do not just criticise what the Government does. Put up serious alternatives
to be considered. Argue your case. Be scrutinised as you scrutinise
us. And do not just support popular measures like increasing social
spending or building more HDB flats or asking the Government to
deliver more – anybody can do that. Also acknowledge that these
measures cost money and explain how proposals will be funded. Speak
up for measures which may be necessary but are unpopular, like immigration.
Being principled does not mean not being afraid to offend the Government because
the Government is not the Emperor and it does not chop heads off.
Being principled means not being afraid to tell unpalatable truths
to Singaporeans because voters are the sovereign and they can vote
against you. But if you have conviction, if you believe in it and
have passion, then persuade people to follow you. Do not lead from
the rear. And that applies to PAP MPs too. Speak your minds – speak
frankly, vigorously and passionately. We have heard many heartfelt
views over the last few days. Many of them passionately argued,
each in his/her own way. They have expressed their aspirations and
concerns of their voters, but I also encourage the PAP MPs to keep
close to other groups in society who will see you as their voice
in Parliament, people for whom you are their natural conduit, whether
it be the young, the old, community organisations, clans, sports
groups, nature groups, etc. Each of us comes with our own interests,
our own connections, our own constituencies outside of the people
who voted for you. Nurture those links, broaden your contacts, cover
their natural ground and, together, cover the whole ground comprehensively.
But as I said, also stand up for your convictions; do what you believe
will benefit your voters and what is right for Singapore. </p>

play a critical role in making our democracy work. They have to
be active citizens, working for causes which they believe in, but
united by a larger cause – share in common, which is to make Singapore
grow and prosper. Interests will not always be aligned. It is not
in the nature of human beings or human society that we are all clones
of one another and all have exactly the same ideas and interests.
Therefore, we need to work harder to build consensus, to compromise,
to give and take for the common good. And I think as incomes go
up, as people become more educated, this will take more work.</p>

many of you would have read about the nursing home which needs to
be built in Bukit Batok. The residents are concerned and they would
prefer not to have a nursing home next to where they live. And their concerns
have some basis and their emotions are understandable. And, yet,
if every neighbourhood in Singapore rejects having a nursing home
nearby, then there will be no nursing home built in Singapore, and
I think we will all be worse off. It is not just Singaporeans who
have such a psychology. It happens in many countries. There is even a
word for it. It is called NIMBY − not in my backyard. You have bought
a house, the house is worth something, somebody puts a facility
next to your house, property value may be affected, please put it
elsewhere. Next block is all right – it is not too far for me to
walk, but downstairs affect my amenities. And this will crop up
repeatedly, especially in a crowded city like Singapore. Mr Zainudin
has a similar problem in Bishan because Marymount Terrace homeowners
are affected by the North-South Expressway acquisition, and it is
not easy to resolve. Mr Zainudin, and I think Mr Hri Kumar also.
We are discussing, and we are trying our best to help. We have to
find fair and practical compromises. And if some groups have to
give up something, then we try to help them in some other way where
possible. To make every deal win-win-win, I think is very hard. But
on each deal, you will win some, you will lose some – overall, taken
it over the big picture, we all win – I think that is possible.
And if we have good faith, if we trust one another and we work together
with one another, I think we can make that possible. We cannot afford
to let every local objection block important projects because otherwise,
on healthcare, on transport, on housing, on many issues, we will
be gridlocked, frozen, and we will be stuck, like some developed
countries are stuck when they have no powers to do what is in the
public interest. So we need the spirit of compromise and it is this
sort of spirit which has to be part of our maturing democracy. So
when we say a democracy is maturing, it is not just the Government
taking an attitude or your institutions being right, it is also
how the people relate to one another, relate to the Government,
and relate to the community.</p>

society, a vibrant economy and constructive politics, we can face
the future with confidence. The next decade, we must expect a challenging environment.
Nobody can tell what the next 10 years will bring. It will be a
more uncertain and volatile world. Look at the last decade. Ten
years ago, in October, if you had looked forward for 10 years, would
you have predicted 9/11 or SARS or the global economic crises? Nobody
had heard of Osama Bin Laden; nobody had invented the term SARS,
nobody knew what the sub-prime debt was. Had it not been invented?
Probably. But in 10 years, three big surprises will change. What
are the surprises we must expect over the next 10 years? Nobody
can say. We can see certain serious problems in the world economy
today – America, with its fiscal problems and political gridlocks,
so they cannot decide whether they are going to raise taxes or cut
social spending; the EU, with Greece in deep trouble; with Spain
and Italy worrying whether they also may have a run and a crisis
of confidence; and the Euro, not certain whether it goes forward
to be more integrated or goes backward and comes unstuck. These
are very deep and structural problems which are not going to be
resolved soon and there is a real risk of a protracted global slowdown
– stagnation – just like the Japanese, after 1990 was stagnant for
now 20 years without being able to get the economy moving. Something
like that could happen in Europe, something like that could happen
in America. We hope not, but it is possible. </p>

our problems, they say, "But you all sound so optimistic, compared

seize the opportunities. If things turn out worse, we adjust course

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposals contained in my address cost money,
but I hope the Prime Minister will not raise taxes. Having only
recently emerged from the worst global recession in decades, we
are now staring at the possibility of more global economic uncertainty
ahead. This could mean more pain for Singaporeans and test our social
and economic resilience. I urge the Government to continually review
and enhance the measures to uplift and upskill Singaporeans, and strengthen
our ability to cope with the challenges that economic uncertainty
brings.</p>

older workers and incentivising companies to retain and not replace
them. Just last Friday, a sprightly old lady sought my assistance
to find work. She had been laid off from her job of over 20 years.
Older workers on the same factory floor were similarly affected.
They were told they were not able to see the small components that
they were fitting as well as the younger foreign workers who replaced them.
She asked despondently whether older workers were somehow less useful.
Her situation is representative of a growing number of elderly who
face difficulty finding dignity in work. This is a global problem.
While the Government has put in many measures to help older workers,
such as re-employment legislation and the Special Employment Credit,
more can be done on this front, in line with the Government's focus on
quality and inclusive growth. </p>

the Government moves to tighten foreign labour controls and push
towards productivity, I hope it will proactively reach out to our
small and medium enterprises to help them adapt and cope. Many small-time
businesses find it difficult to get Singaporeans to take on jobs
that foreign workers used to do. They find it a challenge to innovate,
redesign or mechanise their work processes, unlike larger corporations
or MNCs. </p>

an elderly couple who runs a vegetable wholesale business in Pasir

he went back. The livelihood of this elderly couple is suddenly
at risk. Might our knife be cutting too deep?</p>

the backdrop of economic uncertainty, MCYS' plans to strengthen
Singapore's social safety net is indeed timely and a number of Members have
spoken passionately about this over the last few days. My focus,
instead, Mr Speaker, will be on coordination and delivery of social
assistance. Acting Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Tuesday that
our effort to help the less fortunate is not just about doing more
but also doing better with the resources we currently have. I fully
subscribe to this. Partnering VWOs and other social service organisations
to help them be more productive and effective will make a career
in the social services sector more varied and appealing. It will
also help them stretch existing resources. As Mr Willie Cheng, former Chairman
of the NVPC, wrote in his book some years back, it is not just about
doing good, but "Doing Good Well".</p>

visits, my grassroots leaders and I encounter individuals or families
in hardship. Recently, a senior grassroots leader alerted me that
there was a particular family that, in his words, and I quote "they
looked like they were in very bad shape". We paid a visit. The elderly
head of the household and his wife had serious, chronic medical
conditions. Both could not work. To pay for medication and treatment, they
were relying on the wife's near-exhausted Medisave. One son was
trying to find a job; another was still studying. </p>

came across a pair of brothers living with their widowed mother.
She suffered stroke and was bed-bound. On their tight salaries,
the two sons scrimped to hire a domestic worker to look after their
mother. They had little left. Instead of weekly physiotherapy, they
cut it down to once a month. And to bring her out of the flat for
some sunshine and fresh air, they had to push her in a wheelchair
down a flimsy, treacherous plank that doubled as a makeshift ramp
for their door-step. </p>

for some reasons not aware that they were eligible for many forms
of Government assistance. But as they had not come to the Meet-the-People Session,
or gone to the CDC, or visited the nearest Family Service Centre,
or been picked up by any VWO or Government agency, they went unnoticed
for some time. We might be missing other families like these.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-39579be2-69fb-47ff-a63b-de6f4ca634fa"><!--a--></a>And so it is that our social support system
is made up of many helping hands, from the public, private and people
sectors. And we have an extensive array of schemes and programmes
as well as the capacity and resources to give assistance. But we
need to ensure that these hands interlock tightly to form a seamless
social safety web so that cases do not fall through. For instance,
social service agencies can further strengthen their outreach efforts,
galvanise the extensive local grassroots network, and encourage active
citizens in the community to help spot Singaporeans in distress.
The grassroots movement can also form local communities of care
within closely-knit communities and neighborhoods, such as within
a precinct or even a single block, to provide support and care for
the disadvantaged. This would be painstaking work but I believe
it would make our social safety net that much more effective.</p>

the way we assess cases and deliver social assistance. Many families
we meet at MPS come with complex and difficult problems that require the
compassionate ear and the active involvement of many organisations
and agencies. But just like in the acute care environment, these
"patients" have to see many specialist agencies, one after the other.
For instance, Mr Speaker, Sir, if they have financial problems or
need job placement, they might be interviewed by CDC. If family
disputes are involved, they might be referred to a Family Service
Centre. If housing problems are in the mix, they may be interviewed
by HDB. If they have difficulty paying for treatment, they would
see the hospital's Medical Social Worker. They repeatedly answer
similar questions, and may often have to submit the same document
to many organisations and agencies.</p>

that some degree of specialisation is inevitable because each agency
views each problem from a different angle. To be fair, our agencies
and VWOs have gone a long way down the road of integration and data
sharing. However, we should see if it is possible to create a "one-stop
shop" at centralised networks and node points such as the CDC to
consolidate basic information and documentation. We already have
plans for one medical record for every Singaporean. Maybe we also
see one case file for each needy applicant.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-3bbeb524-1dd5-476d-b366-83508cbadd15"><!--a--></a> A related point is about
the legal system's interface with the community, in particular low-income
Singaporeans. These Singaporeans sometimes have difficulty applying
for probate or letters of administration to deal with the assets
of their loved ones who have passed away because of legal costs.
These are people who might fall outside the Legal Aid Bureau's means-test
ceiling. But these are the types of legal processes that the man in
the street has to grapple with at some point or the other. I would
therefore like to make three simple proposals for consideration:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3486acbc-2040-4658-8ee9-d685e5941085">

these processes further so that people can navigate them easily
without the need for expensive legal assistance? After all, there
is no more estate duty involved in the process.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a19b62b9-28f8-45cc-ba69-19e8c2cec7af">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a19b62b9-28f8-45cc-ba69-19e8c2cec7af"><!--a--></a>Second, can the Public Trustee
help administer small estates even if there is a will involved?
I understand that the Public Trustee can only assist where there
is no will involved, that is, where a person dies intestate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c12a3116-b3f5-4e0c-852f-a2e499cf6b92">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c12a3116-b3f5-4e0c-852f-a2e499cf6b92"><!--a--></a>Third, can we allow lawyers
to charge contingency fees, that is, to collect fees after the proceedings
are over depending on the outcome, for selected types of legal proceedings?
This could apply to non-contentious matters like probate or simple contentious cases involving
simple disputes. To prevent abuse, the fees can be capped or mandatorily
taxed by the Court. </p>

agencies to continually review existing stable of social programme
to see how these can be enhanced in light of experience. As far
as possible, excessively tight restrictions should be relaxed. There
should be greater discretion to apply such programmes in favor of
the disadvantaged. One example is the Seniors' Mobility Fund. It
assists the elderly in getting basic mobility devices to achieve greater
independence in the community. I strongly support this initiative.
Many Members support this initiative.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6e70dcde-e568-4cc5-9863-2fbe6e89c926">
                  <a name="president-address__id-6e70dcde-e568-4cc5-9863-2fbe6e89c926"><!--a--></a>On Monday night, an elderly
frail Singaporean sought help because his wife had suffered from
a serious condition and could not walk. He had to carry her everywhere from
bedroom to bathroom, from bathroom to living room, and was near
the point of physical collapse. I asked him if a wheelchair might
solve part of the problem. He said "yes", and so I quickly applied
under the Fund for a wheelchair. Two days ago, I was advised that
the Fund could not be utilised because it was restricted to Singaporeans only.
You see, in this case, the man is a Singaporean but his wife had
been a Permanent Resident for a long time. In the end, we found
other sources of funding and support to help the family. But should
it be this way? To be fair, this is a new scheme. I am confident that
in light of experience on the ground, the relevant agencies will
review and widen its criteria. But the broad point I am making,
Sir, is that wherever there are rules and restrictions, there should
also be "safety valves" of discretion that will allow flexibility in
dealing with special circumstances.</p>

I will make two small points on the implementation of "barrier-free
access" in estates. A resident once remarked to me that while the
estate in Jurong Spring is 100% barrier-free, one of the last obstacles
for the elderly and disabled is actually right at their doorstep.
In such older estates, unlike newer developments, there are steps
leading up to the flats and while our residents had no trouble in
their younger years, these have now become painful obstacles that
they surmount every day. I know the Minister for National Development
is extremely busy with many priorities but I hope HDB will find
some time to study this to see if a scheme to build ramps for the elderly
in older estates might be feasible in the future.</p>

the Transport Ministry's announcement in its Addendum that it will
consider adding lifts in MRT stations and overhead bridges near
stations to make our transport system more barrier-free and elderly-friendly.
I wholeheartedly support this review and I hope the hon. Minister
will remember the frequent and long-standing requests by residents
in Jurong Spring for such an amenity at Lakeside MRT. This will benefit
elderly residents tremendously.</p>

cares for its weak and vulnerable, is a good indicator of the resilience
and strength of its community and the depth of its conscience and
soul. But social policy, unlike other policy areas, cannot be meaningfully
discussed or debated in abstract or purely on statistics. This is
because the true measure of the effectiveness of a social safety
net is qualitative, not statistical or quantitative. It is about
people and their individual stories. It is about their trials and
tribulations; and it is about how lives are rescued and transformed
one by one. In short, it is about individual outcomes, for individual people,
not about how many cases are processed, or how much money we indeed
spent. </p>

has painted a broad vision for Singapore, founded on the basis of
inclusivity, active citizenry, and the promise of quality growth.
This will not be easy given the challenges we face, internally and
externally. We can only achieve this if the Government and people
work together as one. And on that note of unity between the Government
and people, I move to my final, slightly disjointed point and that
is in respect of the hon. Member for Aljunied Mr Pritam Singh's
proposal for a Freedom of Information Bill, so that if lies are
purveyed on the new media or elsewhere, any citizen or journalist
can walk into the Government department, obtain the data and expose
the lie. While this is not an appropriate venue for a thorough discussion
on the benefits or disbenefits of the Freedom of Information Act,
I just like to share my concern about the underlying premise of
Freedom of Information legislation. </p>

legislation is predicated on the fundamental distrust of government,
of adversarial relationship between government and its people, on
the assumption that government is often reluctant or even hiding
things from its people. Is this the kind of relationship that we
want between our Government and our people? Is this the structure
we would like to have in the relationship moving forward? I prefer
the Government and our people to be united and to have an open,
frank and honest dialogue. I expect the Government to be transparent,
to be accountable and to be responsive at all times. If lies are
spread, I do not think we need citizens or journalists to go into
a department to compel the Government on pain of the law to disclose information.
I hope our Government would release information to shed light on
half-truths and lies instead. </p>

of Information Act is not straightforward, Mr Speaker, Sir. Results
in other countries where the Act exists are mixed. Indeed on the
20 September this year, an article appeared in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Guardian
Online</em> entitled, "<em class="ph i">Mixed Results since Blair's €˜dangerous'
Freedom of Information Act launched</em>". In this article, it shows
that while it has brought about some accountability of government,
the converse has happened in terms of trust between government and
its people. The article suggests that the Act may have perverse
results in the way government operates and I think, as this point
is being made, we ought to carefully consider it and ensure that
all the merits and the disbenefits of this legislation are thoroughly
debated. On this note, I support the motion.</p>

Sir, the President in his Address had touched on the need for the Government
to engage Singaporeans more extensively in policymaking. Several Members
of the House have also echoed this need in their speeches for the
past few days and we have just heard the Prime Minister discussing
the same point. For example, Mr Edwin Tong spoke of having deeper
and broader engagement with Singaporeans and the need for the Government
to connect with their hearts. Mr Cedric Foo called for an open sharing
on information. Ms Sim Ann appealed for higher level of partnership within
the people of Government. Mr Baey Yam Keng touched on how the Government can
leverage on the social media more effectively. </p>

the House that MICA will be working closely with fellow Ministries
to ensure that the voices of citizens and the needs of our various
segments of society are heard, understood and considered in policy
formulation. And this includes greater sharing of the rationale,
thinking, trade-offs and in some instances, information on any policy
decision making process. The Government will make a concerted effort
to communicate better and reach out to a more diverse populace.
Our population today is more educated and vocal. Younger Singaporeans
are also more adept in using social media and are receptive to all kinds of
news and views. So, the Government must evolve its communication
approach and style, openness, empathy, responsiveness, authenticity
and transparency are key pillars in good public communications.
Guided by these principles, we can go a long way to expand public
spaces to deliberate issues objectively and constructively and more
importantly, addrFess the challenges facing Singapore as one people,
one nation. </p>

the whole-of-Government's efforts to leverage on multiple platforms
to better inform, consult and engage the public in developing new
initiatives and shaping policies. In particular, the Government
recognises social media as a valuable platform that agencies can
use to directly engage with individuals and interest groups and
get more people connected on collaborative projects. Most Ministries already
have some forms of social media presence, be it in Facebook, YouTube,
blogs or Twitter. It is, however, not the number of social media
platforms that matters but rather the quality of the engagement
process. It goes beyond having fresh and updated content that is
accessible and informative to engaging in a two-way conversation.
Going forward, MICA is speeding up efforts to better equip public
offices with greater awareness, knowledge and skills sets in social
media engagement. In parallel, MICA will build a community of social
media practitioners drawn from all Ministries to share widely on
good online engagement practices for the public sector. The leveling
up of online engagement will serve to complement existing efforts
and broaden the communication outreach of the Government. We must
also make known these channels widely so that more people can come
on board. MICA recently launched the Government's social media directory
to provide a one-stop repository of all the social media platforms
that are run by our public sector agencies. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c349a80b-740b-4e6f-9f73-d566ca9bc6e0">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c349a80b-740b-4e6f-9f73-d566ca9bc6e0"><!--a--></a>In a nutshell, Sir, we will
raise the bar on online engagement. But having said that, I would
like to emphasise that social media is to supplement existing outreach
channels and not to replace them. Face-to-face dialogue sessions,
townhall meetings and kopitiam chats are "high touch" interactive
channels that we will continue to focus on. The Government is well
aware that it does not have the monopoly of good ideas. Over the
years, the Government has engaged the public in various public consultation
efforts to improve policy robustness and developed consensus on
policy options. These dialogues were useful, allowing for many good
ideas to surface. Public inputs have been incorporated into numerous
policies such as the Ministry of Health's means-testing framework,
MOM tripartite efforts to overcome the downturn in 2008, and MOE's regulatory
regime for the private education sector.</p>

multi-faceted, the need to tap on the broader community, including
academia, independent think-tanks and various segments of society,
is of greater imperative. MICA recently sought the views of the
public, the arts community and the industry on the Arts and Culture
Strategic Review (ACSR). This approach was also taken for the proposed
Data Protection Bill. I am heartened by the responses, and I would
like to emphasise that the Government welcomes active contributions
and suggestions from all segments of society. Our approach in public engagement
also needs to be enhanced to be more inclusive and collaborative.
While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and each agency has
to consider the scope of engagement and its stakeholder profile,
public consultation must be considered as an essential component
in policy formulation and in some cases implementation process. This
means stepping up our efforts to tap on the people, private and
public sectors (3P Model) to come together to define problems, develop
possible solutions and co-create policies.
The process of public consultation must also be made more visible
– both through news media and social media – to encourage more people
to come forward to contribute ideas. MICA will set out to share
and spread best-in-class practices across Government agencies. </p>

the loop with the public after a public consultation exercise and
making efforts to explain why a policy has been shaped in a particular
way, why some suggestions can be incorporated, and why some cannot.
So, to better support the whole-of-Government communications, MICA
will expand its pool of Information Officers and enhance their skills
to help deliver the desired outcomes.</p>

the House, such as Dr Amy Khor and Mr Lawrence Wong, have shared
their concerns on the Internet becoming a conduit for undesirable behaviour.
The standards of behaviour on social media should be no different
from the physical world. Social norms should be respected. While
many netizens are respectful of their Internet-users, some, hiding
behind the cloak of anonymity, have been less than considerate in
their use of the Internet, posting comments that incite racial or
religious animosity, spreading misinformation, and even cyber-stalking.
This can sometimes lead to dire consequences. For instance, earlier
this year it was reported that a Myanmar girl studying in Singapore
committed suicide after her ex-boyfriend posted "bad comments" on
her Facebook page, accusing her of being a "loose woman". In another instance,
two Singaporean youths traded racially insensitive remarks on a
Facebook page, making vulgar comments about each other's religions. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-3bba6b10-987e-4b05-bd7a-5e5accfc76df"><!--a--></a>There is a need to promote
the responsible and discerning use of the Internet, or as how Dr
Lam Pin Min puts it, as enhancing the "digital quotient" among Singaporeans. As
part of our efforts to foster cyber-wellness, MICA has been working
with partners from the public, people and private sectors to implement
information literacy, or what the Prime Minister calls digital judgment,
and cyber-wellness outreach programmes. The Inter-ministry Cyberwellness
Steering Committee (ICSC) has set aside S$10 million to co-fund
initiatives from the people, private and public sectors to promote cyberwellness.
A total of 17 projects have been funded to date. One of the ICSC-supported
projects is the Cyber Wellness Movements in ITE (Balestier Campus)
and ITE (College West Campus), which reached out to students, parents
and educators through interactive drama, workshops, group work and
peer mentoring. MDA's ongoing Cyber Wellness Campaign also aims
to equip students, parents and educators with practical knowledge
on how to handle cyber content and issues. </p>

related to the Internet. While we need to pay attention to the softer
aspects of Internet usage, we have not forgotten the need to ensure
that no one is left behind in the digital age. In this regard, IDA
has provided equipment and training to those in need of assistance
through its various IT programmes. For example, 14-year-old Ibrahim
Bin Paishar used to go to his friend's house when he needed to use
a computer for his schoolwork. However, he has recently benefited
from IDA's NEU PC Plus programme and now has his own laptop with
a broadband connection. Since the launch of the programme in 2006,
it has benefited more than 11,000 needy households with school-going
children.</p>

Mr Victor Sim, has also benefited from IDA's programmes. Mr Sim
attended computer training at an IT learning hub in Toa Payoh library
and now leads an active digital lifestyle, using the email, editing
photographs, exchanging travel tips and sharing information. Close

lives of those with disabilities such as 24-year-old Ang Yu Kiong,
who has mild cerebral palsy. Due to his condition, Yu Kiong has
a speech impediment and has difficulty walking. After graduating
from Republic Polytechnic with a Diploma in Business Application
in 2008, Yu Kiong had difficulties finding a job because of his
disabilities. He approached the Infocomm Accessibility Centre (IAC)
to enhance his employability with IT skills. IAC developed a training
plan that set him on a path towards a career in web design. Yu Kiong
is now working at an engineering consultancy company as a project
assistant. He is happy with his job and was recently promoted. </p>

point that we are all trying to grasp. Because of our open economy,
events beyond our borders constantly impact us. Digital media is transforming
the way we relate to one another, while immigration has changed
the face of our society. Singapore remains a home with exciting
opportunities for all. But the changes also create a sense of uncertainty
and anxiety among many Singaporeans. We have heard MPs reflect these
concerns in the House.</p>

shared by Singapore's Malay/Muslims. As a community, how should
we respond? There have been many discussions both in this House
and outside. Many ideas have been suggested. And as we start this
process of finding solutions with the opening of the Twelfth Parliament,
allow me to take a look at the wider picture. When we build, it
is important that our community gets our foundations right. </p>

seem new, we should not forget that, collectively, we have been
here before. Our community is not unused to dislocations and stresses, and
even challenges to our identity. Fortunately, such experiences,
I believe, have been mainly positive, because they have strengthened
us. They have given us greater resilience, a stronger identity and
better problem-solving skills. So, our community can draw on the
wisdom we have gained from the past in order to seize the opportunities
of the future with confidence. </p>

the last 46 years of nation-building has brought about profound
changes to our lifestyle including our religious life. The need

ourselves as part of the Singaporean family. Every year, without
fail, we will see many Malay/Muslim families attending the National
Day Parade, many with national flags painted on to their cheeks.
Yet these very same families have a love for Malay language and
are comfortable practising their religion here in Singapore. We
have the same hopes and dreams. We want to see our children do well in
school, our workers excel in the workplace and our families living
in happiness and harmony. This is the Singapore dream of unity,
peace and progress. At the same time, we treasure our religious
and ethnic identity as both Muslims and Malays. Islam is central
to our lives. It defines our place in this universe. It gives us
the impetus to put in effort, the confidence to embrace change with
a progressive outlook, and the values of tolerance and respect.
At the same time, our Malay language and cultural heritage is an anchor.
We are proud of our language and want to remain vibrant. As the
proverb goes "<em class="ph i">bahasa jiwa bangsa</em>" or the language is the
soul of the race.</p>

our religious affiliation and cultural and linguistic heritages
connect us to the wider Muslim world and the region. These are important
bridges that our community can tap on to the benefit of our nation.
Our <em class="ph i">haj </em>pilgrims, and this is the <em class="ph i">haj</em> season, have
often been praised for being well-organised and orderly, reflecting
positively our experience as Singaporeans. Their only fault, Sir, is
that they use too much water while they are in Mecca. Therefore,
being Malay/Muslim Singaporeans means we are in some ways the same
as other Singaporeans, and in some ways different. The exact balance
is something we have to answer for ourselves. What do we want to
share, and how do we wish to remain unique? This is the central challenge
that has always been with us, and will never go away. Our plus point
is that we have always been an open community.</p>

has been harder than some people think. Some, mainly outside Singapore,
dismissed us for staying put in Singapore. They failed to recognise the
rational and responsible decisions our forefathers' made to keep
our status and standing in a new nation. We neither sold out nor
abandoned ship. These critics did not think that it is possible
to achieve any balance between being Singaporean and being Malay/Muslim
much less being both a good Singaporean and a good Malay/Muslim.
On the other hand, Sir, there are some observers at the other extreme,
who think we have never even tried to integrate and that we remain
separate. Again, only those who do not know our community can hold
such perceptions. We have not only adapted to public housing policies,
but we also attend national schools, mingle and interact freely
and more recently engage in serious and open dialogue about our
respective faiths. The exact balance that we strive for is something
that is circumstantially dynamic. But for us at the philosophical
level it is a settled thing. This is our home and we are not going anywhere
else.</p>

the welfare of our community, our way of life and identity appeared
at risk of being compromised because of national policies, we have
found constructive solutions. Each time, we have been guided by
the same imperative, to be good Malay/Muslims and to be good Singaporeans.
We have stayed true to our community identity and at the same time
embraced and contributed to the Singapore project, keeping faith
with this beloved nation of ours.</p>

one of the first challenges the community confronted was adapting
to living in high-rise HDB flats where the sense of a community in
a village life could not be easily replicated. With the move to
modern housing estates came the anxiety of seeing our places of
worship having to make way for development. But in a creative move
not seen in any other country where Muslims are minorities, the Government
together with community leaders proposed and implemented the highly successful
Mosque Building Fund (MBF). Since then, the MBF has funded the construction
of 23 new generation mosques. Every working Malay/Muslim adult,
from the humble road sweeper to the corporate executive, has a hand
in this as we all donate to this fund.</p>

the Government together with the community created a unique legal
framework for the religious life of the community. The Administration
of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) of 1968 paved the way for the creation
of three Government-supported institutions namely the Registry of
Muslim Marriages, the Syariah Court and the Islamic Religious Council
of Singapore (MUIS). Every visitor I have met has been impressed
at this innovation, in which religious institutions exist as part
of a secular state. These institutions have allowed Muslims to practise
their faith freely and, more importantly,
as Singaporeans living in a multiracial multi-religious society.
This is indeed a privilege that many Muslim communities elsewhere
would welcome.</p>

mandatory military service in 1967, it was painful to see an earlier
generation of Malay/Muslim men have their loyalty to Singapore doubted.
Many faced a double blow, as they subsequently faced economic disadvantage
as a result of not having done National Service. Our community patiently
but persistently pressed our case. Since those early years, much
has been done to address this concern and today there is a growing
number of Malay/Muslim officers across all uniformed services. </p>

education inevitably turned the public's attention to our six full-time <em class="ph i">madrasahs</em>,
which pre-date Singapore's Independence. For a community proud of
its Islamic heritage, the apparent finger-pointing did not go down
well. We readily accepted that a cap to <em class="ph i">madrasah</em> enrolment
was necessary in line with our needs for religious teachers. Then,
9/11 happened and a JI terrorist cell was discovered in Singapore,
and the entire landscape changed. I was appointed Minister in-charge-of Muslim
Affairs just a few months later and suddenly the job had become
very different from what it used to be. Our community was put on
the defensive, constantly expected to prove our loyalty. Fortunately,
the Government responded decisively to engage the wider public on
the difference between Muslims and those advocating violence by misusing
the name of our religion. We responded decisively too giving birth
to the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) and playing our part
actively in the various inter-faith engagements and programmes.
Compared with 2001, I think we are stronger now. Only those who
are not in touch with Singapore will fail to see how firmly engaged
we are as Singaporeans. These incidents reflect how circumstances

in 1970s and 1980s also brought into focus other issues. The emergence
of the drug problem in the late 1970s and an increasing awareness
of gaps in educational performance raised doubts about the community's ability
to adapt to a modern society founded on the principles of fair competition
and meritocracy. Despite the daunting magnitude of the problem,
we persevered and tackled the drug problem decisively hand-in-hand
with the authorities. Since the formation of Mendaki in 1982, we
have striven to close the educational gaps working together with other
Malay/Muslim organisations. In 2003, we went further to formalise
the Community Leaders Forum to share expertise and experiences,
and do projects together to develop the community holistically in
tandem with the Government efforts for the nation. Even though many
had said we will never catch up, we have never given up on putting
in effort and today we have a growing number of students excelling
across the entire education landscape. Yet for every Malay/Muslim
individual who makes it academically, there will be many others,
from our other major communities. Hence, for my community, when
someone succeeds, we rejoice as a community as he or she reflects progress
and the hopes of the entire community. As a community, we do celebrate
our talent achievements in all areas and not just those who excel
academically.</p>

challenges. The challenges
will not go away. Some say they may intensify because the identity
issues are becoming more pronounced in a globalised world. However,
Sir, I am confident that we will get better managing that.</p>

the community is as uncertain as it is for other communities. The
lack of certainty does not mean that we should think less deeply
about our challenges and opportunities. We need to concern ourselves
with benefiting from Government policies as well as ensuring personal
and committee engagement in the national dialogue. Like other Singaporeans
this is our home and it is here where we have our roots, start our
families, nurture our children and chart our future. Some may cynically
say that certain Government policies and institutions are remote
and inaccessible and that the Malay problem cannot be solved. But
our history shows the power of engagement to improve the community.
We have developed deep experience in dealing with difficult issues.
Our community leaders have extensive experience and are well regarded
for their commitment and conviction. There is sufficient institutional memory
in the community to avoid the quicksand and the minefields. For
example, now there are enough community leaders who know what to
do whenever there is any hint of inter-religious friction. Indeed,
some Muslim groups are at the forefront of inter-faith cooperation.
Through our measured and rational approach, our community leaders have
earned the trust of others. We can speak up for the community without
being suspected of being chauvinist or extremist.</p>

and build trust is important because the tensions will not go away.
This tension is not unique to the Malay/Muslim community. All communities
face similar tension between racial and religious identity and being
Singaporean. There is now more recognition that we can be different
yet equal partners. We need to continue to provide first hand opportunities
to make a difference to identify problems, understand their causes
and come up with solutions. Open thoughtful constructive dialogue
is a critical component in that process. Personal commitment and
active participation in this effort is also a key component but
beyond navigating what is, our community needs to be able to imagine
what we can be. And in shaping that vision of ourselves, we can
draw upon the many diverse experiences that have shaped and will
continue to shape our community.</p>

with other Singaporeans in this little island we call home. Our
aspirations, hopes and dreams are no different from those whom we
share this island with. All of us carry multiple identities and
this is a boon and not a bane as some of us would like us to think.
Indeed, our Chinese, Indian and Eurasian and other compatriots have
had their own share of trials and tribulations, both unique as well
as what we have commonly shared as Singaporeans. We, therefore,
need not shed the layers that define us in order to become Singaporean.
If anything, these layers should continue to contribute to the continuous project
of defining who we are and what it means to be a Singaporean in
the 21st century. This is our hope and our sense of place in this

Malay community of Singapore has faced many challenges and experiences
since the country gained independence in 1965. All these challenges

helped to build us into a stronger and more capable community. All the successes we have
achieved, whether in the education and social fields, are the result
of our hard work to be cohesive and our willingness to be progressive.
These are the values that we must continue to practise in the effort
to build the vision of a community of excellence. Our journey towards
a community of excellence requires a continued effort and cohesiveness.

I will be very brief. I would like to address this clarification
to the Minister and in his capacity as the Minister for Information, Communication
and the Arts. With regard to the Minister's remark that he would
like Singaporeans to come forward and co-create policies, I may
have belaboured the point. I think all Members would know what I
am driving at now. It is really the freedom of information legislation.
Can I request from the Minister whether his Ministry would consider
at least looking at the both pros and cons of such legislation and
to find out whether it is suitable for Singapore, especially in
this era where people want more transparency, more accountability

Certainly, the Government will consider all necessary legislation
either existing or new ones that we have to amend in order to achieve
some of the desired outcomes. Let me share with the Member some
information which I have obtained about the Freedom of Information
Act, about its practice in other countries. We know that while theoretically
the Act will allow individuals more access to government information,
in practice there are typically also important exceptions to information
access. In the UK, for example, Sir, I have been informed that the Government
may refuse where the disclosure of classified information that may endanger
certain public interests or if it is too costly to retrieve the
information. So, this means that individuals are usually only able
to acquire unclassified information. So, we have to bear that in
mind. </p>

information is already released on various platforms. And Mr Singh
has mentioned the effort by MICA to put data online progressively,
on the websites of public bodies and periodic press releases. This
incremental value of freedom of information legislation may be limited
but I agree with him that we need to study all possible formulations
of the Act or other existing Acts that may help us to achieve the outcome
that we want.</p>

the Government has always been trying to create better conditions
and opportunities for Singaporeans. We save our reserves to cope
with the needs of the future. We invest our surplus on training
citizens to develop a more competitive country. We encourage more
foreign investments here to create more jobs for Singaporeans.</p>

every company can have a smooth journey from the beginning to the
end. Quite often, they will run into difficulties. I myself have
switched jobs seven times and experienced the misfortune of being
retrenched. Fortunately, Singaporeans can get help from Government
schemes. Our major policies have achieved their intended results.
However, we can do more in some other areas to bring some warmth

our policies more "personalised".</p>

assistance scheme. I met a 30-year-old single mother in Ang Mo Kio
– Cheng San Seletar. Her ex-husband is in jail and she has to raise six
kids single-handedly. She used to earn $1,500 and received various
Government subsidies such as Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), ComCare
and housing, childcare, transport and utility rebates. Her boss
raised her wages to $1,700 as a reward for her good performance.
This should be something to be happy about. This also achieved the

some of the subsidies because her current salary exceeds the income
ceiling and the $200 wage increment is not enough to meet the daily
needs of the family of seven. </p>

if they lose subsidies because of salary increment, some of them
might lose the drive to earn more because they feel that what they
gain cannot make up for what they lose. By making our current programmes
more comprehensive, we can help low-income workers to get out of
the social safety net. I am glad that my ex-colleague from the National
Trades Union Congress, Madam Halimah, announced yesterday that ComCare
will become more flexible, so that citizens can enjoy financial assistance
for a longer period of time.</p>

that low-income families who are currently under assistance schemes
continue to enjoy the same subsidies for six months, if they have
upgraded themselves and are now earning wages that exceed the income

This would encourage them to continue to work hard to get out of
the poverty circle.</p>

men marrying foreign wives. According to Population in Brief Report
2011, unwed rates are highest amongst men with secondary education
or lower. Forty percent of Singaporeans married foreign spouses.
Seventy-seven percent are single men who married a foreign wife.
They thought they will be able to enjoy life after marriage, but
find themselves running into difficulties. These men face an uncertain
future because their wives cannot get permanent residency. They
cannot buy HDB flats. If the wife gets pregnant, they cannot enjoy
medical subsidies. As the wife does not have work permit, she cannot
find a job to supplement the family income. In the end, the husband
has to shoulder the heavy financial burden. If they have children, and
the wife's application for social visit pass renewal is not approved,
she has to go back to her home country. I am sure many MPs have
seen similar cases. Perhaps the Government can consider issuing
a "special work permit" to a Singaporean's foreign spouse, so that
she can work. Next, for the foreign spouses who are employed or
have children, we can expedite their PR or citizenship application,
so that the family can live together.</p>

ex-offenders are released from jail. Under the Yellow Ribbon Project,
they can get help and re-integrate into society. SCORE's data shows
that, since 2007, the number of companies providing job opportunities
to ex-offenders has increased by 70%. Many ex-offenders found a
job successfully. This shows that the society and employers have
made progress in accepting ex-offenders. Next, we should encourage
more employers to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Project and hire
more ex-offenders, to give them an opportunity to live a good life
instead of treading their old path. </p>

the Government has earlier introduced a "Special Employment Credit"
scheme. At the end of last month, the first payment was disbursed.
There are over 50,000 employers who have provided jobs to 170,000
low-income older Singaporeans. I suggest the government introduces
a similar "Special Employment Credit" under the Yellow Ribbon Project

Chamber to find the oldest object here, and I think it must be the
Mace. It is the symbol of the authority of the Speaker. This particular
Mace at the head of the Table has been a part of the Legislative
Assembly since 10 September 1958 – just over 53 years ago, before
many of us were born. The early Mace was, in fact, a weapon of war
– with a round-fisted head and sharp metallic spikes. The Mace in
this House has a head that is shaped like a lion with wings. Hopefully,
Sir, it will never cross your mind to use it against us, even when
we are engaged in heated wars of words.</p>

us, this Mace has been a part of Singapore's legislative history.
It bore witness to all the historic moments in our young nation's
political development. And yet, if the Winged Lion Mace head were
to come alive and be asked how things were different back then and
now, I suspect it would say simply, "some things have changed and
some things have not." Whether our GDP is US$400 as it was in 1960;
or US$4,000 in 1979; or US$44,000 at the end of 2010. The lower
income among us still
find it hard to cope. Whether we live in muddy <em class="ph i">kampongs</em>,
2-room rental flats or at The Pinnacle with its million-dollar views,
we cannot avoid entirely episodes of job losses or poor health.</p>

MPs have asked for will increase our spending. So as not to burden
our future generations, the responsible way to increase spending
is to, at the same time, increase revenues. This way, we can keep
a balanced budget. One option, of course, is to raise taxes. If
we do not, we must find ways to increase revenues. The question
is how?</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-a45c43f0-fe77-4dc5-9faa-d69ce9ccb92a"><!--a--></a>A quick study of our revenue
structure shows that about 60% of it is contributed by four items.
They are: Corporate Income Tax (CIT), Personal Income Tax (PIT),
Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Customs and Excise Duties (CED).
How sensitive are these revenues to economic performance? In the
2001 recession, our GDP declined by 6.1% in nominal terms. It had
a major impact on our tax collections in the following fiscal year. Our
corporate income tax collections in FY2002, which was based on 2001
income, fell by 12.8%. Personal income tax fell 8.3%. GST grew marginally,
but you have to compare it to the double-digit growth that we used
to experience around that time. GST was growing in that year at
1.4%. Customs and Excise Duties fell 4.1% as well. In all, the revenue
from these four sources dropped around 9%. </p>

well, and nominal GDP rose by 14.6%. This led to a 14.1% increase
in corporate income tax collections in FY2008. Similarly, personal
income tax grew 19.3%; GST up 5.2%; Customs and Excise Duties up
4%. Overall, the combined revenues from the four items increased
by about 12%.</p>

FY2008 because there were no major changes in key tax rates in those
years. For example, GST rate increases, or reductions in corporate
income tax rates. This allows us to see the effect of economic growth
on revenues in a simplified way.</p>

through these numbers is to explain that we really ought to have
a healthy regard for growth. It helps to generate more revenues
which allow for increased spending without having to worry about
higher taxes. Many countries, in addition to being profligate, did
not pay enough attention to their economies, allowing themselves
to lose competitiveness and for their growth to trudge along. Many
of them borrow money to keep up their spending commitments to their own
citizens. But this is passing the burden to future generations,
who are also citizens. For some, the day of reckoning has already
arrived, and they are faced with the painful options of sharply
raising taxes and cutting benefits. Singapore must avoid this.</p>

as oil and so can afford to spend a lot more for a lot longer before
running into problems. We have no such luxury. We must not pursue
growth blindly, and certainly not in a way that does not benefit
the broad majority of Singaporeans. But we must also not become
disdainful of growth. Without growth, we will have fewer resources
to make investments for the future. Moreover, our needs and wants
will always exceed our means. Therefore, we must spend wisely. It
is not always possible to measure the value of our spending. But,
we must still exercise prudence and resist the temptation to spend
our way out of problems.</p>

we have been able to do when revenue flows were particularly strong
is the top-ups to our endowment funds. Having been part of the labour

financial crisis in 2009, I received a phone call one day. It was
about the retrenchment of 700 workers from a garment manufacturing
company where we had a union branch. Ninety per cent women, seamstresses,
who had no other skills. And three out of four of them aged 50 and
above, with rather bleak prospects for finding the next job. Their
last day was to be a Thursday, which was just four days before Chinese
New Year. My fellow union leaders and I were, to put it in an understated
way, quite devastated. We tried our best to persuade the employer
to at least hold the workers till after Chinese New Year to no avail.
So, we had to do the next best thing: keep our chins up, grit our
teeth and set in motion a series of measures to lessen the pain
for the workers. </p>

then was that there is nothing more risky to workers than a job they
feel contented in. It is a great irony for union leaders seeking
to improve working conditions of our workers. Because the more contented
our workers feel, the more likely they are to postpone training
and the less motivated they are to upgrade themselves. And so when
the game is up, they are caught unaware. That is why I believe,
more than Workfare bonuses, more than CPF top-ups and GST credits,
we need to give our workers the chance to build lifelong employability
so that they need never be caught in the terrible situation those
700 seamstresses faced.</p>

on shaping our political culture. After the General Election, many
have noticed the marked change in the way people interact with their
MPs. I would like to share some observations. One type of interaction,
I would characterise it as sort of a Transactional Relationship.
A resident comes and sees us, and says, "I voted for you, so now,
please get me my HDB flat, or approve my wife's PR application,
or get my son into this primary school. There are eight votes in
my household." That is one type.</p>

and sarcastic in tone. Emails that are sent, words that are used.
For example, saying, "Is this how the Government puts Singaporeans
first?", if they do not get what they want. Or anything can be labelled
as, "The Government cares only for foreigners."</p>

of "My-way or no-way". This happens when solutions proposed by agencies
that balance the needs of all the stakeholders are rejected without
consideration for others. "It doesn't suit me, so no-go."</p>

And frankly, I am quite saddened to see my country develop in this
direction. If this is the "new normal", in my mind, there is nothing
to celebrate. But there is a different kind of "new normal" which
we can aspire to, one where it is not uncommon to admit mistakes
and accept apologies.</p>

Central Narcotics Bureau: volunteering information that past statistics
had not been entirely correct. They took the flak but I was very
heartened that at least a small group of people was prepared to
say, "Bravo for owning up, but please work harder, do better." But
not all are so forgiving. And it makes me think, that if we always
crucify people for honest mistakes, for owning up to their honest
mistakes, what we will have is not the "absence of mistakes", only
the "absence of honesty". Is this what we want in the "new normal"
of our politics?</p>

should not be unusual for parties, political or otherwise, to adjust
our positions. I recall very vividly, a visit that I made to the
French National Assembly. There, in front of the Speaker, sort of
a semi-circle theatre-style, are where all the legislators are seated.
And I was told, if you are from a Left party, you sit to the left from
where the Speaker sees you. And if you are from the Right, you sit
on the right. And you are either on the left or on the right, and
your position is fixed. And no matter how the debate develops, no
matter what new information is brought up, the Speaker says, what
does the Left have to say, and what does the Right have to say?
And so your physical position fixes your mental position!</p>

that sort of a positioning. It is necessary for us to adjust our positions
from time to time with new information, new knowledge, new understanding, new
developments. Further good behaviour norms that should apply equally
on both sides of the bench, front and back, and across party lines,
include the willingness to acknowledge trade-offs. </p>

If we have more vehicle quotas, COE prices will be lower, but we
will also have more congested roads and more illegal parking. If
we have more stringent immigration measures, fewer men can get PRs
for their foreign brides. In these issues, a responsible Parliament
must find consensus on where the balance should fall, and from debate,
move to action. In some cases, we can agree to disagree. Like in
the exchange that we just had. Mr Pritam Singh, the hon. Mr Singh
is not here, I wish he had just made his position clear, as the
Prime Minister has, during his speech, which is that we do not agree
with the perception that the media is controlled by the Government.
It is all right for Mr Singh to disagree, but because he has not
been willing to make known where he stands, I really do not know
what to make of his proposals.</p>

the public on issues which are divisive. And by this, I mean not
just race and religion but, increasingly, issues pertaining to our

Minister George Yeo's encounter with a Catholic priest and Minister
Khaw Boon Wan's recent interactions with the Chief Monk of Bhutan.
And it reminded me of a story I first read about 12 years ago. It
is titled "The Rabbi's Gift". And I seek the Deputy Speaker's permission
to share the story.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-2f6c13bc-a59f-45ba-a37c-bf70cc544566"><!--a--></a>The story concerns a monastery
that had fallen upon hard times. Once a great order, as a result
of waves of anti-monastic persecution in the 17th and 18th centuries
and the rise of secularism in the 19th, all its branch houses were
lost and it had become decimated to the extent that there were only
five monks left in the decaying mother house – that were the abbot
and four others, all over seventy in age. Clearly, it was a dying
order.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e6a62c5f-f8d2-4eea-9de2-e21bf8397a29">
                  <a name="president-address__id-e6a62c5f-f8d2-4eea-9de2-e21bf8397a29"><!--a--></a>In the deep woods surrounding
the monastery, there was a little hut that a rabbi from a nearby
town occasionally used for a hermitage. Through their many years
of prayer and contemplation, the old monks had become a little bit
psychic, so they could always sense when the rabbi was in his hermitage.
As he agonised over the imminent death of his order, it occurred
to the abbot at one such time to visit the hermitage and ask the rabbi
if, by some possible chance, he could offer any advice that might
save the monastery.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb44a0e1-824f-43bd-9963-17e5c9499ac1">

at his hut. But when the abbot explained the purpose of his visit,
the rabbi could only commiserate with him. "I know how it is," he
exclaimed. "The spirit has gone out of the people. It is the same
in my town. Almost no one comes to the synagogue anymore." So, the
old abbot and the old rabbi wept together. Then they read parts
of the Torah and quietly spoke of deep things. The time came when
the abbot had to leave. They embraced each other. "It has been a
wonderful thing that we should meet after all these years", the
abbot said, "but I have still failed in my purpose for coming here.
Is there nothing you can tell me, no piece of advice you can give
me that would help me save my dying order?"</p>

responded. "I have no advice to give you. The only thing I can tell
you is that the Messiah is one of you." When the abbot returned
to the monastery his fellow monks gathered around him to ask, "Well,
what did the rabbi say?" "He couldn't help," the abbot answered.
"We just wept and read the Torah together. The only thing he did
say, just as I was leaving – it was something cryptic – was that
the Messiah is one of us. I don't know what he meant."</p>

months that followed, the old monks pondered this and wondered whether
there was any possible significance to the rabbi's words. The Messiah
is one of us? Could he possibly have meant one of us monks here
at the monastery? If that is the case, which one? Do you suppose
he meant the abbot? Yes, if he meant anyone, he probably meant Father
Abbot. He has been our leader for more than a generation. On the
other hand, he might have meant Brother Thomas. Certainly, Brother
Thomas is a holy man. Everyone knows that Thomas is a man of light.</p>

have meant Brother Elred! Elred gets crotchety at times. But come
to think of it, even though he is a thorn in people's sides, when
you look back on it, Elred is virtually always right. Maybe, the
rabbi did mean Brother Elred. But surely not Brother Phillip. Phillip
is so passive –</p>

this manner, the old monks began to treat each other with extraordinary
respect on the off chance that one among them might be the Messiah.
And on the off, off chance that each monk himself might be the Messiah,
they began to treat themselves with extraordinary respect. Because
the forest in which it was situated was beautiful, it so happened
that people still occasionally came to visit the monastery.</p>

even being conscious of it, they sensed the aura of extraordinary
respect that now began to surround the five old monks that seemed
to radiate out of them and permeate the atmosphere of the place.
There was something strangely attractive, even compelling, about
it. Hardly knowing why, they began to come back to the monastery
more frequently to picnic, to play, to pray. They began to bring their
friends to show them this special place. And their friends brought
their friends. Then it happened some of the younger men who came
to visit the monastery started to talk more and more with the old
monks. After a while, one asked if he could join them and then another
and another. So, within a few years, the monastery had once again become
a thriving order and thanks to the rabbi's gift, a vibrant centre
of light and spirituality in the realm.</p>

I love the story. I am sorry Mr Low does not. For one thing, I love
the difference we can make when we start to treat one another with,
as the Prime Minister
says, grace, courtesy, respect, regardless of our station in life.
I wish we do this all the time – with cleaners, security guards,
bus drivers, hawkers, foreign construction workers. Can you imagine
what a powerful force we can be if Singapore were exceptional in
this way?</p>

the imagery of revival, of spiritual uplift. It never fails to give me
a high. Most of all perhaps I love what the story suggests about
accountability. The rabbi had no solution. All he did was to change
the standard by which each monk benchmarked himself – to that of
the Messiah! You see, the real difference we make is not when we
hold other people accountable. That is too easy. It is not even
when we hold each other accountable. The highest order of accountability
is that we hold ourselves to. It is when we hold ourselves accountable
to the highest standards of civility, honesty, integrity, good faith,
good sense, that we have the best potential of changing the world.</p>

We now have the duty of living up to voters' high expectations.
At the same time, we have the privilege of setting new political

us in shaping a political culture we can all be proud of. If the

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is currently studying a proposal
to legislate weekly "off-days" or "rest days" for foreign domestic workers
(FDWs), with compensation in-lieu should the FDW and employer mutually agree
that the rest day be foregone. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-949a8fe5-6a8a-4b66-a28b-0a317e5de9cf">

the well-being of FDWs in Singapore. FDWs are currently protected
under a comprehensive piece of employment legislation called the Employment
of Foreign Manpower Act, which prescribes that FDWs must receive adequate
rest. Employers who fail to comply with this requirement can be
fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed up to six months. They will also
be barred from hiring another FDW. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4f85943b-a3f6-4c9f-8e2c-4e73193aeb56">

was introduced by the employment agency accreditation bodies – Association
of Employment Agents (Singapore) and CaseTrust – requiring employers
to stipulate the pay and number of rest days per month for FDWs.
This contract continues to be the market standard for employment
contracts between employers and FDWs, and requires at least one
day per month to be stipulated. Should the FDWs consent to work
during their rest days, employers are required to pay their FDWs
a mutually agreed amount of compensation. </p>

minimum standard by mandating a weekly rest day for FDWs attracts
diverse views and requires careful consideration. FDWs, like other
workers, need enough time to rest and relax. Recent interviews with
over 900 FDWs indicated that a large majority felt they had adequate
rest each day. However, only a minority had a weekly rest day. </p>

employers cite family circumstances that make it genuinely difficult
to cope without an FDW. A large number of employers have also expressed concern
about FDWs' activities on their day off. </p>

consulting all stakeholders, including employers, domestic workers,
employment agencies and non-governmental organisations on this issue.
This includes prescribing the amount of compensation that should
be given in-lieu of the rest day and allowing FDWs and employers
the flexibility to mutually agree which day of the week the rest
day should fall on. </p>

Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>
                  </span>: All employment agencies (EAs),
including those that place foreign domestic workers (FDWs), are
currently regulated and licensed under the Employment Agencies Act
(EAA). Following the conclusion of a review of the EAA early this
year, an enhanced EA regulatory framework has been put in place
since 1 April 2011.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9b2ef863-1365-4b5c-b5f2-e63a04eb4bb4">

a Comprehensive Licence under the EA licensing framework and are
subject to more stringent requirements. For example, EAs that have consistently
high placement volume of FDWs have to furnish a security deposit
amount of at least $40,000 and up to $60,000. In addition, all EA
personnel need to attain a Certificate of Employment Intermediaries
(CEI) in order to conduct EA work. EA personnel that place FDWs
have to attain the version of CEI which covers the relevant legislation
and regulations, in particular the Employment of Foreign Manpower
Act that spells out the rights and obligations of FDWs and FDW employers. </p>

there is also a specific section dedicated to the obligations of
EAs in the placement of FDWs. It requires, <em class="ph i">inter alia</em>, the
provision of acceptable food and accommodation prior to the issuance
of Work Permits, as FDWs need to pass all the entry requirements
before they can be deployed. EAs are also obliged to furnish prospective
FDW employers with the employment history of FDWs. This ensures
employers are able to make an informed decision when choosing which FDW
to hire.</p>

more informed decisions when selecting an EA, the EA Directory hosted
on MOM's website has been revamped since 1 January 2011 to include useful
indicators for FDW employers. For example, the directory displays
each EA's success rate in placing FDWs who stay with their employers
for a year or more as well as the FDW Entry Test passing rate of
the FDWs brought in.</p>

The Government takes the public's concern with .xxx sites seriously.
The Media Development Authority (MDA) adopts a multi-faceted approach
to addressing harmful online content through regulation, industry
efforts and public education. All local websites are automatically
licensed under MDA's Class Licence Scheme and are required to abide
by the Internet Code of Practice. Local sites which are found to be in breach of class
licence conditions or the Internet Code of Practice would be issued
with a take-down notice. </p>

action against any .xxx site with objectionable content hosted in
Singapore. For sites hosted overseas, blocking is not an effective
solution, given the vast numbers of undesirable sites in a dynamic
online environment and the numerous ways to bypass blocks.</p>

or "opt-in" option with regard to .xxx sites. Instead, MDA is requiring
ISPs to promote Internet filters at the point of sale and upon the renewal
of contracts to subscribers. Parents or subscribers can opt to subscribe
to filters offered by the ISPs to block undesirable sites such as
.xxx sites. Alternatively, anyone could install free Internet filters
such as Norton Online Family and Windows Live Family Safety. I would
like to encourage parents to do so to protect their young ones from harmful
content on the Internet.</p>

promoted actively by the Inter-Ministry Cyber Wellness Steering
Committee (ICSC). This committee, co-chaired by MICA and MOE, was
formed in 2009 to coordinate the Government's promotion of cyberwellness
through working with public- and private-sector organisations. Through
the ICSC, the Government has funded 17 projects, including the Cyber
Wellness Campaign, to encourage the positive use of the Internet
and mobile technologies among Singapore's youths. Other projects include
cyberwellness camps and counselling services.</p>

number of older private residences built prior to the introduction
of the Code of Practice which are located on high ground and do
not have a water tank. Over time, as new developments gradually
increase the overall water demand in the area, these older premises
could experience intermittent lower water pressure during peak usage
hours. PUB monitors these areas closely and when such a situation
occurs, PUB has boosted the water pressure to the area. For example,
in the Tai Keng residential area, PUB has increased the water pressure
to ensure residents continue to have adequate water pressure throughout
the day.</p>
