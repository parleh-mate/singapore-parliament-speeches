<div align="center"><b>MESSAGES FROM THE OFFICER ADMINISTERING THE GOVERNMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(O.A.G's Assent to Bills passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received two messages from the

Officer  Administering the Government  in  connection

with Bills



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



which have been passed by the Assembly. The first  is

dated 10th April, 1956:



<br><br>"Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the honour to inform you that in accordance

with  the  provisions  of  Section  62  (2)  of   the

Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1955, I have  this

day assented to the Bills intituled: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) An Ordinance to amend the Registration of Births

and Deaths Ordinance, 1937 (No. 34 of 1937).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) An Ordinance to establish a licensing

authority for omnibus services.



<div align="right">I have the honour to be,</div>

<div align="right">Sir,</div>

<div align="right">Your obedient servant,</div>

<div align="right">W. A. C. GOODE,</div>

<div align="right">Officer Administering  the Government."</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second message is dated 16th May, 1956:



<br><br>"Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to your S/LA 6/55 Pt. II (28) of 27th

March,  1956, I have the honour to inform  you  that,

having received instructions from Her Majesty through

the  Secretary of State authorising me so  to  do,  I

have  this  day assented to the Bill, passed  by  the

Legislative Assembly at its meeting on the 7th March,

1956  intituled: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Ordinance to make provision for the winding up of the War Damage Fund".

<div align="right">Sir,</div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>RICE PRICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and

Industry whether he is aware that the average  retail

selling  price of rice has been higher in the current

year  than was the case in 1955; and whether he  will

state the reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the hon. Member appears to

have been misinformed. Reliable figures are available

in my Ministry as from 1st April, 1955, and according

to these figures, the average retail selling price of

rice per katty this year was cheaper by one cent than

it was for the last 9 months of 1955. The second part

of the question, therefore, does not arise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware

that the rise in prices appears on page 54 of Malayan

Statistics,  No.  4  of 1956,  prepared  by  his  own

Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, in drafting my reply, I

have  not  consulted the statistics. Did I  hear  the

Member say 1954?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> No. 4 of 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The figures that I quote from

are reliable and are compiled in my own Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>HOUSING UNITS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing whether  he  is  aware

that the Singapore Improvement Trust has planned  the

completion  (a) of less housing units  in  1956  than

were  completed in 1955 and (b) of a lower percentage

of  housing units carrying rentals of not  more  than

$30   p.m.;   and   whether   this   represents   the

Government's policy in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  year  the Trust built a total of 2,795  housing

units.  This  year the Trust expects  to  complete  a

total  of 2,272 units, although the original estimate

for  the completion was 3,158 units. The reasons  for

this drop are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The delay in the clearance of squatters from Queenstown during the last 24 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Delay in squatter clearance as well as main

drainage  and  sewerage  difficulties  at  another

building site at Macpherson Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Difficulty in the recruitment of technical

staff,  particularly architects and engineers,  which

has prevented adequate advanced planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearance of squatters in Queenstown is now

making   satisfactory  headway,  and  the   technical

staffing position has improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question (b), the Trust in

its  building programme this year has planned a lower

percentage of semi-permanent houses carrying  rentals

of less than $30 per month.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



Government's  policy is to make cheap and  economical

housing  available  to as many of  the  lower  income

group  as  possible.  There are two  types  of  cheap

housing  being  built  by the  Singapore  Improvement

Trust at present, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Low-cost housing built to the minimum standards

required  and  to  be  let  at  monthly  rentals  not

exceeding  $50  for two-bedroom units,  and  $55  per

month for three-bedroom units. These houses, with  an

expected  life  of between 80 and 100 years,  may  be

classed as permanent buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Low-rental housing built not quite up to the

minimum  standards required and to be let at  monthly

rentals  ranging  between $20 and $30.  These  houses

have  a  shorter term of life - about 40 years - and  are

classed as semi-permanent buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter type of housing, that is to say, low-rental housing, which is the subject of the Member's

second  part  of  the question, is not  suitable  for

erection  on valuable sites in urban areas as  it  is

uneconomical in land, building and maintenance costs,

and accordingly has been recommended for erection  in

suburban  and rural areas. The Singapore  Improvement

Trust is, in fact, proceeding with a scheme this year

for  the  construction  of 200 low-rental  houses  at

Bukit  Panjang  as part of a pilot rural  development

project. The greater part of the Trust's construction

activity  this year has been planned for urban  areas

where  the  building  of  low-cost  housing  of   the

permanent  type  has  been  recommended,   and   this

explains why fewer low-rental houses are being  built

this year.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYANISATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Public Service)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> If it

please  you,  Sir,  as  you are  aware,  I  shall  be

tendering my resignation as Chief Minister at the end

of   this   sitting,  and  in  accordance  with   constitutional procedure all my appointed Ministers will

be resigning with me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, Sir, the view of your appointed

Ministers  that  it is possible and  desirable,  both

politically  and  administratively, to  proceed  with

Malayanisation    irrespective    of    the    recent

constitutional  setback and the impending  change  of

government.  I  have  to  inform  you  that  we  have

requested  that an approach be made to the  Secretary

of State and to the Staff Associations concerned with

a view to the earliest possible implementation of the

following recommendations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Appointment of a Malayan Director of Personnel;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Appointment of a Malayan Permanent Secretary - designate to the Treasury;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Appointment of a Public Service Commission with

executive  powers and a directive to  take  into

consideration   the   recommendations   of   the

Malayanisation Commission's Majority Report when it

considers appointments and promotions; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A scheme for full abolition terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your appointed Ministers, Sir, are of the view that

the   abolition   terms  should  provide   for   full

compensation to all expatriate officers, payable  not

later  than  the end of four years after  the  Public

Service   Commission  with  executive  powers   takes

office;  such  compensation to be  paid  if  officers

retire earlier with the consent of the Government. On

the  other  hand, if officers wish to  retire  within

this  four-year period, they are free out the consent

of  the  Government dur to do so but will then  only  be

entitled to half the abolition terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of your appointed Ministers, Sir, is

based   on   the  principle  that,  where  there   is

compulsory  termination of a career,  full  abolition

terms  should  be  given; but where there  is  merely

interference  of  the  career without  depriving  the

officer  of his livelihood, then he should await  the

end  of  the four years or earlier agreed termination

before receiving full compensation, but if he insists

on  retiring earlier, half the abolition terms  would

be generous compensation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



for  the disturbance and departure from some  of  the

existing service principles affecting expatriates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason, Sir, for the provision of half and not

full  abolition  terms  on  voluntary  retirement  is

intended to ensure that Malayanisation is carried out

in a planned and efficient manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your appointed Ministers, I must add, Sir, do not

accept  the  principle of a standstill for promotions

of  expatriates as recommended by the Majority Report

but seek in place thereof promotion to grades and not

to  posts,  so that expatriate officers' remuneration

and  ultimate abolition quantum are not prejudicially

affected,  though  this  would  mean  a  considerable

additional burden on the country's finances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

although  this may be a matter out of the  competence

of the present Chief Minister, does he not agree that

this  is a subject which should be debated on a White

Paper  rather  than  on  a  statement  by  the  Chief

Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I am informing the Assembly

of  the  approach of the appointed Ministers to  this

problem.  When  a decision is finally arrived  at  in

conjunction  with the Secretary of State,  who  holds

the  whip hand, then the matter will be presented  to

this  Assembly for its own confirmation or  otherwise

of the decision.

<div align="center"><b>RUBBER EXPORTS TO CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Commerce and Industry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, hon. Members will no doubt have read

with  pleasure the announcement I made on Monday that

exports of rubber in reasonable quantities may now be

permitted  to China. The embargo on such exports  has

been  a source of great dissatisfaction to the trade.

Therefore, in accordance with the declared policy  of

this Government to do everything within its power  to

encourage  and  expand trade, strong  representations

were made to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  of State for the Colonies for the  removal

of the ban. I am sure that the favourable reaction of

Her  Majesty's Government to our representations  and

those of the Federation Government in permitting such

exports  now  will be received with gratification  by

hon. Members and by the trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain doubts have been expressed, Sir, in the last

two  days  as  to  the precise meaning  of  the  term

"reasonable quantities". This is a matter on which my

Ministry would have to use their judgment, and  where

they  are  in doubt, they will use their judgment  in

consultation with the Colonial Office. The number  of

applications,  total quantity applied  for,  and  the

actual demand from China would be some of the factors

that  we  shall  take into consideration.  Individual

applications for, say, up to 2,000 tons will be dealt

with  straightaway in my Ministry,  each  application

being  judged on its merits. Applications for  larger

quantities would be referred to the Colonial  Office.

I  may  add, Sir, that there is no need for the trade

to  take  an  unduly pessimistic viewpoint  that  our

discretion will be exercised harshly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Sir. Hon. Members will recollect a

statement  made by my friend and colleague  the  Hon.

the  Chief Minister a few months back that, while  in

Delhi in December last, together with him, I took  up

the  matter of according preferential treatment,  for

duty  purposes,  to  some commodities  exported  from

Singapore  to  India  which,  until  now,  were   not

enjoying  such  treatment.  In  accordance  with  the

declared  policy of this Government to  assist  trade

and   to   develop   friendly  relations   with   our

neighbours,  I  again  took the opportunity  to  make

personal representations on this subject to the  Hon.

the  Minister for Commerce of the Government of India

when  I  was  in  Bangalore attending the  E.C.A.F.E.

conference  last  January.  As  a  result  of   these

representations,  hon. Members  will  be  pleased  to

learn  that  the Government of India have  been  kind

enough to see our viewpoint, and the difficulties  of

our  merchants on this score have been satisfactorily

solved.

<div align="center"><b>CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  lay upon the Table a Certificate of Urgency signed

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

the First Reading of the Bill intituled "An Ordinance

to   amend  the  City  Council  Elections  (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance, 1955 (No. 21 of 1955)".

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that the tenure of office of City

Councillors, both elected and nominated, who were due

to  retire  on  the 1st of December, 1955,  has  been

extended to the 1st of July, 1956. As it will not  be

possible  for  the new local government  legislation,

based on the recommendation of the Committee on Local

Government, to be in force by 1st July, 1956, it will

be  necessary to further extend the tenure of  office

of   the   City  Councillors,  elected  as  well   as

nominated, beyond 1st July, 1956. The purpose of this

short  and  straightforward Bill  is  to  enable  the

present  City  Council to continue in existence  till

December 1956. Sir, I beg to move.

"That the Bill be now read the Third time."

<div align="center"><b>HOTELS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is another short and simple Bill. Its

main  object  is  to  cure a  defect  in  the  Hotels

Ordinance, 1954. That defect is that under section  1

of the Ordinance the whole of the Ordinance has to be

brought  into  force  at one time  on  one  day.  The

Ordinance  and  the regulations made  under  it  will

provide   for   the  registration   of   hotels   and

hotelkeepers  and will lay down certain standards  to

be  complied with by hotels, and it is clearly  right

that the regulations requiring acts to be done should

be brought into force a reasonable period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>



before  failure  to carry out those acts  becomes  an

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 2 of this Bill is to enable

some  sections to be brought into force earlier  than

others,  thus  making it possible to  give  time  for

hotelkeepers  to comply with the Ordinance  and  the

regulations made thereunder before they become liable

to penalties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to transfer the

power  of making appointments to the Hotels Licensing

Board  from the Governor to the Governor in  Council.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Singapore Harbour Board, under

subsection  (1) of section 23 of the Ports Ordinance,

is   vested  with  certain  powers  of  appointments,

promotions,  disciplinary control and  the  grant  of

leave  without the previous approval of the Board  in

respect  of officers whose monthly basic salary  does

not exceed $435.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in agreement with the Staff Association,

the Harbour Board has revised the salary structure of

its  staff and this revision has affected the  powers

of  the  Chairman, as a number of officers, who  were

prior  to  this  revision drawing salaries  of  below

$435, are now drawing a basic monthly salary of above

this  figure - up to $465. It is desirable,  therefore,

that  the  status  quo  of  the  Chairman  should  be

restored  in this respect, and to achieve  this,  the

Ports Ordinance requires an amendment by substituting

the  figure  $465  for the figure $435  appearing  in

section 23 (1). Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, His Excellency the Governor has signified his

consent to this Bill being proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Magna Carta, Sir, is laid down the principle

on  which the case for legal aid might be based,  and

down  through  the ages has come this guiding  tenet:

"To  no man will we deny, to no man will we sell,  or

delay justice or right." It follows that all citizens

should  enjoy equality before the law and that  there

should be no necessity for a golden key to unlock the

door  to the courtroom. The ideal of fairness to rich

and poor alike means that no man should suffer in the

prosecution or defence of his legal rights  for  want

of   professional   assistance  and   advice.   Where

inadequate facilities exist for a citizen of  limited

means  to seek redress through the Courts for a wrong

which  has  been done to him, or to obtain legal  aid

for  his defence when he is committed for trial, then

justice  becomes  a  rationed  commodity  not  freely

available to all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficacy, Sir, and success of any judicial

system  is  dependent on three factors: firstly,  the

Courts  of  the country must be impartial;  secondly,

the  laws  which  they administer must  be  fair  and

reasonable; and, thirdly, the Courts must  be  freely

accessible  to  all. As regards the first  condition,

Sir,  there is not the slightest doubt as to the high

standards of impartiality attained by our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



Courts.  In  so  far  as  the  second  condition   is

concerned, it can safely be said that we have no laws

which  discriminate between one individual  or  class

and  another.  It  is  the last requirement,  namely,

accessibility,    which    requires    our    careful

examination.  It is of little comfort to  the  poorer

citizen  that  the laws of his country are  fair  and

just  and  that  the  Courts  are  impartial  if,  in

practice,  he is debarred from access to  the  Courts

through lack of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the indigent person's accessibility

to the Courts has been differently handled in various

countries.  England  and  Wales,  Australia,  certain

European  countries and a number of States  in  South

and  Central  America, have statutory  provision  for

legal  aid.  In  the  United States,  Sir,  organised

private activity has been very marked in some States,

such  as Massachusetts. In that State, although there

is  no statutory provision in respect of legal aid in

its  ordinary  civil Courts, the city of  Boston  can

none  the  less boast of one of the finest legal  aid

societies in the world and the poor of that city  can

be  said to have their legal rights well safeguarded.

In  other countries, with small centres of population

and  where  lawyers  have general  practices,  fairly

effective  rotation on a charitable  basis  has  been

worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last decade, however, there has been

greater  reliance placed on legislative measures  for

the   provision  of  legal  aid,  for,  with  notable

exceptions,  experience has shown that,  in  general,

private  effort cannot promise continuity or  provide

the  wider  scope that a State can make available  to

its  people by way of legislation. Although there has

been  diversity of approach in the matter of granting

legal aid, the problems that have had to be faced are

not  dissimilar, for exactly the same  administrative

and  judicial  difficulties have  arisen  wherever  a

system of legal aid has been proposed. Thus, there is

the  important problem of selection. A means test has

to be devised so that the financially undeserving are

precluded   from   availing   themselves   of   legal

assistance at the expense of the State, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>

this  Bill  prescribes  such a  means  test.  Another

aspect  of  selection,  Sir,  is  that  people   with

baseless,  frivolous or vexatious claims or  defences

should be debarred from assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill now before the Assembly, it will be

observed  that  in criminal matters a  Judge  of  the

Supreme Court or District Court, as the case may  be,

is  required to certify that it is desirable, in  the

interests  of  justice,  that  legal  aid  should  be

provided  to  the  applicant. In civil  actions,  the

Director  of  Legal Aid is required to be  satisfied,

inter alia, that the applicant has reasonable grounds

for taking, defending, continuing or being a party to

any legal proceedings. With regard to criminal cases,

objection  has sometimes been raised that  where  the

public  defender is a public officer there  would  be

two  representatives of the State on  both  sides  of

criminal   proceedings.  This  would  be  a   serious

objection if the same department were responsible for

the  conduct  of  both prosecution and  defence.  The

legal aid organisation which the Bill envisages  will

not come under the Attorney-General's Ministry, which

will  continue to be responsible for the  conduct  of

prosecutions,  but it will be under an officer  known

as  the Director of Legal Aid, whose department would

be  quite  separate and distinct  from  that  of  the

Attorney-General's. Further, Sir, it must be  pointed

out  that  it should not be the object of  the  State

primarily to obtain convictions. The real aim of  any

judicial system is to arrive at the truth and to mete

out  justice. The Director of Legal Aid, by supplying

the  proper  balance, will assist in  achieving  this

aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us at this juncture, Sir, consider what legal

aid  facilities  now exist in Singapore.  Free  legal

representation  is available only in the  High  Court

and  in none of the lower Courts. A person may  apply

to  the High Court for legal aid in forma pauperis in

all  civil  matters  dealt with in  the  High  Court,

provided   that  he  is  not  possessed  of  property

(excluding wearing apparel and the subject matter  of

the  proceedings) exceeding $300 (or in some  special

circum-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>



stances $750) in value and the usual income from  all

sources of the applicant does not exceed $200 (or  in

special circumstances $300). In addition, free  legal

representation is provided where necessary to persons

charged  with  murder. In so far as legal  advice  is

concerned,  Sir,  a free service is provided  by  the

Department of Social Welfare. This is a purely advice

service and no representation in Court is provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will therefore be seen that the present system of

legal  assistance to poor persons is  altogether  too

limited to do more than touch the fringe of the need.

The  need for an improved legal aid service  is  long

overdue   and  the  Marshall  Government   can   take

justifiable  pride in introducing  this  much  needed

social  legislation. The Bill now under consideration

indicates  the  lines  along  which  we  might   well

proceed.  There may perhaps be need for modifications

or amendments as a result of experience gained over a

period,  but as to the general proposition  that  the

time  is  long overdue for a comprehensive legal  aid

service, there can be little disagreement. Much  work

and  thought has gone into the drafting of the  Bill.

An  officer  of  the  Colonial  Legal  Service  spent

several  weeks  in the Public Solicitor's  Office  in

Sydney,  New  South Wales, studying the  legislation,

practice and procedure there, and, in the main,  this

Bill,  based on his recommendations, is an adaptation

to  local  conditions of the New  South  Wales  Legal

Assistance Act, 1943-1947.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be amiss if, at this stage, I were

briefly to outline the main provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, Sir, provides for the appointment of the

Director  of Legal Aid, one or more Deputy  Directors

and  such number of Assistant Directors as is thought

necessary.  All persons so appointed are required  to

be  qualified  persons who will  have  the  right  of

appearance in all Courts in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 4, it is anticipated that the

Director of Legal Aid and his assistants will not  be

in  a position to deal with the volume of cases which

flow into his office. Provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>



has therefore been made in this clause for panels  of

solicitors willing to investigate, report and give an

opinion upon applications for the grant of legal  aid

and  to  act  for persons receiving legal  aid.  Such

solicitors  would be entitled to fees agreed  between

themselves and the Director. I would add,  Sir,  that

the  success of this scheme depends a great  deal  on

the  co-operation  of the Bar. Wherever  there  is  a

scheme  for legal aid, there is bound to be  a  close

relationship  between the legal aid organisation  and

members  of  the  Bar  in  that  territory,  both  as

individual advocates and as a collective body. It  is

of   importance  to  the  cause  of  legal  aid  that

solicitors in private practice respond to  the  call.

The profession has an ethical interest in seeing that

no poor person suffers injustice through inability to

obtain legal assistance or advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill, Sir, makes provision for legal

aid in criminal cases in the Supreme Court and in the

District  Courts but not in the Magistrates'  Courts,

for the expense would be considerable if legal aid in

criminal  matters  were extended to the  Magistrates'

Courts.  Provision  is made for legal  representation

for   criminal  appeals  in  respect  of  any  person

convicted in the District Court who wishes to  appeal

to  the  High  Court  and in respect  of  any  person

convicted in the High Court who desires to appeal  to

the  Court of Criminal Appeal. No specific means test

is  laid down in respect of legal aid under this Part

of  the Bill beyond the general requirement that such

assistance   should  be  extended  only  to   persons

"without   adequate  means".  It  is  not  considered

desirable  or necessary where a person's liberty  may

be  at  stake to have the rigid means test  that  has

been  devised  for  legal aid in civil  actions.  The

Judge  is,  however, required to certify that  it  is

desirable in the interests of justice that legal  aid

should be provided in any particular case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III. Sir, provides for legal representation in

civil  actions  in  the Supreme  Court  and  District

Courts, and in the Magistrates' Courts in maintenance

cases under the Married Women and Children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>



(Maintenance) Ordinance, 1949. While legal aid is not

extended to the Magistrates' Courts, an exception  is

made  in respect of maintenance cases in those Courts

as there is a very real need for legal representation

in  certain  at least of the cases where wives  claim

maintenance  from their husbands for  themselves  and

for  their  children  or where  claims  are  made  in

respect   of  illegitimate  children.  Questions   of

marriage  or paternity may be relevant and are  often

difficult  to  prove. The present  position  is  that

husbands  frequently have solicitors  whom  they  can

better  afford  to retain appearing on their  behalf,

while  wives invariably attempt to conduct their  own

cases,  much to their disadvantage. Under  the  Bill,

legal  aid  will, of course, be available  to  either

party  in  maintenance proceedings. There  is  little

doubt, Sir, that more wives than husbands will  avail

themselves of this service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made reference, Sir, earlier to the problem

of  selection  in accordance with the  means  of  the

applicant. It is never very easy to devise a fair and

equitable  means test when the Government provides  a

free service of any sort, but after much thought,  we

have, I think, devised a satisfactory means test.  In

order  to be eligible for legal aid in civil actions,

the  applicant should not be possessed of or entitled

to   disposable  capital  exceeding  $500   and   his

disposable income should not exceed $1,000 per annum,

though the Director has discretionary power to  grant

legal aid where the applicant's disposable capital is

between $500 and $3,500 and his disposable income  is

between  $1,000  and  $3,000,  in  which  event   the

Director  may require a contribution (the details  of

which  are  set  out  in clause 14)  from  the  aided

person.   The   terms   "disposable   capital"    and

"disposable income" are defined at clause 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 stipulates that where legal aid is granted

to  more  than  one  party in civil proceedings,  the

Director  of Legal Aid is prohibited from acting  for

either party but shall assign solicitors to act  from

the panel.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a legal aid certificate is obtained by fraud

or  misrepresentation or where an  aided  person  has

acted  improperly in bringing or defending any  legal

proceedings  or  in the conduct of  them,  clause  19

provides  that  in  such event  such  person  may  be

ordered  by  the Court or Judge to pay the  costs  of

both  the Director or of the solicitor who acted  for

him, or the costs of the other party, or the costs of

both the Director or such solicitor and such party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general position with regard to costs is

detailed   at  clause  21.  The  expression   "costs"

includes  counsel's fees. The Court  is  required  to

make in favour of the aided person the like order for

costs as it would have made had the aided person been

unaided  except,  of  course, against  another  aided

person.  The aided person is liable to pay  costs  to

the  Director in certain specified circumstances.  It

may  be objected that the Bill makes no provision for

the payment of costs to a successful non-aided party,

but  in  view  of the expense this would involve,  no

other  solution appears possible. Two points  should,

however,  be borne in mind. Firstly, the Director  is

most unlikely to act other than with a full sense  of

responsibility  and there would  be  no  question  of

legal aid being granted except in proper cases;  and,

secondly,   there  is  some  measure   of   safeguard

contained  in  clause 19 which enables  costs  to  be

recovered   from  an  aided  person  who  has   acted

improperly  in  bringing  or  defending   any   legal

proceedings or in the conduct of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV deals with the subject of legal advice which

is  made available to persons resident and present in

Singapore.  No specific means test is laid  down  for

legal  advice but an applicant is required to satisfy

the  Director that "he cannot afford to obtain it  in

the ordinary way". This, Sir, is also the language of

the  English Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, for,  in

respect  of  legal advice, it is felt  that  no  more

rigid  test than this should be prescribed. Provision

is  made for payment to the Director of a nominal fee

of  $1  (or such other fee as may be prescribed)  for

such advice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject, Sir, of legal advice, it must be

pointed  out  that while injustice  may  arise  as  a

result  of a poor man being unable to contest a  case

in  Court, he may also be at a disadvantage  when  he

wishes  to  ascertain his legal position  and  obtain

advice and assistance short of Court proceedings. The

provision of facilities for legal advice is  one  way

of  removing  any  sense of grievance  and  injustice

which may rankle in the mind of a person who, because

of his limited means, is unable to ascertain what his

rights  are, and it may be argued, Sir,  that  it  is

perhaps a good thing to condition the citizen  to  be

as  mindful of the legal pitfalls which may  confront

him as he is of his physical well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, as a whole is arranged in five Parts

and provision is made in clause 1 for the Governor to

appoint different dates for the coming into force  of

the different Parts or provisions therein. This would

enable  the legal aid organisation to start  modestly

and  to  expand  as the need arises.  It  would  also

enable  us to control costs. As has been pointed  out

in  the  explanatory note to the  Bill,  an  accurate

estimate  of  the costs of operating  the  legal  aid

scheme  is  not  possible, and  if,  in  the  initial

stages,  the  provision of legal aid  is  limited  to

proceedings in the High Court, the costs  are  likely

to  be in the vicinity of $280,000 per annum. This is

as near an estimate as can be made at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bar Committee raised objection to the

powers conferred on the Minister by clause 28 to make

regulations, and stated that such regulations as  are

intended to be made should be read together with  the

Bill  so  that all concerned may have the opportunity

of  considering and, if necessary, criticising  them.

Preparation  of these regulations, Sir, has  not  yet

been  completed,  but  the Bar  Committee  have  been

assured  that  they  will  be  consulted  before  any

regulations are made. Moreover, under subclause  (5)

of  clause  28,  all such regulations  must  be  laid

before this Assembly and hon. Members can, if they so

wish,   move   a   resolution  annulling   any   such

regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to quote an extract

from  the  introduction  to  Regional  Heber  Smith's

"Justice  and the Poor" wherein this passage  occurs:

"The  very existence of free government depends  upon

making the machinery of justice so effective that the

citizens  of  a  democracy  shall  believe   in   its

impartiality  and  fairness." This measure,  Sir,  by

making  the Courts accessible to the indigent person,

by  affording him skilled defence where necessary and

by giving him legal advice where he is in doubt as to

his  legal rights, will, it is hoped, put an  end  to

that oft-repeated jest: "The Courts of law, like  the

Ritz Hotel, are open to the rich and poor alike!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, I am

proud  to have the privilege of seconding the  motion

for  the Second Reading of this Bill. The institution

of   justice  is  one  thing  for  which  we  can  be

unreservedly thankful to the colonial power,  but  it

has  one drawback, and that is that, in some measure,

the  poor  people of the country have no  opportunity

either to understand their powers under it or to have

full access to it; and as long ago as before the war,

Sir,  in  1939, I sought to obtain the assistance  of

the Bar at its annual meeting to propound some scheme

for free legal aid. A few years ago, Sir, in order to

shut   me   up,  they  appointed  me  as  a   one-man

committee - and duly rejected my report! I am therefore

very  happy  to be in a position today to assist,  in

some  measure,  in making possible a  social  service

which   I  consider  essential  in  every  democratic

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have heard that this Bill is based to a

large extent on the provisions of the New South Wales

Legal  Assistance Act. Sir, the late Attorney-General

of New South Wales, Mr Martin, was good enough, when

I was in Sydney many, many years ago, to give me real

assistance in understanding their system, and I  must

confess that I have acquired a very great respect for

the  way in which the people of New South Wales  look

after those who are too poor, either for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



purposes  of  defence  or for  purposes  of  bringing

action,  to  obtain legal assistance.  Therefore,  as

soon  as my Government took office, we sent,  as  you

have  heard my colleague the Minister for Labour  and

Welfare say, the Registrar of the Supreme Court,  Mr

Tan Thoon Lip, to study this system and on his advice

and  recommendations, and with his assistance, we now

present  a  Bill to you which we hope will remedy  an

unhappy feature of our legal institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be churlish of me not to recognise the

assistance that the Bar has, in fact, given by way of

free  legal aid to poor persons in the past; but that

has been very, very limited in character, and I would

also  like to pay public thanks to 25 members of  the

Bar  who  voluntarily put themselves on  my  list  in

order  to assist those who sought free legal  aid  at

the Meet-the-public-sessions. That again, Sir, is not

fully  adequate to meet the needs of the country  and

but for the fact that the clan associations have done

immense  good  in the past in arbitration,  we  would

have had an outcry for free legal aid much earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is, I understand, to be a suggestion that

this  Bill be committed to a Select Committee. Now  I

wish  the House to know that for months we have  been

in touch with the Bar Committee. We have received and

given  serious consideration to their views  and,  in

fact,  have  incorporated some of them  in  the  Bill

before  you,  but no amount of further  consideration

would  convince  us  that the remaining  points  with

which  we  are  at  variance  should,  in  fact,   be

accepted.  There  is, however, one far  more  serious

reason  why  this  Bill should not  go  to  a  Select

Committee.  You will notice, Sir, that  we  have  not

presented  any  Bills  today for  First  Reading  for

subsequent attention, because we recognise that, as a

result  of the constitutional changes which  will  be

taking  place tomorrow, there will, in any event,  be

one  of  two  courses  taken by  His  Excellency  the

Governor. He will either prorogue this session or  he

will dissolve the Assembly. Sir, in either case, even

in the case of prorogation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>



all  unfinished business before the House will  cease

to  exist. Therefore, any motion to commit this  Bill

to  a  Select Committee is a motion to kill it.  This

Bill  seeks to help the poor of the country  to  some

measure  of  assistance from the  Bar  and  from  the

Government   where   they   need   assistance;    and

particularly  assistance  is  needed   when   it   is

recognised  that  the large mass  of  the  people  of

Singapore  are not literate in the English  language,

and  consequently do not know their rights under  our

system  of  justice. I therefore ask hon. Members  to

bear this in mind and to give their full support  for

a  measure in which I think we can all take pride. It

may  well be that it will require amendments  in  the

light of experience, but let us not kill an effort to

which  a  great deal of energy, thought and attention

has  been  given.  Sir, I do plead  for  the  general

assent of this House to this provision and that there

should  not  be,  in respect of a  matter  so  nearly

touching  the  welfare  of  the  people,  any   Party

approach.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Party

supports  the principle of this Bill. I do not  think

anybody  would seek to take away the credit which  is

owing  to  the  present Government and its  head  for

having  introduced this Bill. The only difficulty  is

this.  I am a member, Sir, of the Committee which  is

the  governing  body of advocates and  solicitors  in

this  Colony. As the Minister for Labour himself  has

said,  to  make  this  Bill  work  it  requires   the

unstinted co-operation of the profession. He has said

that  the profession has expressed certain doubts  as

to  the advisability of giving the Minister unlimited

powers  to  make regulations under clause 28  of  the

Bill.    He  also  knows  that  the  profession   has

expressed  certain  views as to the  advisability  of

making champerty by the Crown legal. It is one of the

basic principles of English law that anybody who aids

somebody else to institute proceedings where  he  has

no  interest is, in fact, committing a tort.  Now  we

are  going  to introduce by this Bill a principle  by

which  the  Crown,  or through its  organisation  the

Legal Aid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



Department, would be able to aid a litigant in either

prosecuting or defending a suit without having to  be

penalised  subsequently  in  costs.  That  raises   a

question of principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the point that the Chief Minister has

made,  that  if this Bill is committed  to  a  Select

Committee, then it lapses. I would ask the  mover  of

the   Second   Reading  of  this  Bill  to   consider

this - would it not be advisable to hold up the  coming

into  operation of this Bill, if it is  passed  today

through all its three stages, until such time as  the

profession has been fully consulted, has had time  to

consider  the full implications of it,  and  has  had

time  to make its views known to the Government?  But

politically we support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  welcome  this  Bill. As an  ordinary  layman  not

knowing much about the law and mixing up with  people

of  the  poorer  classes, I have always  come  across

cases of people who were wronged but who did not dare

to  take  up legal proceedings for fear of  incurring

payment  of costs if their cases should be  lost.  In

instances  like  this, I always feel  that,  although

there is justice in law on paper, in effect, in quite

a number of instances it is the money that counts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) about the Minister being empowered

to  make regulations as to the costs, I feel that the

legal  profession  has been doing very  well  indeed.

Certified accounts sometimes show that there might be

an  income of about $11,500 per month! It might  even

be  more! I think, if we are going to create a system

whereby  wealth  is  going  to  be  distributed  more

fairly,  such incomes should be scaled  down,  and  a

professional  man should earn, say, roughly  five  or

six  times as much as a labourer and no more. I think

that  is  the system that is prevailing in  societies

that have gone a long way towards socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In London, as far as I could learn from my first

visit, I think a professional man earns no more  than

this, and the system in Singapore should tend towards

that level. As a matter of good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



gesture - and  there  are  so  many  lawyers  in   this

House - it  should  be  good  to  start  with  oneself,

because  then it would really show sincerity  in  the

ideals  of creating a better social system. I  always

hate  the  idea of wanting to be generous with  other

people's money, but I will always welcome people  who

begin with themselves, especially when it is a matter

of  disadvantage to themselves. Sir,  I  welcome  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I feel that it is

as  important to know the law as it is to have access

to  the  Courts  of law. From my experience,  Sir,  I

believe  the  reason why there are so many  cases  in

Court  is  due  to the fact that many people  do  not

understand   the   law.  The  legal   advice   system

incorporated  in the Bill will be more effective  if,

by  an  administrative way, the legal aid  scheme  is

decentralised and more advisory centres  established,

particularly  in the rural areas. This  will  obviate

the   necessity  of  people  having  to  travel  long

distances  to the headquarters of the Social  Welfare

Department at Havelock Road. I hope and believe, Sir,

that   the  Minister  will  favourably  consider   my

suggestion of decentralising the Legal Aid Department

to reach the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, most of the benefits envisaged in

this  Bill will be brought to nought if there  is  no

corresponding decentralisation of the Courts of  this

Colony.  I  feel sure that the Government  will  also

consider the question of decentralising the Courts. I

am  aware  that in the past attempts have  been  made

towards this end, but I do not know what progress has

been  made.  Many  people in all parts  of  Singapore

island  do  visit  the Courts daily,  and  I  may  be

voicing the feelings of many people who have not  the

money  even to come to town to seek legal assistance.

I  do  hope.  Sir,  that in this  endeavour  the  Bar

Committee will be with the Government as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, in

reply  to the Member for Tanjong Pagar, when he spoke

as  the  leader of his Party and said that his  Party

supports the principle of this Bill, I wish to  thank

him.  The  hon. Member, Sir, has also expressed  some

misgivings as a member of the Bar Committee. I  would

like  to  assure  him  that he  need  not  have  such

misgivings because I have earlier stated in my speech

that  the Bar Committee will be consulted before  any

regulations are made, and, Sir, this Ordinance cannot

come  into  force until the regulations are  made.  I

Committee  will  be consulted before any  regulations

are made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Sir, representations have

been made to me that the intentions of the Government

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



connection  with  clause  9  are  ambiguous,  and   I

therefore seek clarification from the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary.   The  marginal  note  reads   "Compulsory

retirement",  whereas  the  phrasing  of  the  clause

states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be lawful for the Governor... to require any

officer to retire..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I to understand that this clause allows officers

at  present in service, who are willing, to  continue

in  Government service beyond the age of  55,  should

Government require their services? Furthermore,  does

this  clause  allow  an  officer  to  remain  on  the

establishment after the age of 55 without a break  in

his service?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do I take it that the hon. Member is

going to move an amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 9 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I am sorry there should appear to be a

contradiction  between  the  marginal  note  and  the

wording  of the clause. What this clause does  is  to

lay  down the circumstances in which it is lawful for

the Government to compel an officer to retire, but it

is  not mandatory on the Government in the sense that

the  Governor is not required to call upon an officer

to  retire on reaching the age of 55 under  clause  9 (a).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of clause 9 (a) is that it is lawful for

the  Government, when an officer reaches the  age  of

55,  to call upon him to retire from the service, but

it  is  not  mandatory that he shall be  required  to

retire.  In  fact, there are a number of cases  where

officers  have reached the age of 55, and because  it

has  been  in  the public interests  to  continue  an

officer in service, he has been allowed to serve  on.

In  those  circumstances, there would be no break  in

service. If the officer desires to continue to  serve

after  55  and if the Government considers  that  the

interests of the public service are benefited by  his

staying  on,  he remains and his service is  unbroken

until such time as he does retire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated in moving the Second Reading of this

Bill,  the  present  Government policy  is  that  the

normal  age  of retirement should be 55. That  policy

is, of course, subject to exceptions where there are

circumstances which justify giving permission  to  an

officer to stay on; but the policy, broadly, is based

on considerations at the present time and this is in

conformity    with   agreement   with    the    Staff

Associations. The wording of this clause of the Bill,

however,   in   no   way  prevents   the   Government

reconsidering  that policy, and if in  the  light  of

future   circumstances,  such  as  the  progress   of

Malayanisation, the Government wished, as  a  general

rule,  to ask officers to serve on over 55, it  could

certainly do so in so far as the law is concerned. It

would,   of  course,  be  right,  in  honouring   our

obligations to the Staff side, that we should consult

them  before we made a major change of policy. I  can

assure the hon. Member that, as the clause is worded,

the  Government  is  free to use  its  discretion  in

deciding its policy, and there is no break in service

if an officer stays on.

the words "and in the case of Home Civil Service

Pension to be four-thirds of its actual amount".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a technical amendment, Sir. The clause deals

with  the  method  of' calculating  the  value  of  a

gratuity  and the amendment I move explains  how  the

gratuity shall be calculated in cases where there  is

no   reduction  of  pension.  The  method  now  being

provided  is  that a gratuity shall be calculated  as

increasing  the pension by one-third. That particular

circumstance  applies to what is known  as  the  Home

Civil  Service in the United Kingdom, and we have  in

recent  years  had a certain number of  officers  who

have  served  in  Singapore and it  is  necessary  to

provide for their case. Sir, I beg to move.

Excellency's consent to this motion being  considered

by the Assembly, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the stand of its

London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We uphold the basic right of peoples to governments

of  their  own choice." The House will remember  that

humanitarian  principle, quoted from the  Washington

Declaration  to which the Prime Minister  of  England

set  his  hand  not  so  long  ago - on  the  first  of

February,  1956.  We, the people of  Singapore,  Sir,

took this as a good augury of the possible success of

our  Merdeka Mission with its modest plan for limited

freedom. It did not take us long in London,  Sir,  to

learn  that  to  the Colonial Office  the  Washington

Declaration  was  a  quixotic document  for  external

decoration. "Liberate Singapore? Do not be infantile;

we  need  Singapore more than ever now.  Freedom?  We

will  give  them the freedom to serve our interests."

This,  as we saw it, was the attitude of the Colonial

Office,  matured in the tradition of the exploitation

of  human  beings  the world over. Whilst  the  Prime

Minister of England seeks the welfare of Britain with

humanity,  the Colonial Office seeks the  welfare  of

Britain at the expense of humanity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London, Sir, full of faith in the British

people's    liberal    attitude   towards    colonial

territories. Historically, we recognised the  radical

and  humane  difference between the British  approach

and  that of other European imperial powers. We  were

conscious of the tragedy of the relationship of  such

imperial  powers as France, Holland  and  Italy  with

their  colonial peoples, tragedies which  highlighted

the genius of the English people in the past in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



transforming their colonies into friends and  allies.

The  tradition  started, Sir, many  decades  ago - nine

decades  ago. I think it was in 1867 when Canada  was

given self-government, and although until the end  of

the  war  that liberal tradition of humanity  towards

one's colonies was limited to the colonies which were

peopled by British stock, nevertheless after the  war

the  statesmanship and humanity of the British people

found  a  government which also liberated  such  vast

Asian  territories  as India, Burma  and  Ceylon.  By

these   acts  of  statesmanship,  Britain  not   only

prevented   a  ghastly  holocaust  and   a   dreadful

bitterness  and antagonism in Asia, but  the  British

people retained for their own welfare, as well as for

the  welfare  of  their  former  colonies,  the  very

valuable   friendship  and  co-operation   of   these

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it, Sir, that has brought about a reversal

of this intelligent, humane policy - a reversal by this

present  Government?  Why is the  British  Government

going back to the policy of the days of the revolt of

the American colonies? Why is Singapore being made an

exception? I would say this, Sir: There is a reversal

of policy as far as we can see, but it does not apply

to Singapore alone. I am under the impression that it

is  a  complete reversal of policy in respect of each

and  every colony which has any strategic or economic

value  to  the  United Kingdom.  The  action  of  the

British Government now, Sir, is no longer inspired by

an  understanding of the necessity to make friends of

those  whom they can no longer keep as slaves.  Their

actions  in  respect of colonies now  spring  from  a

psychology of fear and hurt pride based on a  feeling

of  weakness.  "Many of us are tired of being  kicked

around,"  said  a  member of the British  Government,

drawing attention to Cyprus, Jordan and Ceylon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night I read another statement, not reported in

the  local  Press, by Mr Selwyn Lloyd,  the  British

Foreign Secretary. I read from Time Magazine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



of  4th June, page 22. Mr Selwyn Lloyd stated  at  a

Tory rally:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are an island dependent on our overseas trade

and  our overseas interests. It is essential that  we

should  retain  certain  positions  of  strength   at

whatever cost."



<br><br>He   specified  Cyprus  and  Aden  and  Singapore - "at

whatever cost".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need Singapore now more than ever," said the

Secretary  of  State  for the Colonies  at  a  public

meeting; and because they believe they need Singapore

and  because  they are tired of being kicked  around,

their  hearts are hardened and they will not see  the

only fruitful approach is to trust the cooperation of

a  friendly people within the framework of  practical

guarantees, that we offered. In their present  punch-drunk  state,  they must insist on  overall  colonial

rule  and  control  by force of  arms.  The  Colonial

Office, Sir, repeatedly sought to impress us with the

vital  importance of Singapore as a defence base  for

the  free  world.  In  the name of  the  free  world,

Singapore must remain unfree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conference table, I pointed out, as an honest

friend of Britain, the grave dangers involved in  the

British stand that the people of Singapore cannot  be

free  so long as Britain needs to maintain a base  in

Singapore. This was not appreciated at the time, Sir.

However, there seems to be an awakening to the effect

on world opinion, and on the opinion of the people of

Singapore, of the British Government's view that  the

people  of  Singapore  must  subserve  the  military

interests of the free world - a live offering to  their

god of brass - S.E.A.T.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of the people of Singapore, Sir, I

welcome  the news today that our brothers across  the

Straits have refused to join this organisation  which

seeks  to  keep  the  people of Singapore  a  subject

people   in   the  name  of  the  free   world.   The

realisation,  Sir, of the effect that their  attitude

would  have  on  world opinion has not changed  their

attitude;  it  has  merely changed  their  propaganda

slant. And now we have speeches by the Prime Minister

and  others  that the breakdown of the constitutional

talks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



was  not  on the question of external defence  powers

but   for  the  protection  of  Singapore's  internal

security and population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note, Sir, that the Australian Prime Minister has

hurried to the support of the United Kingdom stand. I

would  like to make this clear: though the Australian

Government has representatives both in London and  in

Singapore, at no time has it sought to ascertain the

views  of  the  Singapore Government on  the  British

proposals  nor  has  it  made any  effort  to  obtain

information as to our understanding of the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer, Sir, to just one speech of the British

Prime  Minister, Sir Anthony Eden,  and  one  of  the

Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Robert Menzies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read from Reuter's report of Sir Anthony Eden's

speech at Norwich, dated 1st June, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have massive responsibilities in the island of

Singapore,  and not least to the ordinary  people  of

Singapore.  It  is  not just a  question  of  defence

bases,  (please note - "not just a question of defence

bases")  important though these are to the  whole  of

the  free  world. The liberty and livelihood  of  the

island's teeming population are very vulnerable.  We

had  to  retain  some safeguards to deal  effectively

with  an  emergency. I believe that  many  people  in

Singapore recognise this."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I read from Reuter's report from

Colombo dated 2nd June of a Press conference given by

Mr Robert Menzies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asked: Do you think Britain is justified in

withholding  even a modicum of freedom for  Singapore

on  the  question of internal security?  Mr  Menzies

said:  'I do not agree with the implications  of  the

question.  The  United  Kingdom  Government  has  not

denied  in  its  proposals  authority  over  internal

security.  Instead  it has put forward  a  series  of

proposals under which step by step internal  security

will become a matter for the local authorities as the

local authorities become capable of dealing with  it.

It  has declined. I think properly, to let the  whole

of  internal security be given in one hit because  it

will  be  disastrous  to  the  overall  security   of

Singapore.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir, I read from Reuter's report from

London  dated 1st June, 1956, on the White  Paper  on

Singapore's constitutional conference, tabled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



by  the British Government in Parliament. This is how

the final paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A principal reason for the failure of the month-long London talks was Britain's refusal to give the

final say in the control of internal security on  the

island  to  elected  Singapore  Ministers  after  the

territory got internal self-government."



And  so,  Sir,  we now have the propaganda  slant  on

internal security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what the Rt. Hon. Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd, Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for

the  Colonies, and leader of the British  delegation

to  the constitutional conference, says. Sir, I quote

from  Hansard, Vol. 552 No. 155, 16th May, 1956, Col.

2017  bottom,  and  top of Col. 2018  (this  was  the

morning after the breakdown):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Government considered it necessary

to  retain, as a safeguard, the power to make  Orders

in  Council for Singapore; but were willing to  limit

this   power  to  matters  affecting  United  Kingdom

responsibilities  for external defence  and  external

affairs.  This  constitution  was  refused  by   the

majority of the delegation."



<br><br>Sir,  that  seems  clear  enough.  Not  one  word  on

internal  security, but fortunately there  is  a  lot

more,  if  you  will  permit me. In  Col.  2018,  Mr

Aneurin Bevan asks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we understand that what has really happened is

that  there is a breakdown almost exclusively on  the

interpretation of where the frontiers lie between Her

Majesty's Government's rights in the island  and  the

rights  of the local government in internal security,

because  there appears to be some confusion  on  this

point?"



<br><br>At Col. 2019, Sir, Mr Lennox-Boyd replies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The right hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the

causes  of the breakdown is not by any means correct.

The  conference  did not break down  on  the  limited

field   of   internal   security.   It   broke   down

fundamentally  on  two  points.  The  first  was  the

refusal to recognise that we must have some power  in

the  field  reserved to us in Singapore, of  external

defence  primarily, and the wide measure of  external

affairs,  that  is, some power other than  the  power

totally to suspend the constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it broke down on the fact that we could

not   accept  a  constitution  for  the  Defence  and

Security   Council  which  would  put  Her  Majesty's

Government  in  the  United Kingdom  in  a  permanent

minority  on a body without whose authority we  could

take no action, save that of the suspension of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>



constitution, in the fields by agreement reserved for

us  and  for which in our generation and historically

we would be held responsible. We would, in fact, have

been undertaking responsibility without the power  to

discharge it."



<br><br>Still more, Sir. Mr Lennox-Boyd again to Mr Aneurin

Bevan, who kept harping on this business - " "Is it not

internal security?" At Col. 2020:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . , the right hon. Gentleman is wrong in

harping on internal security."



<br><br>Now listen to this, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our interest in internal security has been in its

implication and involvement in external defence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our interest in internal security is only in so far

as  it affects external defence." It seems to me that

that  is clear enough, but I find, Sir, that  I  have

one more quotation in this fascinating unravelling of

British propaganda. I refer now, Sir, to Col. 2021 of

the same Hansard. We have Mr Geoffrey Lloyd standing

up.  (You  will remember Mr Geoffrey Lloyd,  Sir - the

Rt.  Hon. Mr Geoffrey Lloyd, M.P., and leader of the

British Parliamentary Delegation, who came but a  few

short  weeks  ago  and was our guest.)  Mr  Geoffrey

Lloyd:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Am I right in understanding my right hon. Friend

(that  is,  Mr Lennox-Boyd) to the effect  that  the

difficulty which has arisen relates entirely  to  the

retention of powers necessary for the carrying out of

defence responsibility? If so, those of us who  share

his  very deep desire to reach an agreement with  the

Singapore  delegation will reluctantly conclude  that

breakdown at this stage is inevitable."



<br><br>And Mr Lennox-Boyd puts the last nail in his coffin,

Sir, when he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir, I can assure my right hon. Friend that

his interpretation is absolutely correct."



<br><br>And  what  is his interpretation? Will you bear  with

me?  It  is "the difficulty which has arisen  relates

entirely to the retention of powers necessary for the

carrying out of defence responsibility."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it seems impossible, if language is to

have   any   meaning,  that  there   could   be   any

misunderstanding  of the stand of  the  Secretary  of

State that the constitutional talks broke down on the

powers  he required for external defence and internal

security was merely a side issue and only in  so  far

as it affected external defence, and yet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>



we  have the Prime Ministers of England and Australia

speaking   at  radical  variance  with  the  Colonial

Secretary's  stand. What is the  truth?  And  who  is

indulging  in  unctuous  inaccuracies  that  seek  to

mislead decent people? This question is all the  more

pertinent when we come to consider the correspondence

in  the  next  motion  passing  between  me  and  the

Colonial Office, wherein it is clearly indicated that

there   are  only  two  issues  which  separate   the

Secretary of State from me. One is the appointment of

a Malayan Governor-General as distinct from a British

High Commissioner. And let me make this plain: if  we

have  a  Malayan Governor-General, the British  would

still  have  the  right  to appoint  a  British  High

Commissioner as their representative; he would  still

preside  on  the Defence and Security  Council.  Your

delegation,  Sir,  has at all times  sought - we  never

gave  this  up - the appointment of a Malayan Governor-General  as  a representative of the Queen  with  the

purely  decorative functions of the Queen  and  as  a

symbolic  Head of the State in whom we could coalesce

the loyalty of a nascent nation; but the Secretary of

State is of the opinion that the time is not ripe for

His  Excellency  Sir  Robert  Black  to  walk  out  of

Government  House and for a Malayan to walk  in.  For

the  Colonial Office, Sir, it is a matter of  British

prestige in Asian waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question on which we are at issue - the

only  other  one - is  that  I  want  the  transfer  of

Singapore  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Colonial

Office to another Ministry. I shall deal with this at

greater  length when we come to the question  of  the

correspondence, but  at this stage  I  think  it  is

important that the people of England consider how, in

the   name  of  anything  decent,  in  the  name   of

elementary truth, can it be said that the appointment

of  a  Malayan  Governor-General or the  transfer  of

Singapore from the Colonial Office in any way affects

internal security or external defence. This is a  cry

for  truth,  Sir,  and let it not be  a  cry  in  the

wilderness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other matter before I come to the

White  Paper  which I wish to touch  upon,  and  that

concerns  the repeated statements in the local  Press

of   the  disunity  amongst  your  delegation.   Sir,

disagreements there were - plenty of them - daily, as was

natural and to be expected when you remember that the

delegation consisted of many, many Parties;  but  let

this  he  clearly understood: they were never brought

out;  all  those  disagreements took  place  at  the

private meetings of the delegation and the remarkable

thing   about  your  delegation,  Sir,  is  not   the

disagreements  behind  the  scenes  but  the   almost

miraculous  unity  with which it faced  the  Colonial

Office.  We quarrelled like cars and dogs behind  the

scenes.  People threatened people with  bashings  on

the  head  but  when  we came to  face  the  Colonial

Office,  Sir,  we were solid. That is  something  the

people of Singapore do not seem to have realised, and

surprising though this may sound to those of you  who

have  been subjected to the full barrage of countless

tales  of disunity, I would like to place on  record,

with all sincerity, my pride in the way the Singapore

delegation faced the Colonial Office and its  panoply

of  experts up to the last day when the Secretary  of

State terminated the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that on the first day, the

delegation  was shaken - so was I - by the  statement  of

the  leader  of the Liberal-Socialist delegates  that

his Party sought safeguards on internal security, and

I still say for myself that I think the time was ill-chosen,  but in fairness, Sir, let us admit that  the

Liberal-Socialists made their point gently  and  with

moderation  and  throughout  the  remainder  of   the

constitutional  conference, for days and  days,  they

conducted themselves with dignity and with restraint,

honestly  seeking to cooperate with us  and  going  a

long,  long  way with us, Sir, I am not  speaking - I

have  no  brief  for  the  Liberal-Socialists - of  the

contemptible conduct of their President who,  at  the

height  of the constitutional conference, went  round

in  Singapore saying, "Please, teacher, I can form  a

Government."  I  am  not  speaking  of  the  defeated

candidates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>



Sir,I  am  speaking of the successful  Members  who

formed part of the delegation in London. They are  my

political  opponents, it is true, but I  consider  it

inherent in political democracy that there should  be

honest   dealing  between  political  opponents   and

respect   for   sincerity,  even  though   there   is

disagreement  on policy. On that principle,  Sir,  in

fairness  and  in view of the attacks to  which  they

have been subjected in the Press and in public, I say

that  the Liberal-Socialists have been wrongly blamed

for the breakdown of the conference. On the contrary,

Sir,  they gave evidence at the most difficult  times

of  their  anxiety to avoid a breakdown by  accepting

majority  decisions without insisting on their  right

to  make reservations at the conference table. Theirs

was  a creditable performance in what must have  been

to them an acutely difficult time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am conscious, Sir, that there have been persistent

reports on the part of the English Press in Singapore

to   make   out  that  the  differences  within   the

delegation  caused the breakdown of  the  conference.

This  is  understandable when  we  realise  that  the

Singapore  English Press does not want freedom  from

colonial rule for Singapore and consequently it is  a

matter  of policy that everything should be  done  to

heighten the prestige of the Colonial Office  and  to

smear the reputation of the Singapore delegation  and

any  and  every  Singaporean who may prove  to  be  a

strong opponent of the Colonial Office. I would  like

to  repeat, Sir, for the record and for the people of

Singapore, who I trust know that they can believe me,

that there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the

differences  within the delegation  had  no  material

effect  in  bringing  about  the  breakdown  of   the

conference.  The Colonial Office is solely  to  blame

and  is  solely  responsible for  this  breakdown  in

insisting  on  overall  supervision  and  control  of

future  Singapore governments in the name of external

defence and external affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come, Sir, to the White Paper which is tabled

before   you  this  morning.  Although  this   is   a

Government Paper, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>



think  it  is fair to make it known that the Official

Members  of  the  Council of Ministers  who  were  in

London  did  not  and  would not  co-operate  in  its

presentation,  nor, since it was a  document  of  the

Council  of  Ministers, was it  possible  for  me  to

consult  the other Members of the delegation  on  its

presentation.   In   the  circumstances,   Sir,   the

appointed Ministers who were in London take full  and

complete  responsibility for this Paper.  I  wish  to

make  two  observations on it. I am  informed  by  my

friend  and  colleague the Chief  Secretary  that  my

statement  that the British Government had repeatedly

refused   Singapore  the  formation  of  a  Singapore

battalion,  although never challenged in London,  is,

in  fact,  inaccurate. He tells me that the Singapore

Government - the former one - dropped the question of the

formation  of  a Singapore battalion because  of  the

difficulties and particularly because of  the  United

Kingdom's refusal to agree that we should, out of our

own  money,  pay adequate rates of pay in  excess  of

what they paid. That is a wonderful distinction, Sir,

and  I hope it will be noted: it is very significant.

They   never   openly   refuse,   they   are   merely

obstructing.  That  is the way  the  Colonial  Office

works.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> They never.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> When the Singapore delegation,

Sir,  pointed out to the British delegation that  the

overall imperial legislative powers which the British

Government sought and which you will find at Annexure

I,  page  52  of the White Paper, would  cover  every

field of public life, the Secretary of State told  us

that he was prepared to give us a letter assuring  us

that    he   would   not   exercise   those    powers

unreasonably - the  judge  as to  what  was  reasonable

being,  of  course, the Secretary of  State  for  the

Colonies. We ought to make that clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for the rest of the Paper, perhaps there

is nothing new, but let me recapitulate very briefly.

You  are  aware  from the tenor of the  debate  which

preceded the departure of the Merdeka Mission that we

were deeply anxious to seek with Britain a friendly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>



relationship  for the foreseeable future  within  the

framework  of human dignity. We therefore  asked  for

political freedom within the Commonwealth and planned

to  respect  British economic and military interests.

We  were prepared to remain within the sterling area,

and   because  we  realised  that  Britain   believes

Singapore  is  of vital and strategic  importance  to

her,  we  offered  an  agreement whereby  the  United

Kingdom  would have the right, at its discretion,  to

have  such  naval, military and air installations  in

Singapore  as  it deemed necessary,  with  powers  of

administration    within   the   areas    of    those

installations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government expressed the view that a

treaty  could  be  unilaterally  denounced,  as   was

threatened  in  Ceylon and, in the circumstances,  we

reluctantly agreed that within the Act giving us  our

new  constitution, there should be retained the power

to control external defence and foreign affairs other

than trade, commerce and cultural relations. Finally,

Sir,  to meet the British Government's objection that

it  was  all very well to have powers but what  about

the   sanctions,   we  agreed  that   Her   Majesty's

Government  should  have the right,  within  the  Act

giving  us  our  new  constitution,  to  suspend  our

constitution  whenever,  in its  discretion,  it  was

satisfied   that   the   Singapore   Government   was

dishonouring  its  obligations to co-operate  in  the

efficacious  discharge  of its  external  defence  or

external   affairs  obligations,  whenever   internal

security so deteriorated as to affect the efficacy of

external   defence,   and  whenever   the   Singapore

Government  acted ultra vires. That right to  suspend

the  constitution was not subject to the Defence  and

Security  Council at any time. It  was  an  absolute

discretion  of Her Majesty's Government.  What  more,

Sir, can a reasonable people give?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We even agreed to a British Chairman of the Defence

and   Security  Council  which  would   advise   both

Governments on external defence and internal security

matters and which would seek to iron out disputes  in

borderline case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By conceding this much, Sir, we had gone well beyond

our  original  intentions which we had  expressed  in

this  very House during the Merdeka debate,  for  the

retention of these powers in the Act are of so  vital

a  character  that  they mean  that  Britain  retains

ultimate  control of our destiny and we had to  admit

that, in the circumstances, what we were prepared  to

agree  to,  although  much more than  internal  self-government, was radically less than Dominion status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having pushed us back so far, Sir, the Colonial

Office  then  indicated its complete  dissatisfaction

with  the concessions and under the guise of  seeking

powers of external defence and foreign affairs - I  use

those  words advisedly "under the guise", by  way  of

pretence  of  seeking powers of external defence  and

external  affairs - they asked that they should  retain

over-riding   imperial  legislative  powers   to   be

exercised,  not on the recommendation of the  Defence

and  Security  Council, as they say  in  their  White

Paper,   Sir,   and   say  erroneously,   but   after

considering a report of that Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your delegation asked for a definition of "external

defence" and "foreign affairs" which the Secretary of

State was peppering the conference with, and finally,

we  got that written definition - a definition at  page

52 - which  I  hope  every public-minded  citizen  will

read,  because a cursory glance even to a  non-lawyer

will sufficiently indicate that the powers which they

sought - these imperial over-riding powers - cover  every

aspect   of  public  life.  Sir,  no  government   of

Singapore could, under these provisions, be free from

the  constant  coercion to comply  with  the  British

Government's  directions on internal  policy  if  the

Singapore Government wanted to survive, and there are

times,  Sir, when, in order to have important  social

legislation, one seeks to compromise with  one's  own

conscience  and  to accept these hateful  directions.

Under  these  powers, the Singapore Government  would

never be free to evolve policies in harmony with  the

people's  wishes but must always be looking over  its

shoulders,   always  fearful   of   the   threat   of

utilisation of these powers, always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>



compromising. By this simple expedient,  the  British

Government  hoped  to  have  full  control  over  our

political  life  and  to  slough  off  the  odium  of

colonial   rule   on   to  the   wretched   Singapore

legislators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of your delegation, Sir, fearing the

dangers  of a breakdown of the talks, explored  every

avenue  to make the demands of the British Government

acceptable to the people of Singapore. To  this  end,

we  stated we were prepared to accept the over-riding

powers,  if  subject  to the recommendations  of  the

Defence  and  Security Council of which the  Chairman

should be a man appointed by the United Nations. Sir,

we argued that since the British Government said. "We

need  these  powers because we need  Singapore  as  a

base.  We  need  Singapore as a base because  of  our

international defence obligations;" our  answer  was,

"In  that  case, why not have as an arbiter a  person

appointed by this international organisation of which

you  are  a  member and which you claim to  respect?"

That suggestion was rejected out of hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many efforts behind the scenes, Sir, to

seek  a possible solution. Many suggestions were made

and,  as  a  final offer at the conference table,  we

agreed that the British Government should have  these

powers   if  their  exercise  were  subject  to   the

recommendations  of the Defence and Security  Council

of  which the Chairman was a Malayan appointed by the

Government  of  the Federation. This suggestion  too,

Sir,  met  with  short shrift. I finally  offered  to

accept  these  powers and a British Chairman  of  the

Defence and Security Council if these powers, but not

the   right   to   suspend  the  constitution,   were

automatically  to terminate in April 1959.  Sir,  why

April 1959? It is because I wanted for the people  of

Singapore  a  fixed  date.  I  sought  to  avoid  the

agitation  which would make for political instability

and racial antagonism and if I could say, "People  of

Singapore, be patient till 1959. There is no need  to

agitate,"  they may well have accepted the  position,

and furthermore, Sir, to the Colonial Office which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>



fears the threat of Communism - as I fear the threat of

Communism - surely it would have been adequate to  have

these  powers for three years? Within the next  three

years democracy would either have taken firm root  or

it  would have withered, and if it withers, Sir,  the

main  responsibility  is on  the  conscience  of  the

Colonial Office - if it has a conscience. No, Sir, they

were  not  prepared to accept April 1959 even  though

after  April 1959 they would still have the right  to

suspend our constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only say this, Sir, that during those last few

days, when we were struggling and wriggling to find a way  for  some  sort  of an honest  constitution,  I

gained the impression that the British Government and

the  Colonial Office were no longer really interested

in  reaching an agreement with us, and the conduct of

the  Secretary of State on the last Saturday  of  the

conference,  when he arrogantly sought to  bring  the

conference  to  an abrupt termination, but  confirmed

this view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have returned empty-handed to you because we

would  not  put our hand to an agreement which  would

make of future Singapore governments de facto stooges

of  His  Excellency the Governor alias His Excellency

the High Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are people in Singapore who are of the

view  that  it would have been better to  bring  back

something  than  nothing at all - it is  better  for  a

hungry   man   to  eat  something  than   to   remain

starved - but, Sir, I will never offer a hungry  man  a

poisoned  cake.  It  is better to remain  hungry.  If

unadulterated, there were some ingredients of a  fine

cake in the British offer. But in the package form in

which we had to take it or leave it, the constitution

offered was a dangerously fraudulent one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did the British Government seek to retain

over-riding imperial legislative powers but they also

made  it clear that, in their view, the time was  not

ripe  for  Sir Robert Black to move out of Government

House and for a Malayan to move in. Our anxiety for a

Malayan Governor-General, Sir, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>



not  based  on any personal considerations.  Whatever

the  difficulties I may have had with His Excellency,

I have always found him of the utmost courtesy and if

we  must  have  a British Governor or a British  High

Commissioner - call him what you will - we  may  as  well

have Sir Robert Black as any other. Our desire for  a

Malayan  Governor-General, I repeat, is not based  on

personal considerations but it is to give reality  to

the  change of status of the Colony of Singapore, but

if  there is only to be a change of name, I, for one,

am   not   interested  whether  they  call  Singapore

"Colony"  or  "State", if that means the same  thing,

and  I  am  not interested in whether they  call  the

Governor  "High Commissioner" or "Czar" or "Fuehrer",

if that means the same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial Office also made it clear that, for the

foreseeable future, Singapore would remain under  the

tender  care  of that dedicated band of  men  in  the

Colonial  Office  who  have  been  matured   in   the

traditions  of authoritarian rule over more  than  80

million abject subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 15th of May, Sir, when the conference

officially ended, I have thought and re-thought  over

many aspects of it and particularly my repugnance  to

the  over-riding imperial legislative powers  and  of

the British offer as it was ultimately put before us,

and  I say to you, Sir, to hon. Members here, and  to

the  people  of  Singapore, that I  believe  we  were

absolutely    right   in   refusing   a    fraudulent

constitution which sought to take away with one  hand

even  more than what it gave with the other, because,

Sir,  it would have retained complete control but  at

the  same time it would have hidden behind the  local

people, and colonial interference would not have been

obvious  and the local people would have carried  the

odium of Colonial Office policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that it is better to come back empty-handed,

Sir, and still have hope that reason and justice  and

good sense will somehow shortly prevail than to tie



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>



the  people  of Singapore hand and foot  for  several

years  to a constitution which they will have  learnt

to  revile. To have accepted this constitution  would

have  dealt a death blow to the concept of  democracy

which  has  been gaining ground in Singapore  in  the

past year's rapidly maturing political atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to a lighter side. Though the

course  of the constitutional conference was  fraught

with  frustrations, I would like to pay public thanks

for  the  courtesy  and generous hospitality  of  the

Secretary  of  State and the British  Government,  as

well    as   the   innumerable   organisations    and

individuals,  to  the Singapore  delegation  and  its

individual  members, and I know that all  members  of

the  delegation, and I hope Members of this House and

the  people  of  this  country,  would  wish  to   be

associated  with  the expression of appreciation  for

the   way  in  which  the  Singapore  delegation  was

received by the people and the Government of Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to express my sincere thanks and

that   of   the   delegation   to   the   very   able

constitutional advisers for their magnificent support

and  also, Sir, if I may, our sincere thanks  to  our

devoted Secretariat from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word, Sir, and one which I may expand in

the  next  motion and that is: what of the future?  I

myself can see no worthwhile prospects except on  the

road  on  which  we have just met a serious  setback.

Biased  though  I  may  be, I  have  sought,  in  all

honesty, to assess impartially the true prospects for

the welfare of the people of Singapore in the days to

come  and  I  repeat that, in my view, our  long-term

welfare requires close and friendly co-operation with

Britain  within the Commonwealth's framework. However

bitter  the  ashes of our dead hopes, I say  that  we

must,  with  Britain, as we are with the  Federation,

show our wisdom and our strength by patiently keeping

the  door  open  against the  time  when  reason  and

justice and good sense can prevail.

the motion of the Hon. the Chief Minister and reserve

my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  people of Singapore have asked  again  and

again  for freedom from colonialism. They sent  their

delegates  to  London  with  a  clear  mandate.   The

moderate  claims  put forward by  the  delegation  on

behalf  of  the people of Singapore were rejected  by

the  British Government. There is no doubt now in the

minds  of  the  great  majority  of  the  people   of

Singapore that the blame for the failure of the talks

lies  with the British Government. What was the basic

reason for the failure of the talks? The basic reason

was  the British Government's determination that  the

interests of the people of Singapore should always be

sacrificed  to the needs of Singapore as an  imperial

fortress.  Because of this imperial aim, the  British

Government  refused to grant complete internal  self-government  to  Singapore, including the  control  of

internal   security   by  a  democratically   elected

government  of  the  people of Singapore.  They  even

refused to accept a Malayan Chairman for the proposed

Defence  and  Security Council and thus revealed  the

insincerity of their assurance that they desired  the

unity  of Singapore and the Federation. They insisted

that Her Majesty's Government should have over-riding

powers  to  legislate  by Order  in  Council  and  to

institute  Emergency Regulations through the  British

High  Commissioner, affecting wide fields  of  public life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, what the British Government hoped to do

was to take away with one hand what they offered with

the other. No self-respecting delegation claiming  to

represent  the  true  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore  could have agreed to such conditions.  The

people of Singapore can be proud of the rejection  by

the   delegation   of  the  offer  of   the   British

Government. By and large, the delegation did not  let

the people down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of the British Government to preserve

Singapore  as a fortress even at the cost of  denying

the  people  of Singapore their legitimate  political

aspirations   has  earned  for  it   the   odium   of

international  opinion,  and  particularly  of  Asian

opinion.   This  desire  is  not  only  against   the

interests of the people of Singapore but also against

the  interests  of  the people of the  Federation  of

Malaya.  It is also offensive to the aspirations  and

policies of our great South East Asian neighbours - the

great and peaceful peoples of India, Indonesia, Burma

and Ceylon. These great neighbours of ours strive  to

create  an  area of peace and democratic progress  in

South-East  Asia. They are all therefore  opposed  to

the  activities of a S.E.A.T.O. base in this part  of

the  world.  A  fortress of colonialism in  Singapore

surely  runs  counter  to the  policy  of  the  great

peoples of India, Indonesia, Burma and Ceylon,  which

is  to  secure and extend the area of peace in  South

East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lennox-Boyd says that the Singapore fortress is

necessary for the defence of the free world. This  is

strange,  for India does not want it. Indonesia  does

not  want it and neither do Burma and Ceylon  want  a

S.E.A.T.O, base in this part of the world. For  whose

defence  is  it  wanted? Is it  for  the  defence  of

Britain?  But  Britain is 8,000 miles away.  At  whom

will  the  guns  of this fortress be aimed - at  India,

Burma,  Indonesia,  Ceylon? However,  even  from  the

military  point  of  view, surely the  hydrogen  bomb

makes Singapore useless as a fort. One hydrogen  bomb

on Singapore would spread destruction as far as Kuala

Lumpur. In any case, of what use can Singapore be  to

Britain as a fortress when it is faced with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>



population  hostile  to  colonialism  and   demanding

freedom and democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole attitude of the British Government during

the talks proved three things. Firstly, it proved the

insincerity  of  its  professions  to  grant  genuine

freedom and democracy to Singapore. Secondly, by  its

rejection  of a Malayan Chairman for the Defence  and

Security  Council, it proved the insincerity  of  its

repeated  assurance and desire to see  the  unity  of

Singapore  and the Federation. Thirdly, the  British

Government sought to continue denying the  people  of

Singapore  their  aspirations  by  sowing  dissension

amongst them and by trying to throw the blame for the

failure of the talks from themselves to other people.

This  is  sheer  hypocrisy which all  genuine  anti-colonial parties and groups must expose and condemn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rendel Constitution has been proved unworkable

and  we  have this now on the authority of no less  a

person  than  our distinguished the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister. In the words of the Report on the All-Party

Delegation to London presented to this Assembly, "the

Labour Front-Alliance Government, from the moment  it

took  office  on  the  7th  April,  1955,  had  ample

confirmation from experience that the diarchical rule

of  the Rendel Constitution was quite inadequate  for

the   happy   evolution  of  the  people's  political

aspirations."   The   impossible   nature   of    the

constitution   was   again   revealed   during    the

constitutional  crisis of June and  July  last  year.

Because  of  the proved impossibility of  the  Rendel

Constitution, the people of Singapore sent  the  All-Party   Delegation  to  London  to  ask  for  a   new

constitution which would give self-government to  the

people of Singapore. We all know now how these modest

aspirations of the people of Singapore were  treated.

In   view  of  this,  this  Assembly  has  no   other

alternative   but  to  approve  the  stand   of   its

delegation at the constitutional conference and, as a

consequence, to condemn the insincere attitude of the

British  Government  which was  responsible  for  the

failure of the talks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Assembly has also no alternative, if it wants

to  retain the confidence of the people of Singapore,

but to instruct any new government that may be formed

under  the  present  constitution  that  their   only

justification  for existence as a government  is  the

reopening   of   the  constitutional  talks   without

compromising  on the important issue of principle  on

which  the talks broke down and towards that end  the

unity of all genuine anti-colonial parties and groups

is vital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have taken the breakdown of

the  talks  with great calmness. This is due  to  the

extreme reasonableness and patience of our people, it

is  also  due to their continuing confidence  in  the

leadership of the genuinely anti-colonial parties  of

Singapore. But the British Government will be  making

a  grave mistake if it takes advantage of the natural

reasonableness  and  patience  of  our  people.   The

patience of our people is not unlimited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when  the  talks were taking place  in  London,

almost  everybody in this country anxiously  followed

the  progress as reported in the local Press. I, too,

read my morning papers with great interest and I  had

hoped that some of the hopes and dreams of our people

would  be  achieved peacefully.  I  am  an  old  man,

probably one of the oldest men in this House,  and  I

had hoped, with thousands of people, that the British

Government  would  be  sincere  to  give   us   self-government   and   independence.  But   the   British

Government  would  not  give  us  independence.   The

British  Government just said that because  Singapore

is  a  military port and the Parties were not united,

so they were not willing to grant us independence.  I

think  that  is wrong of the British Government  when

the  people of Singapore want independence.  I  would

say  that  they just take the people of Singapore  as

their enemies when all we want is friendship with the

British people and the British Government. I think  I

am   now  mistaken  for  having  thought  that   this

delegation would succeed when they went to England to

ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>

for  Merdeka. The British have no desire or intention

to  change their old ways. They live too far away  to

understand Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young, we never thought of colonialism as

a  bad  thing. We just accepted it; but now everybody

knows  that  colonialism is really a bad thing.  Even

the British are forced to say that colonialism is bad

nowadays. The reason why the British do not  want  to

give  up  Singapore is because the British Government

are  making  so  much money in Singapore.  They  come

8,000  miles  away; the climate is not  suitable  for

them; and yet, why do they remain here? It is only to

bring  out the money from Singapore. So they continue

to rule Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The London talks show us that the British say one

thing  and do something else. They say all  sorts  of

sweet  words  to the people and some  of  them  might

think  that the British are so good. I say  that  the

delegation did a lot in London through the leadership

of the Hon. the Chief Minister. I say that all credit

is  due  to  him  for guarding the interests  of  our

people.  Britain wanted to give us something to  show

the world that she had given up her bad ways, but she

wanted  to  take back as soon as she  had  given,  by

wanting over-riding legislative powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the end of our fight. All the young

people  believe  in freedom. They have  convinced  me

that freedom will come and that, despite even an  old

man like me, freedom will come if we are prepared  to

work and fight for it. I know they are right; freedom

will  come. I am prepared to do my share  and  I  ask

everyone here to do their bit. Let us stop trying  to

show  each  other how good we are. Let us  fight  the

British! They are the enemies of Singapore's freedom!

Let us unite and fight on! Merdeka!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear, Merdeka!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already indicated that slogans,

however  commendable, will not  be  allowed  in  this

Chamber.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Hon. the Chief Minister said that he  would

resign after this sitting and I must congratulate him

on a magnificent final, or perhaps I should say semi-final,  performance  in this House.  I  am  glad  Mr

Lennox-Boyd  could not hear him, though  at  times  I

feared he might - the noise was so great, issuing  from

the Hon. the Chief Minister's lips.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose, Sir, there is some point in having this

debate on a subject which, after all, is an endeavour

to  get  the  endorsement of the  twelve  people  who

stayed  at home to the stand made in London. But  for

my part, I have learned nothing new this morning from

the  Hon. the Chief Minister's speech. We  have  all

followed  closely every phase of the talks.  We  have

read  the newspaper comments and we have listened  to

the  Hon. the  Chief Minister's broadcast.  We  have

heard it all before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not ordinarily have taken part in this

debate but for the fact that I felt that no one  else

in this Assembly would dare to disagree with the Hon.

the  Chief  Minister on his diatribe of the  Colonial

Office and, in my opinion, his unseemly criticism  of

that  Office. Today's denunciation was an enlargement

of  the  recent broadcast made by the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  when  he said, "The Colonial  Office  is  a

thing apart. The very essence of their philosophy is

the  exploitation  of  human  beings.  Theirs  is   a

philosophy  of Fascism." I think he went  on  to  say

something  that  no amount of written  assurances  or

promises  could  make the leopard change  his  spots.

That  seemed  to  me  to  be a singularly  unpleasant

sentence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, I do not believe personally that the

Colonial  Office is as all-powerful as the  Hon. the

Chief Minister suggests. I do not believe that it  is

an exploiter of human beings, nor do I believe for  a

moment  that its policy is Fascist, and  I  am  quite

certain  that there must be many people in  Singapore

who think in the same way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to my mind, the whole approach of the

Merdeka Mission was premature. This is a line I  have

always pursued and I will still say it. That many non-Europeans  think  so has also been  revealed  by  the

vernacular Press round about the time of the  failure

of  the  Merdeka  talks. The Hon. the Chief  Minister

made some reference to the English Press this morning

but  there was criticism too in the vernacular Press,

and  if  you  care  to consult the  Public  Relations

Office's  translations you will  find  that  this  is

indeed so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about May the 19th, there were references in

the local Press to the Hon. the Chief Minister having

spoken  of "the agony of the people of Singapore  and

of  the  people being stunned at the failure  of  the

Merdeka talks". Well, now, I think, in all sincerity,

that  is  an  exaggeration and  indeed  it  would  be

surprising  if it were not, because just  before  the

Hon. the  Chief  Minister left, he  himself  made  a

broadcast  in which he warned the people of Singapore

that  the delegation might not meet with success with

the  Colonial  Office and he said, "If that  happens,

take it like men." They did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one Chinese newspaper on May the 19th - I hope I

may  introduce  these references  to  the  vernacular

Press  because  we  have heard so  much  against  the

wicked English Press - said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"it saw the failure of the constitutional talks in

London as a matter of course."



<br><br>Whatever that may mean -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do you not know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I do not read Chinese. This was a

translation by the Public Relations Office.  It  gave

three reasons for the inevitability of -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What paper is this?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I will supply the Hon. the Chief

Minister with the name of the paper, Sir, if he would

like me to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir, is a

Member  permitted  to  refer to  a  document  without

specifying it? He seems to be running away!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I will be very pleased to give the

name, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The point has been

referred  to  me - whether  a  Member  is  correct   in

referring  to  a  document without specifying  it.  I

think it is proper parliamentary practice that if  an

hon.  Member  does  refer to a  document,  he  should

specify it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Very good, Sir. The Chung Shing Jit

Pao  in  its  editorial on May the 19th. One  of  the

reasons  it  gave  was that the delegation  was  ill-organised,   its  Members  were  dreaming   different

dreams,  and  even  attacking and  running  down  one

another. The second reason was that, in view  of  the

strategic  importance  of  Singapore  as   an   anti-Communist bulwark for the free world, the question of

Singapore's  independence  is  not  a  local   issue.

Thirdly,  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  failed  to

realise that he was dealing with an experienced, far-seeing  Britain who would never submit to tall  talks

and  threats. In short, the failure of the  talks  is

due  to the delegation's lack of political foresight.

The  newspaper then urged the Party in power to enter

into    further   negotiations   with   the   British

Government, which seems to me very sensible advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, even the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan

Yew), whom this conveyed amusement to, and who in the

past has always doubted the bona fides of the British

Government, according to the Straits Times,  when  he

returned  to  Singapore,  said - of  course,  the  hon.

Member  is  free  to correct me if this  is  not  the

Straits  Times, but I copied it out - "Our  failure  is

only  a temporary setback and I do not think anybody,

least  of  all the British Government, believes  that

this  is anything more than a temporary halt." "least

of all the British Government !" - that is pretty good,

coming from the Member for Tanjong Pagar!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They (the British) are ever anxious to open

negotiations with one or more groups from Singapore."



<br><br>And indeed they are, as it says in the final telegram

to the Hon. the Chief Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are committed unequivocally to leading the

people  of  Singapore to full self-government  within

the Commonwealth."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On what terms?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Now, Sir, you have had your say.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Returning to the vernacular Press,

Sir - I  hope this raises a laugh too - the Tamil Murasu,

an Indian newspaper -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Wrong pronunciation!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I beg your pardon! This paper, also

in an editorial at about the same time, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conditions in Singapore are not suitable for

complete  self-government.  The  experience  of   the

people  to  take  over  the responsibilities  of  the

administration is very little."



<br><br>And another one, Sir - I feel like spelling it, but can

I  pronounce  it  just as I see  it,  Sir - the  Kerala

Bandhu said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It could be deduced from the report of the talks

that  the  Colonial Office had acceded to almost  all

the  demands of the delegation. Therefore the failure

of  the  talks can be considered only as a  temporary

setback.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should be led by capable leaders who act

sensibly  and calmly. Experience proves  that  it  is

foolish to think of winning over the British lion  by

furious and childish threats."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister in his broadcast

the  other  evening said that many people wanted  his

head.  I  do  not want the Chief Minister's  head.  I

would not know what to do with it if I had it, and  I

do not disagree with him when he said, "The people of

Singapore have as much right to human equality as the

British people." But he also said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>



his delegation recognised, however, that "the British

people believe that they have strategic interests  in

Singapore  vital to their survival" - yes, and  to  his

and  Singapore's  survival, too. That  is  the  vital

point  as  I  see  it.  Britain  has  an  inescapable

commitment in this territory to see that this  island

does  not  fall under Communist domination. We  heard

today  all  about Ceylon, India, Burma and  Indonesia

but  we  did not hear about the menace to the  north.

Certain powers are necessary for carrying out defence

responsibilities    and   obviously    the    British

Government, and rightly, in my opinion, is not  going

to relinquish them lightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister also said, and the

Member  for  Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)  said

this afternoon, that Singapore could be destroyed  by

a  hydrogen  bomb. I think any schoolboy knows  that,

but  I would remind these gentlemen that a major  war

was  fought in Korea where the Americans had  nuclear

weapons but did not use them. It does not follow that

atomic  weapons would be used. The British Government

knows as much about atomic weapons as anybody in this

House - you  can be quite certain about  that  - but  it

still  believes that it would be dangerous to  desert

this   highly   important  and  strategic   fortress - dangerous  in  the interests of the free  peoples  of

South-East Asia as well as their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the Hon. the Chief Minister is a

Malayan  and  one  thing  I  do  not  doubt  is   his

sincerity, but when he says that he is right and  Mr

Lennox-Boyd,  the Colonial Office, Sir Anthony  Eden,

Mr Robert Menzies and everybody else are wrong -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not everybody else is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I beg your pardon. I will just stop

at  Mr  Menzies - are  wrong, in  spite  of  his  very

powerful address - I felt like St. Paul myself,  almost

I was persuaded - I am not 100 per cent convinced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I spoke in this House, I said, "I will

co-operate  fully on whatever decisions were  reached

in  the  London talks." In the event,  there  was  no

decision  and I will certainly not support  a  motion

which  is little more than a vote of censure  on  the

Colonial Office of my country.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  the  arrival of the Singapore  delegation  in

London,  the  British Press had  already  assumed  an

attitude   of  sarcasm  and  ridicule   as   to   the

aspirations of the All-Party Mission. Public  opinion

in  London was that Singapore is not - yet ready  and

not    strong   enough   to   shoulder    the    full

responsibilities of self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst members of the Liberal-Socialist Party, each

and everyone of them, in London were doing their very

best  to  gain the confidence of the Colonial Office,

the  members of the People's Action Party were  doing

their  very worst to harden the minds in the Colonial

Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such untimely and provocative outcries in

London - "Drive the white man into the sea!  Drive  the

British    into    the    sea!    Asia    for     the

Asians!" - immediately before the opening of the  talks

had  certainly paved the way for the failure  of  the

Merdeka talks. Just ask yourself: would any sane man,

seeking  a favour, tell his would-be benefactor  that

he  intends to get rid of him soon and yet  be  crazy

enough to expect and to believe that the favour  will

be  granted? So unfortunately for us, even before the

talks  began,  public opinion in  London  was  biased

against us. Now, let us come to the point -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Will the hon. Member

address his remarks to the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Now, let us come to the point

where the inconsistent and the ill-tempered the  Hon.

the  Chief  Minister lost the confidence of  his  own

Ministers  and his Coalition colleagues.  Blinded  by

his  uncontrollable self-imagined disappointment  and

rage, the Hon. the Chief Minister could not see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>



his  way  to  accept  Britain's  offer  of  what  was

tantamount to full internal self-government which, in

the  first  place, he had asked for. What over-riding

powers  Britain  asked for was to be  tempered  by  a

rider  in which Britain would undertake by a  written

guarantee not to abuse, and Mr Lennox-Boyd had  said

that. It is beyond the understanding of my Party  and

the  people  of  Singapore why  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  would insist on throwing away the talks  by

asking for an imaginary "full loaf". We asked  for  a

full loaf with certain unpalatable ingredients.., but

those   ingredients  are  of  the  Hon. the   Chief

Minister's own making. He had publicly said  that  he

would  cede  to Britain foreign affairs and  external

defence. He now throws away the pot of gold  for  the

gossamer  threads of the rainbow.  In  this,  he  was

ably -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Who has been teaching him all

this?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> - abetted by the People's Action

Party  who  also previously said that they  would  be

satisfied  with a three-quarter loaf - to  quote  their

own    words:   "as   a   workable   and   acceptable

constitutional  step".  Perhaps  that  turnabout  was

brought  on  by Britain's acceptance in principle  of

Singapore's   citizenship   proposals.   Under   this

agreement,  which  is now lost to  us  for  the  time

being,  a citizenship status would have been created

for  Singapore  which  would be  the  equal  of  that

enjoyed  by  other  members of the Commonwealth.  The

granting  of  a rightful place in Singapore  for  all

aliens who take an oath of allegiance to this country

would  mean  a tremendous increase in the  number  of

electors  capable  of thinking for themselves.  Maybe

the  People's Action Party are afraid of the  country

having  a  preponderance of thinking  people  on  the

rolls. Afterthoughts are often terrifying and we  now

can  see  the fears of those bent on playing  to  the

gallery. I repeat what I have said on my return  from

London:  I do not blame the Colonial Office  for  the

breakdown of the Merdeka talks. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>



am  sure  the  House  knows by now  where  the  blame

rightly falls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this sitting

reminds me very much of my student days when  at  the

end  of  the term, in the Students' Union, we  wished

the  retiring President goodbye, wished him well  and

welcomed  the new President. On such an occasion,  we

like  to forget all those personal differences  which

have   divided  us  and  all  the  other   unpleasant

difficulties   which   have  often   bedevilled   our

relations in the past term. Well, this is really  the

end  of the term. The session comes to an end  and  a

phase in Singapore's political life comes to an  end;

and  much as I regret the quite impolitic stand taken

by  the Liberal-Socialist Party, I think it adds that

piquant  touch of madness which has bedevilled  this

past year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every schoolboy knows - what Mr Sutherland and

those  who  agree with him including,  unfortunately,

the  Member  for  Tiong Bahru (Mr William  Tan)  who

happens  to  find  himself on the same  side  as  Mr

Sutherland knows - why Britain does not want  to  give

up  Singapore. I would not myself be so unkind as the

Hon. the  Chief  Minister was to  have  quoted  with

relentless    vindictiveness   every    contradictory

statement made by high-ranking British Ministers  and

even  more  high-ranking Commonwealth statesmen.  But

one  thing  sticks out a mile, and that is  that  the

Britain we went to negotiate with in April this  year

was  a  Britain which was in no mood for dynamic  and

imaginative colonial policies. After the slap in  the

face  from Jordan, when they kicked out the Chief  of

the  Arab  Legion,  after  the  outburst  in  Nicosia

airfield  the day following a statement from  a  high-ranking British official that they could hold Cyprus,

whether  the  people  of  Cyprus  were  friendly   or

unfriendly,  and after the failure of British  policy

in  Ceylon  by  the  Left  Wing  election  success - of

course,  the Prime Minister is now being  invited  to

Chequers because he wants to drive the British  bases

into  the  sea - we  arrived, as the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru  (Mr William Tan) had said, to face a  hostile

English Press. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>



have  made a collection of these little articles  and

stories  meant for British consumption and,  at  some

suitable date, I think the people of Singapore should

be  told  that  what  their  statesmen  and  visiting

dignitaries tell us is not what the people in England

are being told.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we flew into London Airport, I was reading the

Daily  Mail, and the editorial, I think,  struck  the

keynote to the talks. On the front page it said:  "We

own  Singapore. Let us have none of this nonsense  of

self-government.  Here is a territory  which,  unlike

any  other  colonial  territory,  we  bought  and  we

developed. Who are these little men who now come  and

say  that  they want the country from  us?  They  are

immigrants. They came here after Britain  bought  the

place  and  we  bought  it for ever."  That  was  the

keynote of British public opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are always a reasonable people, particularly when

we  want  to  negotiate. Whatever may have  been  the

failings  of  my Party, I think nobody can  say  that

during  the  course  of  the talks,  the  P.A.P. was

unreasonable.  We were prepared to negotiate  on  the

basis  of the agreements arrived at between  all  the

Parties  before  we left Singapore. So  long  as  the

principles  agreed  upon  were  maintained,  we  were

prepared  to  be  quite  elastic  in  the  forms  and

ultimate  formulae of the final agreement.  Far  from

hardening  British opinion, as the Member  for  Tiong

Bahru  said, we, and a few Members on the  Government

side, were the only people who took advantage of  the

facilities offered by British organisations, such  as

the  Labour Party, the Movement for Colonial Freedom,

the  Colonial Fabian Bureau, to try and get our point

of  view  across.  We did not try to  cheat  them  by

saying that we loved them and wanted the British  for

evermore.  What  we said to them  and  what  we  have

already  said  here was that Asia is Asian,  that  we

want  to tie up the loose ends neatly and peacefully.

We  know  that for the time being all we can  get  is

complete  internal control, and we want it. We  tried

to  put  across the point of view that,  although  we

would do what Ceylon is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>



doing when we became free and independent, it was  in

the best interests of Britain to allow that to happen

peacefully rather than to have it happen violently. I

quoted  a  British professor to the British people - of

course, one who was disavowed long ago - who said  that

there  were  only  two  ways for revolutions - one  was

revolution  by violence, and the other was revolution

by consent. I exhorted them on innumerable occasions,

and  I  am  grateful  to  the Independent  Television

Authority  for giving us an opportunity to  tell  the

people  of Britain that their ultimate interest  lies

in an Asia which, whilst not subservient, is at least

uncommitted  in  a  world  clash  of  ideologies.  We

failed.   We  failed  because  the  British  Colonial

Secretary  could not carry his Cabinet,  even  if  he

wanted  to, and because the Cabinet could  not  carry

Tory  public opinion, even if they wanted to, because

the  Tory  Press  and  the whole climate  of  British

public  opinion was hostile. It was a  revelation  to

me. I renewed many old friendships. It was astounding

to  find  the change of political attitudes.  On  one

occasion - and this was a fair barometer of the  temper

of  the British people which we had to face and which

the British Government has to pay closer attention to

than   the   temper  of  the  people  of  Singapore - a

contemporary  of mine for whom once  upon  a  time  I

worked  in  an election, said to me, "Of  course,  we

quite agree that ultimately you ought to be free. But

if  we  get  pushed out from all our little footholds

all  over the world, then we find ourselves more  and

more helpless without American arms and bases and our

policy will be dictated by the Americans. There  must

come  a  point of time, and the point has  come  now,

when  we  must say that we intend to assert ourselves

in  this  world and we intend to stay put." That  may

not  be  what Mr Lennox-Boyd said to us  across  the

conference table, but there was nothing which he said

across  the conference table, particularly after  the

breakdown  of  the talks when I tried to  pursue  the

reasons  why  he  had  refused  our  proposal  for  a

Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>



Chairman,  that contradicts my personal feel  of  the

situation,  namely, that Britain was not prepared  to

go  any  further with this policy of freeing  subject

peoples  in  order  that they be  friends  with  her.

Britain  did  not  believe it  any  more,  not  after

Ceylon. Britain was going to make quite sure, whether

subject peoples were friendly or unfriendly, that  as

long  as  the reality of power was with Britain,  she

was going to have her way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an experience not easily to be forgotten - to

go  to these talks with a suave, polished, and a very

much  upper-upper class gentleman, putting  across  a

very  British  point  of view, extremely  polite  but

extremely  ruthless. He told our Chief Minister,  and

only  once,  in the crudest possible terms,  what  he

thought   of  the  aspirations  of  the   people   of

Singapore.  Much as I admired the polished  sharpness

of his barbed sarcasm, I left the conference table on

the 15th May determined that one day we shall go back

to  that  conference table and, from  a  position  of

strength, re-pay him the courtesies that he  rendered

us  on  this last occasion, in as polite  and  in,  I

hope, as refined and genteel a manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are grateful for the little hospitalities of life

which  were accorded us - some of us enjoyed  it  more

than  others. In fact, some have not as yet  returned

from  their  journeys.  A Negro  friend  of  mine  in

London,  who,  for the last twenty  years,  has  been

meeting  colonial delegations, came up to me one  day

and presented me with a book about a revolution in an

African colony and he said, "Of course, you know, the

British  have been doing this thing for such  a  long

time.  They will wrap you up and bathe you in a  warm

glow of hospitality and hope that in the process  you

will  forget all about the chaps you are coming  over

to fight for, and you will sign anything after that."

I  am  glad to say that the Singapore delegation,  in

spite  of  the  very  warm glow  of  hospitality  and

friendliness  and personal courtesies  which  we  all

enjoyed, decided that principles were principles, and

when  it  came  to the question of whether  Britain's

interest was paramount or the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>



Singapore's interest was paramount, they decided that

the  interest of the people of Singapore was the last

word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the talks break down? We had gone there and

we  had said beforehand that we would give up foreign

affairs  and external defence. I would not have  done

it  that way myself because I never believed that the

British  people,  being some of the most  hard-headed

businessmen  in  the  world, would  take  that  as  a

generous opening gambit and reply, "You can have  the

rest."  However, after three weeks of  beating  about

the  bush,  we  came down to brass  tacks.  What  the

British really want is to make quite sure that  while

they  allow  all  the  trappings  of  internal  self-government,  the  reality of power  was  to  be  with

Britain.  From  Governor  to High  Commissioner,  the

withdrawal  of the three ex-officio Members  and  the

Nominated  Members, and doubling the  number  in  the

Assembly - al1  the velvet glove. In  fact,  they  were

even prepared to give us international, cultural  and

trade  relations which, although it  might  not  have

allowed  us  a seat in the United Nations,  might  at

least  have  allowed  us  to maintain  some  sort  of

consular  service. But the reality of power - the  last

word was to be with their Chairman on the Defence and

Security  Council. Mr Lennox-Boyd - I have  a  healthy

respect for the gentleman's dialectical skill - put  it

over to the British public in an extremely simple and

effective way. He said, "The people of Singapore  had

come  and  said  beforehand that they would  give  us

defence and external affairs. If they give us defence

and  external  affairs, we must have the chairmanship

of   the  Defence  and  Security  Council.  This   is

eminently reasonable, and the people of Singapore  or

the   delegation   were  eminently  unreasonable   in

refusing  us  the  chairmanship of  the  Defence  and

Security Council. Therefore the talks broke down."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point the talks broke down on the 15th

of  May this year, I have not the slightest doubt  in

my mind that the final decision, to stand firm on our

proposal of a Malayan Chairman, was right. A  lot  of

water has flowed under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>



the  bridge  since that evening. The Hon. the  Chief

Minister will forgive me if, in what is after all  an

end of term sitting, I were to recall the evening  at

the  Independent Television Authority when he  and  I

both sloshed up Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd. I must say that

the   asperity  of  his  tone  then  was   completely

unadulterated by any thought of trying somehow or the

other  to  retrieve the position for the British.  He

stated  our  stand  then and he  stated  it  in  more

picturesque   language  than  I  ever  can - "Christmas

pudding  and arsenic sauce" - and as we went  down  the

lift,  he turned around to me and asked me,  "We  did

right,  did we not?" I said to him then and I say  to

him  now,  "We  did  right. We could  not  have  done

otherwise."  However  much  we  may  have  wanted  to

settle, the moment we found ourselves in that  corner

where  Britain  said, "You have three representatives

on the Defence and Security Council and I have three.

Then  I  have  the Chairman and the Chairman  with  a

decisive vote. The Council can then recommend to me

in  London  that  certain  laws  and  Ordinances  are

necessary  and I can promulgate them",  then  we  are

already  in  a position where compromise  would  mean

surrender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anybody who really sits down to weigh

up  the  political future would doubt  that,  on  the

whole, the conference was not a failure. It was not a

waste of time because it brought out the issues  into

sharper   and  more  immediate  conflict   than   any

correspondence would have done. When  we  faced  each

other across the table, despite all the gentility  of

good  breeding and good manners, we came down to rock

bottom,  namely, the desire of the British people  as

interpreted by the Tory Government to maintain -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Colonial Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Colonial Office? I make no distinction, Sir. Perhaps there is, but to

my  mind,  the  British Government runs the  Colonial

Office,  the  British Government runs  the  whole  of

Government.  The Cabinet accepted responsibility  for

this particular step



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>



because  they were convinced that their duty to  this

generation  and succeeding generations of Britishers,

let alone these natives in far away Singapore, was to

see  that Britain did not throw her possessions away.

"Look  at Ceylon. We were kind to them. We gave  them

freedom.  They never had to organise any E.O.K.A, or

'Join  Greece'  organisation  and  the  silly  cussed

little brown men threw out all their friendly leaders

and  put  in  a  lot of silly people  who  wear  this

curious  outfit  instead of wearing striped  trousers

and tails and come round to tell us that they want to

kick  us  out of Trincomalee. We then have to  invite

them to come to Chequers as we need them. And we  are

not  sure  yet  that when they come to Chequers  they

will  be  reasonable because even before  they  leave

Colombo  they  say that they are only going  to  talk

about  the procedure of how to get us out of Ceylon."

Basically,  that  was  the attitude  of  the  British

Government. I agree with the Hon. the Chief  Minister

that,  whatever  the  many  differences  within   the

delegation, they were all within the confines of  our

delegation.   Even  if  we  had  the  most   absolute

unanimity  we still would have failed. There  was  no

escape,  in the end, from the irresistible conclusion

that  Britain had decided that from now  onwards,  at

least as long as this present Government is in power,

she  was  going to stand firm on British  rights.  To

suggest,  as the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr  William

Tan)  suggested,  that if we were  only  a  bit  more

friendly  we  might  have got somewhere,  is  wishful

thinking.  However friendly we could have  been,  and

however polite and accommodating, British policy  had

already hardened before we arrived in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what was the thing which made the Federation

talks  more  successful than the Singapore  talks?  I

have  never  really  believed that  sweet  words  and

reasonableness  alone would get us  freedom.  I  have

always  believed that the British are  a  reasonable,

practical people and that they take a certain  course

of action because, for the time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>



being, it is the best course that they can take. When

confronted  with  two unpleasant  alternatives,  they

have  the knack of choosing the less unpleasant  one.

In the Federation they were faced, when the Tunku and

his   delegation  went  there,  with  the  unpleasant

alternative  of saying "No" to a mass movement  which

was basically non-Communist, and running the risk  of

having that non-Communist movement coalesce with  the

Communist  movement, which would have been fatal  for

Britain.  Faced  with that alternative,  the  British

said  to  the Tunku and his delegates, "You can  have

Merdeka by August 1957, if possible." If August  1957

comes  and  it  is  not  possible  and  that  massive

nationalist movement is still there and ready to make

it  unpleasant, not in a violent way, but in a  quiet

constitutional way, then Britain will say,  "Yes,  it

is  possible." That is the task that faces us  today.

If  we  had gone to London and (however disunited  we

were)  we  represented  a  movement  basically   non-Communist, then I say we would have succeeded. It was

not  because we did not have sufficient skill or tact

or  persuasive powers but because basically we  could

not   confront   Britain  with  a   less   unpleasant

alternative  than the Malayan Communist Party  taking

over by violent revolution. That is the task which we

have before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said when I returned that the British would always

be  ready  to open new negotiations, and indeed  they

are.  They are looking for a stooge group to sign  an

agreement  with  them. The duty  here  of  all  anti-colonial  parties is to see that no stooge  group  is

formed  to  sign  this agreement. I  think  we  shall

succeed  because when you rub an Asian down  to  rock

bottom, he gathers together and says, "Down with  the

white man." He said that for hundreds of years and it

takes  a  long time to get these things  out  of  the

system,  particularly when the  white  man  is  still

here.  That  is the challenge. We must  redouble  our

efforts.  We  must build up a movement, non-Communist

basically,  with a chance, maybe for  all  times  but

anyway for some time, of running Malaya. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>



still believe in one Malaya because we cannot run one

little  colony  or  state  of  Singapore  on  a  non-Communist or any other basis. The moment we have done

that,  we  could go back and meet the  Rt.  Hon.  Mr

Lennox-Boyd,  or  whoever his successor  may  be.  We

could  then in polite genteel language tell him  that

there  would be unfortunate consequences for  British

prestige,  power, trade and commercial  relationships

unless  our  fair, modest and reasonable demands  are

complied  with  forthwith. When that moment  arrives,

then  we  shall  get Merdeka. That is the  lesson  of

these  talks:  that, if we want to succeed,  we  must

succeed  on our own strength and not on the  weakness

of  the  other side. To a certain point, the  British

could  be  pushed.  They could be threatened  by  our

saying, "Well, all right, if you will not give it  to

me,  I will do nothing and I will let something  else

happen."  As  long as the reality of  power  is  with

Britain,  she  can  afford to  ignore  that  sort  of

threat.  But  when the reality of power shifts  to  a

nationalist movement, then the British people,  being

eminently  the most reasonable and practical  people,

will  be  the first to recognise when it is  time  to

make  a graceful exit. That is the task of all  those

who  wish  to  see a free, democratic,  non-Communist

Malaya:  to  build up that movement, so that  however

weak  and friendly and accommodating our leaders  may

be,  there are fierce men behind who will make  clear

in  no  uncertain terms what the needs and the wishes

of  the  people are. This is a setback but  it  is  a

temporary one because no doors can be closed  to  our

movement which is determined to fight on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the immediate future holds for

us.  If  the  British through their Governor  are  as

democratic  as they profess to be, then,  of  course,

the  sensible thing would be fresh elections. I  have

the  feeling  that they may not be as  democratic  as

they  profess themselves to be. Somehow or the  other

we  must go on with this Assembly. If we have  to  go

on, then let us go on in a manner befitting self-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>



respecting   representatives  of  a   self-respecting

people determined to seek their legitimate interests.

Whatever  Government  which  comes  into  power   and

pursues that policy will have the co-operation of  my

Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Another kiss of Judas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

one  of the members who supported the termination  of

the Merdeka talks, but, in fact, there is very little

for  me  to  say  especially after so many  brilliant

speakers have so clearly analysed the reasons for the

breakdown of the talks. You have heard this  morning,

Sir,  how  the  Hon. the Chief Minister  tackled  the

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support heartily the first part of the Chief

Minister's  accusation  that  the  British   Colonial

Office  was responsible for the failure of the talks,

and  I would like to place it on record; but I cannot

agree with him when he said - I do not know whether  it

is  because of party politics or whether he tried  to

be  diplomatic - that there was unity  in  the  Merdeka

Delegation. When I think of the disunity  that  there

was  in the delegation, I feel disgusted and consider

it a disgrace. I do not think it is fair of the Chief

Minister to try to cover this up. There were  reports

of disunity in the local Press and even in the London

Press after the arrival of the Merdeka Delegation  in

London. There were charges and counter-charges.  Some

members charged that a certain Party was supported by

the Communist Party, which in turn invited the retort

that  "our  leader  is  not an Asian  and  he  cannot

understand the Asian nationalist movement."  On  many

occasions,  at  tea  parties  and  public  functions,

speeches  were  made  by members  of  the  delegation

openly contradicting each other. Members of one Party

would  say,  "My  Party is the best.  The  people  of

Singapore support my Party." Then members of  another

Party  would reply, "No, the people of Singapore  are

led  by  us."  The Hon. the Chief Minister  tried  to

cover this up and said that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>



disunity within the delegation was not known  to  the

Colonial  Office. I think we should not do  that.  We

must  tell  the truth that the Colonial  Office  knew

very  well  that there were disunity and disagreement

within our delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the true state of affairs is known, that

there  was  disunity  within  the  delegation,  every

Singaporean  would  naturally  ask,  "Who  should  be

blamed for the failure of the Merdeka talks?" We have

already  heard  some  Members say  that  the  British

Colonial Office should be blamed. Others say that the

Hon. the Chief Minister should be blamed. I wish  to

tell  the  people  of  Singapore the  truth - that  all

Parties  should  be blamed, including myself.  Filthy

party  politics and party manoeuvres created disunity

in the delegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Did we indulge in party

politics?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am trying to explain. I am going to show up -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Did we indulge -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> We have heard it said that the

People's Action Party's stand had been firm from  the

start of the Merdeka talks, that they must have  what

they wanted, that they must have what they could get.

They  said that their attitude at the talks was  firm

and  determined, but the records can prove that  this

was  not  so. Had it not been for a sudden switch  in

the  stand of the delegation, I think my proposal  to

accept  the  Colonial  Office's offer  under  protest

could have been carried. With your permission, Sir, I

will  quote  extracts from the  Minutes  of  the  8th

meeting  of the All-Party Delegation held at No.  10,

Carlton  House  Terrace, London,  at  12.30  p.m, on

Monday, 7th May, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meeting then considered the stand to be taken

on  the  statement of the Legislative  Powers  to  be

retained by Her Majesty's Government as set  out,  in

the paper attached to S.C.T. (56) 9.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew (the Member for Tanjong Pagar)

stated  that as he saw it these proposals forced  the

Delegation  to  return  to  the  realities   of   the

situation. It was clear that Her Majesty's Government

would  continue to remain in Singapore by  virtue  of

force. The Delegation had therefore to condition  its

approach to meet that situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. view was to ask for internal self-government. Having conceded external defence and

external  affairs the sovereignty remained  with  Her

Majesty's Government...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His (Mr Lee Kuan Yew's) view was that if the

constitution  provided for complete  control  of  the

Civil  Service and internal security, that should  be

acceptable.  His  stand all  along  had  been  for  a

constitutional settlement. His attitude had  been  to

find  out  how  much they could get, and  if  it  was

politically  acceptable, then the  Delegation  should

take

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister asked for confirmation that he

correctly understood that the P.A.P. stand  was  that

if  Singapore could get complete control of the Civil

Service  and the Police they were prepared  to  allow

legislative  powers  to  be  in  the  hands  of   Her

Majesty's Government."



<br><br>Then the Member for Tanjong Pagar confirmed that that

was  the position - that if we got Malayanisation,  if

we  could  get control of the Police Force, we  could

allow   Her   Majesty's  Government   to   have   the

legislative powers. Of course, to be fair,  he  added

more:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . if Singapore had control of the Police

force  and  the Civil Service, it could in 18  months

organise  itself so that the British could be  thrown

out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this any different from my last proposal - that we

could return and ask for more powers in two years? So

that  was  the P.A.P. stand on the 7th of  May.  Were

they  not  prepared  to accept the Colonial  Office's

offer?  Even  if  I  can tell you off  the  record - [Interruption.] This is what the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  said  to the Hon. the Chief Minister:  "David,

why do we want to fool ourselves and fool the people?

If we allow Her Majesty's Government full legislative

powers  to suspend the constitution, why cannot  they

make a partial suspension? It is just like offering a

person  four tyres. Can you stop him using  only  one

tyre?"  That was the actual position and hon. Members

can  check  me if I am wrong. That was the  practical

example that the Member for Tanjong Pagar put forward



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>



to the head of the delegation - that we could allow Her

Majesty's Government to have a partial suspension  of

our   constitution.   That  was   the   controversial

problem - over-riding powers over our Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the question of citizenship which was

one  of  the  subjects discussed at the  delegation's

meetings.  This subject has been going on  for  many,

many  years. Before our departure for London, we  had

an  agreement that the question of citizenship should

be  included  in the talks, but when  it  arose,  the

Member  for  Ulu  Bedok (Inche Abdul Hamid  Bin  Haji

Jumat),  representing the U.M.N.O., strongly  opposed

raising  it for discussion. Imagine my surprise  when

the   Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  stated  that   "he

supported  U.M.N.O.'s stand on this  and  added  that

this  was  a purely domestic affair which should  not

affect  the  negotiations."  To  make  it  clear,  he

emphasised that "This is a minor and domestic  issue.

Do  not  discuss it at this meeting." Sir,  on, this

point -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member giving way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, are the Minutes that the

hon.  Member is reading the Minutes of the delegation

meetings or the Minutes of the conference meetings? I

think  he  should make that clear, Sir. If  you  will

forgive me, Sir, I seek this device to make it  clear

in  case  of  any  charges of misuse of  confidential

matter - using delegation Minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I think the Minutes of the

delegation  meetings are not allowed to be  divulged.

However,   I   feel   that  we   are   the   people's

representatives  and  we must not  fail  to  let  the

people know exactly what we did in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>



London.  I  do  not like a different  picture  to  be

painted.   I  now  come  back  to  the  question   of

citizenship.  In  view  of  the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar's  stand  on it at the meetings  in  London,  I

would  like to ask him this: Is he afraid of  letting

this  question of citizenship go through, which  will

mean that there will be added to the electoral roll a

quarter  of  a million middle-aged and stable  voters,

and  that  he  has  no confidence  in  winning  their

support?  That  if  citizenship  goes  through,   his

election  machinery is not going to run  smoothly?  I

hope  not, but there is a doubt in my mind and I like

to  be  sure, because suddenly the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  changed  his  attitude on  this  question  and

became  so firm and would not want any compromise  at

all. I say that only the Hon. the Chief Minister  was

the  one  who, from beginning to end, wanted a  whole

loaf  of bread, but not the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

But we are now back in Singapore and the local people

think  that  he  was the only person who  stood  firm

throughout the Merdeka talks, the only hero!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Next to the Member for Changi!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am not like that. I think it

is my duty to tell the people the truth. Just now the

Member for Tanjong Pagar has stated why we failed. He

says  we  cannot  expect to kow tow to  the  Colonial

Office in order that they will give us what we  want.

We  must be strong ourselves. Then we can get what we

want.  But  I would like to point out what the  Chief

Minister  has  pointed  out.  There  are  many,  many

political Parties - too many, in fact - in such  a  small

island as Singapore with such a small population, and

our   people  are  divided.  We  have  Socialism  and

Capitalism  and "Extremism". We have the Malays,  the

Indians  and  the  Chinese.  "Extremism",  you   see! [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Such being the case, I wonder

how the idea of the Member for Tanjong Pagar can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>



carried  out - to work for the unity of the  people  of

Singapore to the point where we are strong enough  to

fight  the British - if we have party politics  playing

such  havoc in our nationalist movement. I, for  one,

feel  this is wrong. Under the mighty call of Merdeka

all   political  Parties  should  sink  their   party

interests in favour of a nationalist movement.  I  do

not  think  it is a healthy sign, when a  country  is

struggling   for  independence,  to  have   so   many

political parties divided on so many issues.  I,  for

one,  want to be sincere in my beliefs, and as a move

towards  this  end, I now solemnly  claim  that  from

today onwards I belong to no political party in  this

House. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I solemnly proclaim that I will

have nothing to do with party politics and that I  am

going  to be an independent Nationalist. I am willing

to  be  the eyes and voice of the people, but not  of

any  Party, which is not a healthy sign and does  not

agree  with my political philosophy, until  we  fully

achieve independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a last word, I sincerely hope that we do not

regard  the Merdeka talks as a failure. I  wish  that

all  political  Parties would still remain  calm  and

united.  The  committee working  for  Merdeka  should

continue   to   work   for   the   struggle   towards

independence. We must sink all our differences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move

an amendment to the motion. I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out the words "approves the stand of its

delegation   at  the  Constitutional  Conference   in

London"  and  to insert "is of the opinion  that  the

offer  of  Her Majesty's Government should have  been

accepted  by  the  delegation at  the  Constitutional

Conference in London as an interim measure  in  view

of   the   considerable  constitutional   advancement

contained therein and in view of the urgent  need  to

restore  the  feeling of confidence and stability  to

the country and to the people".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I just examine this amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, it occurs to me that that

is  a  negation of the motion that stands in my  name

and which I moved. In the circumstances, Sir, I would

enquire  whether it is permissible under our Standing

Orders  to allow an amendment which is a negation  of

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did anticipate a move of this nature

and I have examined the position. The rule is that if

an  amendment  is a mere negation of a  motion,  then

that is out of order; but if the amendment offers  an

alternative   proposition,   then   it    is    sound

parliamentary practice. It is, in fact, the  practice

adopted  in  the  House  of  Commons  and  in   other

Legislatures. This amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this

amendment,  I  would like to acquaint the  people  of

Singapore  with the stand of the Singapore delegation

before  it  went to London. We should know  what  our

demands  were  and then, after comparing  those  with

what  we  got  from London, we would  then  be  in  a

position  to  say whether we were right in  accepting

the  proposals from Her Majesty's Government or  were

right in refusing them. I do not want to be the  sole

judge  of  this whole matter. I think the  people  of

Singapore  should know everything about it  and  then

judge the whole issue on its own merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Singapore hoped to get the following

concessions in London:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we were agreed that the Legislative Assembly

of  Singapore  should have 50 fully elected  Members.

There  should be no Nominated Members and no Official

Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, since that was the case, we asked that the

Chief Minister and the other Ministers should then be

appointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>



in the same manner as in the case of the appointments

of Ministers in Great Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we asked for citizenship rights. On this

point, we agreed that people, who have been living in

Singapore  for a long time, although they  were  born

outside Singapore, but owe loyalty to Singapore,  and

also if they would swear allegiance to Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

Will  the  hon. Member please clarify whom  he  means

when  he  says  "we" - the delegation or  the  Liberal-Socialists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> When I say "we", I mean the

whole Singapore delegation, and if you do want it -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> All right, our friend the

Member  for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng), I will  dish

it back to you!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, no. We accept it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Member for Serangoon

is speaking to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, the people who are living

here  in Singapore but who were not born here, should

be  given Singapore citizenship. That was one of  our

demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point was that the Civil Service should

be   Malayanised  in  accordance  with  the  Majority

Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four points were, in actual fact, the

substance  of  our demands. Of course,  added  on  to

that,  we  had  trimmings. We said that  probably  we

might  want  to  walk  through one  door  instead  of

through  another  door.  We  might  probably  have  a

Governor-General instead of a Governor -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is that a trimming?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I think that is, because no

matter  what  you  do,  what really  matters  is  the

substance.  If  I  am invited to a dinner  and  I  am

served  with  chicken, it is the chicken that  counts

and not the little bit of tomato or lettuce or one or

two  slices of chillies surrounding the chicken. What

we  want  is  the real substance, not all  the  other

things. However, although those were our demands,  we

agreed  amongst  the delegation that  we  would  cede

voluntarily to Great Britain the responsibilities  of

external  defence  and foreign  affairs,  except  for

trade  and commerce. Of course, later on, we demanded

a  slice  back  and  said, "No, not  only  trade  and

commerce,  but I think we will also include  cultural

relationships."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Moment of interruption.

Debate to be resumed, what day, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.

for the next day.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT'S POLICY WITH REGARD TO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT;</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>NEW FACTORIES OPENED IN 1956 AND NUMBER OF WORKMEN EMPLOYED</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether he will give details in respect of the Government's declared policy of encouraging industrial development, what the results so far achieved are, and whether he will supply a list of new factories opened in 1956, together with the number of workmen employed therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Government is keenly interested in industrial development and is anxious to assist in the setting up of new factories in Singapore. Steps that are being taken to encourage the establishment of new industries include the setting aside of areas for industrial development, notably at Toa Payoh and possibly later at Tanjong Beylaya, and proposals for the establishment of an Industrial Promotions Board to assist small-scale manufacturers and for making sites available through the Singapore Improvement Trust on reasonable terms. The possibility of reducing the cost of water supplied to industrial users is being discussed with the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary inquiries are dealt with by the Development Section of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry which will shortly be strengthened by the appointment of an Industrial and Commercial Intelligence Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exact figures relating to factories newly opened in 1956 are not available but it is known that the undermentioned factories amounting to 27 in all have been opened since January of this year. This number compares with 7 that were opened during the whole of 1955.

<div align="center"><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EDUCATION PLAN AND ESTIMATES OF ITS COST</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Education whether he will outline the stages by which the Government proposes to implement the education plan given in the White Paper, together with estimates of its cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The education policy is being implemented rather by simultaneous and continuous development over the whole field of education than by clearly defined and consecutive stages. However, since the most serious weakness in the present system is in the administration of grants-in-aid, especially to Chinese schools, attention is being concentrated first on the preliminary measures which must be taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>

before any satisfactory long term development of the grant system is possible. These measures are: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to expand the administration and the inspectorate to ensure that grants-in-aid are well spent and properly accounted for;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to assess teachers' qualifications and service not previously recognised;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to draft a new Education Ordinance and Grant Code and Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the requests from some Chinese Schools for ad hoc building grants are being considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time committees are working on the revision of syllabuses and text-books for all subjects, including Civics, and on the provision of religious or ethical instruction in all schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration is also being given to the composition of the new Educational Advisory Council, which will be formally constituted under the new Education Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evening classes for pupils who failed to gain admission to secondary schools have already started. There are now 11 classes with some 400 pupils, and the system can be greatly extended if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General development plans which have just been prepared include the building of enough primary schools to ensure that no child need leave school till he is 14; of some 4 secondary schools a year to include academic, technical and trade schools for pupils from all types of primary school; of a new Teachers' Training College similar to the Paterson Road College; and of the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These development plans, if fully carried out, would involve a capital expenditure over the next 5 years of some $70 million and an annual recurrent expenditure rising over the same period to over $100 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it should be clearly understood that this programme can only be carried out in full -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the necessary teachers can be recruited, trained and retained;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if enough suitable sites can be acquired and cleared;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if the work is within the Colony's building capacity; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if Government can provide the necessary funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to Government will also depend on how many Chinese schools are to receive full grant-in-aid.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASED STAFF, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED AND EXPENDITURE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INVOLVED FOR THE OPERATION OF DISTRICT COUNCILS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing whether he will give details of the increased staff, buildings and equipment which will be required, together with estimates of the capital and annual recurring expenditure involved, for operating four District Councils which the Committee on Local Government has recommended.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> A White Paper outlining the Government's policy with regard to the Report of the Committee on Local Government is being tabled before the Assembly. The question is therefore premature at this stage.

<div align="center"><b>ADDENDUM - GOVERNMENT PRIMARY SCHOOLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Admission and non-admission figures)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b>, pursuant to his reply to the following question for oral answer asked on 4th April, 1956 (Official Report, 4th April, 1956, Volume 1, No. 28, columns 1749 to 1750)



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Education (i) how many new students were admitted to Government primary schools at the beginning of the present school year; (ii) how many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>

students of the age of 7 years who applied were admitted and how many were refused admission; and (iii) how many students of the age of 6 years were admitted.",

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplied the following information:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 15,553.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) (a) 10,116.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) No Singapore children were refused admission. As far as the Ministry of Education has been able to discover, no children of 7 years old were, eventually, refused admission. It is true that considerable numbers whose parents failed to register them for admission within the prescribed period were in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>

first case refused. But arrangements were subsequently made to provide places for all these children in additional classes formed after the schools had re-opened. Records were not kept by schools as to numbers of non-Singapore children who were refused admission. This particular piece of information is therefore not available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) 4,849.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed that the figures in (ii) (a) and (iii) together come to nearly 600 less than that given in (i). This balance is made up partly of children born in 1947, for whom special efforts were made to create school places, and of children from outside Singapore.
