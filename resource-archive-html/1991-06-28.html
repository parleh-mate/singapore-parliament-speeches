   <b>DEVELOPMENT OF MALAYAN RAILWAY LAND</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for National Development what is the plan for the development of the Malayan Railway land currently being reclaimed and whether his Ministry will consider converting the narrow piece of land upon which the railroad track is resting into a pan-island path for recreational use such as jogging and cycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, three large pieces of Malayan Railway land at Keppel, Kranji and Woodlands have been identified for joint development by the Malaysian and Singapore Governments after the Keppel Station is shifted to either Bukit Timah or Woodlands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land at Keppel will be developed for residential and commercial use, Kranji for industrial use, and Woodlands for entertainment, residential and recreational uses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Malayan Railway lands are narrow strips of track lands which cannot be developed independently. These lands will either be integrated with the adjoining lands for comprehensive development or be used to complete planned road and drainage network.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to convert the railway track lands into a pan-island path for recreational use because such lands do not fit into our planned network of open spaces for recreation. However, where the track lands abut existing recreational facilities, we shall consider using some of them for jogging and cycling tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, will the Minister inform the House when the location of the new train station will be decided and where it will most likely be located, ie, in Bukit Timah or Woodlands?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a matter for the Malayan Railway to decide. They are looking at a site in Bukit Timah near the fire station. But as I said, they might go to Woodlands. This matter is under study by them.

   <b>RENTAL SCHEME FOR HDB FLATS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Review)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether there are plans to review the rental scheme for Housing and Development Board flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry and the HDB are finalising a review of HDB rental housing policies. The key objective remains to encourage and assist as many HDB flat tenants as possible to own their flats. At present, 80% of the population live in owner-occupied flats. Only 8% of the population, or 52,000 families, reside in HDB rental flats. With some further assistance, more tenants will be able to own their own flats. HDB is currentlyworking out various measures to facilitate this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Government's efforts to encourage and assist citizens to own their flats, there will remain a small number of families who will continue to need rental housing. The majority of rental tenants are housed in 1- and 2-room units built in the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the 1-room rental flats are obsolete and will be gradually phased out. The physical standards and quality of rental flats to be retained will be improved. This will be done, together with the upgrading of owner-occupied blocks, under HDB's Upgrading Programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is also considering a Transitional Rental Housing Scheme to cater to the needs of Singaporeans who need short-term rental housing. Such a Scheme will enable young couples who wish to set up their own families, and those awaiting completion of their home-ownership flats, find interim housing. The Scheme will be restricted to citizen families who are not existing HDB tenants and lessees, or not owners of private properties. Rental will be at market rates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full details of the various changes affecting HDB rental tenants will be announced in due course.

   <b>RENEWAL OF PAVEMENTS AND WALKWAYS IN CIVIC DISTRICT</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Expenditure)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Minister for National Development how much monies were spent in 1989 and 1990 and the amount proposed to be spent in 1991 to renew pavements and walkways and beautify the Civic District and other areas, showing the amounts for each year separately.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to renew and improve pavements and walkways in the Civic District, the Public Works Department spent $1,694,000 in FY 89 and $1,895,000 in FY 90. The expenditure includes paving, street furniture, lighting and landscaping. It expects to spend $12,797,000 in FY 91 for walkways in the Civic District and other areas in Singapore. This includes $3 million for covered walkways between

  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask the Minister, why is it necessary to keep on renewing the pavements and walkways all the time?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of these are new, for example, connections between MRT stations and population centres and between MRT stations and bus interchanges. So it is not a question of renewal. Some have to be improved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we encourage people to travel by public transport, whether by buses or MRT, we must make it convenient and pleasant for them to walk from MRT and bus stations to their final destinations. We have spent many millions of dollars improving the roads for cars and I think we ought to also spend money to make it easy, convenient and pleasant for people to walk if we are serious about encouraging the use of public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Has the Minister ever considered placing priority on the spending of funds concerning the pavements and other things?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I do not know exactly what the Member means but certainly, Sir, in view of the fact that we are always short of funds and we have limited resources, we do set priorities. We do things where they are needed most and where they can make the maximum impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Sir, what I mean is, there are other pavements all over the city. How is that all these sums of money have been spent only on Orchard Road and the Civic District?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, I hope the Member heard what I said. He asked, first of all, how much we spent in the Civic District and he also asked how much we are going to spend in the Civic District and other areas. I gave him the figure for the Civic District and I gave a much larger figure for what we intend to spend in the Civic District and other areas and I mentioned that this includes

  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will say whether the grant of $4 million to the PAP Community Foundation is a proper use of public funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Tay Eng Soon) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the grant of $4.2 million to the PAP Community Foundation is a proper use of public funds because the money will be used to help the Foundation to upgrade their kindergartens for the benefit of children in Singapore. Other kindergartens may apply for similar grants if they are properly run and have pre-school programmes approved by the Ministry of Education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Is it morally right, Sir, for the Government to spend money on a political party?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, I would like to correct the statement made by the Non-Constituency Member. This money is not being spent on a political party. It is being spent on a charitable foundation which is called the PAP Community Foundation. This Foundation is registered with the Registrar of Societies and the Commissioner ofCharities and it observes the rules governing charitable organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Is the Government prepared to make grants also to other political parties which carry on such kind of work?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, the answer to that is yes. But the political party concerned should first set up a foundation and, secondly, if they want to run a kindergarten they should show that they can run a viable and good quality kindergarten. Thirdly, if they are running preparatory year programmes which meet the standards approved by the Ministry of Education, they may also apply for the same grant.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, can the Minister say that the money spent is purely for educational purpose and not for political purposes?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Yes, Sir, the money spent will be for the upgrading of certain kindergarten centres, provision of new facilities and new teaching areas. These centres will be used for the provision of kindergarten and nursery classes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the PAP logo is used in all these kindergartens, not only on the outside but also in exercise books and sometimes even on uniforms. Is that not a political purpose?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, the Member may not have scrutinised the logo very carefully. In fact, there is a difference in the PAP Community Foundation's logo, which has the initials "CF", and that is quite different from the Party's logo. This logo has been registered with the Registrar of Societies and the Commissioner of Charities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Minister say that, in fact, the logo of the PAP Community Foundation is similar to that of the political party? The main thrust of the logo is the lightning. Is that not very clearly identified with the political party?
  <br>

  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> I would leave it to the Member to interpret. He can put any interpretation he likes, but it is distinctly different from the Party's logo.

   <b>(Allegations of insider trading)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Assoc. Prof. Maurice Choo -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To ask the Minister for Finance if he will elaborate on the recent allegations of insider trading against individuals involved in the sale of United Industrial Corporation Ltd shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Question No. 5, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in October 1990, UIC negotiated with Mr Liem Sioe Liong on two transactions:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a proposal by Singapore Land Limited, a subsidiary of UIC, to buy shares in Marina Centre Holdings Ltd (MCH) and Marina Bay Hotel Pte Ltd (MBH) from Mr Liem's private company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a proposal by Mr Liem's private company to buy new UIC shares.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiations continued through November and December, but on 21st December 1990, Singapore Land and Mr Liem's private company agreed not to proceed with the sale and purchase of shares in MCH and MBH.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22nd November 1990, almost a month after UIC started negotiating with Mr Liem's private company on the two proposed transactions and before they agreed not to proceed with the sale and purchase of shares in MCH and MBH, Mr Lee Kim Yew, Chairman of UIC, sold his personal holdings of 25.3 million UIC shares to Mr Liem. On 28th December 1990, one week after Singapore Land aborted the acquisition ofshares in MCH and MBH, Mr Oei also sold his personal holdings of 182 million UIC shares to Mr Liem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During UIC's negotiations with Mr Liem in late October 1990, Mr Oei Hong Leong, in his capacity then as chief executive officer of UIC, told Mr Liem that the value of UIC's portfolio investments had fallen by between $50 million and $100 million. However, UIC did not announce this fact publicly until 12th March 1991, when UIC published its 1990 results, which showed a provision
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of $77 million for its investment in the shares of two Japanese banks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, Mr Speaker, Sir, distinguish between the actions of UIC and of its individual shareholders, that is to say, Mr OeiHong Leong and Mr Lee Kim Yew. The question for the company is whether it has complied with the Stock Exchange's disclosure requirements by withholding the investment losses from the public until 12th March 1991. The SES considers that it did not. The Stock Exchange does not dispute the need for Mr Oei, who then represented UIC, to disclose the losses to Mr Liem for the purpose of Mr Liem's purchase of new UIC shares to be issued by the corporation. But UIC should have informed its existing shareholders at the same time. The SES has therefore censured UIC publicly for non-compliance. Besides public censure, the SES can suspend UIC shares from trading temporarily or delist the shares from the Official List permanently. But such penalties would hurt UIC's public shareholders unnecessarily.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate question is whether Mr Oei and Mr Lee, in their personal capacity as individual shareholders of UIC, infringed any legislative provision on insider trading. Section 103(11) of the Securities Industry Act states that it is a defence for a person charged with insider trading if he can prove that the other party to the transaction knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the inside information before entering into the transaction. The rationale is that when both the buyer and the seller are then on an equal footing, the other party to the transaction, knowing the information, is not therefore at a disadvantage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Oei informed Mr Liem about UIC's investment losses in late October 1990. Mr Lee sold his UIC shares to Mr Liem on 22nd November 1990. Mr Oei sold his UIC shares to Mr Liem on 28th December 1990. Thus, Mr Liem knew about UIC's investment losses before he bought the UIC shares from Mr Oei and Mr Lee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these facts and on legal advice, the SES concluded that Mr Oei
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and Mr Lee had not committed insider trading as defined under the Securities Industry Act. The SES therefore decided not to pursue the matter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reviewed the evidenceand agreed with the Stock Exchange's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for the answer. I think we can accept the explanation that there was no insider trading as alleged by many people. However, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister: is the public censure of UIC the maximum powers available to the Stock Exchange of Singapore? If this is so, would the Minister be prepared to ask the Securities Industry Council (SIC) to advise the Stock Exchange on sterner measures, other than just public censure, for serious offences of this nature?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following this, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware that the Stock Exchange of Singapore, for the moment, does not give reasons for rejecting applications from listed companies for rights, bonuses, splitting of stocks, etc. This is not in keeping with the open and consultative style of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Would the Minister be prepared to ask the Stock Exchange to give reasons for such rejections?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under present arrangements, the Stock Exchange has, as I mentioned earlier, additional powers to delist the company's shares from the main board. But this would be a very extreme measure which would hurt the shareholders more than the individuals concerned. Beyond that, I amprepared to suggest to the SIC that they should advise SES to consider other measures more appropriate for offences of this nature. But I would like to point out that the Stock Exchange is an independent body which should act on its own and both the Government and the SIC can only advise it on what procedures it should adopt. But I am prepared to suggest to the SIC that they should advise SES to consider what measures they might want to introduce in future for offences of this type.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware that, so far, the Stock Exchange has not issued reasons for rejecting applications for bonus issues and rights issues and this is a matter of some concern to the public. The MAS has, in fact, suggested to both the SIC and the SES that they should consider giving reasons if they feel that the disclosure of such reasons would be in the public interest. But again I would stress that this must be at the discretion of the SES. I have asked the SIC to consider this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister gave a statement very early in the day concerning the issue. I wonder why the Minister has taken on himself the role of a judge and pronounced that there was no possibility of insider trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, are you asking a question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Yes, that is the question. I ask why the Minister has taken on himself the role of a judge in pronouncing that there was no case for the prosecution of insider trading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question, Sir, that follows is: in view of the heat and controversy of the whole issue, would the Minister be prepared to have a special committee to look into the matter so that the whole question can be thrashed out and everybody knows exactly what is happening? Otherwise, many people will still be in the dark, especially the shareholders, as well as other people who are interested in the issue of insider trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as Minister, I have not taken on myself to decide on this issue. It is the Monetary Authority of Singapore, as a regulatorybody, which made the recommendation which I support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question on whether the MAS acted correctly is very straightforward. The MAS is the regulator of the securities industry. It routinely evaluates many cases of possible violations of the Securities Industry Act. Where there is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing, these cases are sent to either the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) or the Attorney-General (AG) for further investigation and prosecution. In other
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cases, as in the UIC case, where the evidence is clearly insufficient to support prosecution, no further action is taken. For the MAS to send each and every case to the AG's Chambers and the CAD, even when it is clear that no offence is disclosed, is to abdicate its responsibility as a regulatory body. Further, this will only overload both the CAD and the AG's Chambers with redundant work. The evidence in this case is quite clear. Mr Liem bought shares from Messrs Lee and Oei. He had all the information available on the share losses incurred by the company. The law is also quite clear in this case. So I see no further reason to refer the matter to a separate commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I ask the Minister to clarify? He said that Mr Liem was informed in late October 1990 of the losses of UIC. Was he informed orally or in writing and, if in writing, can he state the date of the letter?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I mentioned earlier in my reply to the question that the information was passed over a prolonged period during the negotiation with Mr Liem's private company which was in the process of selling shares in the Marina Centre Holding to Singapore Land. This negotiation took place over several months. As far as the actual mechanics of the transfer of information are concerned, I do not have the details. But I can assume that such information must have been passed in many forms.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have got it in my notes that the Minister distinctly said that Mr Liem was informed inlate October 1990 of the losses of UIC. I am not referring to the long period of time in which he could gather this information. That was mentioned earlier in the Minister's speech. But, in the course of his statement, he said that under section 103(11) of the Securities Industry Act, there was a good defence if the buyer knew of the losses and both the buyer and the seller would stand on the same footing. After that, he said that this information was given to Mr Liem in late October 1990. I want to know whether
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this information was given orally or in writing to Mr Liem. If it is in writing, can he give us the date of the letter?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I will repeat again. The information was transferred during a prolonged period of negotiations, starting in late October. I have no details of the actual mechanics of the transfer of information. I suggest that the Member contact Mr Liem and see whether he would like to act as his advocate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only quoting the words of the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But what is your question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is he denying that he did not say that in late October the information was given to Mr Liem? Is he saying that? I am only quoting his words?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, do you have a supplementary question?

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I say that I am entitled to clarification of what the Minister has said in his speech. Check your notes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I fail to see the purpose of this question. The crux of the matter is: was the information passed and was it passed before the sale of the shares? And the answer must be yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If the answer is yes, what is the problem of the Minister in giving me the answer I require. I have got it in my notes that he said the information was given in late October. Is he denying that he did not say this? You can check the Hansard.
  <br>
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether he will allow owners of motor-cars, which are 10years old and above at the time when the motor-car quota system was introduced, to lay up their cars for further registration without first paying for a Certificate of Entitlement after the 2 years' grace period.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Sir, under the vehicle quota system, all registered vehicles in Singapore must have a valid Certificate of Entitlement (COE). This is necessary to control the vehicle population in Singapore. When a vehicle owner deregisters his vehicle and surrenders his COE to the ROV, this COE is then added back to the pool which is made available for future tenders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle owners will be given a rebate of the cost of their COE for any period that the vehicle is not used, during the term of the COE. This would normally be due to the deregistration of the vehicle before the expiry of the COE. Such rebate would also apply to the temporary laying-up of the vehicle. This rebate is calculated on a prorated basis, according to the number of full calendar months that the vehicle is not used. The rebate would be given when the COE is surrendered back to the ROV.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, a vehicle that is laid-up temporarily will enjoy a rebate of both the road tax as well as the COE cost for the period laid up.

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All meat and meat products are imported into Singapore from approved sources. And for these sources to be approved, they have to meet certain criteria including having safe amounts of antibiotics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The checking process involves the withdrawal of antibiotics from the animals so that when they are slaughtered, there is not an excessive amount of residue in the meat. This requirement is imposed on all sources except those in Peninsular Malaysia which is our traditional source of supply of live poultry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give better protection to our local consumers, the Primary Production Department is at present discussing with its Malaysian counterparts the introduction of an accreditation scheme for poultry, similar to that for pigs. The scheme will require all farms to follow good husbandry practices which will minimise the residue problem in poultry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the phasing out of poultry slaughter in wet markets, poultry will soon be slaughtered in approved abattoirs. The Primary Production Department will conduct checks at these abattoirs to ensure that the poultry are safe for human consumption. Those farms that are found to produce poultry with excessive amounts of drug residues will be banned from further exporting to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Sir, will the Ministry consider drawing up measures to require Singapore importers and wholesalers of poultry containing excessive antibiotics to compensate persons who have been medically certified to have been harmed through consuming such poultry?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peter Sung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peter Sung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary Production Department does not have any record of persons in large numbers who have been so affected. But if there is a widespread problem of people who are so affected, we will study the problem and see what appropriate measures should be taken.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bill size averaged $277 or about $40 per day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Class C wards enjoyed an average occupancy rate of 80%, which is similar to the overall hospital occupancy rate of 77%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate survey in February also revealed that about 23% of the patients in Class C wards were actually awaiting transfer to Class B2 or better wards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the feedback from patients so far has been satisfactory. All patients in Class C wards of SGH as well as the other Government and restructured hospitals are under the charge of specialists. Their management is supervised by the specialists and other medical staff of the ward and thestandard of medical care is comparable to that of patients in other wards.

  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will give the number of credit cardholders and the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> dollar amount of credit utilised via credit cards for the years 1988, 1989 and 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of credit cards, both main cards and supplementary cards, issued in Singapore was 318,966 in 1988, 449,762 in 1989 and 609,706 in 1990. The actual number of cardholders may be smaller because each cardholder may be holding multiple cards. As for chargecards, the total number of cards issued, both main cards and supplementary cards, was 161,716 in 1988, 181,975 in 1989 and 201,002 in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total rolled over balances of credit cardholders were $14.6 million, $135.1 million and $207.2 million at the end of 1988, 1989 and 1990 respectively. The rolled over balances refer to the minimum sum which is not settled by credit cardholders by due date as well as the balance that is rolled over after settlement of the minimum sum. The total balances exclude late payments of charge cardholders who are required to pay the amounts charged to their cards by due date. The low balance at the end of 1988 was because it excluded the rolled over balances of less than one month. The information on the latter was available only from 1989 when the Monthly Statement on Credit Card Transactions was revised.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, the figures show an increasing trend. I would like to ask whether the Minister will consider taking steps to deter, prohibit or to regulate the increasing amount of credit extension by these card issuing companies since (a) such credit extension would be illegal under certain circumstances given a recent legal ruling; and (b) at the high interest rates charged, there is a strong implication that such credits arebeing used by those not able to obtain loans at lower cost and, by implication, are those least able to afford such high cost of borrowing or living on borrowed money.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the very rapid rise of credit cards and chargecards issued in recent years is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a matter of some concern to the regulatory authority, the MAS. The MAS is in the process of reviewing the whole activity. However, I should point out that it is not the Government's duty to determine how the Singapore consumer should spend his money, although we would advocate against pursuing the syndrome of spend now and pay later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is of concern to the authorities is that one of the consequences of the rapid proliferation of credit cards is that it would lead eventually to excessive credit creation by individuals who hold one or more cards and therefore multiply their credit extension. Multiple cards mean that for each card you will have a credit limit multiplied by X number of cards which you have. This could eventually lead to defaulting or write-off on bad debts. Also the experience elsewhere, particularly in the United Sates, has led us to believe that excessive proliferation of credit cards could eventually lead to fraud. So some degree of regulation might be necessary and the whole issue is being reviewed, bearing in mind that the last time the regulations were set was in 1983, at which time the credit threshold was for people with $2,000 a month and above and the age requirement was not less than 21 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he meant that the Government is concerned about fraud in credit expansion in Singapore, but not concerned about the social implications of those least able to afford credit to have such credit extension available to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The issue of the least able to pay is determined by the income limits which are imposed, and this is an issue which we are now looking at. I did overlook the question which Mr Heng Chiang Meng raised, which is the high interest rate charged. I do not consider that necessarily as a bad thing, because high interest rate would automatically restrict the amount of credit taken on the cards. On the credit cards, the cardholder is required to pay a minimum sum every month and interest is charged on the outstanding
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> balance. If the card company were to charge a very low rate of interest on outstanding balances, I would suggest that it would in fact increase the tendency to use more credit on the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, may I ask another question? I think the Minister misunderstood me. My point about high interest rates charged is to show the Minister that those who have to use credit card extension or credit have not been able to borrow funds at lower interest rates and these are normally the people least creditworthy to borrow funds at lower rates and therefore least able to afford the cost of living on borrowed money.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have made your point, Mr Heng, but what is your question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> My point is: is the Government not concerned about the social implications, rather than just the fraud and the credit expansion?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, of course, the Government is concerned about the social implications. As I said earlier, it is not the Government's job to determine how the consumer should spend his money. However, we would in fact advise all Singaporeans not to spend excessively on credit, but the control has to be a personal issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulator's problem is to ensure that credit is not excessively given and against conditions which would lead to excessive credit creation and ultimately leading to defaults and frauds. As I mentioned earlier, these issues are being looked at by MAS.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Sir, will the Minister ask the MAS in its review to inform the public how much debt is incurred by the people in Singapore or the credit that is being given to them, every year, or maybe twice a year?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The total amount of outstanding credit on credit cards is about $2.7 billion currently. The rate of default so far is not unduly worrying, although it is rising. It amounts to about $11 million write-off per year by the credit card companies, accounting for about 0.4% of total credit extended. Com-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pared to this, the situation is much more worrying in the United States where bad debt write-offs can amount to something between 4% and 5% of credit extensions.

   <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Question No. 11, Sir.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if work permit holders are allowed to hold two jobs, the main advantage is apparently to derive more work from the pool of foreign workers.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disadvantages are:
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the cost of employing the foreign workers concerned will be reduced, with adverse implications on local wages and the pressure on the employers to reduce their dependence on foreign workers. Secondly, there will be problems of accountability for the foreign worker and collection of levy from both employers.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the workers' health, safety consciousness and job performance will be affected by his eagerness to work longer hours. Under the Employment Act,
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> workers are limited to a certain amount of overtime work per month beyond which my Ministry's approval is required.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, I am not in favour of allowing work permit holders to hold two jobssimultaneously. As it is, many foreign workers are already working overtime and on shift work.

   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board was responsible for the development of sports facilities in HDB New Towns. The Stadium and Sports Complex in Serangoon New Town was supposed to have been built in 1991.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in April 1989, the development of sports facilities was transferred from the HDB to the Singapore Sports Council. The Sports Council reviewed the project proposed by HDB and only obtained approval for the construction of the Sports and Swimming Complex from the Ministry of Finance in May 1990.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders for the Stadium and Swimming Complex were called in November/December last year. The Stadium project has been awarded and this is expected to be completed in May 1993. The tender for the Swimming Complex couldnot be awarded due to the high tendered price. The lowest tender exceeded estimates by 29.8%. A consultancy firm has been employed to review the Swimming Complex project with a view to reducing costs to incorporate cheaper methods of
   <br>

   <br>
   <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are about 16,300 tenanted shops in HDB estates. Not all of these can be sold. Some are affected by redevelopment. Others which were built before 1984 can only be sold after the Housing and Development Act is amended. Still others need to be upgraded to current building and environmental standards before they can be sold. HDB is taking action on all these aspects. For those that can be sold early, HDB is working out the terms and conditions for sale and expects to be able to announce them towards the end of 1991. In working out the terms, HDB will give special consideration to sitting tenants. As many tenanted shops are involved in the programme, the sale will have to be phased over a number of years.

   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill fall into three categories. First, there are the provisions which are purely consequential to the amendments enacted earlier this year to the Constitution relating to the Office of Elected President.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill makes amendments to the provisions concerning Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs). Thirdly, the Bill amends the provisions relating to the maximum amount of election expenses which can be incurred by a candidate in an election or his election agent.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with each of these three categories of amendments.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the amendments which are consequential to the constitutional amendments enacted earlier this year. The amendments which we enacted earlier this year in this House on the Elected President provide for various aspects of the Office of Elected President. This includes the provision that a person will be disqualified from being elected as President if he is subject to the disqualifications for Members of Parliament in Article 45 of the Constitution.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 45 disqualifies a person from being elected to Parliament, inter alia, if the person is found guilty of any offence in connection with Parliamentary elections, or if the person has failed to file the return of election expenses on time and in the manner required by law. The Parliamentary Elections Act also spells out these disqualifications. Consequential amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act are therefore necessary to provide that any person who is disqualified from being elected to Parliament by reason of having been found guilty of any offence, or having failed to file returns regarding his election expenses, in connection with any Parliamentary election will also be disqualified from being elected to the Office of President.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category is NCMPs. In 1984, the Constitution was amended to provide for a maximum of six Non-Constituency MPs. Section 52 of the Parliamentary Elections Act currently fixes the maximum number of NCMPs at three, that is to say, three less the total number of Opposition Members who are elected under our first-past-the-post system.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate in the Committee of Supply earlier this year, the NCMP, Dr Lee Siew-Choh, noted that there was only one NCMP. He asked the Government to state its policy on NCMPs. To this, the Prime Minister replied that the Government intended to have more NCMPs after thenext elections, at least four and perhaps six.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this objective, the Parliamentary Elections Act has to be
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> amended. The Bill therefore amends section 52 of the Act to enable the President, by Order in the Gazette, to increase (to a number not exceeding six) the number of NCMPs to be declared elected for the purpose of any general election. Any such Order must be made between the time of dissolution of Parliament and Nomination Day. Such Order will lapse at the following dissolution of Parliament. If no Order is made or no Order is in force, the number of NCMPs will remain as currently prescribed, ie, three less the total number of Opposition MPs elected.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic trigger mechanism for deciding how many NCMPs will in fact be declared elected is not changed, ie, Parliament will have to see first the number of Opposition MPs returned. Thus, if the maximum specified in the Order is five NCMPs, then the actual number of NCMPs will be five less the total number of Opposition MPs returned in the general election, that means successful candidates.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next general election, Government's intention is that the provision should be made for four NCMPs.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third category of amendments. Section 69 of the Parliamentary Elections Act presently prohibits candidates in a general election or a by-election and their election agents from incurring expenses in respect of the conduct or management of the election in excess of $6,000 or 50 cents per elector on a register of electors, whichever is the greater.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This maximum amount was fixed in 1954 and has not been revised since. In view of the depreciation in the value of money over time and rising costs, this limit should be reviewed. It is therefore proposed to raise the maximum amount a candidate or his election agent can incur in respect of the conduct or management of an election to $12,000 or $1 per elector on a register, whichever is the greater. Although the maximum permissible amount on election expenses is a matter of detail, at present it can only be amended by an Act of Parliament. It is proposed to set out the new maximum amounts in a new Third
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Schedule which can be amended subsequently by order in the Gazette by the Minister responsible for the Parliamentary Elections Act. No order to amend the Schedule can be made during the period between the issue of a writ of election and nomination day. If the electionis contested, no order can be made between the issue of a writ of election and polling day. This is to prevent changes to the amounts during an election.
   <br>

   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this change is timely. It was in 1954 that the expenditure during the general election or by election was set at the limit of $6,000 or 50 cents per elector, whichever is the greater. It is obvious that this is insufficient at today's prices. Indeed, it is my observation that many of the volunteers and party supporters have spent money out of their own pocket during election campaign, for example, in relation to meals. To them, we owe a vote of thanks for their commitment to democracy, be they in the PAP or Opposition parties. The proposal to double this expenditure limit to $12,000 or $1 per elector is realistic but not excessive. Sir, in our meetings with parliamentarians from overseas, they have often remarked on the low cost of electioneering in Singapore and applauded us for having the foresight to introduce this legislation. I believe that the new limits will be sufficient yet still not allow money to be a barrier to any potential election candidate. It will at the same time not be excessive to allow for unnecessary expenditure.

   <i>NCMPs</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1984, the Constitution was amended to provide for a maximum of six NCMPs. Section 52 of the Parliamentary Elections Act currently fixes that maximum number of NCMPs at three, that is, three less the total number of Opposition Members elected under the first-past-the-post system. The Prime Minister has said that he intends to have at least four to six after the next general election. The present amendment before us proposes to enable the President to increase the number of NCMPs through an Order made between the time of dissolution of Parliament and nomination day. Each order will lapse at the next dissolution of Parliament.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek clarification as to what are the guiding principles for fixing this number. I agree that for the number to be set between the dissolution of Parliament and nomination day is an appropriate time and is fair play. However, I believe that there must be some set criteria by which the number is fixed. If it is the intention to err on the side of caution, then we should at this time categorically state this to be the reason. Alternatively, the number could be increased by one NCMP per general election over the subsequent general elections till the maximum number of six is reached, and then review the success or otherwise or relevancy of the NCMP system at that time.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the Member for Fengshan who said that the money allowed at 50 cents per elector or $6,000, whichever is greater, is not enough. From my experience, the amount allotted at the present rate is more than enough. In fact, there is really no justification to increase the expenses for a parliamentary candidate. I have been involved altogether in five parliamentary elections - four of them in general elections and one in a by-election. I have not only taken part in those elections with the amount allotted and campaigned not only in those elections but also campaigned them successfully with the
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> amount at the present rate. In fact, in all of the elections, I have not spent more than half of the amount allowed. My constituency comprised about 18,000 voters and I have never spent near to the $9,000 allowed. In three of them, it was about a quarter, for the fourth, it was about half, and for the last election, it was about 80% of the amount allowed. Therefore, it proves that the amount is really sufficient.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this Government has always prided itself that the politics in Singapore is not money politics. It has often said that anyone, not necessarily a rich man or a millionaire, could take part in a parliamentary election. Why not keep it that way? I think that is the best way to maintain democracy and not make politics into a rich man's game or to be supported by interest groups like in other European countries.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we need to increase the amount allotted for each candidate to spend? Is the PAP now short of volunteer workers? Do they have to rely now on money to carry out their campaigns? Do they want more money for advertisements on TV? Or do they want to employ professional advertisers to carry out the campaigns for them? If not, why do they need this extra money? As it is, each candidate already has to pay something like $4,000 deposit in an election. And of course everybody knows that the PAP is a rich political party whereas the Opposition has to live and work with volunteers.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Member for Fengshan said is perfectly correct. In fact, many of the Opposition volunteers who have helped in the election campaign have to pay for their own meals, provide their own vehicles and pay for the petrol to run their vehicles. Why not? If they have a cause to fight, I do not think they will begrudge the amount. As regards the NCMPs, at this juncture, where there is a very basic political change in Singapore, I really do not think that this amendment to the NCMPs will have effect. I think the Government is very presumptuous that they will win nearly all the seats again. But I can tell this
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> House that the situation in Singapore has really changed, and it really makes no difference, whether you are going to allow four or five NCMPs. It does not make a difference because we do not need them, and we will see that there is no need for NCMPs at the next general election.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister has said, the Bill serves to provide -
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for more NCMPs if the PAP so wishes;
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) for increased spending by candidates in the elections; and
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) for legislation for the election of a President in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the increase in the number of NCMPs. In 1984, amending the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act, the Senior Minister, then Prime Minister, had assured the House that there would be at least three Opposition Members of Parliament, and that the number of NCMPs could be increased to six. Though only two Opposition MPs were elected in 1984, the Government nevertheless did not increase the number of Opposition Members to "at least three", as the then Prime Minister had categorically assured the House. This really came as no surprise, as the PAP could rarely be depended on to keep its word on important issues.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the Bill is to enable the President to vary the number of NCMPs from four, as explained by the Minister, to at most six. Excepting for the possibility of the President being able to vary the number of NCMPs, there is practically no difference between the position following the present amendment and the original position before the amendment. Of course, as Mr Chiam has emphasised, there may be no further occasion for NCMPs in future. If there should be occasion for NCMPs again in the next elections, we shall then have to see how the PAP lives up to its word this time.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the question again arises. Why does the PAP institute the system of NCMPs, and incidentally also NMPs?
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCMPs were introduced following Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam's victory in the Anson by-election in 1981 and the subsequent feverish attack unleashed by the PAP
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> against the then lone Opposition MP. When the attack against the lone MP brought in its trail adverse publicity for the PAP, and it was severely criticised for its intolerance to fair and legitimate criticism, the PAP came outwith the answer of the NCMP. It was clearly an attempt to assuage and appease popular discontent, and an attempt to show that the PAP was not intolerant to opposition and criticism; that it would indeed like to have an Opposition in Parliament; and that it was even willing and ready to initiate the NCMP system to give the Opposition an opportunity to have its own representatives to ventilate its viewpoints in Parliament. But there are also criticisms against the NCMP system. Some people have called the NCMP a second-class MP, and I do not blame them for saying so.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such being the case, Sir, my suggestion is that, if the PAP feels that there should be more Opposition Members to voice non-Government viewpoints, then the correct and proper thing to do is, as I have stated on another occasion, to institute the system of proportional representation in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is well-known, Sir, the present electoral system of first-past-the-post winner is a most undemocratic and unfair electoral system. It brings about unfair and unequal representation of the true wishes of the voters. Elections in Singapore and the unequal representation in the Singapore Parliament are concrete examples of such unfair and undemocratic elections par excellence.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the PAP willing to forgo the present unfair electoral system for one which the people of Singapore may have fair representation in Parliament? In view of the Prime Minister's call for an open, democratic and consultative government, is the Governmentwilling to appoint a special committee to look into the desirability or otherwise of proportional representation in Singapore? Dare the PAP take up the challenge to find out the views of the people of Singapore?
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of raising the maximum amount a candidate may spend in the conduct of an election, it would seem that the Government is opening the door
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> for Singapore parties to plunge into the realm of money politics. The PAP is of course fabulously rich, and it hopes to benefit from such money politics in Singapore. But we must ask: Is it a wise thing to do? Hitherto, a candidate gets elected because (i) the policies of his or her party, supported by its organisation and propaganda apparatus, gain popular support; and (ii) the candidate is seen as the most capable and most able to represent and ventilate the views of electors in Parliament. And since 1963, and especially over recent years, the PAP, with its control over the mass organisations and its monopoly of the mass media, has overwhelming advantages over Opposition parties. Nevertheless, with the rising political consciousness of the people, it has lost ground.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Votes for the PAP have declined, and votes for the Opposition have increased. In fact, Opposition votes accounted for nearly 40% of total popular votes in the 1988 election. Come 1992 or 1993, who knows how many more votes the PAP will lose to the Opposition and how many the Opposition will gain?
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With inflation and increasing cost of printing, costs of conducting an election campaign will certainly go up a little. But Opposition parties with all their disadvantages have managed somehow to keep their election spending to a very small sum. Not the PAP. The PAP spends much more. And the Bill will enable the PAP to spend still more in its campaigns to win votes. If the spending of $1 for each elector on the electoral register is allowed, a candidate would be able to spend $18,000 or $20,000 in a constituency of, say, 18,000 or 20,000 electors. Will spending such a large sum not open the door to abuse of treating and other forms of electoral bribery and corruption?
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new amendments, political parties like the PAP which can afford to spend freely, could easily change clean healthy election practices into pure money politics. That is to be deplored. And Government should not initiate such electoral provisions simply because it has advantages over Opposition parties and
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> can benefit from such dirty money politics. Hitherto, the present maximum amount of $6,000 allowed per candidate has worked quite well. Mr Chiam has told us of his experience. Similarly, I can say that in the Barisan Sosialis in the old days, and in the Workers' Party today, we do not spend even half the amount that is legally allowed.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one from political parties, so far as we know, other than from the PAP itself, has complained that the amount for an election campaign is insufficient. The maximum amount for electoral campaign should therefore be maintained for the time being or, at most, be increased only slightly.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item in the Bill is to prepare legislation for the election of the President. Though the amendments appear to be procedural and consequential, as the Minister has said, nevertheless, to the PAP, the amendments are of the utmost importance. Without these amendments to sections 55, 61 and 79 of the Act, it will not be able to proceed with the election of the President. They are to be introduced by the Presidential Elections Bill today. After this, the election of the President may be held when the incumbent President steps down. Or the election of the President may come together with the 1992 or 1993 general elections. Whatever it may be, it will be interesting to know how much a presidential candidate will be allowed to spend in the elections. If there should be a million electors, would the candidate be allowed to spend $1 million in his election campaign? That would be real money politics as we see in the presidential elections of the United States today.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the Bill, the PAP has now introduced that into Singapore. All because it has lost confidence in being able to gain the people's support in its rule over Singapore. But that will not stop the downward trend of popular support for the PAP, as mentioned by Mr Chiam, and as already evident since the 1981 Anson by-election, and especially seen over the last two elections in 1984 and 1988. Nor will it be able to stop the upward trend of popular support for
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Opposition parties, with more and more Opposition members being elected to Parliament.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in replying to the points which have been raised, first, let me take the points which have been made by Members on the question of NCMPs. Dr Arthur Beng asked about the criteria and whether we can fix it at a particular formula. Mr Chiam, of course, consistent with his Party's position on the question of NCMPs, is opposed to the very idea of NCMPs. And Dr Lee Siew-Choh is in a very odd position of having, in the same breath, to recall his Party's opposition to the NCMPs and yet square this with his recent request to ask for more NCMPs.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replying to Dr Arthur Beng, Members know that when we introduced the NCMP by constitutional amendments in 1984, we stated that we recognised that this was a novel, unprecedented constitutional device for the airing of different views in this House other than the Government views, or views of the party in power. And we said, at that time, let us see how it works in practice. Opposition parties - Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), Workers' Party (WP) and even Singapore United Front (SUF) - opposed vehemently. In the 1984 elections, there were no takers. It was offered to the highest defeated candidate, Mr M.P.D. Nair, of the Workers' Party. They claimed that it was hypocritical, undermined the whole system of parliamentary democracy and so the WP rejected it. It was then offered to Mr Tan Chee Kien and the SUF also rejected it.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, the Workers' Party made an about turn. What was the result? The result was that we now have Dr Lee Siew-Choh in this House, a defeated candidate in the elections, but making speeches, expressing viewpoints, often sharply critical of the Government. But there has been movement. It has shown that the NCMP concept does allow an Opposition party's representative, although not successful in the elections, to be in this Chamber to take on the Government. So from a total rejection of the NCMP concept, the NCMP of the
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Workers' Party here has asked for more NCMPs. Well, fine. It may be that Mr Chiam has a crystal ball and he may be right that we may never need NCMPs, but we said, let us agree to Dr Lee Siew-Choh. But should itbe 4, 5 or 6? Our view is that there should be some flexibility.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various factors would obviously have to be taken into account, for example, how many Nominated MPs will there be in the Chamber? If there are no Nominated MPs, then perhaps the case can be made up for a greater number of NCMPs. Also what is the stand of other political parties? If others, like the WP, accept the NCMP concept, maybe then again, there would be a case for increasing the number to more than four. But for the time being, as I have said, the Government intends to increase it gradually and the intention is for four NCMPs for the next elections.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn now to the question of election expenses. Mr Chiam is trying to make the point that there is no need for this amendment because he and the other Opposition parties have managed to work within the limit. That is fine too. But in narrating the expenses that he has achieved over the different elections, he was first able to confine his expenses to half the limit, then it increased. In the last election, he reached 80% of the limit which shows that in the next election, it may be 90% or 99%. The reasons for this amendment are as I have given in my speech.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both Mr Chiam and Dr Lee Siew-Choh have bandied the phrase "money politics" without defining "money politics". How is this amendment going to bring about money politics? What do they mean by "money politics"? My understanding of the term "money politics" is that someabuse it as people entering politics for purposes of enriching themselves. How does this amendment entitle that? Some may also want to use it. To me, money politics is, in a sense, bribery, treating or other illegal practices. How does this amendment permit that? There are very strict
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> provisions in the Parliamentary Elections Act on election offences, unauthorised activities and corrupt offences for the purposes of the elections, which include carefully defined offences on bribery, treating and illegal election activities; all of which are not affected by this amendment at all. So I would like to hear from them as to how this amendment brings about money politics. All it does is that it revises the figure which was introduced in 1954.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just touch on another point on NCMPs. Dr Lee Siew-Choh started off his speech by saying that the Government went back on its word when it introduced the amendments in 1984. True, the Prime Minister said, when he moved the amendments, that the Constitution provided for a maximum of six NCMPs and the Parliamentary Elections Act, to start with, provided for three NCMPs. Dr Lee Siew-Choh said we went back on our word because we have not brought about three NCMPs. But he has misunderstood the concept of NCMPs. It does not mean that, regardless of the result of the elections, there will always be three NCMPs because if there is one member who is returned successfully, like Mr Chiam in the first-past-the-post system, then there is only provision for two NCMPs. Or if, as happened in one case, there were two who were returned after the general election - Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr Chiam - there would be scope only for one. In other words, whatever number, whether it is three or four or six, as prescribed by the Parliamentary Elections Act, it is that number less the number of successfully returned Opposition candidates. So there is no going back on its word by the Government in this regard.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the points raised by Dr Lee Siew-Choh on the Elected President, I think it is more appropriate to raise these pointsunder the debate on the Presidential Elections Bill that we will have at the next sitting.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I believe the Minister wants an explanation of the meaning of "money politics". I think money politics can best be seen in America where they have to spend vast amounts to win an election campaign. How do they do it and why do they
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> need large sums of money? Because they want to buy air time on television. I do not know whether this Government is going to change the rules in regard to electioneering in Singapore. If they are going to allow advertisements in regard to election campaigns in Singapore, then that is where money politics will come in, where you can advertise and you can put your message into every living room in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a four-Member constituency, or even a three-Member GRC, there would be enough money to do this kind of campaigning, because if you have three, I believe it is about 30,000 to 35,000 voters in each of the GRCs. If you have four, you add another $20,000, it is $50,000. That is quite a lot of money. But where do they get this money from? From, of course, interested parties, business people, people who have an interest and they want certain Members to get in to voice their own interests. And this is where money politics comes into play. So I hope Singapore's politics will not degenerate into that kind of politics. I think we have been doing very well, spending just enough money to campaign and using a lot of willing helpers and volunteers who believe in a cause and not with a money sign in them to come into politics. I hope this amendment will not degenerate into having bigger amounts allowed for each parliamentary candidate.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Let me also say a few words about money politics, Sir. I have said in my speech that the Bill will open the door to abuse, ie, it has not come about yet in actual fact, but who knows. At the present moment, already $4.2 million has been given to the PAP Community Foundation. Is this not one of the ways to influence the voters to vote for the PAP? Is this not part of money politics and using Government money on top of that?
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aside, the Minister has said that in 1984 there was scope for only one NCMP after two Opposition MPs were elected. True, I mentioned that myself. Since two were elected, how was it that there was no NCMP to become the third Opposition MP? If there were no three Opposition MPs, then surely the Govern-
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> ment had gone back on its word to have "at least three Opposition MPs," whatever the type of Opposition MPs they might have been. Two were elected and therefore one should have been an NCMP, but it was never offered down the line. Therefore, let me remind the Minister, his memory is failing him.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that I have not asked for more NCMPs. I have only asked whether the Government will live up to its promise, to what it says. What I have asked for is proportional representation, because that will give equal, fair, representation to the voters in Singapore. The whole world is going towards proportional representation. In Britain itself, the people are asking for proportional representation. In Japan too. And even Prince Charles has put in his word to support proportional representation. If the Government is really keen to have more Opposition MPs, that would be a fair way to go about it. And there will be no need for people to say that the NCMPs are just second class MPs and NMPs are third class MPs. Would the Minister not be happy to have such a situation?
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, he has also mentioned 1988. I cannot say that we have completely turned around. There was the popular demand that there should be more Opposition MPs, whatever the occasion. For me, I feel that we should make use of every available opportunity to voice our party views as well as the viewpoints of the public and give vent to their grievances. Thus more and more people will know what Opposition people think about and say. Hence, the need to have NCMPs if we fail to win in the first-past-the-post election.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I apologise to Dr Lee Siew-Choh for not replying to him on proportional representation because my reply would have been similar to what the Prime Minister stated only a few months ago. Dr Lee Siew-Choh raised this on 13th March 1991 in this House and said exactly what he has said just now. But this question has been effectively replied to by the Prime Minister when he pointed out that proportional representation -
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> He did not convince me.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It may not be
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> convincing to Dr Lee Siew-Choh, but the point is, as the Prime Minister said, if you have proportional representation in Singapore, you will in fact be concocting a brew that will blow up our multi-racial harmony, because you will have political parties which are based on race, religion, language. We cannot afford it and he pointed out that no Commonwealth nation has proportional representation. He also pointed out and asked Dr Lee Siew-Choh to look at the dismal experience of those European countries which had proportional representation and the frequent changes and musical chairs which take place there.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On NCMPs, Dr Lee Siew-Choh's memory needs to be jogged. He says that he never asked for more NCMPs. Let me quote what he said on 29th November 1989 [Hansard, Vol. 54, No. 8, col. 752]:
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Presently, we have one elected MP and one, or if you like, two NCMPs. So we have room for another three or four NCMPs. Therefore it would be logical to have more NCMPs as a first step.'
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 29th March 1990 [Hansard, Vol. 55, No. 15, col. 1026], he said:
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the Government feels that there should be more Opposition MPs, all it has got to do is to increase the number of NCMPs, to make up the total number of Opposition MPs to six.'
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of election expenses, I agree with Mr Chiam that we should not go the way of the United States. But this amendment that we are making is to increase the 1954 figure to $1, and I do not see how it can make us go the way of the United States.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Clarification, Sir. The Minister has said something about my asking for an increase of NCMPs, from three to six. True, Sir, I said that, but in the context of the Government's proposal to have NMPs. I suggested that if there was a need to have more Opposition Members, surely it would have been better to have elected or near-elected MPs than Nominated MPs. That was why I asked for an increase from three to six. But I did not ask for more NCMPs per se.

    <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
   </div>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 1991 gives legislative effect to income tax changes announced in the 1990 Budget Statement and four other tax changes not announced in that Statement. I announced a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 32% to 31% with effect from Year of Assessment 1991 to ensure that our tax structure remains competitive. The reduced rate will also apply to trustees and non-residents. As a corollary to the reduction, any dividend paid on or after 1st January 1990 will carry a credit of 31%. Clauses 13, 17, 18 and 19 amend sections 43, 44, 45 and 46 respectively to give effect to these changes.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax incentive was proposed to encourage multinational corporations to setup Finance and Treasury Centres (FTCs) in Singapore to perform their
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> treasury, investment and financial services for their own account and for companies in their group. With effect from Year of Assessment 1991, income accruing to an approved FTC from trading in foreign exchange, offshore investments and provision of financial services to related companies will be taxed at a concessionary rate of 10%. Dividends declared out of such income will be exempt from tax. Clause 16 inserts a new section 43G to enable the Minister to make regulations providing for this incentive and clause 4 amends section 13B to provide for the tax exemption on dividends.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another tax incentive was introduced to develop Singapore as a global entrepot and to promote international trading of major commodities in Singapore. The income of an approved international commodity trading company derived from transactions in commodities and commodity futures will be taxed at a concessionary rate of 10% with effect from Year of Assessment 1991. Dividends declared out of such income will be exempt from tax. Clause 16 inserts a new section 43H to enable the Minister to make regulations providing for this incentive and clause 4 amends section 13B to provide for tax exemption on dividends.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidelines were drawn up to regulate the tax treatment of finance leasing transactions. They would determine, for example, whether a finance lease of a machinery or plant should be treated for tax purposes as a genuine lease or as a sale, and whether capital allowances for the asset should bemade to the lessor or lessee. Clause 2 inserts a new section 10D to enable the Minister to make regulations relating to the tax treatment which will apply to finance leases entered into on or after 1st April 1990.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage offshore leasing activities, clause 16 inserts a new section 43I to provide that the income of a leasing company derived from offshore leasing of machinery or plant shall be taxed at the concessionary rate of 10% with effect from Year of Assessment
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> 1991. Dividends declared out of such income will be exempt from tax and clause 4 amends section 13B for this purpose.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, underwriting profits derived by an insurance company from insuring offshore general risks and the interest and dividends derived from investing such profits are taxed at a concessionary rate of 10%. To promote further growth, I announced that with effect from Year of Assessment 1991, the 10% concessionary rate will apply to offshore interest and dividends derived from investing the whole of the shareholders' funds which are used to support the offshore insurance business. Clause 8 amends section 26 to provide for this change.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar incentive was proposed to promote offshore life insurance business. With effect from Year of Assessment 1991, a concessionary tax rate of 10% will apply to offshore interest and dividends derived by an insurance company from investing its offshore life fund and shareholders' funds supporting the offshore life business. Clause 14 amends section 43C to enable the Minister to make regulations providing for the incentive. Clause 8 amends section 26 to deal with income from offshore life insurance business and to require insurance companies to maintain separate accounts for such income.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Approved Operational Headquarters (OHQs) are taxed at a concessionary rate of 10% on their income from providing management, technical or other supporting services to their related companies. In the course of providing such services, OHQs may also derive income from trading in foreign exchange and offshore investments, on their own account. To encourage these high value-added treasury, investment and financial activities, the 10% concessionary rate will be extended to income derived from such activities with effect from Year of Assessment 1991. Clause 15 amends section 43E to provide for this extension of the OHQ incentive.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax incentives are given to OHQs and FTCs to service the needs of their related companies, including managing their funds. However, overseas companies
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> would not have their funds managed from Singapore if income arising from these funds were to be taxed. Therefore, as a feature of the OHQ and FTC incentives, income of a non-resident person arising from funds managed by an OHQ or FTC will be exempt from tax. Clause 5 amends section 13C to enable the regulations to be made to provide for the tax exemption.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage families to have their second child earlier, a special tax rebate will be given from Year of Assessment 1991 for a second child born on or after 1st January 1990 before the mother reaches 31 years of age. The rebate will be $20,000 if at the time of birth of the child, the mother is below 28 years of age, or $15,000 if she is below 29, $10,000 if she is below 30, and $5,000 if she is below 31. The rebate can be used to set off against either or both of the parents' income tax liabilities, but must be utilised within seven years. The time limit within which the existing tax rebates in respect of a third child and a fourth child may be claimed is also extended from five years to seven years. Clause 12 amends section 42A to give effect to these changes in tax rebates.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Year of Assessment 1991, the tax relief in respect of an aged parent or grandparent or a disabled sibling or child will be increased from $2,500 to $3,500. This is to further encourage families to care for their aged and handicapped dependants. Clause 10 amends section 39 to increase the tax reliefs. To encourage married women to continue working and raise families, a relief for the foreign maid levy will be given against the earned income of a married woman. This relief is also available to separated, divorced or widowed women with children. It is twice the amount of maid levy paid in a year in respect of one foreign maid and is available from Year of Assessment 1991. Clause 10 amends section 39 to provide for the relief.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage a self-employed person to save more to provide for his own needs when he retires, tax deduction has beenallowed for his voluntary contributions to the Central Provident Fund,
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> subject to a limit. I have announced that the limit for the tax deduction for Year of Assessment 1991 will be raised to 15% of assessable income from self-employment, subject to a maximum of $10,000. In comparison, the previous limit was 10% of assessable income, subject to a maximum of $7,200. Clause 10 amends section 39 to increase the limit for tax deduction.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to four other tax changes which were not announced in the 1990 Budget Statement. Two of them are consequential amendments needed as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 31%. The other two amendments are necessary to fine tune the existing provisions in our tax legislation.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 9 amends section 35(2A) to provide for Singapore dividends derived by a person during 1989 to be assessed to tax at 32% for Year of Assessment 1990 in cases where such dividends would otherwise, by virtue of his accounting period, be assessed to tax at 31% for Year of Assessment 1991. This is to avoid a mismatch arising from the reduction in the corporate tax rate whereby dividends derived in 1989 are taxed at 31% while tax credits of 32% are allowed on such dividends. This is a consequential amendment required to be made together with a reduction in the corporate tax rate.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment consequential to the reduction in the corporate tax rate limits the highest effective tax rate imposed underPart B of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act to 31%. This will ensure that those who are taxed under the existing Part B rates, such as management corporations and clubs, will in effect not be taxed above the corporate tax rate of 31%. This was announced in a press release immediately following the 1990 Budget Statement. Clause 11 amends section 42(5) for this purpose.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment concerns tax exemption for a shipping enterprise. Currently, section 13A provides for tax exemption on the income of a shipping enterprise derived from the carriage of passengers or goods by Singapore ships.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> As a logical extension and in order to encourage Singapore ships to provide similar offshore services, clause 3 amends section 13A to extend the tax exemption to include income from towing or salvage operations carried out by Singapore ships. The extension will take effect from Year of Assessment 1991.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, capital expenditure incurred on installing a stand-by generator will be allowed to be written off in one year. A stand-by generator would be useful in providing electrical power in an emergency situation as well as for normal business operation. As an encouragement for the installation of a stand-by generator in an office or factory to supply electrical power in the event of a power failure, clause 7 amends section 19A to provide for an allowance of 100% in respect of the capital expenditure incurred. This will take effect from Year of Assessment 1990.

   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1991 was passed by Parliament on 3rd January 1991 and assented to by the President on 18th January 1991. Arising from this, it is necessary to amend the Financial Procedure Act (Chapter 109) to take into account the newfinancial provisions introduced by the constitutional amendments. As Members know, the purpose
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> of these new financial provisions is to protect Government's reserves.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make the necessary consequential amendments. It also proposes some other amendments that either reflect current practice or are of a drafting nature.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I will now highlight the principal amendments.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words "other than land" in the long title of the Act are proposed to be deleted. This is so that public property referred to therein would include immovable public property. This is necessary as immovable public property such as land will be included in determining Government's reserves.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 2A is proposed to provide for the appointment of the Accountant-General. This is in line with the new Article 22 of the Constitution. New section 2B spells out the duties of the Accountant-General.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 of the Act is proposed to be amended to include gold and bullion in the list of assets that public funds may be invested in, and to disallow investment in any stock, bond, fund or security issued by the Government. This is to reflect current practice.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8(1) of the Act is proposed to be amended to allow the creation of deposit accounts for the proper accounting ofmoneys received but which are not revenues of Singapore. Currently, there is no specific authority for the opening of deposit accounts for accounting of moneys like confiscated gambling money and security deposits.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Act is proposed to be amended to reflect the current practice of including moneys for the purpose of making advances in the Annual Estimates submitted to Parliament for approval.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment is proposed to section 11(2) to provide that the Minister may make advances from the Contingencies Fund only with the concurrence of the President. This amendment is consequential to Article 148C of the Constitution.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential amendments are also proposed to section 12 of the Act to provide that the Minister may authorise issue of moneys from the Consolidated Fund in the following circumstances:-
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to meet expenditure appropriated by a Supply or Supplementary Supply law or any other law or approved by resolution of Parliament in accordance with Article 148A(2) of the Constitution;
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to meet expenditure approved by a resolution of Parliament in accordance with Article 148B(1) or Article 148B(2) of the Constitution with which the President concurs;
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to meet expenditure approved by the Cabinet in accordance with Article 148B(4) of the Constitution should there be no Supply Law by the first day of a financial year.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Act is proposed to be repealed and re-enacted to provide that no guarantee shall be binding on Singapore unless it is given with the written authority of the Minister with the President's concurrence or in accordance with law. The section also provides that no loan raised by the Government shall be binding unless it is raised in accordance with Article 144 of the Constitution.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, section 18 of the Act is proposed to be amended in keeping with Article 147(5) of the Constitution. This imposes a duty on the Minister to furnish, togetherwith the annual financial statements, a statement of outstanding guarantees and other financial liabilities of Singapore at the end of the financial year. It also requires the Minister to present to the President the audited accounts and financial statements together with a statement stating whether the audited accounts and statements show any drawing, or likelihood of drawing, on the reserves of the Government not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office.

    <b>NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL BILL</b>
   </div>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Acting Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>The Acting Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed National Arts Council Bill seeks to establish a statutory board which will enable the Government to better support the development of the arts in Singapore. The development of the arts in Singapore is an important part of the next phase of our overall national development.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arts Council will serve as a catalyst. It will support arts groups directly and indirectly and encourage other organisations and members of the public to do likewise. It will promote widespread appreciation of the arts in Singapore and encourage public recognition of artistic achievements in our society.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government will give full backing to the Arts Council, it is very important that the private sector, both private citizens and corporations, also give their full support. For the arts to flourish, we need a tripartite working relationship between thearts community, the private sector and the Government. It will be the job of the Arts Council to help build up this tripartite relationship. Much has already been done but much more needs to be done.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hub city of the world, our ambition should be to make Singapore an international centre of the arts. If the arts are only by Singaporeans for Singaporeans we will at best be mediocre. Our basic approach must therefore be to supplement local talent with foreign talent, especially Asian talent, and target not just the Singaporean market but also the region. In this way, we will also make our contribution to the development of the arts in the region. We
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> should invite eminent foreigners in the arts world to help us in the Arts Council either as members or as advisors.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Structure of the Council</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in April 1989, the Advisory Council on Culture and the Arts recommended the formation of the Arts Council. The Advisory Council proposed that the Arts Council should be a company to give it maximum operational flexibility. Such an agency need not be subject to civil service constraints.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a non-profit company, we now propose to form the Arts Council as a statutory board. This will better reflect its public purpose and national character. A statutory board formed by Parliament will enjoy higher public status than a company.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give maximum autonomy to the Arts Council. It will formulate its own personnel policies, so that the right people can be engaged, retained and developed. There is a shortage of trained and experienced arts administrators in Singapore, a shortage that is beginning to retard the development of the arts. The Arts Council will help to build up such a core of administrators to meet the growing needs of the arts sector.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Government financial support, the Arts Council will be free to raise its own revenue. An endowment fund, called the Singapore Arts Endowment Fund, will be formed under the Bill for the Arts Council to receive donations from the public. Interest from this fund will be used to help arts groups and to organise arts activities. The Bill also gives the Arts Council the power to form companies and to participate in joint ventures.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Membership of the Council</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Arts Council will comprise a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and 10 to 25 other members. To carry out its public mission well, the membership must be broad-based. We will need representatives from the arts community, the private sector and the public sector. We have to strike a balance between
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> supporting art for art's sake and subjecting art to the test of the market.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the Arts Council is well-advised on matters pertaining to the arts in Singapore and the rest of the world, the Bill enables the Council to appoint advisory committees. They need not all be composed of Singaporeans. We should also include foreigners who can help us. These committees will cover the major fields, including the literary arts, the visual arts and the performing arts.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Absorption of staff and property</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arts Council will absorb the staff and property of the Arts Division of the Ministry of Information and the Arts; the National Theatre Trust, which is a statutory board; and the Singapore Cultural Foundation, an endowment fund now under the Ministry. The National Arts Council Bill provides for the repeal of the National Theatre Trust Act.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
   </div>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the GPC on Information and the Arts supports the establishment of the National Arts Council. As a statutory board, the Arts Council will enjoy flexibility in its operation and autonomy in its finance and administration. On the other hand, the Arts Council is accountable to Parliament through the Acting Minister.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me offer some general observations about the promotion of the arts in Singapore. I hope these observations are useful to the National Arts Council and perhaps even to the Ministry. In the development of the arts, we need to strike a certain balance between conflicting interests. The first is about the role of the Government. The
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Government should give maximum assistance to arts organisations and artists. The assistance can be in the form of provision of arts facilities, training of artistic talent, financial and administrative support. However, such Government assistance does not confer on Government officials the right to interfere in the artistic creation. Interference will only stifle creativity. The arts produced under the bureaucratic system are normally rigid, unnatural or even lifeless.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second balance concerns the role of the private enterprises and corporations. Incentives must be given to encourage more private enterprises and corporations to participate in the promotion of the arts. On the other hand, we must make sure there is no over-commercialisation of the arts. In a free market economy, purchases of art works by private enterprises and corporations at higher prices constitute a form of material incentive to the artists. The artists, however, must continue to be motivated by the desire to achieve artistic excellence and should not allow themselves to be dictated by monetary consideration.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third concerns foreign competition. Every effort must be made to train localartists so as to raise the standard of their works. Nevertheless, this should not lead us into protectionism and the creation of a closed-door mentality against foreign competition. Foreign competition will help broaden the vision of the local artists and bring about more diverse and more dynamic local artistic activities. Foreign competition will also inspire local artists to set their sights beyond the national boundary and venture into the international arts scene.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, let me make two specific comments on the Bill. Firstly, financial grants from the Government. I understand from the Bill that the assets and funds from the National Theatre Trust, the Singapore Cultural Foundation and the Arts Division under the Ministry will be transferred to the Council to set up the Singapore Arts Endowment Fund. I take it that the Government will also provide operating grants annually to the Council. Could the Minister inform the
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> House what is the annual grant to be provided to the Council? I have checked the 1991/92 Budget and the recurrent expenditure allocated under the Arts Programme for FY 1990 was $4.16 million, and the recurrent expenditure estimated for FY 1991 was $7.19 million. The sums are really very small. In fact, these sums are much smaller than the recurrent expenditure allocated under the Parks Programme. The recurrent expenditure allocated for the Parks Programme for FY 1990 was $31.63 million and for FY 1991, it was $34.69 million. In other words, the recurrent expenditure allocated for the Arts Programme accounted for less than 22% of the expenditure allocated for the Parks Programme.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Arts Council to be the "national vehicle for the arts programme", a much higher financial grant is required from the Government. While I understand that the Council will seek financial grants from the private sector in the form of donations and sponsorships, the Government needs to set an example. Here, may I make a suggestion. One possible source of finance is from the Bukit Turf Club and the Singapore Totalisator Board. Could the Minister obtain a firm commitment from these twoorganisations for their financial contributions to the Arts Council? If our objective is to ensure adequate financial resources for the promotion of the arts in Singapore, it does not matter whether the money is from the oil companies or from gambling activities.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, appointment of Council Members. I read in the newspaper that the Acting Minister has announced the appointment of the Chairman. We have no quarrel with the appointment of Prof. Tommy Koh as the Chairman. I personally think that he is the right choice. The Bill also provides for the post of the Vice-Chairman and 10 to 25 other Council Members. I hope the Minister will consult our GPC on the nomination of the Council Members. The GPC will, in turn, consult its Resource Panel. In this way, the Ministry and the GPC can work together for the promotion of the arts in Singapore.

   <br>
   <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng :</b> Sir, I must say that eventually and finally arts is about to take its rightful place in our society. I do not suppose there is any need for me to go into the reasons why food for the spirit is now necessary, now that Singaporeans have been provided with food for the body. I must assume that this is supported and accepted by all.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the National Arts Council (NAC) will be the national vehicle through which the food for the spirit will be provided, I fully support this Bill. However, from another perspective, this Bill is only a shell to contain the appropriate policies for the advancement of the arts in Singapore. Eventually, how effective it will be depends on the substance and quality of its policies and its efforts, and not its form. It is in this context that I would like to raise several issues. One, the Arts Council appears to be a successor to the National Theatre Trust (NTT). I hope that it will not be a mere continuation of the National Theatre Trust. Since its establishment, the NTT has not been very effective in promoting and advancing the arts on a broad basis. It has organised many cultural functions and, in the process, has become another arts organisation - no different from the rest, albeit bigger, better organised and perhaps with more financial muscles.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that one of the Arts Council's early tasks will be to review the policies, regulations, practices and procedures affecting us and the promotion of artsin Singapore today. Many of the policies were formulated years ago and may no longer be relevant in our present context. In this respect, perhaps it could update the views and recommendations expressed in the Report of the Advisory Council on Culture and the Arts, done in 1989, and proceed from there.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is that I hope the National Arts Council should not be involved in organising any artistic activities as provided for in clause 5 of the Bill. The Arts Council should be the umbrella body for all arts organisations in Singapore. By all means, provide the infrastructure, facilities, the policy
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> framework, financial and other forms of assistance, but the Arts Council should not compete with the arts organisations by the organisation of artistic activities. It should encourage and promote, but not organise them. I have my doubts about the effectiveness of this policy.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, would the Council not organise activities as dictated by what the Government of the day wants? In other words, such activities could very often be termed as propaganda and, in the end, this could be counter-productive. Here, I would like to propose that a hands-off approach might be the best. There is also another reason for the Arts Council to stick to its main function of being the umbrella body. From an overview, its main concern with the policy to encourage and promote the organisation of activities, the Arts Council could provide seed money and other forms of financial assistance to the many deserving arts organisations, especially in their early years. We have already seen some good results of this policy. Examples which come readily to mind are the Substation and some of the more well-known performing arts groups. More of this type of assistance will be helpful.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the financial side, arts expenditure, unfortunately, is very often deemed as expenditure without financial returns. Perhaps, there may be good returns eventually but, from a purely financial perspective, it would be too risky an investment. Therefore, I could see that, in later years, budgetary allocationfrom the Government will always be a thorny issue. Hence, I would like to express the hope that the Arts Council be given adequate funds to fulfil its main responsibility. I also hope that the Government will not view this Bill as privatisation of the arts and thereafter leave it to the private sector and the general public to support the arts.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the private sector should and must support the arts but to expect it to carry the greater part of the financial burden is asking for too much, especially when the public and the private sectors are also called upon to
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> contribute to education, the poor, the underprivileged, the physically handicapped and all other kinds of charity.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet arts expenditure can be a bottomless pit. Therefore, I believe that this financial burden should be a shared partnership between the Government and the public. In this respect, I would like to forward this suggestion, and that is, to give double tax exemption to individuals donating to the Arts Council. I stress only individuals and not companies for a good reason. Firstly, such double tax exemption would encourage contributions by individuals at the community level, that means by individuals themselves and not through their organisation, and this should be the case since arts is really for everyone.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the loss of tax revenue from the Government's viewpoint will also not be too great since individual tax rates are progressive, going up to a maximum rate of 32%. Hence, as an example, for those at the marginal 15% tax rate who are given a double tax exemption, it will only benefit them up to 30% which means that, in actual fact, for every dollar they contribute, they have to contribute 70 cents of their own money while the Inland Revenue Department contributes 30 cents. Even this, forexample, is lesser than the 31% that is being enjoyed by companies which contribute to institutions of a public character. I think this suggestion is worth considering even from the financial viewpoint.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 9 of the Bill gives the Minister the power to direct the Council. Itseems rather unnecessary in the light of paragraph 5 of the First Schedule that the Minister has absolute power to revoke the appointment of any Council Member. And this is also not consistent with the oft-repeated comment that arts development should be left to the people within some framework. However, I am not advocating the removal of this clause but I feel that a clarification of how this power is to be used would be helpful to dispel misgivings. Sir, I would be grateful if the Acting Minister could comment on these issues.

   <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(
   <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the proposed National Arts Council will be a very important milestone in our Next Lap towards spiritual development. It also signals the uplifting of the status of the arts. I feel that we should be proud of the fact that we are able, in a matter of about 20 years of nation building to move a step forward from materialistic development, to spiritual development. One of our long-term development objectives is to build Singapore into a more gracious and cultured society. The National Arts Council will play a very important role in this aspect.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, the National Arts Council will have to shoulder very heavy responsibilities, just as the old Chinese saying goes: "The burden is heavy and the road is long." The Arts Council will be an autonomous organization. It will take the form of a statutory board. In other words, it will enjoy more flexibility than a Government department in carrying out its activities. And the input that it will receive will be nation wide. So I believe it will be in a better position to reflect the desire and hopes of our people in the development of arts in Singapore. But I believe that the Arts Council will also have another basic mission, that is not only to satisfy the desire of the people but also to preserve and promote the various Asian traditional arts and to facilitate the development of a unique Singaporean culture. Only by so doing that we would be able to maintain our traditions and our national spirit, which is needed to face up to the world in the face of very strong influence from the West.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the development of the arts is within the realm of spiritual development, which in turn is a very important thing for us to do. This cannot be left to the market forces alone to decide. Take, for example, we want to prevent our society from going fully Westernised and preserve and promote our traditional arts. That certainly requires very strong determination and
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> effort. Those who are involved in this effort should be given not only moral support but also strong financial support.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman-designate of the Arts Council, as we know, is our Ambassador-at-large, Prof. Tommy Koh. I believe we all have full confidence in Prof. Koh and it is hoped that under his leadership the National Arts Council will be able to effectively carry out its duties and to maximise its potential so that arts could be fully developed in Singapore. At the same time, I am sure those who are concerned in the development of the arts in Singapore would also like to know how the Arts Council is going to appoint its Chief Executive Officer and the 10 to 25 Council members as provided for under the Bill. In our multi-racial, multi-cultural society, it goes without saying that the members of the Council should be as representative as possible.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Arts Council to effectively carry out its duty, apart from good leadership, it must also have good financial and manpower support. I believe the staff of the National Theatre Trust and also some of the staff from the Arts Division in the Ministry of Information and the Arts would form the basic staff of the Arts Council. The question is how many staff will the Council have. And whether they are adequate.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to speak on concerns the financial resources of the Arts Council. The setting up of an endowment fund would ensure that the Arts Council has enough funds to carry out its activities. However, I believe that if we want to raise sufficient money for this endowment fund, it would take some time. So I hope that the Government will take the lead by giving an initial grant to this Arts Council so that it could have a good start. I believe the private sector would also respond positively. Recently, a company donated $1 million to the Substation. From this, we can see that we would have good support from the private sector in the development of arts in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Bin Hj Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the National Arts Council is a timely one. It marks the realisation of Singaporean artists and arts organisations for a central body to provide the necessary support and guidance in the development of arts in Singapore. The NAC can indeed become a strong cultural catalyst towards this end.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arts in Singapore has seen a steady growth in the last three decades. We have passed the days of the Aneka Ragam Rakyat of the early 60s. Singaporeans are now being treated to several cultural festivals and events. For example, we can now witness the music and drama festivals. The arts festival has always been an important cultural calendar in Singapore. Our artists have also been given much encouragement and motivation through the various literary competitions like the short story and drama writing competitions. Local recognition of their work is made through the awards of the Cultural Medallions. In fact, several of our literary figures have received regional recognition by being recipients of the ASEAN Cultural and Communication Awards. All these point to the fact that there is no dearth of cultural activities in Singapore. If one cares to browse through the Straits Times weekend guideline on cultural activities, one finds quite a good list of these events. They include films, dances, theatres, concerts, art shows, talks and workshops being held at the various cultural venues. Perhaps the term "cultural desert" is slowly becoming a misnomer in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dispelled this myth that Singapore is lacking in cultural activities, we shouldnevertheless redouble our efforts in improving the quantity and quality of Singapore arts. To this end, the NAC can play a pivotal role. It may be helpful at this juncture for NAC to restate what is its policy towards the evolution of Singapore arts in particular and Singapore's culture in general. Such a statement or guideline would help clear some of the lingering doubts and reservations of Singaporeans as to what kind of cultural orientation is needed towards the evolution of Singapore's culture and the arts.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a subject of this nature would undoubtedly attract interesting intellectual polemics from different quarters, the purists and the pragmatists included. In my humble opinion, Singapore's evolving culture, its arts included, centres around a potpourri of the cultures derived from and influenced by the Eastern heritage of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, and the contemporary impact of the Western civilisation.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "potpourri" needs elaboration. The dictionary explains "potpourri" as a mixture of flowers or petals, herbs and spices, kept and used for scent or fragrance. Again, the word "mixture" is also worth noting. It means that the different components of the flowers and the herbs in the potpourri can still retain their own properties, but together they contribute to the fragrance they exude.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the same analogy, Singapore's evolving culture and arts must be a potpourri or a mixture of the various ethnic cultures and arts with a strong strand of Western cultural tapestry woven into it. Such a mixture would bring forth a cultural fragrance which is distinctly Singaporean.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not alone in this process of cultural evolution. If the Indonesian arts andculture is the totality of the songs and dances and the artifacts from the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi and now Irian Jaya, and that of the Malaysians include the ghazal from Johor, the ronggeng from Malacca, the inang from Negri Sembilan and the boria from Penang, or the dikir barat and the makyong from Kelantan and Trengganu, and the Fiesta Filipina is a potpourri of songs and dances from the islands of Luzon, Sumar and Mindanao, then Singapore's culture and arts must surely be the totality of the song and dances and the artifacts of our different ethnic groups.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may be permitted to surmise, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that the arts and culture of a country is to some extent the resultant of its common history and unique geography. Our common history has brought us to live together in this island of Singapore. Our historical past and our unique geography
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> have moulded our cultural character to be that of an urban and not rural or agrarian in nature. But arising from this common history and geography, what is more fundamental is whether we as Singaporeans are willing to accept and appreciate the different ethnic arts and culture as our common heritage. In other words, our culture and arts is what we see outside and how we feel inside. The breadth of what we see and the depth of how we feel determine our common cultural emotions. I do understand that such emotions take time to bloom and mature. But I believe the seeds of these emotions have already been sown and the plants are growing. We are beginning to see flowers sprouting from these plants. Given time, I am confident that these flowers will exude the Singapore fragrance.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to some specific clauses of this Bill. In regard to clause 5 of the Bill on the functions of the Council, would the Acting Minister elaborate on the kind of support and assistance given by the NAC towards the development of arts organisations? Similarly, in clause 6 on the powers of the Council, what would be the nature and the new scope of the variousadvisory committees? With specific reference to the extension of grants, contributions, loans for scholarships by the Council, may I suggest that the Council train people who will be bi-cultural in knowledge and expertise. In other words, we should have cultural officers who are not only anchored in one particular art, but equally conversant in the arts of a different culture. They will be our cultural bridge towards cross-cultural appreciation in our multi-ethnic society.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like the NAC to establish a functional link between itself and the schools and junior colleges with a view to developing talents among our youths.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their enthusiastic support for the National Arts Council and for the appointment of Prof. Tommy Koh as the Chairman of this Council, and also for their very thought-
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> ful and thought-provoking comments about what our general approach towards the development of the arts in Singapore should be.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of comments have been raised which I would try now to address in turn.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the funding of the Arts Council. There is some approval for the increase in Government funding, but there is also concern that it may not be enough. Let me assure Members that the Government is committed to furthering the development of the arts in Singapore and will increase its funding progressively. The Council will get an operating grant of $6.5 million in the first year, and this will increase to $7.4 million in the second year to $8.4 million in the third year. The $6.5 million for the first year represents a 67% increase over recurrent expenditure on the arts last year. Beyond these three years, let us wait and see because it is possible to actually waste money on the arts, and we should not be just throwing money at the problem to solve it. There is a certain tao, as it were, as to how quickly the arts can develop in Singapore, and we should move with it rather than to speed it up faster than it can on itself progress. But where Government is needed to provide umbrella facilities, infrastructural facilities, that Government will do and, in fact, as Members are aware, we have now embarked on a project to develop a world class, top rate, performing arts centre in Singapore, and that will cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost of operating that centre must come to millions of dollars every year. All that Government is undertaking to help finance, fully the capital cost of building the centre, and partially the cost of running it. The problem is not really money. The problem is whether we are able to develop the software so that when the centre is ready, not only will we have the people to perform on the various stages, we will also have the audiences to fill up the halls. Building the building, that is the easiest part. But creating the audience support, creating
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> the traditions, developing excellence in performance, all that is infinitely more difficult to achieve. But we will try to do that, so that by the time the centre is ready in 1998/1999, we will have the companies and the groups and the audiences to really breathe life into it.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council is starting off with an inheritance of $11 million from the National Theatre Trust and the Singapore Cultural Foundation. It will also start off with a staff of over 100. We will take it from there and see what is required from year to year.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am intrigued by Mr Heng Chiang Meng's proposal for double tax relief for those individuals who contribute to this Council, although I must say that as the Minister for Information and the Arts, I am rather more enthusiastic than I would have been as the Minister of State for Finance about this intriguing proposal. Nevertheless, my staff will study it very carefully and put up a case to the Finance Minister.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach that we take must balance, as Dr Ow Chin Hock has said, various competing considerations, one of which is striking a balance between top-down direction and bottom-up participation. We all know that throughout history, without a certain degree of top-down support the arts can never flourish. You need either kingsor princes, popes, bishops, cardinals, big entrepreneurs, to give funding, to become patrons. It is the case today. That if you leave it just to the market, the arts will never flourish. At the same time, without the market, it is entirely possible that we will be wasting a lot of money on activities which interest very few. So we must always find a good balance between a top-down approach and bottom-up participation. So when Mr Wan Hussin recommends that the Arts Council should come out with policy statements and give clear directions as to what it wants to do, I say, "Yes, I would discuss this with the Arts Council". But I would caution at the same time that the Arts Council should not be too quick to state its views. I think it should first conduct extensive social investigations, talk to people, find out what the ground is ripe
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> for, what people feel they want, and then work with the currents, rather than try to impose from a theoretical academic viewpoint their view of the world on to the arts community and those who support artistic activities in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Government should try and regulate in a way which facilitates participation by as wide a circle of the community as possible, and this we would do by managing the whole field more lightly and by reviewing our censorship rules. As you know, Prof. Tommy Koh is also chairing a Committee to review censorship regulations in Singapore. This is very timely. The last time we made a review was 10 years ago when Prof. Jayakumar headed the Committee. So 10 years after that, we have a new Committee and its recommendations should take us 10 years into the future. I do not think we should be overly cautious and take small steps. That will not do because it will create too much uncertainty. I have recommended to the Committee that they make an overall assessment and take a decisive step which will settle the field, as it were, for 10 more years into the future. And then 10 years from now we can have another Committee to take a fresh look. But we cannot be making small incremental steps. In the longer term, what we need really, as Mr Wan Hussin suggested, is to develop consciousness in the arts among young Singaporeans in the schools and junior colleges because that will provide the base upon which the arts can flourish over the long term. Right now, we are trying to light fires from the top here and there, but in the end it is whether the ground is ripe for comprehensive artistic development. The Education Ministry has done a lot and I am very heartened by the interest which parents are showing in the arts field. I have mentioned this before, I say it here again, that every year some 40,000 people take the music examinations under the ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) without any encouragement by any public body or by the Government, but parents on their own deciding that - it may be peer pressure - they did not have it for themselves, so they wish it for their
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> children. They feel that if their children do not have such education, somehow they are not completely whole and, therefore, they, on their own, have added the additional pressure on their children in order that they will grow up fuller.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same too in other fields, like in Chinese calligraphy. In Japan and in Korea, even though they learn far fewer characters, they teach calligraphy from primary one. We do not, because that will be an excessive burden on our students. But, completely on their own, many parents have decided that calligraphy is a worthwhile pursuit and have prescribed it for their own children and, for this reason, calligraphy classes are booming all over in Singapore. So do ballet classes, dance classes and so on. So I am optimistic, because we have become a middle class society in one generation, and parents realise, on the whole, that when they were young they did not have the training, now they have the wealth, their appreciation of the arts is imperfect for lack of training when they were young, it is a deficiency which they wish to rectify in their children and with the support of the Education Ministry, I believethat the next generation will be much better off.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we attend concerts and other performances in Singapore today, we find that the majority of the audiences are young Singaporeans, and this is very heartening because when these young Singaporeans become working Singaporeans, become Yuppies, when they get into their 30s and 40s and 50s, they are the ones who will fill up the performing arts centre and who will provide the market for artistesto make a living in Singapore. So there is a positive current flowing in our society. Now that we have achieved a certain standard of material well-being, Singaporeans are realising that they must also give attention to the arts, and this in fact secures the future for artistic development in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job and the job of the National Arts Council is to facilitate this movement, not to thwart it, and not to accelerate it faster than is possible, but to move with it, and to lead it along.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also strike a few other balances, and one is creating ethnic spread and keeping alive the old without the old preventing us from acquiring the new. The traditional arts are important because that is our link to the past. But the arts are a living thing and they are evolving all the time. If we are too trapped in traditional forms, then no progress can be made. And the fact that we are multi-cultural is in fact an advantage. I visited the NUS Music Centre recently, and I was told that a few months ago we sent a team to compete in a music composition contest in Taiwan. And initially the University thought: "Why do we go? We'll only lose face, because the others will be so much better than we are." But, lo and behold, we came up tops. So I asked them: How was that possible? They said: "Ah! The judges thought that we were particularly creative." And I suspect the reason is that being multi-cultural, we were able to cut across cultural norms and achieve mutual stimulation, and this assists us in the creative process. Whereas the Taiwanese who were caught in their owngreat traditions had greater difficulty achieving this breakthrough.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes, we preserve the past but the past must not prevent us from moving into the future. Yes, we want ethnic spread; yes, we want quantity; yes, we want to be fair; but at the same time we should avoid the pitfalls of too much socialism in the arts. In the end, the progress will be uneven. Some will do better than others; and we are better off by backing winners rather than pulling down winners in order to be fair, and absolutely fair to everyone. If weare absolutely fair to everyone, then we will make no progress. And this is a fine balance the Arts Council has to achieve - feeding many, but for those which thrive, give full backing.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very inspired by Mr Wan Hussin's metaphor. It is about plants and flowers. And if I may continue the use of that metaphor. If the flowers are the products, then the job of MITA and the Arts Council is to be an assiduous gardener,
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> tilling the ground, adding fertilizer, weeding, and so on. In the end, the actual creative process cannot be willed from above, it must come from the seeds themselves. So too, striking a balance between the local and the foreigner. As Dr Ow Chin Hock said, if we have too much protectionism, there will be no progress. But at the same time, there is an infant industry argument for the arts. I mean there are some seeds which have to be looked after in greenhouses before they can be exposed in the international environment. So I would say we do need a few greenhouses, and we do have a range of assistance schemes right now to assist fledgling arts organisations and fledgling arts activities in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, what is our objective? Our objective is to help create a Singaporean identity to help forge a Singaporean soul which would attach Singaporeans to Singapore, wherever they are. Are we achieving it? It is hard to say. Because if you ask artists and Singaporeans now to list what they feel to be Singaporean art, they are hard put to do so. It is very difficult to express in words what is Singaporeanculture or Singaporean art. Yes, we can describe what is Chinese art or Indian art or Malay art. But it is very difficult to describe what is Singaporean art other than by using metaphor and saying that it is fried rice, a mixture, or an amalgam of this and that. It is very difficult.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is interesting. I have had to open many exhibitions in the course of my duties. But what I have found is that a Singaporean characteristic is emerging, and emerging irresistibly. You see a painting, initially it looks Chinese. Then you exploreit more closely, you find, no, there is a variation, something is different about this, which sets it apart from the PRC pattern, the Taiwanese pattern. And this is inevitable because the artists grow up here in Singapore soil, they breathe in the air, they take in the spirit, and this must eventually be expressed in their artistic works. And over time, this process will continue, and with each passing year, with assistance from the Government and from private
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> corporations and individuals, we will be able to help in the formation of this Singaporean character, realising at the same time that whatever character we develop must not make us so different as to be weird. And whatever we are, it must not just be attractive to Singaporeans alone, but must also be attractive to foreigners. And this is a great asset we have. That when foreigners come to Singapore, when they come through, visit our exhibitions, there is always something familiar about artistic expressions, something which links us to China, to India, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to Japan, and to the West. And the more we are able to achieve this distinctiveness as Singaporeans without losing our international character, the more we will succeed and it will greatly enhance our long-term competitive position in the future.

   <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I have to play the Philistine and bring you down from the stratosphere of high art to the world of nuts and bolts.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved the Second Reading of this Bill before the House in March this year, it was resolved that the Bill be
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> committed to a Select Committee to give an opportunity to professional groups and individuals in the construction industry to present their views on the new provisions in the Bill that affect them. Two other related Bills, namely the Professional Engineers Bill and the Land Surveyors Bill, were also committed to the same Select Committee.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 15 written representations on the three Bills were received from various professional groups and individuals in the construction industry. The Committee studied all the representations and also heard oral evidence from six of the representors whose views constituted a good cross-section of the representations submitted. Many of the representors supported the spirit and intention of the Bills. The issues raised by them were mainly centred on the particular provisions of specific clauses. A number of valid points were made by some of the representors.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has therefore recommended some amendments to the Bills. These amendments together with the reasons are given in detail in the Report of the Select Committee which has been circulated to Members of the House. I will now highlight the more significant amendments which have been incorporated in the reprint of the Architects Bill now before the House.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Multi-Discipline and Corporate Practice</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the points raised by the representors concern the provisions in the Bill for regulating multi-discipline and corporate practice by registered architects and allied professionals. Several representors were concerned that clause 20 of the ArchitectsBill would allow a licensed corporation with non-architects as directors and shareholders to supply architectural services. It was felt that this may compromise the standard of architectural services provided if the manager in charge is merely an employee of the corporation and works under the direction and control of non-architect directors and shareholders. The Committee accepted that this is a valid concern and has therefore recommended that clauses 20 and 21 of the Bill be amended to ensure that the control and
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> management of the business of a licensed corporation or partnership, insofar as it relates to the supply of architectural services, shall be in the hands of a share-owning director or partner, who is a registered architect with a valid practising certificate, and ordinarily resident in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representor also pointed out that the Bill as drafted could allow non-professionals to hold more than the permitted proportion of one-third of the shares in a licensed corporation through nominee shareholders who are either registered architects or allied professionals; in other words, the professionals fronting for the non-professionals. Clauses 20 and 21 of the Bill are now amended to ensure that at least two-thirds of the shares in a licensed corporation with limited liability shall be beneficially owned by and registered in the names of registered architects or allied professionals or both.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Professional Liability Insurance</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires only licensed corporations formed with limited liability to be insured against professional liability insurance (PLI). However, the Committee felt that enabling provisions should be inserted in the Bill to allow the Board of Architects to introduce compulsory PLI stage by stage in respect of other forms of practice, including individual practitioners. This will allow the Board to respond to the needs of the industry as they arise. Clause 36 of the Bill has therefore been amended to empower the Board of Architects to make rules requiring licensed corporations with unlimited liability, licensed partnerships, ordinaryarchitectural partnerships as well as individual practising architects to take out and maintain compulsory professional liability insurance. The Board is also empowered to make rules prescribing the terms and conditions of professional liability insurance such as the minimum amount of cover required. There is no intention for the Board to introduce such PLI in the immediate future.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Government Architects</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15(6) and 17(2) of the previous draft Bill, which were retained from the
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> existing Architects Act, exempt Government architects from paying the prescribed registration fees. These two sub-clauses have now been deleted to avoid the imputation that the Bill treats Government professionals more favourably than private sector professionals.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Exempt Bodies and Persons</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has no intention to preclude any public authorities that are empowered to supply architectural services under any written law, such as the HDB, from continuing to supply such services in accordance with the provisions of such law. Therefore, clause 3 has been amended to make it clear that the Bill does not seek to license any public authority which supplies architectural services pursuant to any written law in Singapore. In other words, bodies like HDB do not have to apply for a licence because they are allowed to function and perform what they are doing under written law.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Miscellaneous Amendments</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces the system of practising certificates to replace the present system of annual registration for practising architects. This makes it necessary to amend other existing Acts, such as the Building Control Act, which refer only to registration as a pre-requisite for engaging in architectural work. For this purpose, clause 47 has been amended to provide for these amendments to avoid having to introduce another Bill to make direct amendments to other related laws. The other amendments to the Bill are consequential amendments or amendments of a technical or drafting nature.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Architects Bill marks an important milestone for the course of the architectural profession in Singapore. When enacted, it will bring the professional practice of architects and allied professionals up to date with the tremendous progress made by the construction industry over the last two decades.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation to the many people who have contributed to the preparation and drafting of this comprehensive piece of legislation.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Select Committee hearings, a number of professional groups and individuals were concerned over the provisions relating to the control and management of the multi-discipline corporate firms. Under the original Architects Bill, a licensed corporation whose shareholders and directors consisting entirely of non-architects could provide architectural services.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee deliberations, the architects held a very strong view that such multi-discipline corporate practice must, therefore, project to the public a clear picture of the character of the practice. In other words, the practice must make clear to the unsophisticated clients that it offers primarily architectural services, or engineering services, or land surveying services. Thus, if the corporation is architectural-biased and offering engineering and land surveying services secondarily, it should be made known of its architectural bias. Similarly, for the engineers and land surveyors. Therefore, they suggested an amendment to clause 20(1)(d) to require registered architects to hold a minimum of 51% shares in the corporation in a multi-discipline corporate practice with architectural bias. They want this minimum safeguard to ensure that the architect will play a significant and influential role in the control of the supply of architectural services with no dilution of professional standards. Similarly, engineers should hold 51% of the shares in the corporation that is more engineering-biased, and likewise for the land surveyors.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee hearings, there were a lot of exchanges between the Singapore Institute of Architects' representors and the Select Committee Members. It is all in the Report and even, at one stage, the Minister was quoted as saying: "I do not think we can resolve this problem." As the Select Committee has finally made this amendment, may I beg your indulgence, Mr Speaker, Sir, to request the Minister, in the interest of unsophisticated clients,
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> why the Select Committee finally recommended that the Architects Bill be amended to allow licensed corporations to provide architectural services only under the control and management of an executive shareholding director who is a practising architect resident in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>
   <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I thank the Member for his support for the Bill. Sir, as he has mentioned, the question of whether the engineers or architects should have control of a multi-discipline corporation was brought up before the Select Committee and some architects felt very strongly that the firm that offers architectural services should be controlled by architects. In other words, at least 51% should be owned by architects and that there should be a clear picture of the character of the firm.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We debated this at some length and some of the main reasons are given in the Select Committee's Report. But I would just like to repeat or highlight some of the main considerations. Sir, if a group of architects wants to project itself as primarily architects, they can own the firm 100%. It is up to them to decide. There is nothing in the law to say that a multi-discipline corporation must be owned equally by the various professions. So it can be owned 60% by architects, 10% by engineers, 10% by land surveyors and the other 20% by others. It is entirely up to the architects to determine. There is nothing in the law which requires them to distribute the shares equally.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the shares are equally distributed, or widely distributed, and there is no clear dominant shareholder, then the character of the firm would be determined by the kind of work it does and how the public perceives the firm. If you have a firm with I.M. Pei, an architect, as a shareholder, and he owns only 5% of the firm, people who want good designs would go to that firm even though he owns only 5% of the firm. They are not going to look at the shareholding to see how many shares he owns. Similarly, someone who wants a special steel structure and there is a firm with T.Y. Lin as a shareholder, and he owns only 2%, he
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> will still go to him. So the public perception of a firm would be determined by the competence and reputation of the professionals involved and not by the shareholding. The nature and composition of the firm's business may change from time to time. Today, architecture may be the main source of its income, next year, it could be engineering. So what happens? Does the firm restructure? Or they may bring in a new partner, who may be very well known in the engineering world, and people get attracted to the firm because he is a well-known engineer. Do they restructure the firm? We therefore decided to leave it silent and let the firm's reputation, image, perception be determined by market forces and by people's perception of the firm.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point: why did we change the law? As originally drafted, a firm couldoffer architectural services as long as it was under the supervision of an architect. But that architect could be merely an employee. And the point was made that an employee would be under more control and he would be less independent than a shareholding director. Therefore, we amended the Bill to require that if a firm offers architectural services, it must be under the supervision of a shareholding director who is an architect. Similarly, if a firm offers engineering services, it must be under thesupervision of an engineer who is a shareholding director.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

   <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill was also committed to the same Select Committee as the Architects
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Bill and the Land Surveyors Bill when I moved its Second Reading before the House in March this year. The three Bills are linked to each other through the definition of "allied professionals" for the purpose of multi-discipline, professional consultancy practice and they contain very similar provisions. As stated, when I moved the Third Reading of the Architects Bill just now, the Select Committee received 15 written representations on the three Bills from various professional groups and individuals in the construction industry. Arising from these representations, the Committee has recommended some amendments to the Bill which are largely similar to those made in respect of the Architects Bill. These amendments have been incorporated in the reprint of the Professional Engineers Bill now before the House and the reasons for the amendments are given in the Select Committee's Report.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Multi-Discipline and Corporate Practice, Professional Liability Insurance and Government Professional Engineers</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take these three subjects together. The amendments to the Professional Engineers Bill relating to the provisions on multi-discipline and corporate practice, professional liability insurance and exemption of Government professional engineers from paying the prescribed registration fees, are similar to the amendments in the Architects Bill. The reasons for these amendments are also the same as for the Architects Bill and, therefore, I would not repeat them. However, apart from these amendments, there are also other amendments that are peculiar to the Professional Engineers Bill which I will now highlight.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Definition of "Professional Engineering Services"</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Bill is to regulate by licence only those multi-discipline partnerships and corporations that are engaged in providing professional engineering consultancy services. However, the Bill, as drafted, may give rise to the misinterpretation that contractors and manufacturers of engineering products also need to be licensed. Clause 2 of the Bill has, therefore, been
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> amended to include a new term "professional engineering services" which is defined to mean advisory or consultancy services relating to professional engineering work and the sale or supply for gain or reward of any plan, design, etc, relating to such work. This makes it clear that the licensing requirements of the Bill are applicable only to business entities engaged in professional engineering consultancy services. Clause 12 of the Bill is also amended to make it clear that only persons who are authorised to supply professional engineering services can claim remuneration for such services rendered.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Exempt Bodies and Persons</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of the Architects Bill, clause 3 has been amended to make it clear that the Bill does not seek to license public authorities which supply professional engineering services pursuant to any written law in Singapore. In addition, clause 15 has been amended to provide that specific groups of persons, irrespective of whether they are professional engineers or not, could continue to perform certain activities that may fall within the definition of professional engineering work as defined in clause 2. These exempt classes of persons are set out in a new First Schedule to the Bill and include certificated officers under the Merchant Shipping Act, certified operators of steam boilers and internal combustion engines under the Factories Act, and licensed electrical workers and contractors under the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Act. The First Schedule may be amended by the Minister through notification in the Gazette.
   <br>
   <br>
   <i>Miscellaneous Amendments</i>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 47 of the Bill has been amended and a new Second Schedule inserted to make consequential amendments to other existing Acts, such as the Building Control Act, that presently make no reference to practising certificates as a prerequisite for engaging in professional engineering work. This will obviate the need to move a separate Bill in Parliament to make direct amendments to the other Acts.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Bill are consequential amendments or amendments of a technical or drafting nature. The Bill has also been renumbered throughout to achieve uniformity in the numbering of corresponding clauses between the Professional Engineers Bill and the Architects Bill.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill, when enacted, will bring the practice of professional engineers up to-date with the progress made by the construction industry over the last two decades. Together with the Architects Bill, they mark an important milestone for the course of professional practices in the construction industry.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my appreciation to the many people who have contributed to the preparation and drafting of this comprehensive piece of legislation.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

   <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Third time."
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, was committed to a Select Committee in March this year. It is linked to the Architects Bill and the Professional Engineers Bill in that they have very similar provisions concerning, for example, the definition of "allied professionals" and the provisions relating to multi-discipline and corporate practice. Therefore, all three Bills were committed to a single Select Committee.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have heard from my colleague, the Minister for National Development, about the written representations received by the Committee and the oral evidence heard. The representors were particularly concerned about the new provisions in the Bill regulating multi-discipline and corporate practice by registered architects, professional engineers and registered surveyors in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Members have, I am sure, read the Report of the Committee.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has made several amendments to the Land Surveyors Bill and they fall into two categories. Firstly, amendments which are similar to those made to the Architects Bill and the Professional Engineers Bill. Secondly, amendments which are peculiar only to the Land Surveyors Bill.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the first category, the common amendments. The amendments relating to multi-discipline and corporate practice and professional liability insurance follow those made to the Architects Bill and the Professional Engineers Bill. My colleague, the Minister for National Development, has already dwelt on these at length, but let me mention them briefly: First, to prevent nominee shareholdings for the benefit of non-professionals, at least two-thirds of the shares of any corporation licensed to supply title survey services must be owned legally as well as beneficially by registered surveyors or registered surveyors and allied professionals.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the control and management of the business of a licensed corporation or partnership, insofar as it relates to the supply of title survey services, must be in the hands of a share-owning director or partner who is a registered surveyor with a valid practising certificate and ordinarily resident in Singapore.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, empowering the Land Surveyors Board to make rules to require partnerships, unlimited liability corporations and individual practitioners to take out and maintain professional liability insurance in respect of title survey services. This would allow the Board, if it deems fit, to respond to the needs of the industry when they arise.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments to the Bill which are also similar to those made to the other two Bills are:
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in view of the impression that the Bill discriminates unfairly against practitioners in the private sector,
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> Government surveyors will no longer be exempted from having to pay for registration;
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, statutory boards which carry out title surveys as part of their statutory functions will not be required to take out a licence;
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, as surveyors in the private sector will be required to be registered as well as to take out annual practising certificates in order to engage in title survey work, the Bill amends other Acts consequent to the introduction of practising certificates as a prerequisite for engaging in title survey work.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to the few amendments which are peculiar to this Bill. The first concerns payment of title survey fees. At present, survey fees deposits are made with the Survey Department as required under the provisions of the Planning Act for the purpose of meeting the cost of title survey services rendered by the registered surveyor as well as the cost of the services rendered by the Survey Department, and the Chief Surveyor makes payment out of these deposits.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Bill now abolishes the fixed scale of fees for private sector registered surveyors and the fees for services rendered will be entirely a matter of negotiation between the parties, it will be difficult to determine the amount of deposit required to meet their charges. The Select Committee, therefore, proposed that such payments of deposits need not be made in future. References to such a deposit in this Bill have been deleted and appropriate transitional provisions have been inserted.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has also recommended that appropriate amendments be made to section 10(3)(b) of the Planning Act as soon as possible. The Survey Department will impose fees for its services by way of rules made under clause 40(2)(e) of the Bill.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment spells out an additional ground for removing the name of a registered surveyor from the registers of surveyors and practitioners. The existing grounds provided in the Act
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> are death and cancellation of registration after disciplinary proceedings. This additional ground, which I may add is modelled upon corresponding clauses in the Architects Bill and Professional Engineers Bill, is where the registered surveyor has not renewed his practising certificate continuously for more than 10 years. Such a person would most probably not be in touch with his profession. He will not, of course, be prevented from applying for re-registration. The amendment brings the Bill in line with the other two Bills.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Bill are consequential amendments or amendments of a technical or drafting nature.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this Motion for the Adjournment, I would like to highlight the plight of reservists who are pursuing part-time tertiary courses in preparation for professional or academic examinations leading to degrees or diplomas which are internationally recognised. These reservists who are doing part-time studies are generally not given deferment from their in-camp training (ICT). MINDEF's policy now allows only full-time university students or students who have gone abroad to pursue their studies or reservists who have gone overseas to work to defer their in-camp training.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue I would like the Minister to consider is whether he will allow reservists who are genuine part-time students pursuing university courses to be given deferment from their in-camp training. Would the Minister give them the same treatment as full-time university students in respect of deferment from ICT? I would urge the Minister to change the policy and allow bona fide part-time students who are studying for tertiary degrees to be given these deferments. On the one hand, MINDEF allows full-time university students to delay their national service and in-camp training but, on the other hand, those reservists who are part-time university students are not allowed to postpone their in-camp training. Why the anomaly? Such a policy is patently unjust, unfair and discriminates against those male Singaporeans who have missed the boat the first time from obtaining a university degree to get it the second time when they are already past the normal age for admission to a university. In fact, the Government should do all it can to help these genuine part-time students instead of discriminating against them. It is common knowledge that it is more difficult to pursue part-time studies than to do them full-time. It requires a lot of sacrifice, determination and perseverance to get a university degree through part-time studies. And if there are Singaporeans who are undergoing part-time studies, they should be encouraged and helped and not hindered. The SAF in this
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> respect does not seem to have a heart and it is cold and uncaring on these part-time students. I am sure there must be quite a few reservists who have been thumped down by MINDEF when they requested for deferment from their ICT because they are doing university courses on a part-time and not a full-time basis.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight one such case. This reservist is a part-time law student. He enrolled in a locally registered private law school and he was scheduled to sit for his LL.B University of London External Intermediate Examinations on 11th June this year. He was served a notice on 9th September 1990 to attend an ICT from 11th March to 30th March 1991. He requested for deferment in writing on 20th October last year stating his reasons and supplying proof that he was pursuing an external LL.B course and he was scheduled to sit for the local preliminary examinations in April 1991 and the University of London External Intermediate Examinations on 11th June 1991. The period of his in-camp training will end just 10 days before his intermediate examinations date. This case is a deserving one for deferment. Yet, the request was flatly refused. The reply from MINDEF came some three months later on 25th January 1991 refusing permission for deferment and, as usual, no reasons were given. Can you imagine how this part-time student felt? He was frantic. He appealed against MINDEF's decision on 28th January 1991. He also sent his examination time-table to MINDEF. He went personally to see the Commanding Officer. I was told that he was made to wait for two hours before his Commanding Officer saw him. Despite his letter of appeal and personal visit to MINDEF, his appeal was predictably refused on 6th March 1991.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7th March, this reservist sought the help of the Vice Principal of his law school and also enlisted the assistance of his Member of Parliament. After much correspondence, the Vice Principal of his school and the Member of Parliament and the hectic telephone calls made by the former to the office of the Permanent Secretary, permission was finally granted
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> after the reservist had attended two days of his in-camp training on 11th and 12th March 1991. Although permission was given on the 12th, it was not communicated to him until the day after, ie, on 13th March 1991. This is a trauma and heartache of a reservist who sought deferment from his in-camp training.

   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason given by MINDEF for not allowing part-time students to be granted ICT deferment is that they want to ensure operational readiness. I think this is not really a good reason to refuse part-time students deferment from their ICT. If there is really a need for operational readiness in the SAF, then this criterion should not only affect part-time students but also those who are studying full-time, because the concept of operational readiness implies that if Singapore is attacked by an external force, Singapore would have maximum military preparedness. In accordance with this kind of strategy, every able-bodied person who is liable to do military service should be prepared to defend Singapore in such an eventuality. Therefore, male full-time university students who are of military age should not be deferred from military training. But full-time students are deferred from national service. Therefore, under the policy of military preparedness or operational preparedness, there is no need to involve every male citizen of military age. The male full-time university students are deferred and the part-time reservists accordingly should be given deferment from their ICT.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether once a part-time student is given deferment from ICT, this policy will be abused. The Minister need not fear that it will be abused because he can easily check to see that a part-time student is really a genuine one, and not use it as an excuse to avoid his in-camp training.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I hope the Minister will consider sympathetically the plight and the difficulties encountered by part-

   <br> time students in regard to their in-camp training.

   <br>
   <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Senior Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <b>The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam has, as usual, wielded a very poorly guided and indiscriminate brush to paint a dark and distorted picture of the position of a reservist who has to perform in-camp training in the SAF. He has misrepresented the SAF as an unreasonable and inflexible organisation. Sir, this could not be further from the truth and, in the course of the next few minutes, I will set the record straight.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the specific example that Mr Chiam has brought up of the student who was sitting for his external law examination, appealing to be deferred from in-camp training because it coincided with a local intermediate examination. I think Mr Chiam forgot to inform this House that the local examination was, in fact, a mock examination conducted by a local private law school to prepare their students for the formal examination. Being a mock examination, it could always be re-scheduled or could always be re-arranged in some way to accommodate the student's in-camp training. Nonetheless, after appeal by the hon. Member of Parliament who represented this student, and the hon. Member is not Mr Chiam, MINDEF had decided, in this particular case, notwithstanding the fact that it was only a mock examination, to allow him time-off to take the examination. So this is, in fact, a case in point showing that MINDEF does consider each case on its own merits.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now state a fundamental principle. National service, whether it is full-time national service or part-time national service in the form of reservist duty, entails a certain degree of inconvenience and disruption to civilian routine. This is a sacrifice which all male Singaporeans have to make for the security and survival of Singapore. In this way, they are helping to ensure peace for Singapore and their standard of living can continue to go up, and they are also helping to build up a better future for
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> their families. Sir, it is simply not possible to have a national service defence force without causing some degree of inconvenience to Singaporeans. In the case of reservist duty, it is essential to carry out periodic training, such as in-camp training, to maintain a high level of operational readiness, which Mr Chiam seems not to agree, even if such training results in some disruption to the civilian life. If reserve service is not carried out thoroughly and effectively, then I have no doubt that SAF's ability to defend Singapore will certainly suffer.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's point is: why not allow the part-time students deferment from reservist duty? Does Mr Chiam know, for example, that there are 100,000 part-time students in VITB alone? And if all part-time students are eligible for deferment from reservist duty, then how can SAF maintain a credible defence capability.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, while we want to maintain the operational readiness of the SAF through a serious programme of part-time in-camp training, MINDEF also understands the compelling desires of Singaporeans to upgrade themselves throughfurther education, whether it is full-time or part-time basis. MINDEF supports such aspiration. In fact, MINDEF, as an employer, regularly sends its own officers for part-time and full-time courses. And where reservists are concerned, unlike what Mr Chiam has said, MINDEF does allow deferment from in-camp training for part-time students. However, a balance has to be struck when allowing such deferment. We have to ensure that allowing time-off from in-camp training for studies for part-time students will not jeopardize the training needs of the reserve unit.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reservists who are attending full-time course, as Mr Chiam himself knows well, are allowed deferment or even disruption if their course exceeds one year. Reservists who are attending part-time courses can be granted deferment from in-camp training to prepare and to sit for these examinations, provided the exam-
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> inations fall during or just after the in-camp training period. In other words, MINDEF will allow reservists to prepare for these examinations provided it is going to take place within a reasonable period from the in-camp training. We cannot allow reservists to be deferred from in-camp training for a very long period on the basis that they are going to sit for an examination six months or eight months after the in-camp training period. In fact, Sir, for reservists who are attending part-time night classes, if they have to attend in-camp training, the unit commander will be able to let them off at night to attend those classes provided there is no night time training schedule on that day. So the SAF is, in fact, helping all these reservists to carry on with their part-time studies, wherever possible. With these guidelines, MINDEF has been able to devolve the power of deciding who should be given deferment to the unit commanders because the unit commanders know their men. They are in the best position to decide whether a reservist's application for deferment has merit or not and whether the application can be approved after considering the training schedule that has been prepared.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would take this opportunity to let the House know how effective is this system of devolving it to the commanders to decide on the outcome of each application for deferment. Let me quote you some figures of applications for deferment from part-time students who had been called up for in-camp training. These are figures that I have managed to collect from three of our divisions. Out of 226 applications for deferment from part-time students, between the period June 1990 and May 1991, 151 were approved. In other words, two out of three such applications were approved. So it is not as if the SAF had not been sympathetic or supportive of these applications. We had approved two out of three such applications.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to minimize the need for deferment, MINDEF notifies reservists at least six months in advance of their in-camp training. This gives them ample time to make arrangements to hand over their work to their colleagues, or to make plans for make-up lessons if they are
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> undertaking some part-time studies. Where possible, MINDEF also allows reservists to make their own arrangements, such as for fitness examination and for IPPT, which I have announced recently on Wednesday, 26th June, 1991. By allowing reservists to make their own appointments and to choose their own locations, we have made it more convenient for them to undergo these tests and to serve out their reservist duties.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, reservists should understand that deferment comes at a price, a price for SAF, on the one hand, and for the reservist himself. A reserve unit operates as a team. All members of the team should be present when it is undergoing training. In-camp training helps to buildup team work, mutual support and esprit de corps. When the reservist is absent from in-camp training, he has broken the chain. He has deprived a fellow reservist of a buddy in the training. He has weakened the platoon by his absence. Worse still, Sir, if he is an NCO or an officer, the soldiers under his command would have lost a familiar superior to guide and direct them. All in all, Sir, the value of training to the team will be reduced and continuity disrupted. For the reservist
   <br>
   <br>
   <font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font>
   <br>
   <br> himself, he will have to do make-up in-camp training at a later date. He may have to do two in-camp training in the following year. Otherwise, he will complete his reservist training later than his team mates. When he goes for make-up reservist training he has to be fitted in with a different unit, train with different people under a new and different environment. All these will affect the quality and value of the training to him.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that Mr Chiam and those who have encountered difficulties in securing deferment will now understand that MINDEF is indeed sympathetic to their appeals. However, to maintain an alert, effective and credible SAF, reservists must take in-camp training seriously. So while we are sympathetic and we will do what we can to make reservist service more convenient and less disruptive, not all appeals for deferment can be granted.
