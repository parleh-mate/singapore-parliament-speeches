<br><br><div align="center"><b>Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, Members will recall that on  29th

December, 1960, you announced that at 2.13  p.m. on

that day the former Member for Hong Lim, Mr Ong Eng

Guan,  tendered his resignation to you.  It  was  17

minutes before he was expected to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



appear before the House in Committee to substantiate

his  allegations as he had said he wanted to do.  My

colleague  the Deputy Prime Minister, as  Leader  of

the  House, stated in col. 929 of Hansard, Vol.  14,

No. 11:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This last-minute reversal of stand, after stating

explicitly that he intended to substantiate  charges

which  we believe to be false, speaks for itself.  I

had  expected  him,  honour  bound,  to  pursue  the

allegations  he had made in this House. However,  in

view  of  the fact that he has changed his  mind  17

minutes before the sitting of this Assembly, I  have

to  move  that the motion that is before  the  House

should be adjourned sine die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this adjournment sine die is that

since  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, the man who has  made  the

allegations, is no longer a Member of this House, it

will  be better to have the allegations investigated

and  conducted outside this Chamber. It is intended,

therefore, to set up a Commission of Inquiry with  a

High Court Judge as Commissioner to investigate  the

truth of the allegations that have been made against

two  Ministers,  It is our hope that the  Commission

will  commence its hearing and complete its findings

as  soon as possible so that they could be tabled in

this  House. Thereupon, I shall ask for this  motion

to be put back on the Order Paper for debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Inquiry Report has been tabled in this

House, steps will be taken to hold a by-election  in

the constituency of Hong Lim.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with this statement, a Commission of

Inquiry with a High Court Judge as Commissioner  has

investigated  the truth of the allegations  made  by

Mr   Ong  Eng  Guan  against  two  Ministers,   and

completed  its  hearings and reported  its  findings

within  six  weeks. The Report has been  tabled  and

will be debated this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to announce that a Writ for Elections to be

held  in the constituency of Hong Lim will be issued

tomorrow, 2nd March. Nomination Day, as required  by

the Elections Ordinance, will be nine days after the

issue of the writ, on Saturday, 11th March.

<div align="center"><b>INQUIRY COMMISSION'S REPORT ON MR ONG ENG GUAN'S</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ALLEGATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion of Condemnation)</b></div>



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly takes note of the Report of the

Inquiry Commission into certain allegations made  by

Mr  Ong Eng Guan in the Legislative Assembly on the

10th  and 12th December, 1960, as contained in Paper

Cmd.  7  of 1961, and condemns Mr Ong Eng Guan  for

his  dishonourable conduct unbecoming of an  elected

representative of the people in that  he  repeatedly

used  his privilege in this Assembly as a cloak  for

spreading  malicious falsehoods to  unjustly  injure

innocent  persons  both  inside  and  outside   this

Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



During  the  debate  on  the  Budget  Estimates   in

December  last year, Mr Ong Eng Guan,  then  Member

for  Hong Lim, made certain allegations against  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and  Law.

Because Mr Ong Eng Guan did not substantiate  those

allegations, I on the 19th December, 1960,  moved  a

motion in the following terms:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim

for  his  dishonourable  conduct  unbecoming  of  an

elected  representative of the  people  in  that  he

repeatedly used his privilege in this Assembly as  a

cloak for spreading malicious falsehoods to unjustly

injure innocent persons both inside and outside this

Assembly;  that he be suspended from the service  of

this  Assembly until such time as (i) he  apologises

to this Assembly for his dishonourable conduct; (ii)

he  unreservedly withdraws his unfounded allegations

against  the  Prime Minister and  the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law; and (iii) he assures the  Assembly

that he will not persist in abusing his privilege in

this  Assembly  by  uttering  malicious  falsehoods,

unless  he  be  prepared when challenged  to  repeat

outside  the  Assembly the charges he makes  in  the

Assembly.'



<br><br>In  the  debate  on  this  motion,  I  listed  three

specific  allegations made by  him.  One  allegation

concerns  the re-employment of Mr M. R.  Marcus  in

the  City  Council. In col. 786 in Hansard,  No.  9,

Vol. 14, dated 19th December, 1960, Mr Ong Eng Guan

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I wonder if this is the way to get away from the

P.S.C. in  order  to give a job to this  particular

officer  who  happens  to be a brother-in-law  of  a

Minister.'



<br><br>The other two allegations concern the appointment of

Mr   Kwa   Soon   Chuan   as  Deputy   Commissioner

(Valuation).  In  col. 786 of  the  same  volume  of

Hansard of the same number, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to put it to the

Minister that many of these recommendations - which  I

have read myself - are meant for the purpose of fixing

up certain things.'



<br><br>He also said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In my opinion, there is nothing, as far as I

know, to merit the transfer other than the fact that

he is the brother-in-law of the Prime Minister.'



<br><br>These were serious allegations as they implied  that

these  officers  had  been  favoured  in  the  civil

service because they happened to be related  to  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on this motion, Mr Ong Eng Guan

sought  to  by-pass  my motion  by  challenging  the

ruling  of  the Speaker in admitting  my  motion  of

condemnation,   and  that  this  Assembly   had   no

jurisdiction   to  deal  with  the  matters   raised

therein.  We,  on the Government side,  were  in  no

doubt at all that the Assembly had powers to condemn

the  Member for Hong Lim in the circumstances of the

case  and  in  the  light of the constitutional  and

statutory   provisions  extant  in  Singapore.   The

Opposition,   however,  sought  to  make   political

capital out of this matter by supporting Mr Ong Eng

Guan. They confessed that they were confused on  the

admissibility of the motion. You, Mr Speaker,  have

since sought the opinion of the Fourth

Clerk-at-the-Table  in  the House of Commons-a senior officer  of

that  House primarily charged with the special duty,

when  asked,  of assisting and advising legislatures

in  the  Commonwealth on matters referred to him  by

the  Clerks of such legislatures. You, Mr  Speaker,

read  out  the  opinion of the Fourth

Clerk-at-the-Table at the sitting of the Assembly last Wednesday.

The  Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table states that he  would

be fairly certainly of the opinion that the Assembly

does  have such powers. He adds [Hansard,  Vol.  14,

No. 13, 22nd February, 1961]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There seems to be nothing indeed to prevent any

deliberative body (such as for example  the  Council

of  a  Trade  Union) doing this, provided  that  the

motion does not contain a libel. In the case of  the

Legislative Assembly, the question of libel does not

arise  in  view  of  Section 3  of  the  Powers  and

Privileges  Ordinance, 1955. Furthermore  the  words

"except  upon  a substantive motion moved  for  that

purpose"  contained in Standing Order 46 (10)  would

appear  expressly to envisage the moving of a motion

condemning a Member for his personal conduct.'



<br><br>In  brief, the Fourth Clerk-at-the-table admits that

this  Assembly,  on a substantive  motion,  has  the

power  to condemn Mr Ong Eng Guan for dishonourable

conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 23rd December, 1960, Mr Ong Eng Guan said

he  wished  to  substantiate all the things  he  had

said; he had nothing to apologise for. But, however,

he pleaded for time to prepare his case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



The  Government had no intention to prevent him from

speaking  or  to  prevent him  from  seeking  advice

elsewhere.  The  debate was, therefore,  accordingly

adjourned to the 29th December, 1960, when the House

would resolve itself into Committee to hear whatever

evidence  he  could  bring forward  to  substantiate

those allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 29th December, 1960, Members assembled in

this   Chamber - the  Opposition  perhaps  agog   with

excitement, thinking that Mr Ong Eng Guan  would

provide  them  with the cudgels  to  hammer  at  the

P.A.P. December 29th, however, turned out to  be  an

anti-climax  instead. On that day you, Mr  Speaker,

announced  that  Mr Ong Eng Guan had  tendered  his

resignation from the Assembly a few minutes earlier.

Although  Mr Ong Eng Guan sought to run  away  from

giving  evidence in Committee of the  Assembly,  the

Government obviously could not allow the  matter  to

rest there. If we had permitted Mr Ong Eng Guan  to

leave   his  allegations  unsubstantiated   in   the

Assembly, the smears that he had uttered would  have

stuck  and grave injustice would have been  done  to

the   persons  against  whom  he  had   made   these

allegations.  Accordingly I moved  that  the  motion

condemning Mr Ong Eng Guan be adjourned  sine  die,

and  announced that the Government would  set  up  a

Commission  of  Inquiry with a High Court  Judge  as

Commissioner  to  investigate  the  truth   of   the

allegations  that have been made against  the  Prime

Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commission under Mr Justice Chua was appointed

on  the  31st  December, 1960, with these  terms  of

reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) to inquire into the truth of the allegations

on  the  re-appointment of Mr M. R. Marcus  in

the  City Council made by Mr Ong Eng  Guan  in

the  Legislative Assembly on the 10th December, 1960;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to inquire into the truth of the allegations

on  the  appointment of the Deputy Commissioner

(Valuation)  made by Mr Ong Eng  Guan  in  the

Legislative  Assembly  on  the  12th  December,1960;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to inquire into the truth of the allegations

on  the  appointment of Mr Kwa Soon  Chuan  as

Deputy  Commissioner (Valuation)  made  by  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan in the Legislative  Assembly  on

the 12th December, 1960.'



<br><br>During  the Inquiry an undertaking was given by  the

State  Advocate-General on behalf of the  Government

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No action under the Official Secrets Ordinance or

under  any  other  written law and  no  disciplinary

action  will be taken by the Government against  any

person  who  prior  to  this Inquiry  disclosed  any

information on any matter relating to or in  respect

of  this  Inquiry and/or who will be giving evidence

in this Inquiry'.



<br><br>We gave this undertaking because we had nothing evil

to  hide and we were anxious that the truth be  out.

Members  have  by  now studied  the  Report  of  the

Commission of Inquiry and read the findings  of  the

Commission. On Mr Ong Eng Guan's evidence in  chief

the  Commissioner  had this  to  say:  (On  page  6,

paragraphs  14 and 15 of the Report of  the  Inquiry

Commission, Paper Cmd. 7 of 1961).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`14. Mr Ong Eng Guan gave me the impression that

he  was in possession of some inside knowledge about

the  Government  and  I anticipated  that  startling

disclosures   would  be  made.   I   gathered   this

impression  because the first two days' hearing  and

part  of  the third day's hearing were taken  up  by

arguments by his counsel that Government should give

an  undertaking in no uncertain terms that witnesses

who gave evidence before the Commission would not be

liable   to  criminal  proceedings  or  disciplinary

actions  and  such an undertaking was given  by  the

Government.  Mr Ong Eng Guan, however, had  nothing

to disclose. He did not even have any facts on which

he based his allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Mr Ong Eng Guan, in the course of giving his

evidence,  made statements which were  either

half-truths  or  vague allegations with the intention  of

misleading the Commission. I find that he would tell

an  untruth  when  it  suited  him.  All  the  three

allegations  made  by  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  in   the

Legislative Assembly against the Prime Minister  and

the   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  and  all  the

allegations which he made against the Prime Minister

in  the  course  of  giving  his  evidence  in  this

Commission are untrue, groundless and reckless.  Mr

Ong Eng Guan is a person not to be believed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the re-employment of Mr M. R. Marcus into the

City  Council, Mr P. C. Lim, who was  described  by

Mr Ong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



Eng  Guan  as  his key witness, told the  Commission

that  there  was  nothing  improper  about  the

re-employment of Mr M. R. Marcus, and the Commissioner

found  that  Mr K. M. Byrne did not  influence  the

Prime Minister to re-employ Mr M. R. Marcus and  he

had  nothing  to  do  with Mr  M.  R.  Marcus'

re-employment. The Commissioner was satisfied that  the

Prime Minister in re-employing Mr M. R. Marcus  did

so  in  accordance with certain principles which  he

laid  down,  when he took over control of  the  City

Council from Mr Ong Eng Guan, for the re-employment

of City Council Officers who had resigned during the

period  when Mr Ong Eng Guan was in charge  of  the

City  Council.  The Prime Minister  showed  no  bias

towards  Mr  M.  R. Marcus. The Commissioner  found

that there was nothing improper in re-employing  Mr

M.  R. Marcus and the allegation of Mr Ong Eng Guan

is untrue and groundless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the establishment of the post of Deputy

Commissioner (Valuation) and the appointment of  Mr

Kwa  Soon  Chuan to this post the Commissioner  said

(in  paras.  26 and 29 in page 9, and in paras.  39, 40,  41  and  42  in page 12 of the  Report  of  the Inquiry Commission, Paper Cmd. 7 of 1961):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`26. Mr Ong Eng Guan's allegations are that these

members  of  the Working Party were  all  under  the

instructions  of the Prime Minister or the  Minister

for  Finance, and that "it would be in the  interest

of  civil  servants for their own personal good  and

welfare  to  take directions without  question  from

their  Ministers", and that they  set  out  to  make

recommendations  for the creation  of  the  post  of

Deputy    Commissioner   (Valuation),    and    that

subsequently  they drew up qualifications  for  that

post  to  tailor the job for Mr Kwa Soon  Chuan,  a

brother-in-law of the Prime Minister,  so  that  the

Prime Minister could place his brother-in-law  in  a

key position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan said that he felt that the Deputy Commissioner (Valuation) had far wider statutory

powers  than the Deputy Commissioner of Lands.  This

was said to show to the Commission that the post  of

Deputy Commissioner (Valuation) was a key post. When

Mr  Ong  Eng Guan was questioned he was  unable  to

substantiate it. This statement of Mr Ong Eng  Guan

is absolute nonsense.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`29. I find that no Minister interferred in any

way  with the work and deliberations of the  Working

Party   and   that  when  it  came  to  a   definite

recommendation that recommendation was  put  to  the

Minister  for Finance for his decision. I find  that

there  is no truth in the allegation of Mr Ong  Eng

Guan   that   the   post   of  Deputy   Commissioner

(Valuation)  was  created  just  for  Mr  Kwa  Soon

Chuan.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`39. In the course of his evidence Mr Ong Eng

Guan  mentioned the names of Mr Lim  Eng  Bee,  the

Chairman of the Public Service Commission,  Mr  Lim

Kim  San,  the  Deputy Chairman, and Dr  Phay  Seng

Whatt,  a  member of the Public Service  Commission,

and  said that they were close friends of either the

Prime  Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister,  or  the

Minister for Finance. The suggestion of Mr Ong  Eng

Guan, it seems to me, is that any of these Ministers

could  easily  have  influenced the  Public  Service

Commission to select Mr Kwa Soon Chuan.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`40. Mr Lim Eng Bee, Mr Lim Kim San, and Dr Phay

Seng Whatt stated emphatically that in the course of

their duties no Minister had tried to influence them

and  no Minister had spoken to any of them about Mr

Kwa  Soon Chuan. It is worthy of note that all these

three  gentlemen were members of the Public  Service

Commission  when  that  Commission  considered   the

promotions of timescale officers to Superscale Grade

G and the Commission promoted Mr Un Hon Kun and not

Mr  Kwa Soon Chuan, who was then senior to  Mr  Un

Hon Kun in the Land Office.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`41. The Public Service Commission had given its

reasons for selecting Mr Kwa Soon Chuan and  in  my

opinion  the Public Service Commission  had  made  a

proper selection.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`42. I find that the posting of Mr Kwa Soon Chuan

to  act as Deputy Commissioner (Valuation) was  done

by the Establishment Branch not on the directions of

the  Prime Minister or any Minister but on  its  own

initiative and on Establishment principles.  I  also

find  that  no  Minister had influenced  the  Public

Service Commission in its selection of Mr Kwa  Soon

Chuan to be the Deputy Commissioner (Valuation).  If

the  Prime Minister had wanted to help Mr Kwa  Soon

Chuan in his career in the Administrative Service he

could  easily  have  done so in February,  1960,  by

upholding the security objection against Mr Un  Hon

Kun  thereby giving Mr Kwa Soon Chuan a  chance  of

being  selected for promotion or to continue to  act

in  the  post of Deputy Commissioner for Lands  with

the prospect of being ultimately confirmed in it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a conclusion to his findings on the

terms of reference, the Commissioner had this to say

(para. 43 in page 12):



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`43. I find that there is no truth at all in any

of  the three allegations made by Mr Ong Eng  Guan.

These allegations are groundless and recklessly made

and  there  is  no justification for making  any  of

them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was perhaps fortunate that Mr Ong Eng Guan left the Assembly to face an independent

High  Court  Judge  in  the Commission  of  Inquiry,

otherwise  he might have gone out and said  that  he

was  intimidated by the Government majority and that

judgment  was  passed on him by those  whom  he  had

fought.  We now know that Mr Ong Eng Guan,  in  the

Commissioner's  own words, is "a person  not  to  be

believed",  and who "would tell an untruth  when  it

suited him".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Report of the Inquiry Commission has proved

conclusively that Mr Ong Eng Guan, when  he  was  a

Member  of  the  Assembly, had  grossly  abused  his

privilege  in  this  Assembly in making  allegations

which could not be substantiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me cite a case where an abuse of Assembly privilege was made in the Uttar Pradesh

Legislative  Assembly in India.  A  digest  of  what

occurred  in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative  Assembly

has been published in the Journal of the Society  of

Clerks-at-the-Table  in  Commonwealth   Parliaments,

Volume XXVII for 1958, pages 128 to130.



<br><br><div align="center">'India:    Uttar   Pradesh   Legislative    Assembly</div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insinuations by a Member. - On 10th February Shri

Genda Singh, M.L.A. [i.e., Member of the Legislative

Assembly]  gave  notice  of  certain  short   notice

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scrutiny by the office about their

admissibility the orders of the Deputy Speaker  were

obtained  on  17th  February, 1958,  and  they  were

tabled for answer on 21st February, 1958. Shri Genda

Singh's  complaint  was  that  his  questions  after

admission  had  been sent to the  Minister  on  11th

February and that the Minister intentionally delayed

giving the reply of the said questions till the 21st

February. When the questions were answered  on  21st

February,  Shri Genda Singh said that  the  Minister

defied  the Rule and deliberately delayed  answering

of  questions. He was told by the Speaker that there

had  been no delay on the part of the Minister, that

the   question  of  admissibility  itself  had  been

decided  up  to 17th February by the Deputy  Speaker

and  that  they  were  tabled for  answers  on  21st

February,  which was the day meant for the Minister.

Shri Genda



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



Singh,  however,  insisted that his  questions  were

admitted  on 11th and had been sent to the  Minister

concerned  for  answers on the  11th  and  that  the

Minister, who was in the habit of delaying  answers,

intentionally delayed giving answers till  the  21st

and   that  the  answers  given  were  evasive.   He

persisted   in  his  allegation  that  the   Revenue

Minister  intentionally delayed the replies  to  the

questions and was guilty of violation of rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a request that the matter be referred to

the Committee of Privileges, where many things would

come to light (the implication being that there  had

been  some tampering with the records). The  Speaker

thereupon  referred  the  matter  to  the  Privilege

Committee for inquiry and report under Rule 67.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee investigated the case and in their

Report  came  to  a  unanimous  decision  that   the

questions  had been sent to the Revenue Minister  on

17th   February   and  that  there   had   been   no

manipulation whatsoever of any kind in  the  records

of  the  Assembly  Secretariat.  The  Committee  was

further of the opinion that if a member deliberately

makes  a  wrong statement and tries to  mislead  the

House,  he should be held to be guilty of the breach

of privilege of the House. The Committee, therefore,

came  to  the  conclusion that the conduct  of  Shri

Genda  Singh  in  the House, in  persisting  in  his

charge   against   the  Revenue  Minister   of   his

deliberately delaying the reply to his questions and

his   obvious  insinuations  that  there  was   some

tampering  of  records in the Assembly  Secretariat,

was  contumacious and disrespectful and that he  was

thus guilty of a breach of privilege of the House.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shri Genda Singh did not tender any apology for

his  contempt  against  the Revenue  Minister,  Shri

Charan Singh, and was condemned by the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what Shri Genda Singh said in the Uttar

Pradesh  Legislative Assembly was pretty mild.  What

he had done was that he had uttered an innuendo when

by saying that certain things would come to light he

insinuated that there was a tampering of records and

that  this  could  be revealed by the  Committee  of

Privileges. Mr Ong Eng Guan had uttered  more  than

Mr  Shri  Genda  Singh  had uttered.  He  had  made

specific   and   direct   allegations   and    these

allegations  have  now been discovered  by  the  Commission of Inquiry to be false.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr Ong Eng Guan is not today in this

Chamber, his absence, however, does not prevent  the

House  from  condemning  him for  his  dishonourable

conduct in abusing his privilege in this Assembly as

a cloak for spreading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



malicious  falsehoods  to unjustly  injure  innocent

persons both inside and outside this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

oppose  the motion of the Deputy Prime Minister.  On

the 11th of January, 1961, the Deputy Prime Minister

said  this  of Mr Ong Eng Guan - I refer to  Hansard

[unrevised transcript], col. 984:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whether a man who is prepared to be as

unscrupulous as to tell lies in this Chamber  should

be  considered worthy of representing a  section  of

the people of Singapore - that is the main issue.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleague, Mr Ong Eng Guan,

will stand as a candidate in the by-election in Hong

Lim.   I   think  it  is  too  early  to  make   any

pronouncements  on him yet. Let the people  of  Hong

Lim  decide  as to who tell lies and who  should  be

condemned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I reject and disagree with the

findings of this Commission of Inquiry. The most apt

description of this Report is to use the same  words

spoken  by the Secretary-General of the P.A.P. when

he attacked the Buttrose Report on the Chew Swee Kee

Inquiry published during the last general elections.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to the Straits Times dated

28th May, 1959, page 7, column 8:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Buttrose Commission Report was criticised by

leaders  of  the  P.A.P. at  a  lunchtime  rally  at

Fullerton Square.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Secretary-General of the Party, accused the Commissioner, Mr Justice Buttrose, of

having  exceeded  the terms of  reference.  Mr  Lee

said,  "It was not within his terms of reference  to

pass  judgment on what I said in the Assembly.  That

is  for the people of Singapore to decide." He  said

that during the Inquiry while he was cross-examining

and  giving evidence, Mr Justice Buttrose had  been

very  careful to keep him (Mr Lee) within the terms

of  reference but he himself had strayed outside his

terms  of reference in several parts of the  Report.

Mr  Lee  said, "The final judgment on this  matter,

however,  is not made by the Judge but by  the  next

Assembly which shall debate the issue."'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, the final judgment on this Report

will be made by the people of Hong Lim.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I recall a joint Press statement which my

colleague,  the  Member  for  Punggol,  and   myself

released on 30th December, 1960, wherein we said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Governments like Commissions of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not forgotten those appointed by the

former Government.'



<br><br>Yes,  Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore have

not  forgotten  the Commission of Inquiry  into  the

Tanjong  Pagar  by-election and the  Chew  Swee  Kee

Commission  of Inquiry. Neither have they  forgotten

the  Commission  of Inquiry into the  City  Council.

Therefore, Sir, this Commission is no exception  and

neither    will    its   findings - with    which    I

disagree - change the fortunes of this  Government  in

the Hong Lim by-election. As Commissions have failed

miserably  to  save the S.P.A. Government,  so  this

Commission  of Inquiry will similarly  fail  in  the

Hong Lim by-election.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I first express my condolences  to

the  hon.  Members opposite in what must be  another

gloomy moment in their chequered political careers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time they have been

embarrassed   by   the  findings   of   an   Inquiry

Commission. Yet once again, the P.A.P. has  appeared

before  an  Inquiry  Commission and  vindicated  its

reputation  for honesty and integrity. It  is  again

the  anti-P.A.P. elements who have been  embarrassed

by the findings of an Inquiry Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan, egged on by Right-wing politicians, sought to slander the P.A.P. Government

with allegations of political corruption against two

Ministers.  Sir,  the findings of the  Chua  Inquiry

Commission  have not only cleared the two  Ministers

of  nepotism,  but  have instead  substantiated  the

P.A.P.'s  contention that Mr Ong  Eng  Guan - who  we

have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



told  by  the Member for Cairnhill would be fighting

the   Opposition's  battle  in  the  Hong  Lim

by-election - is a man not to be believed and a  man  who

would not hesitate to tell an untruth when it suited

him.  This,  Sir, is the opinion of  an  experienced

Judge one of whose jobs is to assess the credibility

or otherwise of a witness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied just now quoted the

P.A.P.'s   verdict  on  the  Buttrose   Commission's

Report, but he did not dare, and I am quite sure  he

will  not  dare, do what the P.A.P. did. The  P.A.P.

made the statement about the Buttrose Commission  at

a  public  meeting  and  I  invite  the  Member  for

Aljunied  or  Mr  Ong Eng Guan  to  make  the  same

statement about the Chua Inquiry Commission  outside

the Assembly at a public meeting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the time has come when

there  should  not  be  challenges  of  that  nature

shouted across the Chamber of this Assembly, because

challenges  of  that  nature  may  be  construed  as

breaches of privilege of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Keep to the subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, we will keep to the subject.

Mr Ong Eng Guan, who is now going to fight the Hong

Lim by-election for the Opposition, has been said by

Justice  Chua as a man who cannot be relied upon  to

tell the truth or who would not hesitate to tell  an

untruth when it suited him. This assessment  of  Mr

Ong  was based on his performance before the Inquiry

Commission  in the course of only ten sittings.  Mr

Ong,  moreover,  gave his evidence under  oath.  Not

only  did  Mr  Ong  persist in  the  falsehoods  he

uttered  in  this  Assembly, but  with  pathological

consistency he embarked upon fresh falsehoods during

the Inquiry itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since Mr Ong Eng Guan has been nominated by

the  S.P.A. to fight the Opposition's battle, it  is

only  fair that the Opposition should point  out  in

their next statement this evaluation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



of  their  pin-up  boy made by Mr Justice  Chua.  I

refer to page 6, paragraph 15 of the Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, in the course of giving his

evidence,  made statements which were  either

half-truths  or  vague allegations with the intention  of

misleading the Commission. I find that he would tell

an untruth when it suited him.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right-wing politicians can be quite sure that

Mr  Ong Eng Guan would be fighting the Opposition's

battle  in  a  manner which, I  am  sure,  would  do

justice to the Opposition's cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of Mr Justice Chua furnishes proof

beyond  all  doubt  that  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  acted

dishonourably  in  this Assembly. Anyone  who  tells

falsehoods,  knowing  them to be  falsehoods,  under

cover  of  Assembly  privilege  to  injure  innocent

people outside and inside this Assembly, is, in  our

opinion,   guilty  of  dishonourable  conduct.   And

dishonourable  conduct on the  part  of  an  elected

representative of the people must be severely  dealt

with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, Sir, the Opposition has somewhat different

views on this matter and, if so, we shall be glad to

hear any original point of view. The issue before us

is  simple:  "Did Mr Ong utter reckless falsehoods?

If  he  did  utter such falsehoods  under  cover  of

Assembly  privilege, was he not being dishonourable?

If  he  had  uttered lies, then  should  he  not  be

compelled  to  withdraw them and  apologise  to  the

House?  Would not democracy be brought into contempt

and  ridicule if Assembly privilege were used  as  a

cloak to utter falsehoods against innocent people?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answers to all these questions are "yes"

then  this  motion, far from being  a  blow  against

democracy,  is  intended to  make  more  secure  the

foundations of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the moment this censure motion was

brought  before  this Assembly, the  Right-wing  and

anti-P.A.P. politicians have sought to confuse  the

issue  by claiming that it was a Government move  to

muzzle a Member of the Opposition. For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



Sir,   on   18th   December,  1960,  the   Singapore

Congress - which I understand is a sort of politically

conscious  animal lovers' league - gave a strong  plug

for  Mr  Ong presumably in the belief that  he  was

another underdog to be championed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's censure motion was described by

the  Singapore Congress as a fight between democracy

and  dictatorship  and an attempt by  "occupiers  of

Government  Benches ... to muzzle a  Member  of  the

Opposition".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 24th December, 1960, the coffin was opened

and  the  Workers  Party came out with  a  statement

trying  to depict Mr Ong Eng Guan as a champion  of

democracy. The Chairman of the Workers Party  issued

a  statement couched in the following terms. I quote

from the Straits Times of 24th December, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chairman of the Workers Party, Mr David

Marshall,  today issued this statement:  "The  first

meeting  of  the  new  executive  committee  of  the

Workers Party repeats that the Workers Party is  not

associated with Mr Ong Eng Guan and has never  been

associated with Mr Ong, but expresses its  sympathy

and  respect  for the heroic effort of  Mr  Ong  in

struggling   against  the  attempt  of  the   P.A.P.

Government to silence him and nullify the choice  of

the people of Hong Lim."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Marshall is no political chicken and he

must  have known that there was no attempt to muzzle

Mr  Ong.  In  fact,  Sir, Mr  Ong  was  given  the

opportunity  under  the motion  to  open  his  mouth

wider.  He  could  have spoken freely  in  order  to

substantiate his allegations. He was free to do this

and  that  was what panicked him. As you  recollect,

Sir,   he   said  in  this  House  that   he   would

substantiate  his  allegations, but  when  the  time

came,  this man for whom Mr Marshall has such great

respect got cold feet and did a bunk - and for a  very

good  reason. He could speak freely only if he  were

allowed  to  utter malicious falsehoods  behind  the

protective  shield of Assembly privilege.  This  was

the  sort  of  heroic struggle which has  apparently

earned  for  Mr Ong the respect and greetings  from

the political has-beens of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Ong was reduced to silence in the Assembly,

it was only because he was put in the predicament of

having   to  tell  the  truth  or  have   his   lies

mercilessly  exposed. Chronically incapable  of  the

first and unable to face the second, he declined the

opportunity  of speaking freely in this Assembly  by

substantiating his allegations and decided  to  quit

the Assembly. Sir, he is not, as Right-wing admirers

of  his  are  trying to insinuate,  a  refugee  from

P.A.P. intolerance. He was not expelled  from  this

Assembly by the Government. He ran away of  his  own

accord,  simply because he had lied his way  into  a

situation where resignation appeared to him the only

safe course - or so he thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of this motion is simple. If the

allegations he made were false, and were  proved  to

be  false,  then  he  could  have  remained  in  the

Assembly   by  doing  one  of  two  things:   either

withdrawing  his falsehoods and apologising  to  the

House;  or  repeating those falsehoods  outside  the

Assembly   without   the  protection   of   Assembly

privilege. But he did neither of these things.  What

Mr    Ong's   "heroic   struggle",   as   political

opportunists describe it, amounted to  is  this.  He

wanted  not  only the privilege of lying  safely  in

this Assembly, but he also regarded it as an affront

to his honour and to the cause of democracy in being

asked to substantiate his allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all this attempt by Right-wing forces to

depict  Mr Ong as a heroic fighter for free  speech

boils down to is this: freedom of speech, so Mr Ong

and   his  supporters  believe,  also  includes  the

freedom to lie.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in essence, is the so-called heroic struggle

of   Mr   Ong.  That,  in  effect,  would  be   the

"Opposition's battle" that Mr Ong would be fighting

in  Hong  Lim. Sir, the P.A.P.'s view of freedom  of

speech  is this: freedom of speech means the freedom

to  tell the truth without fear. As against this, we

have  Mr Ong's and the S.P.A.'s stand that  freedom

of  speech - they claim that we tried to restrict  Mr

Ong telling lies freely - therefore must include



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



the  freedom to lie recklessly and deliberately.  If

an elected representative is not allowed in the name

of his voters to tell falsehoods, then, according to

Mr   Ong   and   his  Right-wing  supporters,   the

foundations   of  democracy  would  be   undermined.

Freedom to tell the truth as against freedom to tell

lies - that, when all is said and done, is what  this

motion has been trying to decide on from the start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Hong Lim and the people of Singapore

will  have to choose between the advocates of  these

two sorts of freedom - freedom to speak the truth, and

freedom  to  tell  lies  behind  the  protection  of

Assembly  privilege. Sir, we do not think  that  the

Right-wing politicians who now proclaim Mr  Ong  as

their favourite in the Hong Lim by-election believed

for one moment that Mr Ong's allegations were true.

If  they  had  really suspected that his allegations

had  some substance, then I am sure they would  have

been   the   first   to  agitate  for   a   thorough

investigation into the matter. If the allegations of

nepotism and political corruption were true,  or  if

they were believed to be true, then the P.A.P. would

have  been discredited in the eyes of the people.  I

am  quite  sure, Sir, that Members of the Opposition

are  fully  aware of the damage proof  of  political

corruption  can  do to a political party.  Mr  Chew

Swee  Kee's  case is a very good example.  In  fact,

what surprised us on this side of the House was  the

indifference  with  which the  Opposition,  some  of

whose  Members  tried to nourish  the  soul  on  the

Government  with  discourses  on  moral  rearmament,

appeared  to  have  taken Mr Ong's  allegations  of

political  corruption against two P.A.P.  Ministers.

Those  were  serious charges and, if  true,  merited

severe punishment. But you will recollect, Sir, that

there  were  no strident demands from the Opposition

for  an  immediate  investigation into  the  matter.

There  was  no  insistence that Mr  Ong  should  be

afforded  every opportunity at the earliest possible

moment  to  prove  his allegations;  nor  did  those

outside this Assembly, who have nominated Mr Ong as

the patron saint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



of   democratic  freedom,  demand  that  Mr   Ong's

allegations  be  investigated and that  Mr  Ong  be

pressed  to  prove  his  case.  However,  when   the

Government did the Opposition's work by setting  up,

on  its own accord, an Inquiry Commission after  Mr

Ong's   resignation,  even  then  we  expected   the

Opposition wildly to acclaim this move and press for

the  speedy  conclusion of the Inquiry.  Instead  of

this,  we  found  Mr Ong's friends making  frenzied

demands for an immediate by-election. Members of the

Opposition  joined  in  this chorus.  All  this  was

rather  curious, to say the least. A Commission  had

been  set up to inquire into serious allegations  of

nepotism  by  Mr  Ong. Moral  re-armers  and  moral

disarmers - one would have thought would  have  waited

to  find  out  whether the charges of nepotism  were

true. In fact, it would have been to their political

interest  to  wait for the findings of  the  Inquiry

Commission before the by-election. If they  believed

that  Mr Ong's allegations had some substance, then

the chances of success for Mr Ong in Hong Lim would

have  enhanced  a hundred-fold. It would  then  have

been  a  straight fight between an honest man,  like

Mr  Ong,  and a corrupt government. And the  S.P.A.

knows  very  well that the people of  Singapore  are

always  ready  to  vote for an honest  and  truthful

candidate. That would have been a worthy battle  for

Mr Ong to fight for the Opposition in Hong Lim. But

if,  on  the other hand, Mr Ong was proved a  liar,

then  the  S.P.A. would not have been  put  in  the

predicament  of getting a proved liar to  fight  its

battle in Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is precisely the predicament in which the

S.P.A. now  finds itself. Its battle  in  Hong  Lim

would be fought by a man found to be a common  or  a

garden  liar. In view of the findings of the Inquiry

Commission, the S.P.A. and other admirers of Mr Ong

in this Assembly will either have to join with us in

condemning  a  man  who  had  clearly  indulged   in

dishonourable conduct, or stand loyally by him since

he has had the S.P.A.'s blessings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it may be that the supporters

of  Mr Ong knew that his allegations were false and

were  anxious that they should not be proved  to  be

false.  As  long  as Mr Ong was not  exposed  as  a

purveyor  of  deliberate  falsehoods  and  was   not

prevented,   in  the  name  of  free  speech,   from

purveying new falsehoods in this Assembly, he  would

be  of  great use to the Right-wing enemies  of  the

P.A.P. He could, far more effectively than the

Right-wing, confuse the masses about the P.A.P. After all,

Mr  Ong was a former Minister of the Government and

a Party member, and he had moreover hinted from time

to  time  that he had secrets which would  discredit

the  Party  and  the Government.  This  was  another

dishonourable  tactic that Mr Ong adopted  in  this

Assembly since his eviction from the Party. He  made

vague  innuendoes  that he had  a  lot  of  sinister

things  to  tell about the P.A.P. He  tried  similar

tactics with the Inquiry Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hearings began, he produced not only an

impressive list of 22 witnesses, but made no end  of

a  fuss  about assurances. He demanded a categorical

assurance  from  the Government  that  none  of  his

witnesses would be victimised. All this hitching  of

belts  and  flexing  of  muscles  suggested  to  the

Commission that Mr Ong was about to make  startling

disclosures.  Sir,  let me quote  from  the  Inquiry

Report - paragraph 14 in page 6. As a  result  of  all

this  posing as a man who had deep knowledge of  the

inner  workings  of the Party and of the  Government

machinery, this is the effect he seems to have  made

on the Judge:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan gave me the impression that he

was in possession of some inside knowledge about the

Government   and   I  anticipated   that   startling

disclosures   would  be  made.   I   gathered   this

impression  because the first two day's hearing  and

part  of  the third day's hearing were taken  up  by

arguments by his counsel that Government should give

an  undertaking in no uncertain terms that witnesses

who gave evidence before the Commission would not be

liable to criminal proceedings .'



and   the  Government  gave  those  assurance.  But,

concludes Mr Justice Chua:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, however, had nothing to

disclose. He did not even have any facts on which he

based his allegations.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



This  was  not  because Mr Ong was  prevented  from

speaking  and  telling all he knew.  In  fact,  when

questioned by the Commissioner, he assured him  that

he  had been given every opportunity to say what  he

wanted  to  say  that there had been no  attempt  to

silence  him  in the Commission. Therefore,  it  was

surprising to hear the Member for Aljunied  claiming

or  indicating  that Mr Ong, when  the  by-election

takes  place, is going to make new disclosures.  But

we  know, Sir, Mr Ong has put on this act of a  man

who knows everything before - inside the Party and in

the  Assembly. He has often hinted vaguely  that  he

had inside knowledge about the terrible goings-on in

the  P.A.P.  However, every time he was  pressed  to

elaborate on these vague smears, he chose to act  as

though the world was not yet ready to receive  these

awful  disclosures of what I can  only  describe  as

"Maria  Ong".  However, he could not get  away  with

this act before a Commission where he could be

cross-examined on the spot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Right-wing is

capitalising on Mr Ong's claim that,  as  a  former

P.A.P. member, he had awful and terrible secrets  to

disclose. The Right-wing, who used him as  a

stool-pigeon,  may have suspected that his act was phoney.

However, if by these vague smears and lies he  could

create doubts and suspicions about the P.A.P.,  then

he  should not only be encouraged but protected from

exposure as a chronic and pathological liar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must have been quite clear to many of his

Right-wing patrons, very early on, that his allegations in

the  Assembly  were  false and that  the  motion  of

censure   would   expose  him  as  a   purveyor   of

falsehoods. And once he was exposed as a liar,  then

his  lies  could  do no damage to the  P.A.P.,  and,

therefore,  his  usefulness to the Right-wing  would

have ceased to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Right-wing political opportunists like Mr

Marshall  and  Mrs  Leon Soh and  others  tried  to

confuse  the  issue by claiming that the  motion  of

censure was a blow at democracy. The many S.P.A. and

Labour Front lawyers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



advised Mr Ong must have known that his allegations

could  not  stand close scrutiny. So the  Right-wing

rallied  to his side by implying that the  truth  or

otherwise  of his allegations was a trivial  matter,

and that the censure motion was really an attempt by

Government to silence Mr Ong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Assembly too, Mr Ong, ably assisted by

Members of the Opposition, had tried to confuse  the

issue by arguments about whether or not the Assembly

had  the power to suspend a Member for dishonourable

conduct.  At  one  point, Sir, I  remember  Mr  Ong

pleaded  with  you with all his heart to  refer  the

matter to Sir Ivor Jennings. It is because he was in

a  fix, and, therefore, anything that would postpone

the  moment when he knew he would be called upon  to

substantiate  his  allegations,  or  apologise   and

withdraw his allegations, or repeat them outside the

Assembly  Chamber, was welcome to him.  So  when  he

found that he had no choice but to substantiate  his

allegations, he resigned. It is now clear that if he

could  have substantiated his allegations,  then  he

would  have  lost  no time in trying  to  prove  his

allegations.  It was because he knew that  he  could

not  that  he, on his own initiative, resigned  from

the  Assembly.  No  doubt he thought  that  once  he

resigned,  he  would be spared the embarrassment  of

having to substantiate his allegations. He preferred

the  election platform at Hong Lim because  he  knew

that on an election platform, he would not have  his

lies challenged then and there, face to face, but he

could  go  on repeating lies privately in the  quiet

rooms of his voters unchallenged. That is why he now

claims  that this issue of whether Mr Ong Eng  Guan

is  a  liar  or not should be decided at  Hong  Lim.

Because a liar, Sir, likes a monologue. He does  not

like to be cross-examined. He likes to speak all  by

himself unchallenged. And that is why the Member for

Aljunied  is  now pleading, "Let us  have  a  second

trial  at  Hong Lim", where Mr Ong can clearly  and

freely spread new lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the appointment of an Inquiry

Commission upset Mr Ong and his patrons.  It  meant

that  he  would  still  have  to  substantiate   his

allegations,  and  this  time  before  an  impartial

Judge. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



appeared  to  Mr Ong and his friends  that  it  was

simply a case of jumping out of the frying pan  into

the  fire. So his friends once again rallied to  his

side.  The  Member  for  Aljunied  was  all  for  an

immediate election. There was no need, he  said,  to

wait for the findings of the Commission because that

might take many, many months. The S.P.A. also joined

in  this  demand for an immediate election. All  Mr

Ong's Right-wing supporters, strangely enough,  were

most  anxious to have an election before the Inquiry

Commission had decided whether Mr Ong's allegations

of  nepotism were true or not. I believe  they  must

have had very good reasons for insisting that

the by-election be held before the findings of the  Inquiry

Commission. They must have known that if he appeared

before  the  Commission, he would be  exposed  as  a

petty liar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report of the Commission of Inquiry is

now before us - only some two months since Mr Ong Eng

Guan  resigned. Instead of the Assembly  pronouncing

verdict  on Mr Ong Eng Guan, we have had this  done

for us by a third person - a Judge of the High Court.

All  Mr  Ong's allegations have been proved  to  be

reckless fabrications. He has been described by  the

Judge  as  a man not to be believed, as  a  man  who

would  tell an untruth if it suited him.  The  Judge

also  found  that Mr Ong made new false allegations

before the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these add up to one thing. Not only is

Mr  Ong capable of dishonourable conduct but he was

guilty  of  dishonourable conduct in  this  Assembly

when  he  recklessly  made allegations  against  two

Ministers,   knowing  that   what   he   said   were

falsehoods. The fact that he dared not repeat  these

allegations outside the Assembly proved  this.  Sir,

if   all   these   are  not  reasonable   proof   of

dishonourable conduct, then I would like to know the

meaning of "dishonourable".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his evidence before the Commission, Mr

Ong described what he claimed was the pattern of the

Prime  Minister's  way  of working.  This  so-called

pattern  existed  largely in Mr Ong's  imagination,

but it would not be amiss to draw the pattern of Mr

Ong's dishonourable conduct in this Assembly. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



three   allegations  he  made  against  two   P.A.P.

Ministers were not an accidental indiscretion on the

part  of  Mr Ong. Had it been so, the matter  could

have  been  amicably settled by Mr Ong  withdrawing

his  allegations.  But these three allegations  were

part  of  a  systematic campaign of calumny  through

lies. He had used this strategy of lies and whispers

in  the  Party  since after the  P.A.P. formed  the

Government. Sir, he suffered from the delusion  that

he was a budding Mao Tse-tung and Sun Yat Sen rolled

into  one. In fact, Sir, during the hearings of  the

Commission,  he  declared quite seriously  that  the

aberrations  in  his  personal  life  in  some  ways

paralleled those of Sun Yat Sen and Mao Tse-tung. He

was   increasingly  resentful  of  the   fact   that

colleagues  in the Party had not treated  him  as  a

budding Mao Tse-tung and acclaimed him the life  and

soul  of  the Party. He began, therefore, intriguing

in  order  to  build a personal faction  inside  the

Party.  And  his  favourite weapon  was  the  secret

smearing of his own colleagues. Fortunately, Sir, he

was  never a clever liar, and it was inevitable that

he  should  be found out sooner or later.  And  when

members of the Party, some of whom had at first been

taken  in by his lies, compared notes, they  decided

that  his  lies and intrigues should be checked.  As

you know, Sir, he was subsequently expelled from the

Party;  though even when he was expelled, he made  a

claim  that the P.A.P. delegates who voted  for  his

expulsion  did so because the building  in  question

was surrounded by armed secret police. This again is

another lie to get out of the previous lies  he  had

told.  So, Sir, immediately after his expulsion,  22

Assemblymen signed and published a statement listing

the lies he had told them. This, in fact, formed the

core   of  the  charges  against  him.  And   again,

characteristically he announced in the  papers  that

he  would  appear before the Party to  answer  these

charges. But as in the case of the Assembly, on  the

day  fixed for the hearing, he changed his mind  and

he did not appear, and as justification he cooked up

a   lie  that  had  he  appeared  before  his  Party

colleagues,  he  would have been  subjected  to  the

terror of a secret trial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he could not answer the charges

because  they were true and his accusers were  there

ready  to  confront him with the evidence. That  was

why  he  took no action against the Assemblymen  who

had  publicly caused to be printed in the newspapers

the  charge that he was a liar and listed  the  lies

that he had told.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore he had hoped to win a following by his

so-called 16 resolutions. But even though  he  posed

as  an  extreme Left-wing revolutionary, his support

did not increase. He had, therefore, to do something

spectacular   to   prop  up  his  fading   political

prestige.  Therefore, one assumes that  he  suddenly

became  aware that Assembly privilege could be  used

as a powerful weapon to support his fading prestige.

So he began, first in a modest way, by telling small

falsehoods against the Government and individuals in

the Party. He claimed that the P.A.P. Government was

run  by  Messrs.  Blades, Thomson  and  Meadows.  He

alleged  that the P.A.P. had forgotten  the  workers

and had taken to oppressing the poor. The P.A.P., he

said,  had  become  a  tool of the  Right-wing.  The

P.A.P., he said, was no longer anti-colonial because

it  did  not  demand  an  independent  Singapore.  I

notice, Sir, that since the resignation of Mr  Ong,

this slogan of an independent Singapore has now been

taken  up  by  the  fireside revolutionary  and  the

woolly  anti-colonialist from the  S.P.A.  - Mr  Lim

Choon  Mong. It is a historical fate, Sir, that  all

opportunists become informers for the Right-wing and

subsequently their ignominious tool. It is only  the

Right-wing which is openly championing Mr Ong.  His

support  has  come exclusively from the  Right-wing.

Not  a single progressive organisation has supported

him. They have, instead, supported the P.A.P. simply

because,  for  all Mr Ong's falsehoods,  they  know

that the P.A.P. does not cheat the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr Ong's falsehoods in this Assembly did not

help  him  very  much. After nearly  six  months  of

employing  this campaign of lies, his  only  visible

means of support were the Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



for  Aljunied  and Punggol. That  was,  for  him,  a

depressing thought. He had, therefore, to indulge in

bolder  and  more spectacular lies, and what  better

lie than a charge of nepotism against two Ministers?

Had  he been allowed to get away with this, then  we

are quite certain that he would have been encouraged

to  spread  new  lies under the  cloak  of  Assembly

privilege. For he had nothing to lose. If  his  lies

were  not believed, he had nothing to lose.  But  by

persisting  in  baseless smears and allegations,  he

hoped  that some of his lies would be believed.  The

fact that his smears injured innocent people outside

the Assembly was no concern to Mr Ong. These people

could  not hit back as he had the further protection

of  Assembly  privilege if they dared to  hit  back.

Such  conduct is, in our view, dishonourable and  in

the  long run will bring democracy into contempt and

ridicule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know which way the Opposition is going

to vote on this motion, and we do not care. However,

they  will  agree  on one thing. It  was  worthwhile

waiting  for the Inquiry Commission's Report  before

proceeding  with the by-election in  Hong  Lim.  The

Report makes it clear that the "Opposition's battle"

will  be  fought in Hong Lim by a man who cannot  be

trusted, by a man who would not hesitate to tell  an

untruth if it suited him. Beggars, Sir, it is  said,

cannot   be   choosers.  The  Right-wing   may   not

sympathise with Mr Ong, but they have no choice but

to  unite in support of him. Mr Ong, for his  part,

may  not  have  a  high regard  for  his  Right-wing

patrons,  but  he  cannot  afford  to  spurn   their

patronage.  It is simply a question of he  and  they

either  hanging together or hanging separately.  Our

guess  and  hope is that they will hang together  in

Hong Lim.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to join issue with the Minister for Culture. He

has found it necessary at this particular sitting to

make a pre-election speech. In spite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



of  the culture that he is trying to introduce  into

Singapore,  he has found it necessary to attack  the

Opposition  for  a  shame that is  nothing  but  the

P.A.P.'s. It is not the S.P.A.'s. Who is Mr Ong Eng

Guan?  He  was the beloved hero and comrade  of  the

P.A.P.,  the  man  who, by his antics  in  the  City

Council  as Mayor, had helped the P.A.P. to  victory

in  the 1959 general elections. And this is the debt

of  gratitude  that he got from the leaders  of  the

P.A.P. whom he had helped to get into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they say we are Right-wing. What is

Right-wing  and  what  is  Left-wing? The  public  is  not

interested as to who is Right-wing and who is

Left-wing-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Just what is it?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They are interested in their

livelihood.  They  are interested in  whether  their

rice-bowl can be filled or not. There is no need for

us  to  describe ourselves as Left-wing and  call  a

mass meeting on the Congo just to get the support of

Left-wing adventurers and say, "We had 15,000 people

attending  the  meeting," whereas  at  their  annual

conference  less  than  a  thousand  P.A.P. members

attended their meeting. And this they cannot hide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You never had a conference.

When did you hold yours?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I urge the Members on the

Government  Front Benches to contain  themselves?  I

would also suggest to the Member for Cairnhill  that

he should contain himself and not get too excited.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir, if I find I

have  to  speak in such a tone, but one should  have

expected the Minister for Culture to be a little bit

more  cultured in his attack on the Opposition. Sir,

he  then says that we have been clamouring for a

by-election,  and  that we do not want a Commission  of

Inquiry  to be held. To us, we could pot  care  less

whether Ong Eng Guan was right or wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He said so they do not care how

we vote. So if we can say what he said, we could not

care  less  what  Ong  Eng Guan  said  if  what  the

Minister  for  Culture says is to be given  credence

and, shall we say,-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Talking about freedom!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the truth that he could not

care  less how we vote, may we in the same way  tell

him,  we  do  not worry what Ong Eng Guan  said?  We

wanted an early by-election because it is the  right

of  the  people of Singapore to have a  by-election,

and  any by-election should not be held at the  whim

and  fancy  of  the  Government which  hopes  to  be

returned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture said that suddenly

because  of  Ong  Eng  Guan, we are  clamouring  for

independence for Singapore. Sir, we took  that  line

months  and months ago, because we knew that  merger

with  the Federation is not possible because of  the

P.A.P.  The  P.A.P. has damaged all prospects  of  a

merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And even the Prime Minister had

to  admit  that there could be no merger during  the

life-time of this Government. Sir, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He must have some

consideration-

Member is not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Only last week, Sir, on a point

of  explanation, I was not given an  opportunity  to

explain.  Sir, I would not like to cloud  the  issue

today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



by   speaking  on  matters  that  could  rightly  be

classified  as  a pre-election speech.  We  are  not

going  to  contest this by-election for  the  simple

reason-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That you know you will be

defeated!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister is

backbenchers but to the whole Assembly. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We are not interested in this

by-election  because even if we were to win  one  extra

seat,  it would have no effect on the majority which

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, let us now come to the

motion before the House. I can assure you, Sir, that

in spite of whatever digs the Government benches may

have at me, it is not going to make me lose my trend

of thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in considering the Report of the Commission

of  Inquiry,  we  have also to take account  of  the

evidence  given in that Inquiry. And as  we  do  not

have  a  verbatim report of the evidence,  we  have,

therefore,  to  reply  on the lengthy  reports  that

appeared  in  the local Press. Sir,  the  manner  in

which  the  evidence  was given  by  the  contending

parties  is  a  reflection of the  kind  of  culture

ingrained  in  the minds of P.A.P. leaders  and

ex-leaders,  in  spite of the fact that the  Government

boast  of a Minister for Culture. They seemed to  be

in  their  element and gave ample  evidence  of  the

training  they  have  had of the  art  of  character

assassination. This has done the country great harm-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -inside as well as outside

Singapore.  So  much so, Sir, that the  two  motions

tabled last week by the Government on Algeria and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



the  Congo  were  considered by the uncharitable  as

attempts  by  the Government to restore  the  waning

prestige  inside and outside Singapore.  We  do  not

take  this  view, Sir, because we do not think  this

view  is  correct  and  because  we  know  that  the

Government  is composed of honourable  men.  It  has

claimed  to  be  a  strong anti-colonial  Government

although  it  says  that the present  phase  of  the

colonial  struggle  is  a flexible  one.  It  is  so

flexible  that the Minister for Finance  had  to  go

abegging to the British for financial assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition gives first consideration to

the  evidence  of the Prime Minister,  and  being  a

Prime  Minister, his evidence is therefore the  more

important  and should be accepted as the  truth  and

nothing  but  the  truth, the more so  because  that

evidence was given under oath.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Straits Times of the 31st of January

at  page 7, the Prime Minister was reported to  have

said he "had won the largest number of votes and the

largest majority in the 1955 election." I felt, Sir,

that  this claim could not be totally and materially

correct,  and  I  therefore looked up  the  records.

Figures disclosed, Sir, that the Prime Minister  did

not score the highest majority. The largest majority

was scored by the successful candidate for Havelock,

who is now the Member for Cairnhill-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Ah, what a memory! If you will allow me-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,. Sir, I started

life-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You like Mao Tse-tung too?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -serving the public since 1948.

But   in  1955  when  the  Rendel  Constitution  was

introduced. I did not have to go to the  P.A.P. for

support  to fight the election in Havelock. But  the

Prime  Minister had to call on me, the  then  Member

for  Keppel,  to  tell his constituents  in  Tanjong

Pagar, who had been constituents of the division  of

Keppel, to vote for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I have never asked for help.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You have never been found out

yet!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And I have been serving in this

Assembly  time and time again. I started  as  Member

for  Keppel,  then Member for Havelock, then  Member

for  Cairnhill, and I leave the next division to the

P.A.P.  Anywhere-any time. [Laughter] It  is  not  a

challenge, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is a joke!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Even Tanjong Pagar-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why not Hong Lim?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is all this relevant to the

motion? I cannot see how the remarks are relevant to

the motion. But may I again appeal to the Members of

the Government Front Bench to set an example and the

tone in this debate? Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I found it

necessary  to  be  a  bit irrelevant  in  answer  to

remarks made by the Front Benchers. Sir, I said  the

Prime  Minister did not score the highest  majority.

It  was  scored  by  somebody  else.  And  yet  that

statement  was  made  in the Commission  of  Inquiry

under  oath.  The P.A.P., Sir, in the words  of  the

Minister for Culture, "do not cheat the people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again in the Straits Times of the 31st of

January, on page 7, at the top of col. 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong then referred to a pamphlet which said:

"Vote  for P.A.P.'s Lee Kuan Yew, fearless  champion

of  the  people."  He  asked Mr  Lee  if  he  still

considered  himself  a champion  of  the  people  or

whether he was a fearless champion of the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that people like Lim Chin Siong, Goh Chew

Chua   and   Devan  Nair  never  called   themselves

"champions of the people.' Only Mr Lee did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee replied that those were the tricks of an election.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tricks of an election indeed! The electorate

of  Singapore no doubt will have taken note  of  the

words   uttered  by  the  Prime  Minister   in   the

Commission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



of  Inquiry given under oath. And yet the P.A.P., in

the words of the Minister for Culture, "do not cheat

the people".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again the Straits Times of 31st of January,

page 7, col. 2 this time:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong recalled that when Mr Lee alleged that

he  had a multiplicity of wives on December 12, 1960

he  gave  the impression that he had five,  20,  100

wives and then he reduced the number to two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee said he was not in court to make wild allegations but to produce the documents which would

prove all Mr Ong's falsehoods.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said he was not in Court to make wild allegations. In other words, the

allegation  of  a multiplicity of wives  is  a  wild

allegation  and therefore the Prime Minister  should

not have made that allegation in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was prepared to repeat it

outside.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A multiplicity of wives-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Is that not true?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -which, Sir,-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Is that not correct?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have asked the Member for

Cairnhill how all these remarks are really  relevant

to  the  motion.  It  seems to me  now  that  he  is

debating  the conduct of the Prime Minister.  If  he

wishes  to do so, of course, he must file a  motion.

He  must  give notice of a motion on the conduct  of

the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I did not use

the  words  "wild allegations" without  having  been

given those words myself. The Prime Minister said in

evidence  that  any allegation of a multiplicity  of

wives  which cannot be substantiated is therefore  a

wild  allegation. And that sort of allegation should

not  be made, particularly by the Prime Minister  in

this Assembly which is charged today to condemn  the

ex-Member  for Hong Lim, the ex-Mayor  of  the  City

Council,  the  ex-Minister for National Development,

and the ex-hero and comrade of the P.A.P. for making

wild allegations in this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again on page 5 of the same paper, the

Prime  Minister  is reported to have  said  on  this

question of allegations:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee said that one of the first things he had

learned  in  life was never to make  an  allegation

which  might later have to be substantiated because

this would only lead to trouble.'



<br><br>And  yet he made that allegation of multiplicity  of

wives in this Assembly. Perhaps, Sir, the allegation

was  made in the heat of the moment, or perhaps  the

Prime  Minister has still some more things to  learn

in life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have also some more

information.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is reported too again on

page   7,  column  2  of  this  paper - this  is  very

important:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong said that when he was Mr Lee's friend

everything was all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee interposed that Mr Ong had never been his friend but only his political colleague. As

such,  every  wrong that Mr Ong did  he  concealed

from  the  public  because he had  to  protect  the

unity and solidarity of the party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he knew Mr Ong was trying to make Mr P.

C. Marcus a scapegoat but "we protected you."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaring that "we never bite our own friends,"

Mr  Lee  said  it was only after  Mr  Ong  turned renegade that he decided to fight him.'



<br><br>Because Mr Ong was a colleague at that time,  every

wrong that he did, the Prime Minister concealed from

the public. The public will remember that during the

term  of  office  of  the  previous  Government,   a

Commission  of Inquiry was appointed to  investigate

into the wrongful acts of the then Mayor of the City

Council. The Prime Minister defended Mr Ong because

he  was then a colleague and covered up for him. The

then  Mayor was charged for doing grievous wrong  in

the  City Council. The Prime Minister said that  the

then  Mayor, then his colleague and the hero of  the

P.A.P.,  was  a  great man and had  done  many  good

things  in  the City Council. And now, Sir,  because

Mr  Ong turned renegade, the Prime Minister decided

to  fight  him and to expose him. It is now admitted

by the Prime Minister that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



then Mayor, now no longer his beloved colleague, had

done  grievous wrong in the City Council. This, Sir,

must  be  another election "trick" that won the  day

for  the  P.A.P. during the last general  elections.

Mr Ong at that time was acclaimed by the P.A.P. as

a  great  leader,  a great hero, and  that  under  a

P.A.P.  Government the people would have a wonderful

government  that  would look  after  the  poor.  And

because Mr Ong Eng Guan had been made use of  as  a

great hero during the general elections in 1959,  it

was  therefore justified for Mr Ong to claim in the

Commission that he was helping Mr Lee to become the

Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the previous Government appointed the

Commission of Inquiry which I referred to earlier in

my  speech, the Prime Minister accused the  previous

Government,  saying that this act  was  a  political

move  against the P.A.P., in view of the forthcoming

elections.  What  about  the present  Commission  of

Inquiry  into  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan?  Did  the  P.A.P.

Government not say and confirm it today that the

by-election would only be held after the Report of  the

Commission of Inquiry was debated in this  Assembly?

Sir, we do not hold the view - although it is held  by

many  people  and particularly by the electorate  of

Hong Lim - that this is a political move against  Mr

Ong Eng Guan. We do not hold this view, Sir, because

inasmuch as the P.A.P. Government want to claim that

the  Commission  of Inquiry appointed  by  them  has

nothing to do with attacking the political integrity

of  an  opponent who may appear on the scene in  the

Hong   Lim   by-election,  the  previous  Government

claimed the same thing - it was not a political  move

aimed  at  the  P.A.P.; it was just a Commission  of

Inquiry appointed to expose the wrongful acts of the

then  Mayor  of the City Council. What the  previous

Government  did was wrong, so said the  P.A.P.,  but

what  the P.A.P. Government do now, although it  may

be  the  same  as  what the previous Government  did

then,  is right because it is a good, clean,  honest

Government!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leads me to quote another instance of

this kind of double talk. In 1959 before the general

elections,  there  was a fire at  Tiong  Bahru.  The

previous  Government showed sympathy  for  the  fire

victims  and gave them temporary Trust accommodation

free of rent. But what did the P.A.P. say then? "The

Government is making political capital out of  these

fire   victims.   They   should   not   have   given

accommodation free of rent to the fire victims." Two

days  ago,  a  fire took place at  Upper  Chin  Chew

Street.  And what is the P.A.P. Government going  to

do?  They  are going to give accommodation  free  of

rent  to  the  fire victims too. What  the  previous

Government did was wrong, so said the P.A.P., but what

the P.A.P. Government do now, although it may be the

same  as  what the previous Government did then,  is

correct and grand because the P.A.P. Government is a

good, honest, clean Government!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this paper of 31st January seems to disclose

a  lot of facts. This is important too because it is

levelled at me. The last two lines in column  7  and

the first two lines in column 8 of page 5 read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee then said Mr Ong had a chat with Tun Lim

Yew  Hock, who alerted him and then Mr Ong did  not

turn up.'



<br><br>Sir, this is an untruth although it has been said by

the  Prime Minister under oath. I did not alert  Mr

Ong  Eng Guan. Why should I? On that particular day,

I  was looking forward to seeing the Government take

an   unfair   advantage,  with  their   overwhelming

majority,  over their ex-beloved hero and colleague,

the  Member for Hong Lim at that time, by tabling  a

surprise  motion the terms of which have  caused  so

much  talk in Singapore and elsewhere. What happened

was this, Sir, and this is the truth and nothing but

the  truth. On that particular day, my colleague the

Member  for Farrer Park and I saw the Prime Minister

in  the  Library  at  his request.  He  told  us  in

confidence - and I would not have mentioned it here if

my name had not been brought up in the Commission of

Inquiry - that the Government proposed to introduce  a

surprise motion against Mr Ong Eng Guan. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



were  still with him when the State Advocate-General

came  in  with a draft and we had a look at  it.  We

were asked by the Prime Minister about our stand and

were  told that he had to get a clearance  from  you

for  dispensing of notice. I consulted my colleagues

and  I  then conveyed our answer to the Deputy Prime

Minister  in  the  C.P.A.  Room  because  the  Prime

Minister then was busy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan witnessed considerable activity on the part of P.A.P. Assemblymen. He saw them going

into  the  Committee  room,  closeted,  talking  and

whispering, and you yourself were seen to leave your

Chair to go to your room obviously for consultation.

Mr  Ong was in the Opposition Room. He sent a  chit

to  me  while I was sitting here, saying, "Tun  Lim,

would  you please come out and see me?" I  went  and

saw him in the Opposition Room. He told me, first of

all,  that he sensed that something was in  the  air

because  of  what  he had seen  and  what  had  been

reported  to  him, and he asked me  whether  I  knew

anything.   As   I   received  the  information   in

confidence, I therefore could not say yes.  I  said,

no,  I  had no knowledge. The Minister for Education

felt that I should not have kept that confidence.  I

said, no, I had no knowledge. "Yes, but you know Mr

Speaker  went twice into his room." I said, "If  you

are  so  concerned, go and see the Speaker."  So  he

went to see you, Mr Speaker, and I do not know what

took place, but he came out and later on he told me,

"I say, this P.A.P. terrible, man. They want to move

a  surprise  motion  against me.  But  Mr  Speaker,

anyway,  gentleman; he won't allow  it."  But,  Sir,

when  Mr Ong Eng Guan had that talk with me, I  was

really  embarrassed and then I had to go running  to

the  Deputy Prime Minister and say, "I say, Dr Toh,

this surprise motion of yours may be no surprise.  I

have  been  grilled by Mr Ong Eng Guan. Although  I

have  told  him  nothing, he is  going  to  see  Mr

Speaker."  So if there was anybody who was  alerted,

may  I  suggest  that it was the  P.A.P. which  was

alerted by me to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



the  fact  that the surprise motion was no longer  a

surprise  motion, because Mr Ong Eng  Guan  already

knew that something was coming up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition holds no brief for Mr Ong Eng

Guan - and I repeat it here - we hold no brief  for  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan. In fact, we consider he has  done  a

great  disservice to the country by discharging  his

duties as Mayor in the City Council in such a manner

as  to  make the people feel that the P.A.P. was  a

very   good  Party - which  it  is  not  - and  thereby

piloting  the P.A.P. into power in the 1959  general

elections.  How can we have sympathy or love  for  a

man  who  we  feel  has  done a  disservice  to  the

country?  He  happened  to  be  a  Member   of   the

Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You want him to fight the battle for

the Opposition!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore, Sir,-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> But you say-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please continue, Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Sir. So I did not

alert  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, and I hope that statements

said here in all sincerity and in all truth would be

accepted.  I would not want to alert him even  if  I

were asked to alert him, or even if I were asked  by

the  Prime Minister to convey it to him. I would not

have  done  it. We were going to enjoy the spectacle

of  the P.A.P. Government doing something that could

be   described  later  on - outside  and  inside  this

Assembly - as a most undemocratic act. We did not have

to alert Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this motion we are asked to take note of

the Report of the Inquiry Commission. The Opposition

takes note that the Inquiry Commission has been  the

forum where character assassination was the order of

the  day.  The  Opposition further takes  note  that

because   of   this  character  assassination   (the

dramatis  personae being the Prime  Minister  versus

the ex-Mayor of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



City   council,   the   ex-Minister   for   National

Development,  the  ex-hero and ex-colleague  of  the

P.A.P.,  the ex-Member for Hong Lim) it has done  no

good  to  anybody, not even to the  country.  May  I

suggest  to the P.A.P. that the sooner all  this  is

pushed  aside, the better it will be for  Singapore,

and the more time and energy Government will have to

discharge  their primary duty of looking  after  the

welfare of the people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the second part of the motion.

We  are  asked to condemn Mr Ong Eng Guan "for  his

dishonourable  conduct  unbecoming  of  an   elected

representative of the people". But where is Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan for us to condemn? He is not here. He  has

resigned. And because he has resigned, we feel  that

he has paid sufficient atonement for whatever wrongs

he  might  have done to the dignity of  this  House.

Sir,   we  do  not  countenance  such  dishonourable

conduct  and,  if I remember rightly,  we  have  had

occasion  to  hear speeches made in  this  House  by

certain Members on the Government side bordering  on

such conduct. I know now we all do not want any more

of  it,  and we are glad. As stated by you, Sir,  in

your  speech from the Chair at the last sitting,  we

feel that a Sessional Committee of Privileges should

be  appointed immediately, a Committee which can  be

entrusted  with the duty of maintaining the  dignity

of  this  House  and disciplining  any  Member  from

either  side  of  the  House for  any  dishonourable

conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Minister for Culture has found it

necessary to make a pre-election speech, this motion

has  therefore  taken  on a political  significance,

particularly  as the by-election in  Hong  Lim  will

take  place soon. We are not interested in this

by-election. We know, and the public know, that  it  is

going to be a grudge fight between two groups in the

P.A.P. And because it is a grudge fight, and because

we  have no sympathy for the contending parties,  we

say, "May the less - worse man win".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of what I have spoken and in

answer  to  the  query raised by  the  Minister  for

Culture, the Opposition will abstain on this motion.

The  Opposition and the public take  note  that  the

Minister  for  Culture has said  on  behalf  of  the

P.A.P. Government that they could not care less  how

we vote.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the subject for discussion

by  us  today, I am surprised that even  before  all

Members  of the Opposition have risen to speak,  the

Minister  for Culture has charged that he  does  not

care  less which way we vote. I would like to stress

that I do not care a damn what happens to the P.A.P.

If  the P.A.P. is not interested in our stand, there

will  come a time when the P.A.P. will take heed  of

U.M.N.O.'s vote, particularly the Singapore U.M.N.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, really I do not wish to speak or participate in this debate. It is not because of the

fasting  month or because I am weak. It was  not  my

intention  to speak originally because I  know  that

this  is  a  fight  between two factions,  each  one

wanting  more power, with the result that  one  side

will  become a victim. So whichever side  becomes  a

victim, we are not interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to emphasise once again, and especially to the Minister for Culture, that

they  cannot  attempt to threaten  us,  particularly

U.M.N.O. as  the Opposition. If we are intimidated,

there  will  come a time when our services  will  be

required.  For  instance, what had the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for National  Development

done at the time when there was tension which nearly

precipitated  a  clash between the Chinese  and  the

Malays?  He  invited U.M.N.O. to hold a  meeting.  A

meeting was held and it finally resolved to  put  an

end to the tension. We did not like to take part  in

that  matter, but bearing in mind that we wished  to

co-operate with the Government, we decided  to  make

an appeal through the radio. And on this matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



before  us  today, even before we have declared  our

stand,   we  have  already  been  accused   by   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to comment on Mr Ong Eng Guan. But I would like to say that Mr Ong Eng

Guan  is  an  ex-member of the P.A.P. who  had  been

instrumental  in  creating  disunity  in   Singapore

U.M.N.O. The reason why I say this is that  when  he

was  the Mayor there were many U.M.N.O. members  who

owed  a  debt  of gratitude to Mr Ong Eng  Guan  by

becoming teachers in the Malay classes conducted  in

the  City  Council.  By this  act  of  Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan - helping  U.M.N.O. members - he  directly  became

responsible for the break-up of U.M.N.O. members.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. Mr Speaker, because I am an ex-member of U.M.N.O., I should like to remind the Member that I resigned from U.M.N.O. not because I owed any debt to-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is not a point of

order. Inche Mohd. Ali.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, that was

the  state of affairs existing when Mr Ong Eng Guan

was Mayor of the City Council. Mr Speaker, this  is

still fresh in my memory - I was not a Member of  this

Assembly in the past Government - when we demanded the

Government to release the Nadra detainees,  we  were

intimidated, not me but the Member for-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member has been

irrelevant,  but  I have allowed  him  to  carry  on

because of the allegations made by the Minister  for

Culture. But I think I must now pull him back to the

motion. The motion is merely a motion to condemn Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan in the light of the findings  of  the

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on the

whole,  although I consider Mr Ong Eng Guan  did  a

lot of good things in the City Council, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



my view now that he has clearly demonstrated that he

could fight and join the ranks of the Opposition and

expose  to  the  people of Singapore the  goings-on,

whether  in  the Party or in the government  of  the

day.  Therefore,  Mr Speaker, U.M.N.O.  Members  in

this Assembly hold the same view as expressed by the

Member for Cairnhill, that is, we will not make

pre-election speeches as have been made in this Assembly

just now, and we will not participate nor join hands

with  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan when he contests  the

by-election in Hong Lim. However, we would like to  see

Mr Ong Eng Guan returned as an Opposition Member.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam (Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Ong Chang Sam)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Opposition have expressed  their

views. It is very clear that at today's sitting,  we

can  see that they have united together as one  team

today.  Before the tabling of this Report  the  hon.

Member  for  Cairnhill fully supported Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan.  But after the Report has been tabled, he  has

found that all the facts contained in the Report are

true,  and what the former Member for Hong  Lim  had

said was all false. That is why in his speech he has

expressed the view that he will abstain from  voting

on   our  motion.  This  clearly  shows  that   when

confronted  with a fight, the Opposition still  want

to  support the former Member for Hong Lim.  In  his

speech the Member for Cairnhill did not mention  the

facts contained in the Report. He dared not deny the

facts in the Report. He cannot say that the findings

of  the  Report  were not true.  Therefore,  we  can

clearly  point out that the tabling of  this  Report

will  be  a  very  good  thing  for  the  people  of

Singapore  and  for  all the people  concerned.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are fortunate that in this Assembly

today,  we  can discuss the Report of the Commission

of  Inquiry into the allegations made by Mr Ong Eng

Guan  in  the Legislative Assembly on the  10th  and

12th December, 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this House must express its thanks to Mr

Justice  Chua for his work, because he has fulfilled

his  task  in  a very short time. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

this  is  the  first  time in  the  history  of  the

parliamentary  system that we have  taken  steps  to

deal  with  a  Member of this Assembly for  uttering

certain  unfounded allegations. I hope this will  be

the  last time that this sort of thing will  happen.

Although  we  do  not have a very  long  history  in

parliamentary  democracy,  the  facts  have  clearly

shown  to us that we can fully utilise the  one  man

one  vote  system. There will be no danger  in  this

system,  and we can fully utilise it to develop  the

spirit of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few months, this

House  has become a dirty pool, because the speeches

of the ex-Member for Hong Lim had blinded the people

of  Singapore, so that they have expressed doubts on

the sincerity of the Government. In an editorial  in

the  Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh  of  27th  February,  1961,

regarding the political lesson of the Ong  Eng  Guan

incident,  in the last part of paragraph  4,  it  is

stated thus:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Frankly speaking, these political storms' have

shaken  the faith of the people of Singapore in  the

parliamentary  system and the future  of  democratic

self-government. If this House does  not  resort  to

effective measures, then our democratic system  will

become a laughing stock.'



<br><br>The editorial continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Justice Chua has been appointed as

Commissioner  of  the Inquiry. The  purpose  of  his

appointment  is  to clarify the confused  situation.

His report which has been tabled can be said to have

fulfilled this task.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the suction pump and filter have

now  cleansed the whole pool of dirty water, so that

the  stones and gravel at the bottom have  come  out

clearly, and the people of Hong Lim now clearly  see

the  character  of the ex-Member for  Hong  Lim.  If

necessary we will disclose more facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Opposition Members have

been shouting about freedom of speech and freedom of

the  Press. They have made speeches to that  effect.

They  think  that the censuring of  the  Member  for

using  the privilege of the Assembly as a cloak  for

spreading  false rumours is undemocratic.  And  they

are against this. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



of  the House, when moving his motion, clearly  said

that  this  motion  was  not  directed  specifically

against  an  individual, but it was related  to  the

whole Assembly. But you, Mr Speaker, at the sitting

on the 19th of December, 1960, before the motion was

proposed  by  the  Deputy Prime  Minister,  you  had

stressed that the motion was not directed against an

individual,  but  it concerned  the  Assembly  as  a

whole,  because the protection of freedom of  speech

of  Assemblymen does not mean that the Assembly will

allow  them  to abuse this privilege with  impunity.

The  President of Indonesia, Dr Soekarno, has  said

that  freedom of speech and legal sanction  are  not

separable.  They are complementary  to  each  other,

like body and soul. Like all other kinds of freedom,

freedom  of  speech  is not absolute.  There  is  no

freedom   of  unprincipled  speech.  This  kind   of

unprincipled   speech  will   interfere   with   the

harmonious development of freedom in other respects.

It will tend to hamper the harmonious development of

freedom,  and  this will sow the seed of  discontent

and  the  seed of destruction for freedom.  I  think

hon.  Members here will all agree to this saying  of

President Soekarno.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ex-Member for Hong Lim, Mr

Ong  Eng Guan, utilised the privilege of this  House

as  a cloak to cover up his falsehoods. He cunningly

utilised  all kinds of falsehoods, shouting exciting

slogans and making unreasonable allegations for  his

own  purposes. In his dying struggle he would  catch

at  any straw. But paper tigers and brass rings will

not  endure  the  true test. In the  end,  the  true

nature  of  such people will be disclosed  and  they

will be despised by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Ong Eng Guan put up a

Left-wing  flag,  showing that he was  on  the  Left.  He

walked  up and down the street selling his political

ballyhoo, shouting all day long-shouting slogans  to

the  effect that he was for the benefit of the  poor

people  and down with the yellow culture  and

anti-colonialism. He was crying as though heaven and  the

sky  would fall down. And he tried to show  that  he

alone was the only person who was capable of leading

the people to see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



the  sun  and  sky again. But he has forgotten  that

time  is  the best test, the best witness.  A  paper

tiger, after the rain and the wind, after the  trial

of  temperature, will in the end disclose  its  true

nature and true appearance, and it will show that it

is  only  a  shattered framework, and nothing  else.

Brass  rings cannot endure the heat of the  furnace.

They will melt. Mr Ong's anti-yellow culture became

his  stumbling-block. He claimed himself  to  be  an

anti-colonialist. But this has in the end turned out

to  show  that he is a reactionary and a  Right-wing

adventurer. Now he knows full well that the workers,

hawkers  and farmers have all come to know  that  he

has  been  lying in the past. These  people  do  not

support  him. He knows this fact clearly. Therefore,

his only lifebuoy is the ex-Chief Minister, the hon.

Member  for Cairnhill, and the hon. Member  for  Joo

Chiat, Mr David Marshall, and Mrs Leon-Soh and  so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this type of internal contradiction of Mr Ong

Eng  Guan  is  not  like what Mr Mao  Tse-tung  has

written   in   his  book  regarding   the   internal

contradiction of the people. On the  one  hand,  he

taps  on  the  shoulders  of  the  hawkers  and  the

workers, but on the other hand, he shakes hands with

the  Right-wing  group - coming to terms  with  them.

This  action  will be disclosed by  the  passage  of

time.    Mr    Speaker,   Sir,   those   Right-wing

reactionaries have all spoken in support of Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan.  They have protested strongly. They  have

thought  that with this they can unite  together  to

beat  the  P.A.P. so that they can have a  political

come-back. Mr Ong Eng Guan has also given his  full

support and co-operation to this group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been silent on their speeches and

statements. He thinks that the unity and strength of

the  Right-wing group can beat the Left-wing  P.A.P.

But  unfortunately, Mr Ong Eng Guan  has  forgotten

the  fact that the eyes of the people are bright and

discerning. His coming to terms with the  Right-wing

group  cannot avoid the future events that are going

to happen to him. It is just like paper which cannot

wrap up fire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Mr Justice Chua's Report has been tabled

in  this House, the facts are put clearly before the

people.  Mr Speaker, Sir, let me read out paragraph

43 of this Report. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I find that there is no truth at all in any of

the  three  allegations made by Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan.

These allegations are groundless and recklessly made

and  there  is  no justification for making  any  of

them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is black has now been clearly shown.



<br><br>5.03 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the hon. Member for Cairnhill still speak for

Mr Ong Eng Guan? Will the hon. Member for Joo Chiat

still act as an adviser to Mr Ong Eng Guan? We will

ask them this. Does Mr David Marshall still want to

become  a  supporter of Mr Ong Eng Guan? Does  Mrs

Leon-Soh still want to protest for Mr Ong Eng Guan?

We will be glad if they can come forward and have  a

debate  with us at Mr Ong Eng Guan's mass  meeting;

or  do  they want to meet us in Hong Lim? We welcome

and will gladly accept that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wind up my speech, let me quote paragraph 15 of

this Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, in the course of giving his

evidence,  made statements which were  either

half-truths  or  vague allegations with the intention  of

misleading the Commission. I find that he would tell

an  untruth  when  it  suited  him.  All  the  three

allegations  made  by  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  in   the

Legislative Assembly against the Prime Minister  and

the   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  and  all  the

allegations which he made against the Prime Minister

in  the  course  of  giving  his  evidence  in  this

Commission are untrue, groundless and reckless.  Mr

Ong Eng Guan is a person not to be believed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us put this passage clearly

over to the people of Hong Lim and let them know who

will  be one of the contestants in the Hong Lim

by-election; what kind of a man he is. Let us all  hope

that  this  kind  of thing will not happen  in  this

House in future.



<br><br>5.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, the Government side  has  described

Mr Ong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



Eng Guan as a person who is on terms with the

Right-wing  party, but they have forgotten that last  year

when  we  were debating the speech of the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara,  that Member was  described  as  an

"extreme opportunist". The purpose is to confuse the

Hong Lim electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, just now when our Deputy Prime Minister moved the motion to censure the ex-Member

for  Hong Lim, he acquired the support of the Member

for Cairnhill. Thus, we can see very clearly who  is

on terms with the Right-wing party. It is clear that

the  Government Party is doing this in order to have

harmonious  action against a Member elected  by  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in my view, the electorate of Hong Lim should not be censured. On the 10th and

12th  of  December last year, concerning the  M.  R.

Marcus and Kwa Soon Chuan affairs, the ex-Member for

Hong Lim used his privilege as a Member for Hong Lim

and  as  a  Member  of the Opposition  to  give  his

suggestions,  and the Government had  the  right  to

analyse the facts clearly. The Government should not

consider his words as allegations so as to  use  the

whole Assembly to condemn him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry, because of the ex-Member for

Hong Lim, is just wasting time and public money.  He

repeatedly  said that he had not attempted  to  make

allegations.  Therefore, is there any  need  for  an

investigation?   The   Government   is   using   the

Commission  of  Inquiry to delay the by-election  in

Hong Lim, so as to express their own points of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to paragraph 17 of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry. The

ex-Administrator of the City Council, P. C.  Lim,  gave

evidence  at the Inquiry. Mr Lim, appearing  before

the  Commissioner, pointed out that J. L. Byrne said

the following, that he was under instructions to see

Marcus. This witness was an independent witness.  He

is  now in the Water Department. Unfortunately,  his

points of view were not accepted by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



Commission. In my view, it was impossible for J.  L.

Byrne  to have used those words. Mr Deputy Speaker,

I  do not know whether J. L. Byrne's speech was soft

or  not.  It  was not clear. Or was there  something

wrong?   From  this  we  can  see  that  an  Inquiry

Commission,  in fact, will not come to  any  finding

which  will  be  detrimental to  the  Government  in

respect of the coming Hong Lim by-election.



<br><br>5.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Deputy Speaker, the S.P.A. has not hesitated  to

exploit  the  Ong  Eng Guan issue.  They  have  paid

tribute  to  Mr Ong Eng Guan by even imitating  his

method  of  big smears, innuendoes and  half-truths.

For  example,  in a Press statement  issued  by  the

Secretary-General of the S.P.A., Mr Lim Choon Mong,

on  7th February, he said that "even the absence  of

the  Party's organising secretary from Singapore  at

this crucial moment is significant."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is significant? Is it suggested by Mr Lim

Choon Mong that I was away from Singapore because of

some  disagreement over the motion on  Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan?  Obviously, the statement by  the  S.P.A. was

intended  to imply some disagreement. Let me  assure

the  House  that I am completely with the Government

on  this motion condemning Mr Ong Eng Guan for  his

dishonourable  conduct. Mr Lim is obviously  trying

to propagate the false rumours spread by Mr Ong Eng

Guan  that there are two factions in the Party  - one

pro-Ong  Eng Guan and the other anti-Ong  Eng  Guan.

Let  me  say that there are no two such factions  in

the  Party. There is only one faction - the pro-P.A.P.

faction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the essence of democracy is rule by consent through the Legislative Assembly

elected  by the people. The Assembly is the  highest

legislative  body  of the State  where  the  elected

representatives of the people sit and deliberate  on

issues  vital to the people's interest. It  follows,

therefore,  that the Assembly should  be  given  the

highest respect if it is to be entrusted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



with the fate of the 1� million population. How  can

the  people  have  confidence in  democracy  if  the

Legislative  Assembly is reduced to a status  where,

instead  of debating issues of State, malicious  and

unfounded falsehoods are uttered to injure  unjustly

innocent   persons  both  within  and  without   the

Assembly? If these flagrant abuses of privileges are

not  checked  and freedom to spread lies  prevented,

then  the  elected Assembly would  be  brought  into

contempt and ridicule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, no one who has an interest to see that the democratic system of government should

work smoothly and effectively can oppose the motion.

As  other Members have put it, the issue before  the

House  is  whether the privileges  of  the  Assembly

should  be  abused in spreading unfounded falsehoods

and  whether  the freedom of speech in the  Assembly

includes the freedom to tell lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have no hesitation in giving my unqualified support to the Deputy Prime

Minister's motion in condemning Mr Ong Eng Guan for

his  dishonourable conduct unbecoming of an  elected

representative of the people in that  he  repeatedly

used  his privilege in this Assembly as a cloak  for

spreading  malicious falsehoods to  unjustly  injure

innocent  persons  both  inside  and  outside   this

Assembly.



<br><br>5.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, I also rise to support the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the ground has already been covered by

speeches  so  far,  but this is  such  an  important

matter  that  it  bears  repetition.  Now  that  the

Inquiry  Commission's Report on the  allegations  of

Mr  Ong  Eng Guan has been published, it is crystal

clear  that  Mr  Ong Eng Guan, whilst  he  was  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim,  had  repeatedly  used   his

privilege  in this Assembly as a cloak for spreading

malicious  falsehoods  to unjustly  injure  innocent

people.  At this point, Sir, may I answer, first  of

all,  the Member for Punggol who happens to be  out?

He  said  that the Inquiry was a waste of  time  and

public money. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



think  all of us agree on that. To a certain extent,

it  is  true, but let us also ask, who was the  real

cause  for  all this? No other person than  Ong  Eng

Guan himself. And then the hon. Member also remarked

that  Ong  Eng Guan was accused of being a Left-wing

adventurer  and  now  a Right-winger.  I  think  the

position  has not been made very clear to  him.  The

real  thing is that Ong Eng Guan merely posed  as  a

Left-winger but, at the present moment, he is  being

made  use  of  by  the Right-wing. If  you  want  to

classify  Ong  Eng Guan, then he is  nowhere - neither

here  nor  there.  He is only an opportunist - nothing

more  than that. The Report anyway has categorically

and  conclusively stated that there is no  substance

in the allegations of Mr Ong Eng Guan. Further, the

Report  states that all the allegations made against

the  Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour  and

Law are untrue, groundless and reckless. Mr Ong Eng

Guan  is  a person not to be believed. Even  in  the

course of giving his evidence, Mr Ong Eng Guan made

statements  which were either half-truths  or  vague

allegations  with  the intention of  misleading  the

Commission.  The Commission found that Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan would tell an untruth when it suited him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are facts which have been known to us

for a long, long time and now they are borne out  by

the Report which bears the stamp of authority of  an

independent  High Court Judge. It only  remains  for

us,  who  are Members of this House, to protect  and

uphold the dignity and prestige of the Assembly.  It

is  up  to  us,  who  are  Members  of  this  august

Assembly,  to  see  to it that  no  one  abuses  the

privilege of the House as a cloak to injure unjustly

innocent  people. The allegations of  Ong  Eng  Guan

were  especially  sinister in  that  he  made  those

allegations in the form of half-truths. He gave  the

impression  that  he  had the inside  dope  but  was

prevented  from  spilling the beans because  of  the

Official  Secrets Ordinance. However, an undertaking

in the widest terms possible was given by Government

that  no  action whatsoever would be  taken  against

anyone who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



had  revealed  information before  or  would  reveal

information during the Inquiry. Mr Ong Eng Guan had

been  given  all  facilities to bring  out  all  the

secrets most damaging to the Government, but he only

showed  that he could tell lies even in the  witness

box.  He showed his trump card. All he could say  in

defence  was that he did not understand the  meaning

of  the  word "allegation". Truly, Sir, and I  quote

page 6, paragraph i5, from line 3 of the Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I find that he [that is, Ong Eng Guan] would tell

an untruth when it suited him.'



<br><br>Sir,  all  this merely reveals to what opportunistic

lengths  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan would  go  in  order  to

satisfy  his own selfish ends. He was expelled  from

the P.A.P., and in vengeance he set about to destroy

the Party by means of a systematic campaign of smear

and vilification of the leaders of the Party and the

Government. He had hoped to tarnish the good name of

these  leaders. Of course, this would mean the  loss

of  the trust and confidence the people have in  the

Party   and   the  Government.  If  the   diabolical

machinations had succeeded, it would ultimately have

meant  the fall of the P.A.P. Government,  in  which

case,  as I have mentioned before in this House,  it

would  have  meant not just one by-election  in  one

constituency   but   a  general   election   in   51

constituencies.  Probably that is one  of  the  main

reasons  why the Opposition are secretly  supporting

Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan. It may sound  trite,  Sir,  but

parliamentary democracy is on trial in all the newly

independent and semi-independent countries  in  this

part of the world. Where parliamentary democracy has

failed,   it  has  almost  been  entirely   due   to

inefficiency, nepotism and corruption. Examples  are

not far to seek.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the P.A.P. have pledged ourselves to

democratic  socialism. To make democratic  socialism

work,  we  need  above  all  a  clean,  honest   and

efficient  government. Whatever the  faults  of  the

P.A.P., we are all proud that we on this side of the

House  are clean and honest. Comparisons are  odious

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



you  will  recall, Sir, that we had a  Minister  for

Education  in  the past Lim Yew Hock Government  who

turned  a  miner  after he fled the country  with  a

substantial loot. Which brings my attention  to  the

intriguing way the Opposition has reacted all  along

to  Mr Ong Eng Guan's allegations in this Assembly.

You  will  recall  also, Sir, that  the  Member  for

Aljunied  had  called for an early by-election.  The

Opposition  not only supported the early by-election

before the truth of the allegations was established,

but went a step further and made statements that Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan  was  fighting  the  battle  for  the

Opposition. We all know why the S.P.A. will  not  be

contesting the forthcoming by-election. It has  been

abundantly  clear that Mr Ong Eng Guan is  fighting

the  battle  of  the S.P.A. and all  the  Right-wing

forces  of  the  Opposition in  spite  of  repeated

denials. The Opposition has not dared to come out in

the  open, but unfortunately the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan has rather indiscreetly let the cat out of

the bag by singing his praises of Ong Eng Guan. Does

the Opposition think that the secret help to Ong Eng

Guan will enable the Right-wing forces to rise again

from  the  ashes? At this point, may  I  answer  the

Member  for Cairnhill? Unfortunately he is not  here

now. He asked a very simple question. He asked: What

is  the  Right-wing? Well, let me tell  him,  though

everybody  knows  he  is no political  chicken.  The

difference was very patent in the mass rally held at

the  Happy World Stadium last Sunday. He did mention

that.  While 15,000 Left-wingers attended  the  mass

rally  to show their disgust and abhorrence  at  the

murder  of  Patrice  Lumumba, all the  Right-wingers

stayed   away.  Did  we  see  the  moral  rearmament

supporters  or  the  Lim Yew  Hocks?  When  all  the

Singapore Left-wingers showed their determination-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I do not see any

relevance  to  this  debate before  us.  Unless  the

Member  for  Queenstown can explain or connect  his

explanation  to this debate, I do not  think  I  can

permit him to continue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, probably

you  were  absent when the Member for Cairnhill  was

speaking about the mass rally and Lumumba.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is

relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I wonder if Mr Deputy Speaker

will  allow  me to answer certain points  which  the

Member for Cairnhill has raised.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, that all the

Left-wingers showed determination in their  struggle

against colonialism and imperialism. But where  were

the  Opposition?  Did  they  show  they  were

anti-colonialists and anti-imperialistic? Did  they  show

they  were ready to fight on a united front for  the

freedom of Singapore? That, Sir, is my answer to the

difference between the Right-wingers and  the

Left-wingers.   It   is  the  difference   between

pro-colonialists  and  anti-colonialists.  It   is   the

difference  between the opportunists  and  political

adventurers and genuine patriots who truly work  for

the  advancement and welfare of the people.  I  also

remember,  Sir,  that  in  one  of  the  mass  rally

speeches  made  in  the  Happy  World  Stadium  last

Sunday,  the names of Mobutu, Kasavubu, Tshombe  and

Lim  Yew Hock were all linked together. I cannot see

what  sort  of  blood relationship  they  have.  But

whatever  it  is, we certainly do not want  Tshombes

and  such persons in our Malaya. I would not  go  so

far  as to say that Ong Eng Guan is also linked with

Tshombe.  But from the performance of the Opposition

today,  who is to know what part the Lim  Yew  Hocks

play in this linkage of adventurism, opportunism and

reaction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, although this may appear to be a slight digression, it has all been mentioned in

answer  to  what  Members  of  the  Opposition  have

raised.  The  whole world knows how opportunism  and

reaction   are  very  intimately  linked   up   with

machinations    and   out-pourings   of    malicious

falsehoods to injure people. The Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



for  Aljunied  has intimated that Mr Ong  Eng  Guan

will  stand  as  a  candidate in the  Hong  Lim

by-election.  Really,  Sir, we can  say  now  that  the

people  of  Hong Lim and all the people of Singapore

will know that an opportunist and a proven liar will

make yet another attempt to deceive the people.



<br><br>5.33 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, today in this Assembly we have spent a

lot of time debating the Report of the Commission of

Inquiry into the allegations made by Ong Eng Guan. I

want   to   make  two  points  here.  Firstly,   the

maintenance  of  justice and  the  dignity  of  this

Assembly. Secondly, I want to stress that the

Right-wing group has allied itself with Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the first point. In

South-east   Asia  today  many  countries  are  practising

parliamentary democracy. Our State is one  of  them.

Whether  this system can succeed or not  depends  on

how  responsible  people  practise  this  democratic

system.  What I want to stress is that  we  want  to

maintain  this system. And the main purpose  of  the

Inquiry Commission is to disclose the facts  to  the

people  to  enable  them to understand  clearly  our

attitude,  our  speeches and  our  actions  in  this

Assembly. Unfortunately, many Opposition Members are

afraid  of  this  Inquiry  Commission.  Why?  It  is

because  they  are  afraid that the  facts  will  be

disclosed  so that the people will know  the  truth.

And  they  are  also  afraid and worried  about  the

appointment of this Inquiry Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my colleagues just now have clearly made

many  points  relating  to the  privileges  of  this

Assembly.  Let  us  all  hope that  the  Legislative

Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance  will  be

used  for  the  last time, and that in future  there

will  be  no  such incident. Let us  all  hope  that

everybody here will maintain the decorum and dignity

of this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come back to those two persons who have

left  our  Party and are now sitting on the opposite

benches. They had in the past shouted very clean and

healthy  slogans and expressed their views  to  good

effect. Let me remind them that they must not forget

what  they had professed in the past. They must  now

renew their stand. During the course of the speeches

of the Opposition Members, though they have declared

that they have no link with Mr Ong Eng Guan, yet it

cannot be denied that they have "sub-links" with Mr

Ong  Eng Guan. Since the Ong Eng Guan incident, they

have  been supporting him. Now is a good chance  for

them  to  make a political fortune. Ong  Eng  Guan's

incident is something like a life-boat for  them  to

sail  in,  so that they can prolong their  political

life.  But they will find later that this life-boat,

when  caught in a great storm, will not  bring  them

back  to their political dreamland, but will capsize

in the storm and bring them destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the hon. Member for Cairnhill has made

many allegations. He had quoted at length in support

of Mr Ong Eng Guan. If he is not connected with Ong

Eng  Guan, why should he make such lengthy  speeches

in  support  of him? This attitude of  his  and  his

speech  clearly show that he has been  contradicting

himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me mention this fact. Not long ago in

this  Assembly,  our Leader of  the  House  moved  a

motion  relating to the dignity and decorum of  this

Assembly.  At that time, the Opposition Member,  Mr

Ong  Eng Guan, also supported this motion. But then,

when  Mr  Ong Eng Guan had made certain allegations

to  the  detriment  of the people  both  inside  and

outside  this Assembly, the other Opposition Members

did not come forward to support the motion. They now

only  want to renew their old dream. All this  shows

that Mr Ong Eng Guan and those Right-wing political

elements  are  united. They are connected  and  they

form a united front. It seems that they still have a

chance  to  renew their old daydream. But after  the

election,  they  will  have a very  good  chance  to

reply. Of course, this reply will depend on the wise

judgment of the people in Hong Lim, so that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



will   lead   them  to  see  the  present  political

situation  in Singapore. This result will also  show

the political standard of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>5.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

I  wholeheartedly support the motion  moved  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister. From the basis of the Inquiry

Report, which has been tabled in the Assembly today,

it  is  clear  that Mr Ong Eng Guan  had  used  the

privilege  of  this  Assembly  to  spread  malicious

falsehoods  and to injure persons both  outside  and

inside  this  Assembly who have  no  opportunity  to

defend themselves. What a shame it is for a man  who

claims  to represent the people, but who, in  actual

fact,  in  using  the  freedom  of  speech  in  this

Assembly, has made false allegations instead. It  is

the  principle of any government which  believes  in

parliamentary  democracy that there is  no  absolute

freedom  of speech. But freedom of speech is freedom

of speech to tell the truth. He must not just say it

in   the  Assembly,  but  he  must  be  prepared  to

substantiate it outside the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on this issue, many speakers from the Opposition have indirectly opposed the motion moved

by  the Deputy Prime Minister. They say that whether

Mr  Ong Eng Guan has told a lie or otherwise,  this

motion  is to expedite the by-election at Hong  Lim.

But  they have forgotten that the coming by-election

at  Hong  Lim is the result of a vacancy created  by

Ong Eng Guan himself. In fact, the vacancy is

inter-related with the allegations of nepotism made by Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan against Ministers. Mr Speaker,  with

the  Report before us, those Opposition Members have

started to fraternise with Mr Ong Eng Guan whom  we

know  today  as a political adventurer, and  who  is

prepared to do anything to achieve his own political

ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel strange towards the two Members, the Member for Aljunied and his colleague,

the  Member for Punggol, who have vehemently opposed

the Report of the Commission of Inquiry. However,  I

am of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



opinion  that  when the Commission was  sitting  and

calling   for   witnesses   to   substantiate    the

allegations  made by their colleague, none  of  them

had  the  guts to come forward to give  evidence  in

defence of their colleague in the Commission. If  it

were  me,  Mr  Speaker, in the name of  the  Party,

subsequently I would resign my seat in the  Assembly

to which I was elected under that Party ticket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I was very much impressed by the speech made by the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan.  His speech  was  fiery  perhaps

because of the fasting month. But what tickles me is

this, when I remember the incident of children  when

they  argue among themselves. They spit or  mock  at

one   another  and  they  will  flee,  leaving   the

arguments  alone, not wishing to have  a  sight  any

more of their enemies. I feel, Mr Speaker, what has

been brought home by the Minister for Culture on the

Government's attitude of not caring as to which side

the  Opposition is going to vote is clear  to  those

who  are  following  the political  developments  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the vacancy created by the

resignation of Mr Ong Eng Guan, there are political

parties,  in this Assembly and outside the Assembly,

which have fraternised and have flirted with Mr Ong

Eng  Guan.  Those political parties are hoping  that

they are not concerned with who will win, so long as

the  P.A.P. is  defeated  in  the  forthcoming

by-election at Hong Lim. Although Ong Eng Guan has been

regarded  as  a liar by the Commission  of  Inquiry,

their aim is merely to support Ong Eng Guan in order

to defeat the P.A.P. in the by-election. It is clear

by  this that these political parties have made  Ong

Eng  Guan their tool in order to oppose the People's

Action  Party.  Whether or not they themselves  have

anything in common with Ong Eng Guan is immaterial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, since the Ong Eng Guan incident,

U.M.N.O. has not yet started to flirt with  Ong  Eng

Guan.  From  the  action of the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan, it may not be U.M.N.O. but it may be that

the Member for Kampong Kembangan himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



has  flirted  with Ong Eng Guan. Mr  Speaker,  when

mentioning this issue, I am impressed when  I  think

of  how  Ong Eng Guan dreamed of becoming the  Prime

Minister. Likewise, the Member for Kampong Kembangan

has an axe to grind with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Kampong Kembangan himself

did  say that at one time I did become his political

tutor.  Concerning the clashes that nearly  happened

between  the Chinese and the Malays, the Member  for

Kampong Kembangan has taken the opportunity in  this

Assembly to say that I approached U.M.N.O. and asked

for  their co-operation. Mr Speaker, this  is  true

because  rumours  which  will  precipitate  communal

clashes in this country will merely reflect  on  the

Government, and it is the responsibility of all  the

people  who  love  peace  to dispel  those  rumours.

Therefore, I invited U.M.N.O. and asked them if they

would  like to co-operate to wipe out these rumours.

My  invitation  was  welcomed by U.M.N.O.  For  that

reason,  the Minister for Culture in his  speech  in

this  Assembly  on  the movement of  A.R.T.I.S. did

mention  the leaders of U.M.N.O. as well  as  Muslim

religious   leaders   who   co-operated   with   the

Government. It is our common responsibility  towards

the  prosperity  and well-being  of  the  people  in

Singapore. Also, Mr Speaker, I would like to stress

in  this Assembly the reason why we invited U.M.N.O.

to  take  part  with us to wipe out  these  rumours,

because  many  factions from those  responsible  for

spreading   the  malicious  rumours  did   implicate

several  leaders who were involved in this movement.

Therefore-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Hon. the Parliamentary

Secretary  has gone far enough to answer  the  point

made  by the Member for Kampong Kembangan. In  fact,

the  point  made by the Member for Kampong Kembangan

was   quite   irrelevant,  and   I   permitted   the

Parliamentary Secretary to speak until now in answer

to  the point made. I do not think he should go into

further details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Yaacob: Mr Speaker, I merely explained just

now in answer to the Member for Kampong Kembangan. I

talked  about the false rumours because there  is  a

feeling  that the Government has forgotten the  good

co-operation  rendered by U.M.N.O. Mr Speaker,  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan has clearly said  that

Ong  Eng  Guan was instrumental in breaking  up  the

unity  of U.M.N.O. in Singapore. Whether it is  true

or  otherwise, it is left to the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan.  But when he mentioned that a  number  of

persons  who  are  now on the Government  side  were

former members of U.M.N.O., I would like to say that

we  who  left  U.M.N.O. to join the People's  Action

Party  did  so  not  because of Ong  Eng  Guan,  but

because of the P.A.P.'s social, democratic ideology.

A  great number of the members who left U.M.N.O. and

joined  the  People's  Action  Party  at  one   time

comprised   Left-wing   elements.   They   conducted

political  activities in the Federation  which  were

later banned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must now stop the

hon.  Member  from continuing in that  strain.  Now,

will he come back to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I merely

said  that  just  now  so  that  there  will  be  no

misunderstanding in this Assembly.  It  is  possible

that  trying to implicate Members of the  Government

will  confuse matters, but I would like to say  that

the  groups  which opposed the motion moved  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister in this Assembly clearly state

their stand, that they have some sinister motive  or

that they have begun to flirt with Ong Eng Guan. For

that reason, they have not got the guts to come  out

openly. If outside of the Assembly they were to  say

that   the  People's  Action  Party  is  no   longer

representative  of  the  people,  then  they  should

contest the by-election to fight the P.A.P. But what

do we find, Mr Speaker? In an indirect manner, they

are  supporting  Ong Eng Guan and  using  him  as  a

shield  and  a  tool to defeat the  People's  Action

Party   in   the  by-election.  This   is   a   very

dishonourable act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid my Malay is not so

good. But the translation is that there has been  an

allegation that Members of the Opposition are guilty

of  a  dishonourable  act. If  that  translation  is

correct,  I think the Member ought to withdraw  that

allegation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

prepared to withdraw it. But what I meant to say was

that the method of opposing in an indirect manner in

politics is unwise, because we must come out in  the

open.   If  the  present  Government  is  no  longer

representative of the people, then the  Party  which

could  claim  to  represent the people  should  come

forward  and  put up their candidates  so  that  the

people  could pass judgment as to which Party really

represents the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Shall we adjourn?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,

"That this debate be now adjourned."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, this is the Puasa month and

Malay  Members have to go to mosque at 6.50 p.m. to

break their fast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this debate be now adjourned.
