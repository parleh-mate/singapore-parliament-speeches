<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President (accompanied by two

A.D.C.s) entered the Chamber, accompanied

by Mr Speaker, who was preceded by the

Serjeant at Arms (without the Mace), the

Second Assistant Clerk, the First Assistant

Clerk and the Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Clerk announcing "The President", the

President delivered his Opening Speech.



<br><br>8.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares):</b> Honourable

Members, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



gathered  today  at the start of a five-year  term  of

this fourth Parliament since 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be idle to pretend that the security and

economic prospects are better now than when we met  in

October 1972. Then the Americans were still in Vietnam

and  backing the Thieu regime. Now, they have departed

even  from Thailand. 1972 was before the oil  crisis,

and more rapid growth was in the offing. Now, there is

uncertainty  and anxiety amongst the major  industrial

nations  of  the West. It is an open question  whether

they can co-ordinate their economic policies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



especially  America, Japan and Germany,  to  stimulate

recovery from recession without again another bout  of

high  inflation. We have now to be prepared for slower

growth  rates, and  adjust accordingly  our  spending

habits, both as a government and as individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My government has again been returned to office. The

PAP won in all constituencies. This government has the

highest number of votes, and the highest percentage of

votes  (72.4%) cast in the six general elections  held

since representative government in 1955. This vote  of

confidence  imposes  a  heavy  responsibility  on   my

Ministers to act fairly but firmly. My government will

exercise  its  authority to govern with circumspection

and moderation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also places on all Honourable Members, especially

those not holding office, the duty to ensure that  all

shades  of  opinion  out  in  the  constituencies  are

vigorously  voiced  in  Parliamentary  questions   and

debates.  No  major  policy or legislation  should  be

passed  without the closest scrutiny, and passed  only

after the most thorough debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate on which my government was elected is

clearcut.  The  issues were fought for months,  indeed

years,  before  the elections. Many of the  opposition

political  parties, both those who took  part  in  the

elections and those who did not, repeated the  demands

of  the  Communist  Party of Malaya (Malaya  including

Singapore)   (CPM), regularly  voiced   over   their

clandestine   radio.   These   demands   include   the

unconditional  release  of  all  communist  and   pro-communist

detainees,  abolition  of   the   Internal

Security Act, and abolition of National Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people have rejected these and supported the

government, But it would be naive to believe that  the

Communist Party of Malaya, in their armed struggle for

a   communist  Malaya, will  not  try  to  abuse  the

opportunities  of  the democratic processes,  and  the

mass media, to help camouflage their armed struggle to

grab  power.  They  will continue to  rebuild  amongst

small  misguided student groups, like the Malayan  New

Democratic Youth League (MNDYL). Student groups in the

Polytechnic and in other tertiary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



institutions  have been and will be  their  recruiting

areas.  Small  groups of activists  will  continue  to

manipulate our student organisations abroad in Britain

and Australia, in active collaboration with British or

Australian Marxists and Trotskyites, as the  case  may

be.  They now style themselves as the "new left".  But

their  techniques  of  oft repeated  lies, and  their

exploitation  of innocent soft-hearted or  soft-headed

"liberals",   are  long-established   techniques   and

tactics  of  the communists, learned by the  CPM  from

other  communist parties in Europe and Asia,  repeated

with  minor  variations on new audiences in  different

places.  And  there is always the younger, politically

innocent, if not naive, generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote is also a renewed mandate not to be

beguiled  away  from a most necessary law,  which  the

British themselves drafted and promulgated when  faced

with  communist insurgency in 1948, namely, detention

of  communist and pro-communist elements without going

through  the  processes of a public trial accorded  to

ordinary  criminals.  My government,  in  accord  with

humane  sentiment,  will release  them  if  they  will

denounce  the CPM's use of force to seize  power, and

themselves  forswear  the use of  force  to  unseat  a

constitutionally elected government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest it be forgotten, it is a mandate also to reject

the soft-headed, pernicious policies that all the good

things in life, from bus rides to PUB charges, can  be

given  for free, or otherwise to reduce the  fares  or

charges  when the costs are going up. Only  education,

medical  treatment and housing will be subsidised,  in

order  to help everyone to be educated and healthy  to

be  able  to  look after himself. But nominal  charges

must  be  paid even for schools, to pay for the  extra

curricular  activities,  and  hospitals, to   prevent

unnecessary pressure on medical facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before us are some terrifying examples of what can

happen  to  those  who  go in  for  soft  options  and

subsidised  living, a temptation in  any  one-man-one-vote

election campaign. Some once-great nations  have

been beguiled by this illusion that somebody else will

pay, that all people had to do was to elect a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



government that would take money from those  who  have

and give it to those who have not. Indeed, the British

Prime Minister lamented a few weeks ago that the  most

hateful  slogan  he had heard was  made  at  a  recent

protest  march of Marxist and Trotskyite  infiltrators

of his Labour. Party:

"What  do  we  want? Everything! When do we  want  it?

Now!" A great people have been temporarily reduced  to

straitened  circumstances by this excessive cushioning

of  life  by  state subsidies. When my Prime  Minister

visited China last year, his realistic communist hosts

described such sad situations as "teachers by negative

example".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My government holds firm to this simple truth: that

to  get  from  each his best, rewards and  recognition

must  go  to  those  who  excel in  consistently  high

performance. Between the soft solutions of  some  West

European  socialists of equal rewards,  and  the  hard

realities  of Asian conditions, my government  has  no

doubts  that  the  people  of Singapore  unequivocally

uphold  Asian precepts - "From each his best;  To  each

his  worth". The communists in China have a  variation

of this in their aphorism: "Ge jin suo neng, an lao

fen  pei"  ()  -  from  each

according  to  his ability, to each according  to  his

labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are different from China. We have access

to  modern  science  and  technology.  We  have  rapid

economic  and material transformation that comes  from

these  modern management methods, capital  inputs  and

marketing  knowhow.  But  we  must  not  abandon   the

cardinal  precepts of our long-proven culture systems,

precepts  which  enabled some Asian  civilisations  to

survive, and  without a break in continuity,  floods.

famines,  pestilence,  wars,  disasters  and   foreign

conquests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we admire and must learn and acquire their

science  and technology, their management  skills  and

marketing  knowhow, we do not seek to model our  lives

on  Western social mores and their contemporary  life-styles.

We must learn the experience of the Japanese -

how,  in  less  than a hundred years since  the  Meiji

Restoration  of  1868,  they  have  become  a   modern

industrial   state,  without  abandoning   their   own

cultural traditions. Their experience is more relevant

to  us  than those of the countries of Western Europe.

The   exceptions   are  perhaps   West   Germany   and

Switzerland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to formulate our way of life, taking what is

best  from  the West and fitting it into the Singapore

context.  We  must  not  allow  our  values  and   our

philosophy   of   what  is  good  government   to   be

overwhelmed  by  the  standards  and  norms   of   the

contemporary  West, regardless of their  relevance  to

our  social, economic and political conditions, simply

because, for the time being the West have the material

abundance and technological superiority. Let us select

the relevant factors in their societies, factors which

have made them strong and have been proven by the test

of  time.  Then we can incorporate these factors  into

our system without damage to ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the President's Address. Mr

Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant at Arms, the  Clerk,

the  First  Assistant Clerk and the  Second  Assistant

Clerk,  escorted  the  President (accompained  by  two

A.D.C.s)  out of the Chamber, and the House  adjourned

without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

<div align="center"><b>ADDENDUM TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE FIRST SESSION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>OF THE FOURTH PARLIAMENT ON TUESDAY, 8TH FEBRUARY, 1977</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><i>Economic Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few years, our aim will still be to

make  Singapore grow fast again. Old and new curbs  on

trade  by the richer countries in the world will limit

such growth. But Singapore should grow by at least  6-

8%  every  year. We can then provide enough  jobs  for

workers  And  we  can  enjoy  an  increasingly  higher

standard of living because we can pay for our needs in

food,  housing, education and health and for more  and

better goods and services.



<br><br><i>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall maintain the Singapore dollar as a strong

and stable currency. The money supply will be expanded

moderately.  The  money,  bond,  capital  and  foreign

exchange  markets  will be further  developed  in  our

financial  centre. The intention is  that  there  will

always be finance at reasonably low interest rates  to

encourage sound projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will, however, be no extravagance in public

sector  expenditures. These will be  more  efficiently

controlled  by a new style budget by 1979 This  budget

will  enable  the work programmes of each Ministry  of

Government to be examined against its targets and  its

performance  Funds  can  then be  allocated  on  their

review



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore grow, what we collect from our present

taxes  grows  also. With good growth, we shall  rarely

have  to put up tax rates or think of major new  taxes

to  pay  for our increased needs. But we may want, as

one way of helping to encourage or discourage one kind

of  activity  over another, to change  a  tax  or  add

another  to  our  tax system. We may  wish  to  favour

manufacturing,  international  finance  and   banking.

reinsurance, warehousing  of   capital   goods   and

equipment  for  sale  to  regional  and  international

markets, and tourism and conventions. A Fiscal  Policy

Implementation Committee will suggest how best we  can

do this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Industrial Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want much more manufacturing in Singapore. We

shall   therefore  continue, through   the   Economic

Development  Board, to offer special  help,  by  lower

taxes  or  otherwise,  to investors  who  set  up  new

industries or expand old ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have ready now, in our industrial estates, land

and   factory  buildings  served  with  power, water,

telephone and other services. If necessary,  we  shall

build  more,  especially smaller, factory  buildings.

These will be sold at low prices to manufacturers  who

support  bigger ones by supplying small  parts  or  do

other services for them



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep down costs so that the goods we make

will  not  be  too  dear to compete with  those  other

countries  produce. We shall watch carefully therefore

against too high Government charges for industry  such

as  for  port  services or rates for  electricity  and

water.  But  we may have, from time to time,  to  meet

higher  prices such as for oil. We shall seek, through

the   National  Wages  Council,  single  annual   wage

increases which reward workers who produce more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall spend more on Training Centres to give

better  training to our workers so that they have  the

highest  manual  skills for delicate, precision  work.

And  we  shall also persuade those who own  or  manage

businesses  to learn how to make better use  of  their

workers and their machinery and to sell their products

also in new and wider markets overseas.



<br><br><i>Trade Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall help in a number of ways to make trade flow

more  easily.  We  shall do more to  improve  regional

markets  by increasing ASEAN economic cooperation  and

making preferential trading arrangements. Finance  for

exports  will  be  made  more  easily  available.  The

Monetary Authority of Singapore will keep its rate for

rediscounting  export  bills  attractive.   We   shall

arrange with the Development Bank of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  for  long term loans to be  given  on  easy

terms  to  sell  ships built in Singapore  yards.  The

Export  Credit  Insurance Scheme will be  extended  to

cover  business and political risks for capital  goods

also. Small industries will get increased aid from the

Small Industries Finance Scheme.



<br><br><i>Tourism</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall encourage more tourists to come to

Singapore, especially from ASEAN countries.  We  shall

promote more conventions for business and professional

men.  We  shall  try to increase the number  of  group

tours   by   getting  more  chartered   flights   into

Singapore.



<br><br><div align="right">HON SUI SEN</div>

<div align="right">Minister for Finance</div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Elections of December 1976 proved that

the Republic's citizens accept national service as  a

necessary duty of the young. Only in this way  is  it

possible for a small country to achieve  the  minimum

security required for confidence and development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since our defence forces have to import

nearly all  their weapons and equipment,  the  rising

prices of  these  products impose a severe  financial

burden. It  is  therefore necessary to  exercise  the

utmost economy  in defence expenditure.  In  November

1976, a  committee of Finance and Defence Ministries'

officials was  appointed  to  maintain  a  continuing

surveillance over costs and to prune down expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to economise in the use of

manpower. As a result of successful family planning in

past years,  the  number of young men  available  for

national service in future years will show  a  steady

but relentless decline. In ten years' time, the number

available will be nearly 30% less than what it is now.

There are  a number of implications which  are  being

studied in the Ministry of Defence. It will certainly

be necessary to trim down manpower establishments and

reduce or even abolish vocations which do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



contribute much  to  the combat  efficiency  of  army

units. It  will  also be necessary  to  increase  the

number of  regulars, especially in the NCO ranks.  In

the longer  term,  if  force  structure  is  to   be

maintained at current levels, it is more than  likely

that national  service will have to  be  extended  to

women, for a start, possibly on a selective basis,  to

fill up non-combat posts.



<br><br><div align="right">GOH KENG SWEE</div>

<div align="right">Minister of Defence</div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an open economy. Singapore will inevitably be

affected by  the  uncertain  international  economic

situation in  the  immediate  years  ahead.   Without

natural resources of its own, the Republic must  move

to minimise  the  adverse  effects  of  international

economic developments.  In  the  labour  field,   the

Ministry will  continue  to  work  with  unions   and

employers to contribute to economic growth through the

promotion of a stable and peaceful industrial climate,

the fostering   of  a  disciplined  and   productive

workforce and the safeguarding of the welfare,  safety

and health of our workers.



<br><br><i>I Industrial Relations</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's main resource is manpower, trained and

productive. Our  workers must  work  harder,  upgrade

their skills  and increase their productivity.  Union

leaders at headquarters and branch levels as well  as

workers should accept that future wage increases  have

to be orderly and related to higher productivity  and

economic growth. Fringe benefits which have escalated

in recent  years  must not be extended  in  range  or

quantum. Those which are bizarre or not conducive  to

economic progress  will have to be discontinued.  The

National Wages Council will examine the  question  of

the full offsetting of its wage guidelines against all

forms of  increases  of remuneration.  It  will  also

consider whether  employees  who  job-hop  should  be

granted the   full   wage   increase   recommended.

Rationalisation of fringe benefits will also be looked

into by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



Council. At  the  plant  level,  employers  will   be

encouraged to implement productivity incentive schemes

to ensure  greater efforts on the workers'  part  and

reward for such additional performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will further improve its industrial

relations services  by  adopting  a  more  alert  and

positive approach to the prevention and settlement  of

industrial disputes. A departmental service  will  be

introduced to build up a corps of experienced  labour

and industrial relations officers.



<br><br><i>II Manpower Utilisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures will be taken by the Employment Service to

secure employment for more persons on its register  of

unemployed. The  present  Disablement   Resettlement

Scheme for the training and subsequent employment  of

disabled persons  will  be extended  to  industrially

disabled workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although about 4 per cent of its workforce are

registered as technically unemployed at the Employment

Service, Singapore still has to grant work permits  to

large numbers of foreign workers. Young  Singaporeans

have become choosy about their employment  preferring

not to accept "hard" jobs even though they are better

paid. They prefer to remain unemployed until a "soft"

job to  their liking is found. The Ministry of Labour

is examining  a  study  group's  recommendations  for

encouraging Singaporeans to work in the  construction

industry. Studies  will  be  undertaken   of   other

industries which are avoided by Singaporeans  so  that

corrective action can be taken.



<br><br><i>III Industrial Safety and Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special attention will continue to be paid to

reducing the   accident  rate  of  the  construction

industry and   the   shipbuilding   and   repairing

industries. The  Factory  Inspectorate  will   ensure

better compliance by contractors of the provision  of

life-line anchorages in view of the large  number  of

construction workers injured or killed through falling

from heights. It will conduct further studies on means

of providing  life-line anchorages for walls  without

openings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the number of workers being struck by

falling objects,  the  lnspectorate  will  step   up

enforcement. Contractors will be required  to  provide

safety measures  such  as  safety  helmets,  overhead

shelters and proper debris disposal facilities.  They

will also  have to supervise their workers to  ensure

that they comply with safety rules. With more machines

being used,  training of operators  in  their  proper

handling will be intensified. Shipyard personnel  and

contract workers will continue to be trained in safety

measures, ship-inspection and fire-fighting. Shipyards

will be   further  encouraged  to  introduce   self-regulating

systems of safety and health  as  part  of

their management  functions and  assistance  will  be

provided where necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate will work with SISIR and

professional bodies to produce codes of practice  for

the design  and  erection  of  scaffolds,  formworks.

machine guarding, lifting  equipment  and  pressure

vessels. Amendments  to the  Factories  Act  will  be

introduced to  provide  for  enhanced  penalties  for

offences which are likely to cause the  death  of  or

bodily injury to workers. The Ministry is studying  a

proposal to  establish  an  Occupational  Safety  and

Health Institute to provide training, consultancy  and

research in industrial safety and health. A report  on

the matter  has been submitted by an  ILO  expert  on

occupational safety and health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Health Department will take measures

to protect workers from cancer-causing substances used

in industry.  Additional programmes  to  improve  the

competence of  industrial  health  nurses   will   be

introduced.



<br><br><i>IV Productivity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board will give greater

emphasis on assistance to small and medium-sized local

enterprises to improve their productivity. Training of

supervisors and   junior   and   middle   management

executives will be given more attention.  Consultancy

in small business management will be introduced while

those in industrial engineering, management techniques

and low  cost  automation  will  be  continued.  The

expansion of such a service to systems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



analysis, management information systems and  computer

application techniques to industries will be examined.

The Board will intensify its promotional work in  the

field of  productivity. It will also  assist  in  the

formulation of productivity schemes.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will plan and

work towards better housing with improved social  and

recreational facilities,  better  infrastructure  and

public amenities in pleasant and gracious environment

in the next 5 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of creating new parks and open spaces

is underlined by the large number of people living in

high rise  flats. The Parks and Recreation Department

will continue with its effort to improve  our  garden

city. Six  new parks will be developed at West  Coast

reclaimed land, Pasir Panjang Hill, Sembawang,  Pasir

Ris, Marina Centre and Tanjong Berlayer. Recreational

facilities will  be  introduced  into  these   parks

wherever necessary. Appropriate planning policy  will

ensure the  maximum utilisation of  our  scarce  land

resources and the creation of a pleasant and  gracious

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20 million will be spent on kampong roads, bridges.

jetties, street lighting and public utilities for  the

improvement of the rural areas.



<br><br><i>Housing and Public Projects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1960, the Housing and Development Board has

completed about a quarter million housing  units  for

55% of  our  population. Under the  fourth  Five-Year

Building Programme  another 150,000  units  will  be

completed by 1980. An additional 10,000 flats will  be

built in  the  Central  Area  to  help  reverse   the

population drift to the new towns. At  this  pace  of

development applicants will not have to  wait  longer

than 1 -  1 1/2 years to buy or  rent HDB flats. It is

estimated that about 2 million people will live



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



in HDB flats by 1980. The HDB will continue to strive

to establish a closer rapport with the residents  and

will continue to seek their cooperation and assistance

in providing  an efficient, courteous and  responsive

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HUDC flats are built for middle income citizens who

are not eligible for HDB flats and who cannot  afford

private housing Ownership of HUDC flats is made easier

as the  purchase of the flats can be  made  with  the

assistance of the Central Provident Fund. 2,000  flats

have already been built and sold. Another  1,000  new

flats will be built by 1978 at Braddell Rise. Chancery

Lane and  Ulu Pandan. Middle income housing  is  also

planned for the Central Area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Urban Redevelopment Authority will

systematically clear slums and renew the Central Area.

Places of  historic  interest,  however, will   be

rehabilitated and   preserved.   Entertainment   and

recreational facilities will be  planned  to  promote

activities after normal business hours.  Transit  and

permanent resettlement centres, where required, will

be built to resettle businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our housing and industrial programmes make it

necessary for the Public Works Department to construct

and maintain a large network of roads. The Pan Island

Expressway, the East Coast Parkway and the  Woodlands

Expressway are  three  major  road  projects   under

construction. Computerised traffic  control  will  be

introduced to maximise utilisation of roads. To  cater

to the  interest of the growing number of pedestrians

on our roads, landscaped footpaths, pedestrian  malls

and walkways will be constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PWD is now engaged in the improvement of Paya

Lebar Airport to adequately meet the projected growth

in passenger and air cargo traffic over the next  few

years. The  construction of a new  airport  with  two

runways on  reclaimed land in Changi has  begun.  The

first runway  of  the new airport  is  scheduled  for

service in  the  early  80's.  Construction  of   the

University of  Singapore campus at  Kent  Ridge  with

facilities for the University to increase its  student

population from 3, 500 to 7, 500 will be  completed  by

1980. Work on Kent Ridge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



Hospital - a teaching-cum-general hospital  with  750

beds - will commence in 1978. 36 primary schools and 30

secondary schools  sited within the  new  centres  of

population will be built. In addition, the Department

will also build hospitals, clinics, libraries, markets

and food centres.



<br><br><i>Primary Production</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the limits of available land, self-sufficiency

in pork, eggs and poultry  meat  will  be

maintained. For environmental control, pig farms  will

be relocated  from the Kranji area to a non-catchment

area. A central market for fruits and vegetables  will

be built at Pasir Panjang to replace the Clyde Terrace

Market and other wholesale centres in the city  which

are affected by redevelopment.



<br><br><i>Resettlement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the provision of HDB flats for

residential cases, there will be alternative  premises

or cash  payments  in  lieu for  shops,  resettlement

facilities for specific trades and land for  efficient

pig farmers in Punggol. Flatted and terrace factories

will be developed at Paya Lebar and Jalan Perang  for

the relocation of small and supporting industries for

them to continue and to expand.



<br><br><i>Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclamation to provide additional land for housing.

industries, recreational facilities, roads  and  other

public projects  will continue. At  the  East  Coast.

1,000 hectares  (2,500  acres)  of  land  have   been

reclaimed. Another 1,180 hectares (2,950  acres)  are

being reclaimed  of which 600 hectares  are  for  the

development of  Changi  Airport.  Reclamation   will

provide about 580 hectares (1,450 acres) of new  land

adjacent to the Central Business District. This  will

allow for the expansion of the old city and if  needs

be, the building of a new city of the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board has been steadily

expanding to   meet   the  increasing   demand   for

electricity, water and gas





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Electricity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth in maximum demand of electricity of 11%

per year in 1975 and 1976 is indicative of the general

trend of economic recovery in the Republic after  the

low growth  of 3% in 1974 following the oil  crisis.

Over the next 5 years, a 58% increase is expected  and

more power  projects are underway to  cater  for  the

1980's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage I of Senoko Power Station has been completed

and work  is  currently  in  progress  on  Stage   II

comprising three 250 MW units. This  stage  which  is

estimated to  cost $522 million and is scheduled  for

completion in 1980 will increase the total generating

capacity to 2090 MW. Plans for Stage III of Senoko are

presently under study. For demand beyond the  1980's,

another power  station  will  be  necessary  and  its

proposed location is under consideration. Concomitant

with the  generation  of  more  electricity  is   the

extension of  transmission  and  distribution  system

which will cost $791.7 million over the next 5 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69% of the Board's annual recurrent expenditure

before depreciation and interest charges is  on  fuel

oil for electricity generation. Continuous efforts are

being made  to  increase  operational  efficiency  of

generators to conserve the consumption of fuel oil. As

a result of increasing efficiency, the Board has,  so

far, been able to absorb the 10% increase (from  $160

to $177  per  ton)  in the price of  fuel  oil  since

October 1975,  without  increasing  the   price   of

electricity to consumers. However, the latest increase

in oil  price will necessitate an upward revision  of

the tariffs. Economy in the usage of electricity will

not only benefit consumers but will also save foreign

exchange for the Republic.



<br><br><i>Water</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976 daily consumption of water averaged 594,000

cubic metres. This is expected to increase to 820,000

cubic metres in 1981, an increase of 38%. The  growth

of demand  for  water  has  necessitated  continuous

development of  new sources which are  becoming  more

expensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of Western Catchments Scheme, which

will commence  this  year,  covers  the   four   new

reservoirs by  the damming of four  rivers  -  Murai,

Poyan. Sarimbun and Tengeh - in the western  part  of

Singapore. These reservoirs will have a total  storage

capacity of 28.4 million cu, m. This scheme  and  the

extension of  the recently completed  Choa  Chu  Kang

Treatment Works, scheduled for operation by 1981, will

cost $72 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Kranji-Pandan Scheme, water to the new

reservoir flows through unprotected catchments and  is

more polluted  than conventional sources.  The  water

will have  saline content as the reservoirs  will  be

built in estuaries like Kranji and Pandan reservoirs.

The treated water from these reservoirs will  have  a

different taste  but it will be completely  safe  for

drinking and   within   World  Health   Organisation

standards. This kind of water is to be expected  from

now onwards  as  water  sources  from  the   central

protected catchments have been fully exploited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of production of water is increasing with

more expensive   methods  of   treatment   requiring

sophisticated and costly equipment and  chemicals  to

treat the more polluted raw water. Wasteful habits  in

the use  of  potable  water  must  be  stopped.  The

devastating effects of drought even in countries  with

abundant water resources were seen last  year.  Water

conservation must  therefore be a  way  of  life  for

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the next few years, the Board will have to

look into  unconventional methods of  increasing  its

water supply, like advanced water treatment methods to

cope with  anticipated  demand  beyond  the  1980's.

Feasibility studies and tests carried out  at  Jurong

Pilot Plant, which was set up in 1974, have shown that

with advanced water treatment technique, the recycling

of water  would technically be a feasible  method  of

increasing water supply for the future.



<br><br><i>Gas</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continuing drive against air pollution, the

demand for piped gas is expected to increase  by  75%

over the next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



five years,  especially  from  the  commercial   and

industrial sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this increased demand, gas production

facilities are  being  expanded.  Three  new  naphtha

reformers, each with a daily production  capacity  of

150,500 cubic metres will be added to the system.  The

old heavy fuel oil reformers will then be scrapped and

only the   more  efficient  pollution-free   naphtha

reformers will be utilised for gas production.  These

developments will cater for the demand for  gas  into

the 1980's.



<br><br><i>New Headquarters</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will be moving shortly into its new

headquarters at Somerset Road. The centralisation  of

the various offices under one roof would enable better

coordination and  communication, The  more  conducive

working environment  will  enhance  efficiency   and

productivity.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LAW</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Ministry, in addition to its responsibility

for constitutional and legal matters which are handled

by the Attorney-General's Chambers, will continue, in

consultation with  the various ministries,  to  draft

parliamentary bills   and   subsidiary   legislation

authorised by acts of Parliament, to meet the changing

needs of  our  society. The Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions) (Amendment) Act, the Evidence (Amendment)

Act and  the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)  Act

which brought  about  significant  changes  in   the

administration of justice, were brought into operation

on 1 January 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Residential Property Act,

which came into operation on 11 September  1973, are

being administered smoothly. Changes in land values in

the property market will continue to be monitored, and

remedial measures, where necessary, will be taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand as well as competing claims by Government

departments, statutory authorities  and  the  private

sector on  our  limited land resources will  increase

with the  expansion  of  commerce,  urbanisation  and

industrialisation. State land must be kept  free  from

encumbrances and   where  necessary,   tenants   and

squatters on  State land rehoused, to make  available

land for  development by both the public and  private

sectors. Phased  acquisition  of  land  required  for

development, reclamation and maximum positive  support

and improved  services  by  the  various  Government

departments and   agencies   involved    in    land

administration, will ensure optimum land  utilisation

for maximum economic growth and development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office, Registry of Titles and Deeds,

Survey Department,  Official  Assignee  and   Public

Trustee and Registry of Trade Marks and Patents  will,

in the  exercise of their statutory functions, strive

to provide improved services.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next five years the Ministry of

Communications will  develop  Singapore  as  a  major

Communications Centre.   Modern,    efficient    and

comprehensive services  in   radio   and   satellite

telecommunications, air transportation  and  shipping

will be provided at competitive prices.



<br><br><i>Civil Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's aviation policy is designed to attract

both freight and tourist traffic to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional facilities at Paya Lebar Airport will be

constructed to  meet projected growth  in  cargo  and

passenger traffic over the next few years, pending the

opening of Changi Airport in mid-1980. All procedures

will be simplified, streamlined and rationalised.  An

active promotion  programme  will  be  undertaken  to

publicise Singapore  as  an  airfreight  transhipment

centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will be developed as an airfreight centre

to fully utilise the facilities and services available

at Changi International Airport in the early 1980s. A

liberal and conducive atmosphere will be created  for

international air carriers to operate in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's position as a major telecommunications

centre will be further enhanced by expansion  of  the

Sentosa Earth  Station facilities and laying  of  new

submarine cables  to neighbouring,  especially  ASEAN

countries. International subscriber dialing and  telex

services will  be  extended to more subscribers.  The

international "teleconference" service providing  two-way

audio-visual contact will be introduced in 1978 - 1979.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic telephone network will be expanded. The

target by  1981  is  788,000  telephones  giving   a

telephone density of 32 telephones per 100 population.

This will  be roughly double the present  density  of

16.4 telephones per 100 population.



<br><br><i>Maritime and Port Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) now has 5

gateways handling 14.85 million tons of general  cargo

in 1976, an increase of 16% over the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New cargo transportation and shipping technologies

and mechanised methods of warehousing, cargo handling

and storage are being developed to regain Singapore's

position as the regional warehousing and transhipment

centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main area for redevelopment is at Telok Ayer

Basin where,  because of reclamation for  the  Marina

Centre, the  whole  pattern of lighterage  and  cargo

handling and  the transportation and transhipment  of

regional goods  will  undergo  significant   change.

Measures are  being worked to enable  the  lighterage

trade to continue not only in the Singapore River  but

at Pasir Panjang as well with the same low costs,  so

that Singapore's   competitive  position   will   be

maintained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore World Trade Centre (SWTC) at the new 12-storey

Singapore Maritime Centre when completed  will

link Singapore-based businesses  with  more  than  90

other world trade centres in 40 countries all over the

world. New  trading methods and systems with  special

communications links  and  backup  services  such  as

computer data banks will be provided to service  these

world traders.



<br><br><i>Road Transportation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Bus Service has made great improvement

in the last two years. The good work must continue and

standards improved. Depots and other maintenance back-up

facilities are being built to reduce breakdowns to

a minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Government is studying a comprehensive

transportation and land use plan for a rail-based Mass

Rapid Transit  System. Pending its introduction,  SBS

will be  the mainstay of Singapore's public transport

system.



<br><br><i>Postal Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased mechanisation in the sorting and delivery

of letters and parcels will be installed. Mails  must

always be  delivered  safely and  promptly.  In  many

countries, trade    has   suffered    because    of

inefficiencies in the postal system. This must not  be

allowed to happen in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Postal Complex at Jalan Eunos will

incorporate modern mechanised equipment. 30  new  post

offices will  be  built  in  new  housing   estates,

industrial estates, and newly completed urban  centres

in the  next  five  years. More postal  agencies  and

posting boxes will also be set up for the convenience

of the general public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to expand and improve the

quality of the medical services within the limits  of

our financial capacity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



manpower strength.  Like other services,  the  health

service is  affected  by mounting  inflation.  Health

expenditure increased nearly threefold  in  5  years,

from $53m  in  1970 to $154m in 1975  or  $25.55  per

capita in 1970 to $68.52 in  1975  (or $45.74 at 1970

prices -  a 79% rise in 5 years), The primary concern

will be  to keep  health expenditure at as low a level

as possible through   greater emphasis on  preventive

medicine, and selective institutional care for the acutely ill.

The Ministry reluctantly has to accept the necessity  that

one has  to pay for part of the treatment  to  ensure

that costly medical treatment is not unduly abused.



<br><br><i>Hospital Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Singapore General Hospital will cost $200m.

It is  due for completion in 1980 and will  have  the

most modern  comprehensive  of  hospital  facilities.

There will  also  be  a  new  hospital  within   the

University campus at Kent Ridge costing  $137m.  When

completed by 1985, it will have 750 beds.



<br><br><i>Development of Dental Health Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New school dental clinics and outpatient dental

clinics are  planned for the next 5  years.  The  new

$7.5m Institute  of Dental Health at  Hyderabad  Road

will be  completed in mid 1977. There will be  better

training facilities for dental therapists, nurses  and

technicians. Although a large volume of curative  work

is being  handled, the main emphasis is on preventive

dentistry and dental health education.



<br><br><i>Preventive Medicine</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly two-thirds of total operation costs for the

whole medical  service are incurred  in  running  the

hospitals. This is compounded by the rising demand for

in-patient treatment. There has been a 20% increase in

hospital admissions, from 135, 952 in 1970 to  164, 205

in 1975.  With smaller families and better education,

there is the necessity for better medical services. To

maintain and  improve standards,  expensive  hospital

care is confined to those who need it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a per capita basis, the outpatient services have

been most   cost-effective  -  $4  per   outpatient

attendance compared to an average of $48 per bed  per

day for a general hospital. The logical solution  is

that greater  attention will  have  to  be  paid  on

primary health care, preventive medicine and  health

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Outpatient, Maternal and Child Health, and

School Health Services were integrated in mid 1976 to

streamline primary  health care  services.  New-type

poly-clinics combining  curative   and   preventive

medical/dental treatment are being planned  in  such

major Housing and Development Board Towns as Ang  Mo

Kio. Bedok,  Telok  Blangah. Woodlands  and  Geylang

East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive immunisation programmes against

infectious diseases will continue More stress will be

given to  educate the public on how to stay  healthy

through regular  national  health  campaigns.  These

campaigns will explain the factors which  cause  ill

health, and how mental and occupational health can be

protected by  improving  the  working  and   living

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plight of the geriatric population (those over 60

years) who are more vulnerable to illness because  of

the degenerative  process will  not  be  overlooked.

Though they  constitute  6.6%  of  the   population

(expected to rise to 9% in 25 years), they  comprise

15.5% of all hospital admissions and 27.4% of  long-staying

patients The Home Nursing Foundation, a joint

project by the Government and community, was recently

established to  bring nursing care to  the  disabled

old, chronic sick and mentally ill patients in their

homes Such home nursing will enable the hospitals  to

be put to optimum use for treating the acutely ill.



<br><br><i>Licensing of Medicinal Products</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Medicines Act 1975 has been passed. It will

soon regulate the manufacture and sale of  medicinal

products to   ensure  their  safety,  quality   and

efficacy.

<br><br><i>Infectious Diseases</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No case of smallpox, yellow fever or plague has

been reported for nearly two decades. Diseases  like

cholera, typhoid, malaria and  dengue  haemorrhagic

fever have  been  brought  under  control  and   the

incidence of  these  diseases  has  been   reduced.

However, sporadic outbreaks will continue  to  occur

because our  strategic location exposes  us  to  the

constant risk  of  introduction  of  some  of  these

diseases. Strict surveillance and control of  vectors

and health  education of the public  must  continue.

Though modern  sanitation  and  potable  water   are

available to  most householders, minor outbreaks  of

typhoid will occur through contamination of food. The

Ministry plans  to  screen and  inoculate  all  food

handlers to further reduce the incidence of typhoid.

Some 49, 000 food handlers have so far been inoculated

and 3, 300 screened. A record of typhoid carriers will

be maintained.  Ultimate success in typhoid  control

will depend on the full cooperation of the public and

food handlers  in  maintaining a  high  standard  of

personal and food hygiene.



<br><br><i>Air Pollution</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air pollution is on the increase. The presence of

photochemical oxidant (smog) has  been  detected  on

certain hot  and  calm days in  some  parts  of  the

Island. As emissions from industries, power stations

and vehicles  continue  to  increase,  antipollution

measures will have to be enforced more  stringently.

The sulphur  content of fuel oil  will  have  to  be

reduced to  abate  sulphur  dioxide  emissions  from

industries and power stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some industries have been reluctant to comply fully

with anti-pollution measures But the long-term health

effects of  air  pollution in our  densely  populated

Island demand  that noxious emissions  be  controlled

without affecting the viability of some industries  If

air pollution is not checked early, its  effects  may

be irreversible or the remedial measures will be  too

costly in the future.

<br><br><i>Hawkers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proliferation of unlicensed hawkers has been brought

under control.  The  licensed  hawkers  in  Singapore

numbering 28,750 are sufficient at present  to  cater

for our  population. No new hawker licences  will  be

issued because there is a need to divert manpower  to

the more  productive sectors of the economy. However,

an adequate  number  of stalls in  markets  and  food

centres will  be  available for allocation  to  those

suffering genuine hardship and unable to  seek  other

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 28,750 licensed hawkers, 17,000 are already

within premises. There are still 11,750 hawkers  who

need to be resited from the streets. Yet many  vacant

stalls exist in various markets and food centres. Many

street hawkers are reluctant to move into premises and

prefer to  remain  in backlanes and  other  temporary

sites which  do not have basic amenities. Henceforth,

street hawkers  will  be required  to  accept  stalls

offered to them or cease to do business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing nominal hawker fees will be revised

upwards in  stages in view of the escalation  in  the

cost of building and maintenance of markets and  food

centres.



<br><br><i>Sewerage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of safe drinking water and modern

sanitation services in public housing has  helped  to

improve public health and the quality of life. In 1976

75% of   the  population  was  served  with   modern

sanitation compared with 52% in 1966. By the  end  of

1981 this percentage will increase to 85.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past five years $186 million have been spent

on the main sewerage system and treatment works. Over

the next  five  years a sum of $550 million  will  be

spent on further expansion.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br><i>Social Welfare</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new approach in social welfare is to place

greater emphasis on the developmental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



and preventive aspects of welfare work. Priority will

be given to the welfare of the young, the aged and the

strengthening of the family unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the delivery of social services, the Ministry

will promote greater community involvement. Voluntary

social service  organisations will be  encouraged  to

expand and  improve  their programmes  of  activities

including the provision of residential services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private and industrial establishments will be

assisted to  provide  creche facilities  for  working

mothers. The  Ministry will ensure that  creches  are

properly run  and  help  in the  development  of  new

creches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Probation Service will be

strengthened. More volunteers will be  recruited  and

trained to assist in the rehabilitation of  offenders

on probation and aftercare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Volunteer Social Service Bureau has been set up.

The Bureau  will recruit, train and deploy volunteers

for voluntary social work on a national scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residential care of children and young persons will

stress the inculcation of good citizenship  and  work

discipline. The  needy  aged  will  be  assisted   to

maintain their self-dependence within the community.



<br><br><i>Sports</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council will continue to

emphasize mass participation and the implementation of

a "Sports for all" policy. New sports facilities will

be developed under a Master Plan for sports facilities

up to  1982.  They include provisions for  30  squash

courts; 70 tennis courts; 7 swimming pools; 3 football

pitches and  2  multi-purpose  indoor  stadia.  These

projects will be constructed at an estimated  cost  of

$20.95 million  to  meet the  recreational  needs  of

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitness schemes will be implemented to encourage

more people to take up physical exercise on a regular

basis. A  National Aerobic Fitness Award  Scheme  has

been launched  to enable individuals  to  know  their

level of physical fitness. A fitness park providing 10

exercise stations along a jogging trail has been built

for joggers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



others who are interested in physical exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constituency sports participation will continue to

be implemented through a programme of  seven  popular

sports.



<br><br><i>The Fire Service</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Brigade will be prepared to meet

the task of fighting and preventing fires in high-rise

buildings. A  High-rise  Unit  has  been  formed   to

undertake regular inspections of high-rise  buildings

and to ensure that fire protection equipment installed

in the  buildings  are  maintained  in  good  order.

Officers of the Brigade are given training locally and

abroad to  upgrade their skills. Modern fire-fighting

appliances have  been  purchased  to   enhance   the

Brigade's operational efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme for full-time National Service in the

Brigade was  introduced in January  1976.  Additional

batches of National Service Firemen will be enlisted.

They will  be  posted for operational duties  at  the

various fire  stations on completion of  their  basic

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brigade will take over the Hospital Emergency

Ambulance Service  to  operate  a  unified  Emergency

Ambulance Service for the Republic. The Service  will

be equipped with a VHF communication system which will

enable the ambulances to link up with the Accident and

Emergency Centres in the hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three new fire stations will be constructed over the

next five  years  at Bedok/Changi,  Ang  Mo  Kio  and

Woodlands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Fire Service Act will be introduced to facilitate

the work  of  the  Brigade  in  protecting  life  and

property against fire.



<br><br><i>Mosque Building Programme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's policy is to reserve sites in satellite

towns for  the  building  of  mosques,  churches  and

temples. In the next five years, mosques in Toa Payoh,

Queenstown, Jurong, Woodlands and Bedok/Chai Chee will

be completed under the Mosque Building Fund Scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim in education is to strengthen moral and

civics education, to raise the effectiveness  of  the

education system. This means we have to  improve  the

teaching and the learning of languages and raise  the

standards of technical education.



<br><br><i>Moral and Civics Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral and civics education is mainly taught through

the subject  Education  For  Living  (which   is   a

combination of Civics, History and Geography)  in  the

pupils' mother tongue. The aim of the subject  is  to

inculcate social discipline and national identity  and

to imbue  in  pupils  moral and civic  values.  These

virtues are  also  fostered through  the  daily  flag

raising and  lowering ceremony, the  weekly  assembly

talks by principals and teachers and extra-curricular

activities. Greater effort will be made to ensure that

pupils imbibe the tried and tested Asian cultural  and

moral values. While pupils will learn and acquire more

and more  knowledge of science and western technology

and be proficient in the English language, they  will

be taught not to adopt the life styles and values  of

the West  that are alien and pernicious to  Singapore

society.



<br><br><i>The Education System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education system has been revised to improve its

effectiveness. Consequently the enormous  wastage  in

terms of  pupils not benefiting from the  system  and

having to leave school prematurely will be drastically

reduced. The following measures have been implemented,

and as  they  progress  they will  be  monitored  and

improved upon:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Revision of the System of Primary Education - the

abolition of automatic promotion, the reinstitution of

annual assessments and the introduction  of  the  9th

year of  primary education. By this, pupils  will  be

promoted to the next level of education only when they

are able to follow the lessons there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Introduction of the Basic Course for pupils who

cannot cope  with the Standard (i.e, the  ordinary)

Course. The Basic Course



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



will teach pupils to read and write in one language.

to do  simple arithmetic as well as to  become  good

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) lntroduction of the Junior Trainee Scheme, an

apprenticeship scheme for pupils between  16  and  18

who have  completed their Basic Course. This  Scheme

will help pupils learn a useful trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Regular evaluation and monitoring of the education

system to correct errors and remove anomalies in  the

implementation of policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Revision of the system of Secondary Education with

a view  to meeting the manpower requirement  of  the

nation and   catering   to   different   individual

interests and capabilities. The system of promotion.

retention, and the courses to be studied  by  pupils

according to  their ability, aptitude and  interest,

the combination   of   subjects,   the   relevance,

usefulness and level required of each subject in  the

curriculum are being studied and the detailed  plans

for implementation worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Development of curriculum and production of

textbooks and reading material. The aim is  to  make

school curricula  more  relevant  to  the  needs  of

society, and  to produce sufficient number  of  good

and suitable   textbooks  and   reading   material,

especially in the mother tongues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) More teachers will be trained to meet areas of

shortages. With improvement in teacher training  and

careful selection  of  recruits,   better   quality

teachers with  the right attitude  towards  teaching

will be made available to the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Provision of a wide range of trade and artisan

courses through  the Industrial Training  Board,  in

order to  meet  the needs of middle level  craftsman

and technician manpower requirements.



<br><br><i>Bilingual Education and Technical Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater emphasis will be placed on bilingual

education in  schools, namely, the teaching  and  the

learning of  the  mother tongue and English,  and  on

technical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



education. The  teaching  methods  and  the  learning

techniques of these subjects will be improved.  There

will also  be  provision  of  better  facilities  and

teaching aids to achieve better results.



<br><br><i>Other Areas of Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and expansion of tertiary education

are proceeding as planned. When fully developed, they

will be  able  to  produce the  high  level  manpower

required for  development, management in  government.

commerce and industry, and in the professions.  Adult

education continues  to  provide  a  wide  range   of

recreational and enrichment courses  besides  courses

leading to  specific qualification  examinations.  To

safeguard public    interest,   private    schools,

correspondence schools, special education schools  and

kindergartens are  now  under  better   control   and

supervision of the Ministry.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF CULTURE</b></div>



<br><br><i>Cultural Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Government policy to develop Singapore's rich

cultural heritage  derived from the  Malay,  Chinese,

Indian and western civilisations, and, through  their

cross-fertilization, to evolve  a  national  cultural

identity. The  Ministry will continue to  organise  a

wide range  of  activities  to  promote   a   better

appreciation of  our  cultural  heritage.  This  will

provide our young with the necessary cultural ballast

against the erosion of traditional norms and values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will improve its present range of

cultural activities to meet growing demands for  more

sophisticated programmes. Every encouragement will  be

given to those inclined towards artistic and creative

pursuits, with emphasis on excellence and originality.

The literary and performing arts will receive greater

attention. Apart   from   sponsoring   competitions,

exhibitions and  performances,  the  Ministry   will

provide financial and other forms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



assistance to  deserving  amateur  cultural   groups.

Cultural festivals  will be  held  to  provide  local

artistes with  more opportunities  to  display  their

skills and talents. The facilities and equipment  for

theatrical performances at both the National  Theatre

and the Victoria Theatre will be improved.



<br><br><i>Broadcasting and Television</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our radio and television services will continue to

inform, educate  and entertain.  The  production  and

choice of programmes will take into account the  need

to promote better understanding of one another in our

plural society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1978, 85 per cent of the total output on

Television, including all locally-produced programmes,

will be  in  colour. This will call for  even  higher

standards of production and presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For radio listeners, the quality of transmission

will be further improved with the installation of  new

higher-powered transmitters and the resiting  of  the

transmitting station.



<br><br><i>National Library</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registered readership of the National Library

and its branches is expected to reach one-fifth of the

total population  by  1981. To cope  with  increasing

demands, the library system will be further  expanded

by providing  additional mobile library services  and

extending opening hours. The acquisition, cataloguing

and circulation   of  library  materials   will   be

computerized.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One branch library will be opened in Katong in 1978.

Two more  are planned for Telok Blangah  and  Geylang

East. With  decentralization, the Central Library  in

Stamford Road   will  concentrate   on   specialised

reference and information services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 85, 000 volumes of books will be added each year

to the  library collection The number  and  range  of

audio-visual materials  will  also  be  substantially

increased.



<br><br><i>National Museum</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of its Art Gallery, the National

Museum has become a centre for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



local and   international  art   exhibitions.   When

completely renovated by 1979, the  Museum  will  have

more space and better facilities for the conservation

and display of exhibits and cultural properties. This

would stimulate  local  organisations  and   private

collectors to donate or loan their collections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing museum activities will be expanded to

include weekly conducted tours of the  galleries  and

loan exhibitions  for  schools  to   foster   better

appreciation of our cultural heritage.



<br><br><i>People's Association</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association will continue to play its

role in nation-building. It will draw in and encourage

more people to involve themselves in matters of public

interest and national development projects. With  half

of the  population already living in the HDB estates.

the Association will gear its programmes to promoting

greater social cohesiveness and neighbourliness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public will be encouraged to participate more

actively in community work, More volunteers  will  be

required to serve on the Management Committees.  Women

Sub-Committees and  Youth  Groups.  New  and   better

equipped community centres are necessary to cater  to

the changing  needs  of  the  population.  Ten  such

community centres  are  under  construction.  Several

others are being planned for new housing estates  and

to replace those affected by development projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to emphasise in its

programme of  activities how science  and  technology

coupled with  work  attitudes can stimulate  economic

growth.



<br><br><i>Technician Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the new $41 .8 million

Polytechnic Campus at Dover Road will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



completed by  early  1978. About 4, 000  students  are

currently attending classes at the  new  Campus.  The

final move of the complete student population of 4, 800

full-time students and 3, 800 part-time students to the

new campus  will commence in December  1977  and  the

Polytechnic will be fully housed at  the  Dover  Road

Campus by June 1978.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase of the $15 million expansion

project of  the  Ngee Ann Technical College  will  be

completed this year and the College will have  modern

up-to-date facilities for technician training  in  the

relevant fields.



<br><br><i>Science Council</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Science Council will expand its activities aimed

at stimulating an awareness of the impact of  science

and technology   on  society.  A   competition   for

vocational institute students along the lines  of  its

very popular  Science  and  Industry  Quiz  will   be

initiated this year.



<br><br><i>Science Centre</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Science Centre building was completed in October

1976 and efforts have been stepped up to  have  the

exhibits construction  programme  completed  for  the

opening of  the Centre by the end of this  year.  The

Centre will display exhibits on themes such as energy,

communication, time, evolution genetics  and  ecology

and will  have  adequate space set  aside  for  young

scientists to plan, construct and display  their  own

exhibits.



<br><br><i>Department of Scientific Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Scientific Services will take over

the functions of providing microbiological testing for

pharmaceutical products for the Ministry of Health  as

well as  the  private sector under the new  Medicines

Act, The  Department will expand its capabilities  to

provide fuller support to the Ministry of Home Affairs

in its campaign to control drug abuse.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's foreign policy, as in the past, will be

governed by   two   objectives  -strengthening   and

consolidating domestic economic progress and  security

on the  one hand and the active promotion of regional

cooperation to maximise regional peace and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as global peace and economics are concerned,

Singapore is in no position to influence  effectively

the course of world events. The principal  actors  in

this area are a handful of rich and powerful nations.

Singapore's policy  would be to  stay  out  of  their

conflicts but cooperate with them where their policies

serve our national and regional interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as regional politics is concerned, Singapore

is aware that Western influence and involvement are no

longer dominant factors. The major powers will  still

treat the region as an area of contest but except  for

Japan and  China, the other powers no  longer  regard

Southeast Asia  as crucial to their interests  as  it

once was.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless the major industrial powers are still

important to us economically and their policies  will

affect our  security for better or for  worse,  Their

investments, their markets and their  technology  are

necessary for our continued economic progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally our security and independence would be

jeopardised if,  through  unwise  and  short-sighted

policies, we unwittingly bring about the dominance  of

the region by a single great power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these new realities our foreign

policy must be flexible and sophisticated. Hard  facts

rather than wishful thinking should dictate decisions.

We cannot, in an increasingly turbulent area, predict

how events  would develop but we must be prepared  to

discard outdated policies in favour of new approaches

if circumstances demand them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that ASEAN could be a stabilising factor

and a source of strength for its members provided  we

give regional cooperation more substance than we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



done the past ten years. If we do not move faster than

we have  done so far, then events could overtake  us.

And then ASEAN might not have either the vitality  or

the collective strength to cope with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional cooperation should not merely stop at

ASEAN. New states with different social systems  have

emerged in Southeast Asia. It is vital that the  ASEAN

states should not conceive of relations between  them

and the new states in terms of confrontation for such

an approach  must  ultimately be disastrous  to  both

sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that

there are mutual suspicions and fears between some  of

the ASEAN  states and the new states. But given  time

and firm  but flexible policies we believe  that  the

existence of  different  social  systems   are   not

insuperable barriers to the development of  sound  and

mutually beneficial relations between  the  Southeast

Asian countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must believe in this because the alternative is

protracted conflict which will only open the  way  for

outside manipulation and eventual domination.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of internal security, law and order,

and the  drug menace will continue to preoccupy  this

Ministry. The  problems  are somewhat  inter-related.

Drug addicts will resort to crime to get money for their drugs.

Drugs can be used as a weapon of subversion to weaken the will

and sap the vitality of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be new approach and more comprehensive measures taken,

and better co-ordination among the enforcement agencies to deal

with the problems. Wherever possible the large pools of National Servicemen

in the Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps will be used in

implementing the measures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Internal Security</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communists will continue to be the main threat

to Singapore's internal security. They will not be able to create

widespread violence and chaos so long as unemployment and inflation

are kept in check and the Government remains efficient and uncorrupted.

They will try to build up their underground networks in Singapore and

provide logistics support to the terrorists in the Malaysian jungles.

They may try to launch sporadic acts of sabotage and violence

to shake business confidence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department will continue to seek out and

destroy communist underground organisations. It will neutralise those

whom the communists use as united front leaders. As a precaution vital

installations will continue to be guarded by National Servicemen in the

Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps.



<br><br><i>Law and Order</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical development of Singapore especially over

the last ten years has resulted in major shifts in population, new roads

and new centres of activity. For more efficient service and deployment, the boundaries of

the existing eight Police Divisions will be redrawn and two new

Divisions eventually created. By 1980 almost 75% of the population will be living in HDB estates.

Besides Queenstown and Toa Payoh Estate which already have a police

station each, other satellite towns, namely, the Jurong Town. Bedok New

Town, Ang Mo Kio Estate, Telok Blangah Estate and Woodlands Estate,

will have their own police stations. Eventually, all Special Constabulary personnel living in HDB estates

who are given patrol duties will patrol in the neighbourhood of their

homes under the Neighbourhood Policing Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial, commercial and financial development in Singapore has

changed the priorities of the Police Department in two ways. First, the

opportunities to commit fraud, criminal breach of trust and other

"white collar" crimes have increased. Such cases will be increasingly

complex. To deal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



with this new situation the Commercial Crime Branch of the CID will be

strengthened with more lawyers and accountants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, new shopping complexes, departmental stores and high-rise

office blocks and private flats mostly employ security guards.

The Police Department will take this into account when working out new

methods of policing. A Crime Prevention Branch has been established

in the CID.  Besides educating the public in crime prevention this Branch will advise

developers and managements of commercial, industrial and residential

buildings on built-in security measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads must be made safer for all road users. From the inception of the Points Demerit System on 1st March, 1975 till the end of 1976, 69 motorists have been suspended from driving and another 1 736 warned, The effect on road safety was however not satisfactory. The number of accidents involving serious injury dropped by some 8.8% in 1975 but increased slightly in 1976. The number of deaths caused by road accidents hardly declined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 69 motorists who were suspended from driving, 31 were bus drivers and 16 lorry drivers. This is because the driver of a larger vehicle knows that in any collision with a smaller vehicle, it is unlikely that he will be hurt seriously. He expects all smaller cars to give way to him. This might-is-right mentality must be reversed. With economic progress there will be more heavy vehicles of all types on the road. Owners of private cars will continue to change over to smaller cars. The law will be changed to provide for two things. First, in any collision between two vehicles of different size and weight the driver of the larger vehicle will have to prove that he is not in the wrong, i.e, a presumption which he can rebut. Second, in any fatal accident the driver who is charged in court for dangerous driving will immediately have his driving licence suspended until his trial is completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatal accidents and those leaving the victims maimed result in a loss to society especially if the victims are young. The Points Demerit System will be revised so that offences such as inconsiderate, careless and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



dangerous driving will carry more penalty points. A nationwide "Road Safety For You" Campaign will be launched in June 1977. Its aim is to remind both motorists and pedestrians of the need to observe the Highway Code.



<br><br><i>The Drug Problem </i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost 90% of those detained in 1975 for drug abuse were between 15 - 29 years old. In 1970 this age group was estimated at 582, 900 accounting for 28.1% of the population. By 1980 it is projected that this age group will have increased to 810, 000 or 33.8% of the population. The spread of the drug problem must be stopped quickly. Drug abusers and addicts must be flushed out and isolated for a sufficiently long period to prevent them from infecting others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this the Police, Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps will be used extensively to round up drug addicts. More centres will be established to rehabilitate the addicts. The Central Narcotics Bureau will concentrate on smashing the drug supply networks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it more difficult for subversives, drug traffickers and criminals to nip into and out of Singapore the Immigration Department will introduce exit control early in 1978. By that time the Marine Branch of the Police will have intensified the patrolling of the Straits of Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it is necessary to make it more difficult for subversives, drug traffickers and criminals to carry on their illegal activities in Singapore unnoticed. National Servicemen with police training will provide a good coverage of the vicinity of their home and place of employment. It is estimated that by 1980 there will be 4300 full-time National Servicemen on active duty and 6800 Reservists in the Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps. There will also be some 66, 000 part-time National Servicemen in the SC and VC. Many of them will be organised to serve as a link between the enforcement agencies and the people. In HDB estates they can serve in block committees, one to each or several blocks of flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the best of prevention there will still be criminals and prisoners. Since April 1976



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) has introduced new industries in the prisons and created new jobs for 740 prisoners. At the end of 1976, 2972 prisoners were productively engaged. The remaining 305 prisoners will be given work when the new workshops are ready.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE will next make the traditional prison industries such as laundry, furniture-making and metalwork more competitive. SCORE is planning to organise a production co-operative for discharged prisoners who cannot find jobs on their own.

<br><br><i>A Philosophy of Government</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 40 years ago, in the depths of gloom of the

last war, the British worked out their Beveridge plan,

a welfare state which will care for people from cradle

to  grave, from womb to tomb. Unfortunately it has not

led to a society where all men and women are equal  in

health  and opportunities. Indeed, they are locked  in

bitter class conflicts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, the British, who taught us that excellence

should be rewarded and honoured in order that all  can

benefit from the exceptional talents of the few,  have

now ended up by punishing the talented few, to satisfy

the doctrinal follies of the even fewer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May last year, several of my colleagues and I had

the  privilege  of  an  extensive  tour  of  China,  a

completely  different society in  which  all  men  and

women  have  to  find satisfaction in hard  work,  and

recognition,  not in material rewards, but  in  public

approbation.  China may be too austere, too  severe  a

model,  for Singaporeans. We have come to expect  many

of   the   conveniences   of   life   as   essentials.

Nevertheless,  considering the state of  our  economic

development, our workers should do well  to  remember

that China, which today has the hydrogen bomb,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



the  missiles  and the satellites, got  there  through

sheer  hard  work, often with nothing in  hundreds  of

millions   of   bare  hands  than  the   simplest   of

agricultural implements, like the shovel and the hoe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans, it cannot be a simple copying of

either  China,  the Malaysian archipelago,  or  India,

from whence most of our ancestors came. Nor can we  be

a  copy of Britain, which governed Singapore for  some

150  years,  but  as  a  colony through  an  appointed

governor, not an elected Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are different from China, the Malaysian

archipelago,  India and Britain. We are  Singaporeans.

We must seek practical solutions, solutions which will

work  in  our  context,  to  our  problems  which  are

basically Southeast Asian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, material incentives, strenuously

condemned  in  some  communist  countries   are   very

necessary  for Singapore's continued economic  growth.

And  let  us not deceive ourselves. Continued economic

growth, however slower it has become compared to  what

it  was before the oil crisis, is most necessary if we

are  to  avoid sliding back to the harsh  poverty  and

degradation  of  the years during and after  the  war,

until  recovery in the late 1950's. Indeed,  in  1965,

when  we found ourselves suddenly out all on our  own,

without  enough  land to grow food to feed  ourselves,

many  doubted  whether Singapore would  survive,  even

with   the  protection  of  British  and  Commonwealth

troops.  And in 1968, when the British announced  they

would  withdraw, nearly everyone wrote  us  off.  Even

some  of  our staunchest friends thought that the  end

was imminent and inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the people of Singapore, now a more tightly-knit

society, had the will to succeed, They supported

their  government in a national effort  to  solve  the

apparently unsolvable. Together, people and government

put  in the hard work. Imaginative policies and  tough

measures  enabled us to rise from the near-despair  of

the 1960's, to the relative security of today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have more than trebled the average earnings of

the  modal  group of workers since 1965;  we  have  in

money  terms  increased our GDP from $2.9  billion  in

1965,  by  five times, to $14.7 billion in 1976.  This

was  achieved by a generation that did not flinch from

hardship.  We put national solidarity over  and  above

differences of race, language, and culture, And  there

was  that  willingness to subordinate  the  individual

interest   to   national  interests  to  ensure   that

Singaporeans would not go down,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problems are now vastly different, The young,

with only faint memories of the anxious moments of the

crises and hardships of the last 20 years, crises  and

hardships   their  parents  and  their  elders   still

remember vividly, now take the relative prosperity  of

Singapore  as  the  norm.  This  attitude, the   high

expectations,  the desire to seek jobs in  comfortable

surroundings,  the  impatience,  indeed  the   intense

haste,  to succeed financially - they could be sources

of weakness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External economic factors have now become

unfavourable. The young may yet get their  baptism  of

the  harsh  facts of life. In 1965, after  Separation,

and 1968, when the British forces started to withdraw,

external economic factors were favourable. Our friends

and allies in the West feared for us. Because the West

still  had  strategic interests in this  part  of  the

world,  they went out of their way to help us.  Today,

they  themselves are in difficulties.  World  economic

recovery is still sluggish and uncertain. The price of

oil  is dependent on the Saudis and the Emirates, and

will  turn  on America's determination to resolve  the

problems of the Arabs and the Israelis,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programmes and policies which are set out in the

addenda spell out what the government proposes  to  do

in  the  fields of finance and economics,  social  and

medical services, education and defence. They are  all

based on this inexorable premise, that rewards must be

correlated  to  work,  and  must  correspond  to   the

contribution  one  makes to the total  national  well-being.

We believe one truth to be self-evident:  that

more and more pay for less and less work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



must  lead  to  greater  and  greater  borrowing   and

eventual bankruptcy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However difficult the going, and whatever the

surprises and setbacks, we can overcome them  provided

we  stay  alert  and  trim. The decisive  factors  are

morale  and  will.  If our people  are  determined  to

succeed, then realistic policies can be made to  work.

To  meet  unexpected contingencies, we can adjust  and

adapt our policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man does not live by bread alone. Hence we take

immense  pride  that in the past two decades  we  have

begun  the  process  of  forging  one  people  out  of

disparate  groups brought together by the accident  of

history. Disasters, floods and famines in China, India

and the archipelago around us, led to successive waves

of  migration of different peoples of different races,

different  religions and different cultures,  We  have

become  a  more integrated society than we  have  ever

been in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more, the differences between us, whether

ethnic, linguistic or cultural, are being blurred,  as

our  children  go to the same schools, regardless  of

their  parents'  wealth or status. We share  a  common

destiny. Each can keep his lifeline to his own culture

and   value   systems  through  his  mother  language.

However,  we  are enlarging the common ground  we  all

share.  All  learn not only their mother  tongue, but

also the English language in our schools, the first to

keep  our identity the second to get access to science

and   technology, and  facilitate  commerce  and  the

expansion of industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a more equal and more just society than it

has ever been in the past. This has only been achieved

because  we  have eschewed punishing  those  who  have

achieved  more  and  earned more,  because  they  have

worked  harder  or shown greater enterprise.  But  the

government  is committed to help the most needy.  They

should  never be allowed to become a permanent  burden

on  the  rest of the community. They should be  helped

through better education and health because then  they

can  be  better  themselves. We have established  high

standards  of education and health. They are  a  heavy

drain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



on our scant resources. With a more favourable

environment, we expect the less successful to have the

chance to do better, to improve themselves and to make

a greater contribution to their own well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the philosophy which underlies all policies

of the government However, it is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



spirit of the people which can ensure the success of

these policies.
