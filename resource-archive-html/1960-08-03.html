<div align="center"><b>(Total Cost)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  what  was  the  total   cost

(inclusive  of (a) materials and services  provided

by the Public Works Department, the City Council or

other Government departments, and (b) donations  of

drinks, materials, etc., from commercial firms  and

members of the public) of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Kallang Park project;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Nicoll Highway Promenade project;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Hong Lim Park project; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the orchestra and concert stage at Hong Lim Park.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> For the Kallang Park project,

materials and services provided by the Public Works

Department and the City Council amounted altogether

to   $566,265.97.  Contributions  from  the  public

included  10,000 bottles of soft drinks by  Bireley

and Company, amounting altogether to $900; 10,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



bricks  from Jurong Brickworks at $64 per thousand,

amounting  altogether to $640; 30,000  bricks  from

Nanyang  Brickworks at five cents  each,  amounting

altogether to $1,650. The total donation  from  the

public was therefore $3,190. The total cost for the

Kallang Park project was $569,455.97.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nicoll Highway Promenade project cost

$221,880 in materials and services provided by  the

Public Works Department and the City Council. There

was no contribution from the Public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Lim Park together with orchestra and

stage  cost the Government $174,913.30.  There  had

been  again no contribution from the public towards

this project.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, when the first two

projects  were  mooted,  the  public  was  made  to

understand   that  they  would  be  undertaken   by

voluntary  workers and, if that is  so,  how  could

such  a  big  amount of nearly $800,000  have  been

spent on them?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I never said that the

projects  cost $800,000. The Kallang  Park  project

cost  $569,455  and  the Nicoll  Highway  Promenade

project  cost  $221,880. That was  the  cost  which

arose  out  of materials being used for  these  two

projects.  If  we  were  to  include  the  cost  of

voluntary  labour  which was  put  into  these  two

projects,  I  would say that the ultimate  cost  of

these  two projects would have exceeded $1 million.

As  it is, the total sum for these two projects was

only about $790,000.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The answers of the Hon.

Minister for National Development are misleading.

The previous Minister for National Development -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member confine

himself to a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, is it not a fact that the

previous Minister for National Development did  say

in this House that voluntary workers were paid?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, to my re-collection, I

was  one  of the voluntary workers in that project,

and I was never paid at all.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, surely the

Hon. Minister is not going to claim that it was  as

the  result  of his voluntary work that  these  two

projects were completed. Many, many -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Cairnhill  will probably do well perhaps  to  claim

the  right to debate this matter on the adjournment

or  to file a notice of motion. He is now embarking

on  a  debate  and that course is not permitted  at

Question Time.

the  Minister  for Education, and concurrently  the

honour-able  patron of this Government-aided  Tamil

school.  Patrons  of  aided  schools  are  normally

expected to provide financial aid out of their  own

pockets and not appear generous by dispensing  with

public money.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Does the Hon. Minister imply

that  the  vote to establish, the building  of  the

first Tamil High School was not in order?

mentioned concurrent facts for the House to know.

was  not  in order. I only said that the concurrent

facts were such.

says  he  did  not  suggest it.  But  that  is  the

impression which this side of the House got.  I  am

<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill

intituled  "An Ordinance to amend the Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1955."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Now, Sir, I lay upon the Table

a  Certificate of Urgency signed by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in  respect of  the  Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are

typed  copies of the Bill available for the use  of

Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Law

(Temporary   Provisions)   Ordinance,   1955,    by

empowering  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to  make  an

order  extending the validity of a detention  order

made under the Ordinance for a period not exceeding

one  year at any one time without being restricted.

as is at present, for a maximum period of two years

in  all.  This is sought to be achieved by deleting

the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 50, which

imposes this restriction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware with the conferment of the

enlarged  powers  of  the Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions) (Amendment No. 2) Ordinance,  1959,  to

provide for the alternative of imposing supervision

orders  some  nine  months ago, the  activities  of

secret  societies  have been contained  and  secret

society  incidents have been reduced  considerably.

Nevertheless,   the  situation  requires   constant

vigilance and no effort can be spared in waging the

relentless campaign against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, some of those detained

under   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance, consisting of general headmen,  headmen,

assistant  headmen  and  hard-core  secret  society

groups  will be due for release in the near future.

The  making  of  Supervision  Orders  against  such

persons  will  not  suffice to prevent  them,  upon

their  release,  from exercising  their  pernicious

influence   over  their  followers,   and   it   is

anticipated that their release from detention  even

under  police  supervision will definitely  restore

and  refresh the ranks of their followers, so  that

it  is likely that there will be an increase in the

incidence of their vicious crimes against society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members of the House will agree with me

that  the  danger to society of releasing a  fairly

large number of high-ranking secret society members

suddenly  without  having  undergone  any  form  of

rehabilitation  is  very real indeed.  In  fact,  I

might inform Members of the House that some of  the

leaders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



of  the  present  kidnapping gangs  were  convicted

prisoners  who  have  been released  only  recently

without undergoing any form of rehabilitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in seeking to increase the powers

of  detention of these criminal elements  is  fully

conscious  of  the  fact  that  mere  detention  of

criminal gangsters without any attempt to reeducate

and  rehabilitate them is a negative  and  wasteful

approach to the problem. The Government is  of  the

view   that  detention  should  not  be  purely   a

preventive  measure  of keeping hardcore  criminals

away  from society, but also that detention  should

be  a  rehabilitative process with  the  object  of

converting  the  criminal  detainees  into   useful

members of the society. It is with this end in view

that  the Government has recently launched a scheme

for  the  re-education and rehabilitation of  these

criminal  detainees at Pulau Senang. Obviously,  no

one  can forecast how long it takes to rehabilitate

each individual. Some may respond more quickly than

others, while some may take a longer period. If the

Pulau  Senang rehabilitation scheme is to have  its

full  effect,  the  period  of  detention  of   any

criminal  must  not  be restricted  to  a  definite

period. For this reason the ad-hoc committee  which

drew up the Pulau Senang scheme recommended that an

amendment   should   be  made   in   the   existing

legislation  to  enable the  Minister  to  make  an

indeterminate detention order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government has no wish to see any

criminal  detainees remaining  one  day  longer  in

detention  than  is  necessary.  Accordingly,   the

Government intends in the next few days to  appoint

a  Review  and  Rehabilitation Committee  to  begin

reviewing  the cases of detainees at Pulau  Senang,

with  the view to recommending their early release.

At  the  same  time the Government is  also  making

arrangements to offer gainful employment  to  those

reformed criminal detainees, so that when they  are

released,  they can start life anew without  having

to fall back on their old ways.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, with the powers conferred by the

amendment,   two  objectives  are  sought   to   be

achieved;   namely  (1)  the  negative  object   of

preventing  the  in-crease  of  violent  crimes  by

keeping   hard-core  criminal  gangsters   out   of

circulation  for a longer period of time;  and  (2)

the  constructive object of equipping them  through

work  and  re-education during  the  rehabilitative

process  towards  becoming  loyal  and  law-abiding

members of the community capable of wanting to earn

an  honest and productive livelihood and who  above

all  will  not  consider that  resort  to  violence

provides an alternative means of livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

in  his  speech  just now said that the  Government

proposed to appoint a committee to review the cases

of the detainees at Pulau Senang. Does he mean that

the  Review  Committee will only  review  cases  of

those who are now detained in Pulau Senang and will

not  review cases of those who are detained outside

Pulau  Senang;  and  if  it  is  so,  what  is  the

percentage  of  detainees that are  at  present  in

Pulau Senang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

committee  will  review the cases of  all  criminal

detainees,  but those who have been sent  to  Pulau

Senang  will  receive its first attention.  By  the

criminal detainees in Pulau Senang.

<div align="center"><h4>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S SPEECH</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing

in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech

of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express  our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on

behalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the

present session of this Assembly.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this formal resolution to thank the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his Address to this Assembly, we

put on debate our record of 14 months of office and

I also hope, in so far as it is possible, to survey

objectively  the future that we are likely  to  run

into, in this second session of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year of office of' this Government is

a  decisive one. For if construction and  expansion

do  not  begin in the second year, they are  hardly

likely to start in the third or fourth year of  the

Government's  office. And the question  before  the

country  and the Government is this. Will there  be

continued    stable   conditions   for   industrial

expansion   and   an  effective  Government   whose

declared policies can be relied upon? Or will there

be  growing  agitation, ferment,  unrest,  talk  of

reopening  constitutional discussions for immediate

independence  with  consequent  inability  of   the

Government  to  maintain stability,  no  expansion,

either  economic or industrial, to  take  place  to

meet  the growing unemployment and the con-comitant

social    problems   that   failure   to    resolve

unemployment must bring?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my duty to give an objective and

dispassionate  review  of  the  past  year  and   a

forecast  of  the  trends  and  tendencies  in  the

immediate future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the forces at work in the past

year  discloses that there are no new factors which

have entered the political arena to bedevil us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



or  to  rescue  us  from the perennial  intractable

political and economic problems. Against the P.A.P.

and  what it stands for - an independent, democratic,

non-Communist Malaya - there is only one organisation

to  contend  with  us,  to  challenge  the  present

Government in a bid for ultimate power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right-wing forces, such as they are,

represented by the Liberal-Socialists,  the  S.P.A.

and  whatever  new Parties that may  register  from

time to time, are inert and ineffective. And it was

with  some  sadness that I read the notice  of  the

feeble  amendments to this motion  that  have  been

tabled  by  the Members for Tanglin and Joo  Chiat.

After 14 months in which crucial issues facing  the

survival  of  the democratic system in Malaya  have

been  intensely  debated,  all  that  the  official

Opposition in this Assembly can do is to  think  of

the   restoration   of   paycuts,   worries   about

kidnapping and the re-employment of civil  servants

who  have  left the Government service prematurely.

These  are the world-shaking events which  comprise

the  horizon  of  our  official Opposition - eloquent

testimony  of  their  purblind  approach   to   our

problems.   For  they  can  only  see   peace   and

prosperity in relation to the restoration of  their

little  social  world  which envelops  their  whole

being.   They  refuse  to  see - perhaps   they   are

incapable  of  seeing - the  bigger  problems   which

confront us, problems which go to the very root  of

the survival of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any drama there must be comic relief. And

the  former  S.P.A. Member for Joo Chiat,  breaking

his  14 months' self-imposed penance of silence  on

the  subjects of kidnapping of towkays and the  re-employment   of   Government  officers   who   have

prematurely resigned, they qualify him for an Oscar

as the parliamentary jester of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is improper - perhaps the

Prime  Minister  will  agree with  me - to  call  any

Member  of  the  Assembly a  jester,  let  alone  a

parliamentary  jester. Perhaps  he  would  like  to

withdraw the expression.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would have thought that

jesters  once  upon  a time occupied  a  very  high

status in the royal court, and we can do no greater

honour  to the Member for Joo Chiat than to  bestow

upon  him a role which is so very essential in very

hard  and  trying times. However, if you feel,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that one should be constantly serious

and  no comic relief should be allowed, then may  I

say  I  not only withdraw the word "jester"  but  I

also withdraw the word "parliamentary"?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I allowed the Prime Minister

to  carry on, but of course the withdrawal must  be

unqualified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, when I ventured on that

light-hearted  vein, it is not to say  that  we  on

this side of the House disregard the unhappiness of

rich  families and their unfortunate heads who from

time  to  time are held to ransom, nor do we  as  a

Government  shirk  our  responsibility  to  prevent

these  kidnappings. But to put up  these  secondary

issues  when  the primary question of  survival  is

staring  us in the face, is an example of political

myopia  which has only been equaled by  the  Member

for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that by dismissing the Right-wing in this light-hearted manner, it is not to say

there  are no Right-wing forces in Singapore. Apart

from  the  British  whose  extensive  economic  and

military  interests not only in  Singapore  but  in

this  whole  region are obvious,  there  are  local

adherents of the K.M.T. and a whole host  of  other

reactionary diehards who would stop at  nothing  to

bring the present Government down in the hope  that

they  could go back to the good old days to exploit

the  country  for  their benefit.  We  had  defined

"subversion" and defined it before the elections to

make  it  an issue of confidence and made it  quite

clear  what  we meant by that term - that whether  it

comes  from  the  Right  or  from  the  Left,   any

subordination  of the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore  to  outside interests,  we  consider  an

undermining of the authority and integrity of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



State, and we shall resist. Extremism, either  from

the Right or from the Left, will have to be smacked

down good and hard. If we allow one, acute reaction

on  the  other side is inevitable. Our duty  is  to

squash both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened in the last 14 months? Have we,

as  a  Government, stood up to our responsibilities

and  the test of power? Has this Government  proved

itself adequate to meet the stresses and strains of

an internally self-governing State with an Internal

Security Council, with foreign affairs and  defence

out of its hands?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year the momentum of the P.A.P. after

its  massive  victory  in the  last  elections  was

stupendous.  There were exuberance and  zeal  which

took  a  lot of tempering. Minor mistakes of haste,

born out of impatience to put the world right, were

committed. They were errors, not of the rashness or

wisdom of the policy to be implemented, but of  the

intemperate  haste which resulted  in  insufficient

preparation and the carrying of the opinion of  the

people,  which  could have been done  by  prolonged

consultation and public discussion. It is also true

that  power  accentuated the weaknesses  latent  in

some   of   the   individuals  in   the   political

leadership.    The   emotional    immaturity    and

instability  of  certain  individuals  caused  more

trouble  than had been anticipated. The process  of

rectification,  which  started  some  three  months

after  the Party came into power, had to go  on  to

its logical conclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Communist sympathisers and activists,

who  had scattered and gone under cover before  the

last  elections, began the work of  regrouping  and

reorganisation. Over the last 14 months, a build-up

of  their  ground  strength through  ground  cadres

working on the workers has been taking place in the

trade union movement. These pro-C.P. activists have

worked  hard to secure the support of the rank  and

file.   The  Government  is  realistic  enough   to

acknowledge that there must be a certain amount  of

free play on the ground, provided the authority  of

the State is never challenged, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



leadership of the trade union movement remains non-Communist, as it must be in a non-Communist  State.

And, despite the regrouping and reorganisation,  it

is  quite clear that the absence of tension and the

absence   of  deep  and  abiding  grievances   have

prevented  a  mass  unrest  and  hysteria  and  the

tendency  to  man barricades. There is literally  a

dearth  of issues upon which to bait the Government

and  work  up  feelings of antipathy and  hostility

from the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any test, the P.A.P. Government is admitted to

be  a  progressive  government with  a  small  "p".

Therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  denounce  it  as

reactionary.  By no stretch of the imagination  can

it  be  said to be anti-worker or an enemy  of  the

people.  But,  of  course,  being  a  non-Communist

government, although it is progressive, it is  said

by  the  pro-C.P. orthodoxists that the  Government

consists  of waverers (the traditional  concept  of

the bourgeois revolutionary in Marx's term), always

stopping short of ultimate revolution, compromising

with the enemy, selling out on the long-term rights

and  interests  of  the people to  the  reactionary

colonialist  imperialists of the  British,  or  the

reactionary feudalists of the Federation. These are

the terms and the language of the doctrinaire. As I

see  it,  the  danger is not that the  P.A.P. will

deviate  from its declared policy, but  that  these

Left-wing  adventurers, unable  to  manipulate  the

P.A.P. to  abandon  its non-Communist  principles,

will  begin  a  fight with a government  which,  by

their own admission, is progressive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the events arising out of the

expulsion  of  the  Member for Hong  Lim  from  the

P.A.P. provide us with a wealth of material  as  to

the  thinking  and the tactics of  these  Left-wing

adventurers.   Once  the  P.A.P. discovered   the

weaknesses  of  its  individual  adherents  in  the

political  leadership, it had either to rectify  or

to  go  down as a result of, these weaknesses.  And

rectification   started   not   with   the   recent

expulsions, but with the immediate systematic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



conscribing of the capacity for harm together  with

the  putting right of what had been done wrong. The

opportunist   elements  within   the   Party   were

contained and conscribed. In an open society  where

no  secret  disappearances can take  place,  it  is

inevitable   that  rectification   would   have   a

temporary  unsettling effect.  When  criticism  and

rectification   of  those  individuals   were   not

successful,  then  suspension  and  expulsion   was

inevitable.  And  it  also  provided  us  with, a

demonstration in miniature of the forces  that  are

against  us.  The whole business of suspension  and

expulsion  was allowed to run its full  course,  so

that the full extent of the weak points within  the

Party, and the threats from without the Party,  can

be  brought into the open and clearly seen.  Within

and  around  the Party, it was a test of  loyalties

demonstrated  on  an occasion of  a  minor  crisis,

amply  giving proof of the loyalty or otherwise  of

those  who  subscribe to the P.A.P. The  weaknesses

within the Party will have to be rectified and  the

challenge from outside will have to be met. What is

worthy of note is that there has been no change  in

the  basic  forces at work. But it  did  bring  out

vividly  in  a  controlled  test  the  tactics  and

policies  of  those  who,  for  want  of  a  better

description, we have called Left-wing adventurers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify the' distinction that we make

between  the  Communist Party and  these  Left-wing

adventurers. The policy of the Communist Party,  so

far   as   we  can  decipher  from  their  declared

statements issued both here and abroad, is to unite

with all progressive forces, of which the P.A.P. is

acknowledged as one, to struggle against the forces

of   reaction  viz,  colonialism,  imperialism  and

feudalism.  But  because  the  Communist  Party  is

proscribed and inhibited, its followers and  cadres

lack  positive  leadership; they lack  an  official

line set out with the speed which an open party can

give  to its followers. Therefore, the policies  of

such  an underground organisation have to be freely

interpreted in any given situation on the basis  of

broad  general principles laid down  by  the  Party

beforehand.  And the less adept of these  followers

who want to out-left



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



the  Left and take on battles before they are ready

for  them,  we term "Left-wing adventurers".  Their

acrobatics, in trying to exploit the Ong  Eng  Guan

affair,  is  an  object  lesson  to  us  of   their

recklessness and shortsightedness, and  interesting

enough to merit study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Left-wing adventurers all agreed that the

Member  for  Hong Lim was a political  opportunist.

But they all supported -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

must  realise that he is treading on very thin ice,

because there is a Standing Order which says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose."



<br><br>So  if  the  Prime Minister wishes to develop  that

theme,  in  other  words,,  go  into  the  personal

conduct  of the Member for Hong Lim, then  he  must

file notice of a substantive motion. Beyond that he

cannot go.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have not the slightest

intention,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  to  dwell  on  the

subject  of  the  Member for Hong Lim.  As  I  have

indicated  earlier  in  my  opening,  what  we  are

interested  in is not the Member for Hong  Lim  but

the  tactics  of certain Left-wing adventurers.  We

have  nothing to do with the Member for  Hong  Lim.

All  I was doing was to recount their practice. All

those who have followed the newspapers in the  last

few weeks, including you, Mr Speaker, will bear me

out,  I think, when I say that I am only recounting

what  they  said  and the issues  upon  which  they

wished  to take up the cudgels with the Government.

What   they  said,  quite  simply,  is  that   they

dismissed  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim,  but   they

supported the so-called 16 resolutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is important. What they are admitting

is  that it is true that the man who proposed these

resolutions was in their opinion unworthy, but they

wanted   to  support  the  worthiness  of  the   16

resolutions  which they said contained  progressive

material.  In other words, they were all in  favour

of trying to fish in P.A.P. troubled waters - what we

have  often  demonstrated in  the  past  to  be  an

extremely unprofitable profession. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



man,  whom they detested and despised to the  point

of  conspiring to oust him in August 1957, they now

find  a  useful lever for pushing the  P.A.P. into

what  they  hope  would  be a  more  malleable  and

plastic  position.  They hold  up  their  hands  in

horror,  and  say that the P.A.P. is  going  Right.

They must stiffen it and make it go more Left. They

must  make  it resist the forces of reaction,  i.e.

the  colonialists, imperialists and feudalists, and

respond  `to the forces of progress, that is,  pro-C.P. forces.  In  a  time  of  relatively   minor

difficulties in the Party, they hoped  to  trip  up

the  Party into submission in the name of unity  of

the progressive forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me restate the P.A.P.'s position. We stand

for  what we believe in. And if we have not got the

strength, ability or skill to carry the mass of the

people with us on our principles and policies, then

we  deserve  to  fail.  There  is  no  need  to  be

"rescued" by self-appointed mass leaders.  Whatever

our  weaknesses, lack of courage of our convictions

is  not  one, nor do we lack understanding  of  the

techniques  of  these Left-wing  adventurers.  Were

they  really interested in the 16 resolutions? Were

they  interested in 5 of those resolutions  turning

upon the internal cadre organisation of the P.A.P.,

designed to prevent the party from being controlled

other  than by those who are loyal to the long-term

aims and objectives of the party? Did they want  to

be  cadre members of the P.A.P. when they supported

5  out of those 16 resolutions? And since when  did

they  decide  that  tobacco and petrol  taxes  were

unsocialist  moves?  And the Betting  Bill.  Nobody

passed  any resolution or sent any memorandum  from

the First to the Third Reading of the Bill and then

not until after the P.A.P. conference. Let them  be

honest. They were only interested in a few of these

resolutions-resolutions  designed  to  appeal   for

support  of  these  Left-wing  adventurers.  Reopen

talks  with  the  British. For what?  Independence?

Nobody in his senses believes that Singapore alone,

in  isolation,  can  be independent.  In  the  same

breath,  another  resolution, talks  of  re-opening

talks   with   the   Federation  for   merger   and

independence. What is it to be? Independence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



through  talks with the Federation for  merger,  or

independence for Singapore alone through talks with

the British? This issue was fought out with similar

Left-wing adventurers in 1957 when the P.A.P. went

to  the Tanjong Pagar by-elections. The issue  then

was,  and  still it seems now is, independence  for

Singapore  by  itself  as  a  practical,   feasible

political  objective, or independence for Singapore

only   through  merger  with  a  larger  entity - the

Federation  of  Malaya -  from whom its  water  supply

comes  and  on whose hinterland Singapore's  trade,

commerce and industry depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems for these pro-C.P. forces

during the past year has been the absence of issues

which  would  agitate and excite  their  followers.

They  could not, when they supported the  so-called

16   resolutions,  have  put  much  faith  on   the

practicability of independence for Singapore alone.

All  they  were  concerned with was  to  find  some

slogans to keep their supporters excited, something

on  which  to get tensions to mount, to  create  an

atmosphere  of  uncertainty in which no  industrial

expansion  will  take place, so that  economic  and

social  conditions will deteriorate  and  therefore

their  forces  of  recklessness will  increase  and

strengthen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for good measure, there were two other

issues - release  all  political  detainees  arrested

before  the P.A.P. came into power. The P.A.P. had

already decided on this principle and has made  its

stand  clear,  both in public and in  the  Internal

Security Council. But of course they claim that the

P.A.P. bourgeois revolutionary party was weak  and

vacillating, yielding to the forces of reaction  in

the Internal Security Council! And the cancellation

of  the  registration of the federation  which  the

Government  had  registered but had  de-registered,

again because the Government, so they claimed,  was

either weak in the face of reactionary strength, or

leaning to the Right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were contradictions between the Left-wing

government of Singapore, and the British  and  what

the'  Federation Government itself calls  a  Right-wing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



government of the Federation, contradictions  which

we  must normally expect Communists to exploit, but

many  of  these contradictions they did not exploit

because  it would have redounded to the  credit  of

the  P.A.P. Let me give a small illustration but  a

vivid one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that the P.A.P. Government is

going  to stand or fall on its policy of industrial

peace  with justice, to secure industrial expansion

to  resolve the economic problems. And  it  is  the

business  of a non-Communist government to  explore

all  avenues  and  all  channels  conceivable,  for

assistance and economic aid to resolve our economic

problems.  And  do they not know,  these  Left-wing

adventurers from reading the newspapers, that  even

the   presence  of  a  Russian  delegation  to   an

E.C.A.F.E.  Conference in Singapore on  small-scale

industries was viewed with suspicion and disfavour?

Are  they unaware from Press reports that even  the

giving  of  a  residence  visa  for  more  than   a

transitory  visit  to a Russian representative  had

caused  excitement  and  brought  opposition?   The

British  interests in Singapore  are  obvious.  The

Federation has to ensure that Communist activity in

the   Federation  is  not  aided  from   bases   in

Singapore.  One would have thought that intelligent

Communists  would have found this a good  united  front  issue.  But  on the contrary  the  Left-wing

adventurers kept silent. They only chose to exploit

the  issues  which are of no benefit to the  P.A.P.

but of benefit only to their pro-C.P. forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pose the contradictions between the P.A.P.

and  the  pro-C.P. forces. I say pro-C.P. advisedly

because the M.C.P. is underground and is unable  to

evince its collective will itself, and there is  no

way  of  preventing  several  different  lines   of

various  pro-C.P. groups, all being issued  in  the

name  of the C.P. The P.A.P. is a progressive force

and  will  remain one - a force for change towards  a

more equal and just society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three possible situations in which we

can find ourselves as a Party. First, where what is

good  for the people and for the P.A.P. may be  bad

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



the  Communists.  Secondly, what is  good  for  the

people  and  the P.A.P. may also be  good  for  the

Communists. And third, what is bad for  the  people

and the P.A.P. may be good for the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases, we are prepared to proceed

according  to  the dictates of our  interests,  our

conscience and our judgment. Whether it is bad  for

the  C.P. or good for the C.P. is irrelevant.  The

P.A.P.  Government is prepared  to  carry  out  all

policies which are for the benefit of the aims  and

objectives which the P.A.P. stands for,  and  which

the  people  voted for. But it is not  prepared  to

fight  for, nor is it going to carry out  policies,

which  are bad for the P.A.P. but are good for  the

Communists.  To try and coerce the  P.A.P. into  a

united  front on the third of these premises  is  a

futile and fruitless business which will aggravate,

exacerbate  and stiffen the attitude of the  P.A.P.

We  are  not  going  to  promise  independence  for

Singapore  for the immediate future, first  because

we  believe  it is a fraud on the people  to  claim

that  Singapore can be independent alone, not  only

because it is not viable, but because it can be  so

easily  captured and destroyed. Have they forgotten

that some 80,000 British troops had to surrender in

Singapore  10  days  after  the  Japanese  captured

Singapore's  water supply situated  in  Johore?  Do

they  believe  that an island with 1� million  souls

but  with no natural resources, can be independent?

We  credit them with intelligence and therefore  we

believe that they can see these facts as well as we

can. And the conclusion we can come to is that they

are  deliberately  arousing false expectations  and

hopes in the people and in their supporters for the

selfish purpose of creating excitement and tension,

and  an  atmosphere  of what  they  hope  would  be

uncertainty upon which the growth of their strength

depends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to restate in simple language for

the  benefit of the Opposition, both in this  House

and,  equally important, outside this House,  that

the  policies of the P.A.P. were evolved out of its

own  experience of struggle under local conditions,

not  out of doctrinaire principles. And it has been

successful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



up  to  date and will continue to be successful  so

long  as  it adheres not to doctrinaire principles,

in   complete   disregard  of   local   facts   and

conditions,  but to the principles evolved  in  the

context of the Malayan revolutionary situation.  We

believe   in   an  independent,  democratic,   non-communist,   socialist   Malaya.   What   is    the

alternative for all Left-wing forces in Malaya?  To

this   affirmation  of  our  faith,  does   anybody

seriously stand up to say that they believe in  the

establishment  of  an independent Communist  Soviet

Republic  of Malaya? In the context of the  present

situation, do they hope to carry with them the mass

of  the  Muslim  Malays, the English-educated,  the

Indian-educated?  Surely  all  have  conceded  that

there can be no Communist Singapore until there  is

a  Communist  Malaya and there can be no  Communist

Malays  unless the Malays are sufficiently softened

from neighbouring countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must ask the House to forgive me for having

taken  so much of its time on what would appear  to

be  a theoretical dissertation of the inter-play of

political  forces in Singapore. But it  is  because

what  I  have discussed are the factors  that  will

decide  whether Singapore ticks for better  or  for

worse  that  I  have  spent time  discussing  these

factors. I am sorry that after 14 months of  P.A.P.

Government  the  English  language  newspapers  are

still allowed to confuse and delude the public. The

irony  of it is that basically anti-Communist local

journalists,    through    European    imperialist,

colonialist    newspapers - they   are    long-winded

hyphened words, but they are terms of art and  have

certain  marks with circles, and I have sought  .to

use  these  terms advisedly - these journalists  have

helped  to build up confusion in the minds  of  the

people.   All  this  talk  of  absolute  democratic

rights, laissez-faire liberalism, freedom and human

rights,  in the face of the stark realities  of  an

underground  struggle for power, can  only  confuse

the English-educated world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that we are confronted with is not a

simple  one  of  allowing absolute  liberalism  and

democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



rights  to prevail, but of exerting that amount  of

restriction on absolute rights so that a reasonably

tolerant  democratic  society  can  endure  without

turning  or  yielding to a totalitarian  state.  In

other   words,  the  government  can,   and   where

necessary must, restrict the rights of individuals,

but  if  it does so to a point where it,  in  fact,

makes the whole system a totalitarian society, then

the  purpose  of  the restriction would  have  been

negated.   These  restrictions  are  only  bearable

because without them a more intolerant system would

triumph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech to this Assembly the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has listed out in detail the things

that  will  be  done for the people in  the  coming

year.   They  include  mundane  things  as   roads,

footpaths,   drains,  sanitation  and  stand-pipes.

Since  the  integration  of  the  organs  of  local

government  with  those of the  Ministries  of  the

central  Government, all these things  have  become

the  concern of this Assembly. These are the things

which intimately concern the people and their daily

lives. It is right that a government that seeks  to

improve  the  lives  of the vast  majority  of  its

people - the workers and the farmers - should spend  so

much  time  and  effort  and  money  to  make   the

administration  respond to these  social  problems.

After  14 months we can say that the organs of  the

State   of   Singapore  are  well  maintained   and

functioning with a reasonable degree of sensitivity

to the problems of the people. But we have to admit

that  a  lot  of ground has still to be covered  in

making the administration more alert, and equal  to

the  political  challenge we are confronted  with - a

challenge  of  rapid change, rapid progress,  rapid

improvement   which  the  political   ferment   and

revolution  in Asia has aroused in the  hearts  and

minds of its peoples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chances of success in our struggle

to achieve these objectives - changes of the economic

basis of our livelihood and the social structure of

our population through the democratic process? What

kind  of  political weather are we in for?  Running

the risk of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



weather  forecasters  to be  proved  wrong  in  the

event,  I  would  still  go  on  to  say  that  the

indications are that we will have reasonably decent

weather  with fair periods, wet patches and  sudden

squalls. It is the sudden squalls that we  must  be

careful of. For the worst that can happen - and it is

important  that we remember this - is the failure  of

this little experiment in the democratic process of

one  man one vote to bring some improvement in  the

lot  of the people. If we are unable to face  these

sudden  squalls,  then we shall go  under  and  the

experiment will have to be restarted all over again

on some other occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is useful if we can put these things in

perspective, in terms of the ultimate, of the worst

and  the best, that is possible. What is the  worst

that can happen in the immediate future for us as a

Government?  It  is  that the Government  may  find

itself out-manoeuvred and out-propagandaed by these

Left-wing  adventurers, in which  case  the  P.A.P.

will have to take the count in this fight, and  the

Communists  will be counted out for many  years  to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not unaware that with the Communists on

one  side of us and the British colonialists on the

other, each side will want to pull us to its  side.

We  are also aware that failing this, each of these

two  contending extremes are quite prepared to  use

us  as  buffers in their machinations against  each

other.  The British want to preserve their economic

and  military interests in Singapore  and  in  this

whole   region   for  as  long  as  possible.   The

Communists  want  to  set up a Soviet  Republic  of

Malaya. To them let me say this: we are fully alive

to the realities of this political situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the business of a government to govern, and

whilst  we  are the Government we must ensure  that

this  Government's  authority prevails  within  the

limits  of  its jurisdiction. But it  is  also  the

business  of  the Government to ensure  that  if  a

collision has to take place between these Left-wing

adventurers  and the colonialist imperialists,  the

P.A.P. should let them break their heads



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



on  each other. For we are confident that whatever

the temporary maneuverings and ups and downs, we as

a  non-C. P. socialist force have a historic  role'

to play in the political struggle of Malaya in this

crucial  stage  of  our history.  Our  duty  is  to

preserve the integrity and effectiveness of our non-Communist  socialist movement, not to  be  used  in

other peoples' plots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best that we must strive for is to succeed in

settling the economic and political problems of the

people and succeed in maintaining industrial  peace

with  justice  to  the workers,  whilst  industrial

expansion takes place to alleviate the unemployment

problem  and  create optimistic prospects  for  the

years   beyond  1964.  The  economic   and   social

conditions of poverty and distress must be  removed

by  the  efforts of the people and the  Government.

There must be enough success to ensure a reasonable

equilibrium for peace and prosperity in this  phase

of our struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise that in a speech made by the Hon. Prime Minister

recently,   there  was  one  point   raised   which

attracted  my attention. If I am not mistaken,  Mr

Speaker, it can be said that in the debate  on  the

previous  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Address,  I  was

severely  criticised.  But, today,  it  seems  that

there   are  more  dangerous  elements   than   the

accusations levelled against me as a communalist. I

do   not  and  cannot  for  a  moment  accept  that

statement,  either  today or  at  any  other  time.

Whether in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

in  the present session or in the elucidations made

by   the   Prime   Minister  on  a   self-governing

Singapore, I am of the opinion that the major issue

is  not  on  domestic  problems.  Since  the  Prime

Minister,  who holds the reins of Government,  does

not  wish to achieve independence for Singapore,  I

will  extend  my hand to him if he is  prepared  to

change his attitude to that of anti-Communist,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



so  that  we could save the people of Singapore  in

particular,  and Malaya as a whole. These  are  the

findings  of  the  political organisation  which  I

represent.  My  findings  may  be  wrong  and   the

findings of the Prime Minister may be right.  Today

we  call  our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan  Yew  or

"Lee  Hsien  Sheng",  but if he  really  wishes  to

struggle  to prevent a Soviet Republic  from  being

established in Malaya, then we hope that he may  be

conferred a title by the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to praise the Member for Cairnhill,

but  what  I can see today posing as a major  issue

are  the  Communists or Communist sympathisers  and

their  followers in Singapore. The  Prime  Minister

said  that  only if the Malays were  weak  and  the

position  of the surrounding territories  was  weak

would   the  whole  of  the  neighbouring  islands,

including Malaya, become a Communist State.  But  I

am  fully confident that this would not come about,

Mr Speaker, and I would not mind being accused  of

being communal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malays founded Singapore and not Sir Stamford

Raffles. I would like to stress that my great-great-grandfathers founded Singapore. Whether Mr Speaker

or other Members of the Assembly believe it or not,

I  am  taking  this opportunity today  to  have  it

recorded in the history of Singapore that I do  not

admit  or accept Sir Stamford Raffles as being  the

founder   of   Singapore.  We  are   fighting   the

colonialists and we consider the Prime Minister  as

one   who  has  buried  colonialism  in  Singapore.

Therefore,   Mr   Speaker,  I   am   taking   this

opportunity  today  to  stress  that  history  will

reveal  that  in our struggle, be it in  any  form,

including the political struggle, we must  bear  in

mind that Singapore was founded by the Malays, and,

as  the  indigenous people, we ask that our special

rights be preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malay history, Mr Speaker, there is mention

of this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sang Nila Utama accompanied by his Ministers and

people, went hunting and many game was found.  They

passed a deer which Sang Nila Utama chased. It  was

later  killed  by  His Majesty's spear.  Sang  Nila

Utama



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



went to a rock and looked out to the horizon. He

found  that  the shore across the sea  was  very

fair and white. He was told that the mainland on

the   horizon  which  he  could  see  was  named

"Temasek".  He then commanded `Let  us  go  over

there.'  Whilst  at sea, there  was  a  terrific

storm,  and  he could only reach Telok  Blangah.

All  the luggage was thrown overboard except the

crown.  But  still the storm raged on  and  Sang

Nila  Utama then finally ordered that the  crown

should also be jettisoned, as he felt that  this

act  would abate the fury of the storm  so  that

the  boat  would remain afloat. After the  crown

had been jettisoned, the storm abated. The party

proceeded  and then finally landed on the  shore

where  they found people playing by the  seaside

at the mouth of the River Temasek."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member knows the

Standing  Order  which says  that  a  Member  is

entitled  to  read extracts from  documents  and

books.  I think the passage which is being  read

is more than an extract. Perhaps the hon. Member

can cut it short.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> I will remember that point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Only extracts will be permitted

in future.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): My apologies to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I will cut my speech

short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The party saw a red animal with a black head

and  a white breast. It was slightly bigger than

a   goat.  Sang  Nila  Utama  was  told  by  his

followers  (among  whom was Demang  Lebar  Daun)

that  the animal was called "Singa" (lion). Sang

Nila Utama ordered his party to return to Bentan

with  a message saying that he was not returning

but that he was founding a state."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the

party  in  power sitting on the Government  side

that  the Malays are described as the indigenous

people of Singapore in the Constitution.  It  is

mentioned  in the speech by the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara that the Malays will be given aid, and  I

hope that it will be implemented in the light of

the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of the

special position of the Malays, as long as there

are  U.M.N.O. representatives  sitting  in  the

Opposition, it follows that we will not agree on

all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



points  submitted by Government as  regards  the

implementation  of  what  is  contained  in  the

Constitution,  as we do not wish to  be  branded

politically  that  U.M.N.O. (Singapore)  is  not

fighting for what it should be fighting  for  in

the interest of the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the introduction of the

speech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  it  is

stated - to  cut it short - that it is not  easy  to

establish a socialist State quickly and  that  a

fully  developed socialist economy could not  be

achieved as long as Singapore is separated  from

the  Federation. As I have said earlier on,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we know that the  Federation  of

Malaya  has faced militant Communism since  1948

and that the shooting war between the people who

love democracy and militant Communism came to an

end  on  31st  July,  1960. We  are  aware  that

thousands of lives and property were lost in the

Federation.  Perhaps  the  Minister   for   Home

Affairs here could enlighten us as to the  true

state' of affairs: how many Communist agents are

there in Singapore? Why I ask this, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is that from the speech made by the  Prime

Minister, it would appear to me that this is not

only a problem for the P.A.P. to face alone, but

it  is also a problem which should be considered

by  all  Members  of  this Assembly.  There  are

people  who have been expelled from that  Party.

There  are  genuine Socialists,  Communists  and

Rightists in the P.A.P., but we do not know  how

many  of these elements there are in this  Party

or  in  Singapore. However, if it is  true  that

such  elements  do  exist, then  the  Government

should  take  the opportunity to eliminate  them

once  and  for  all, as they  have  always  been

saying  that they want to create a non-Communist

Singapore, so that Singapore can then merge with

the  Federation. This is a fact  and  we  cannot

deny it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, we come to the social

conditions that exist today. If I were to  speak

on this subject, I might be accused of agitating

communalism;  but I am able to speak  factually.

Every help and encouragement should be given  to

the Malays so that they will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



the pioneers in the achievement of a merger between

Singapore   and  the  Federation.  I   have   every

confidence  that  only  the  Malays  or  the  Malay

leaders   in  Singapore  could  plead  with   their

brothers in the Federation to accept Singapore as a

unit of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we go any further, Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are  many  responsibilities which we must  shoulder

together. Is it sufficient only to build houses for

the Malays in the Malay settlements? In my opinion,

they should be helped in the matter of education. I

do  not  know the programme that have been launched

by  the  Ministry of Education. But  I  have  heard

rumours - I  do  not know how far they are  true - that

from this month onwards the Malays will be exempted

from paying any school fees in Singapore. I do  not

know  whether  that is true, but it is  up  to  the

Minister  for  Education to enlighten  me  on  this

point. Why is it not possible to give such help  to

the  Malays?  We  do not want independence  if  the

Malays  in  Singapore cannot be free in  their  own

thoughts.  Give this opportunity to the  Malays  so

that  they will be able to compete with their  non-Malay  friends  on  equal terms  in  the  field  of

employment,  and so on. But we do not  wish  to  be

spoon-fed  forever. We wish to  stand  on  our  own

feet. However, such opportunities were not given to

us  during the past 14 months and we ask that  they

be  given  to  us.  I hope that this  will  receive

serious consideration by the Ministry concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer to my speech on education made

earlier.  Apart from giving exemption from  payment

of school fees to Malay pupils, if the past British

government  could  do this,  why  is  it  that  the

representatives  of  the people's  government,  who

were  elected  by  the  people,  and  who  went  to

Whitehall -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the hon.

Member. He seems to be so taken up with the subject

that  I  think he is speaking much too loudly,  and

either  my ear drums will go or other persons'  ear

drums  will  go.  It  will be  much  better  if  he

modulates his voice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologize, Mr Speaker, Sir. But these are my views and I hope

that  the  Government will give us the opportunity.

We will not ask for anything else outside except in

this    Assembly.   There   may    be    a    wrong

interpretation - that if we are unsuccessful in  this

Assembly,  we will use force. But I would  like  to

emphasise that whatever we ask for should be given,

or  we  are  obliged to withdraw,  so  that  a  new

Constitution could be promulgated in Singapore.  If

the  British  government, I again emphasise,  could

help the Malays who were considered fit only to  be

peons  or  policemen, then I hope  this  government

will continue to render assistance to the Malays in

the  form  of  free textbooks and other  facilities

which are vital for the improvement of the standard

of education of the Malays in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point to which I would

like  to  draw  the attention of the  Minister  for

Education  is  that we, the Malays,  cannot  accept

Communism. We need moral education. It has been our

custom,  as is known, to incline towards  religion.

While  talking  on the subject of schools,  I  hope

that  religious education could be  taught  to  all

pupils,  especially Malays who embrace  the  Muslim

religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I will go on to the Ministry of

Home  Affairs.  I  would like to get  clarification

from  the Minister, and I hope that he will fulfill

my  request. Could he give a guarantee to  take  on

Malays  as constables possessing Std. VII education

from  a  Malay  school? If not, I  will  very  much

regret  it, and it seems that there is no guarantee

of  a  future for leavers from these lower  schools

and  they are fit only to be labourers who  at  the

present moment are difficult to get. Mr Speaker, I

would  also  like to ask whether or not all  vacant

posts  in  the  Police Force or in  any  department

under  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  have  been

filled.  How  is promotion given to them!  I  would

like  to  ask  further about the  position  of  the

members  of  the Guard and Escort Unit.  Have  they

been given equal treatment with other members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



the Police Force? I believe that provision has been

made  in the Budget for fair treatment to be  given

to members of the Guard and Escort Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point, Mr Speaker, is that concerning

relations  with Indonesia. Mention is made  in  the

Hansard  of  20th July, 1960, that  relations  with

Indonesia  have  been on a much better  level.  Mr

Speaker,  what  kind  of  friendly  relations  with

Indonesia  have been maintained by the  Government?

The  matters that are of benefit to our people have

been   omitted  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech. Is this cordial relationship connected with

newspaper  reports  concerning  the  visit  of  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National   Development  to   Indonesia   to   study

education  methods in Indonesia? I have read  these

reports  but cannot find anything that will improve

the  standard  of education in Singapore.  I  would

like  clarification on this matter. Or is  it  that

the visit was made purely to sound the views of the

Indonesian  Government  as  to  whether  the  Malay

language could be made the official language  which

could  be  used  at  all  levels?  Or  whether  the

Indonesian Government will give au assurance in the

way of trade between Indonesia and Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, mention is also made on rural development. In this matter, I would like `to

receive  clarification from  the  Government.  Many

standpipes  have been installed by the  Government.

The   building  of  roads  and  bridges   and   the

installation  of telephones, and so  on  have  also

been  done  by the Government. These projects  have

been implemented during the past 14 months, but one

thing that astounds me is this, Mr Speaker. I  did

send  a request to the former Minister for National

Development, the Member for Hong Lim, when  he  was

in  charge  of the Ministry, concerning  mosquitoes

breeding  in  stagnant water in the  drains  in  my

constituency.  My request was met-workers  went  to

the  area  and cleared it of mosquitoes. But  since

then  I  regret to say that the kampong  folks  are

very  angry  with  me  as  the  representative  `of

Kampong Kembangan. I told them that I had already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



written letters to the Government, and that it  was

now  left  to them to rectify the state of affairs.

If  the Member for Hong Lim, as the former Minister

for  National  Development, could undertake  to  do

this,  why could the present Minister not do  this?

If I am telling a lie, please send a delegate and I

am  prepared to accompany him and his party to  the

site.  The mosquitoes breed in the stagnant  water.

Mr  Speaker, I do not wish to elaborate  on  small

points  like this. This, in short, depends  on  the

Ministry concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to talk further on the many standpipes installed in my area. The

population there is dense, and consists not only of

Malays  but  also  of Chinese. In  this  particular

place, I am realty sorry to see that the Malays and

Chinese  drink well water; and there are plenty  of

empty  tins  lying around and mosquitoes  breed  in

them.  In  Teo  Kim Eng Road, there  is  no  public

standpipe   installed  there,  and   I   hope   the

Government  will help me. If they do  not  wish  to

help  me  as  an Opposition Member, at  least  they

should help the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I believe the hon. Member

will take some time?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case I will suspend this

sitting. I will take this Chair again at half-past

five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, there is another point to which I should like to draw the

attention  of the Government. This is the  question

of the rural areas - our request for particular areas

or  general areas. I do not wish to give credit  to

the  Member  for  Hong Lim, but  I  would  like  to

emphasise that at one time I did appeal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



to  him for the cemetery grounds, in Teyban  to  be

made  use  of  by  lorries,  and  my  request   was

fulfilled satisfactorily and without delay. I  hope

the  difficulties  in  the  rural  areas  could  be

resolved  in  the interest of the population  as  a

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns the

amenities in the rural areas. Having regard to  the

Government programme to make roads in the kampongs,

I  sent in my request to the authorities concerned,

stating  that the kampong people were  prepared  to

cooperate with the Government if they were provided

with  materials, earth and other equipment to  make

roads in the rural areas. However, I regret to  say

that  up  to  today there are still  roads  in  the

constituency which I represent - and I would like  to

mention a particular road, Jalan Lapang, which is a

major  road - which are flooded whenever it rains.  I

would like to bring home to the Government the fact

that  it  is important not to treat the  people  of

Singapore as being second-class citizens or  first-class    citizens.   Rural   amenities   are    the

responsibility  of  the Government.  Such  problems

could  be  overcome.  From the  point  of  view  of

expenditure,  the  money spent on  Hong  Lim  Green

could  be  better used for the development  of  the

rural areas. I do not know whether this is a tactic

or  manoeuvre  with  regard to personalities.  This

will be judged by the masses. I urge the Government

to  develop the rural areas in the interest of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has said that in its rural programme, the farms especially the Malay

farms,   are   considered  private  property,   and

therefore the Government does not wish to waste its

money  on  helping to improve the living conditions

of  the  people in that area. However, the previous

Government opened up roads and made improvements to

the  rural  areas, in spite of the fact  that  they

were  considered private property. But the  present

Government, I know, has made newspaper releases  to

the  effect  that it is private property  and  that

nothing  could be done about it. I cannot see  why,

if   the   previous  Government  under  the  Rendel

Constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>





could  undertake  this job, the present  Government

elected  by the people could not undertake the  job

in the interest of the people. Is it because of the

shortage  of  money? As I have said earlier,  money

saved,  for instance, on the Hong Lim Green project

could  be  usefully utilized in the development  of

the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big problem, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

subject  of the national language which appears  in

col. 19 of the Hansard dated 20th July, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In implementing the policy of Malay as the

National  Language,  the task of  the  Ministry  of

Education  has been to provide training  facilities

for  the  teaching  of  the language  in  non-Malay

schools."



<br><br>In   this  matter,  Mr  Speaker,  I  merely   seek

clarification   again   because   I   am   not    a

constitutional lawyer. What I know is that  in  the

Federation   of  Malaya  the  Malay   language   is

acknowledged   as   the   national   and   official

language - the  sole national language - after  it  has

been   written   into  the  Constitution   of   the

Federation  of Malaya. In Singapore  today  is  the

Malay  language - the  national language - official  or

not?  Will  the  Government table a  Bill  in  this

Assembly  so that Malay will become officially  the

national language, or do we have to go back to  the

Colonial Office and have them accept Malay  as  the

national  language? From many points of view,  this

will  not be a satisfactory answer to the political

organisation which I represent. So I hope it  could

be  clarified whether the Malay language, which  is

acknowledged  as  the national language,  could  be

considered as an official language according to the

rules of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of language is a

very  big one and the responsibility facing  us  is

heavy.  I,  for  one,  do not say  that  the  Malay

language  cannot  become the national  language  as

well  as  the official language to be used  at  all

levels,  although  there are certain  quarters  who

maintain  that  not  only  must  Malay  become  the

national and official language but that it must  be

implemented forthwith as the national and  official

language.  The Government has failed to state  when

Malay  could  become the official  language.  Hence

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



poses  a question. This should be made clear to  us

so that we could give our support, and it will also

be  a  source  of  inspiration to  people  who  are

interested in promoting the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, there is this

matter  of culture. I hope the Minister for Culture

will   clarify  the  appeal  forwarded   by   Malay

organisations  and  which appeared  in  the  Berita

Harian. This is to make Malay culture the basis  of

a  Malayan  culture. I refer to the issue  of  30th

July  of the Berita Harian. The news item says that

the  permanent Malay Literary Congress of Singapore

has  been asked to implement a resolution taken  by

the  25 youth associations which held a meeting  on

the  17th  July at the Geylang Community Centre.  I

would add, Mr Speaker, that this resolution reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Conference calls upon the Congress to

hold  a  delegates conference of all Malay cultural

bodies   to  discuss  the  implementation  of   the

struggle  of this permanent Congress in the  matter

of making Malay as the base of a national culture."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the appeal has been submitted by the non-political cultural and arts bodies to see

whether  their  proposal could be accepted  by  the

Government  in  its  attempt to evolve  a  national

culture,  but until today we have not received  any

confirmation from the Government that Malay culture

will  be made the basis of a national culture.  Mr

Speaker, on the question of culture, perhaps  there

are  many Members in this Assembly who are experts.

Will  this  proposal have the support of those  who

are responding to Malay culture, Chinese culture or

any  other  culture, and can the demand that  Malay

culture be made the basis of a national culture  be

accepted as logical? I am not surprised at all if I

am  accused of being illogical and out of place  by

bringing   this  matter  up,  because   the   Malay

population  represents only 13  per  cent  of  the

total  population.  Would it be  possible  for  the

culture of a small percentage of the population  to

be  made  the  basis  of  a national  culture?  Mr

Speaker,  if  the Government could  accept  such  a

suggestion,   then,   although   there    may    be

difficulties, ways and means could be devised of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



overcoming  them. I am not coercing the  Government

to accept this suggestion, but by encouraging Malay

culture - whether it is accepted as  a  basis  for  a

Malayan culture or otherwise - we would then not only

look  after  the special privileges of  the  Malays

provided for in the Constitution, but it would also

be  a method whereby we could demonstrate and prove

our loyalty to the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the people of Singapore could accept

the  contents of the Constitution of the Federation

of Malaya. So today, Mr Speaker, as one who at one

time opposed and fought against colonialism, I hope

I  will  not be a stumbling block towards Singapore

attaining  independence. We have to choose  between

Communism and British colonialism. It depends  upon

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that the speech of the Prime Minister of

Singapore  has  revealed that  he  is  prepared  to

continue  the fight against pro-Communist elements;

but  I  ask  once again, why is he not prepared  to

continue to fight for an anti-Communist policy,  if

we  are to resolve the problem of independence  for

Singapore? It is a fact that today `the  island  of

Singapore  has  become a front.  Whether  it  is  a

Communist  or a colonial front depends on  us,  the

indigenous  people, whether they  comprise  Malays,

Chinese, Indians, Eurasians or others. Why must  we

be  afraid  of pro-Communist or Communist elements,

or be afraid of the British colonialists or British

Army  which we find in Singapore? We are not afraid

of  arms  that are in the possession of  the  Army.

Singapore'   was   handed  over  to   the   British

Government by Sir Stamford Raffles by a  stroke  of

the pen. And it is up to us to declare war on them,

particularly the colonialists, by means of pen  and

paper.  It is not difficult for us to resolve  this

problem  if we are bold enough to come forward  and

declare  our  stand. I am sure that  if  today  the

People's Action Party could be courageous enough to

declare  its anti-Communist policy, then  it  would

get  the support of the Malay organisation  that  I

represent.  Regardless of what party it represents,

whether  it  is going to be a coalition  government

after 1964, the Government of the day must face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



difficulties. It is a fact that nobody can  fulfill

the needs of the whole population of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know whether trade will increase, but

the  problem is, how are we going to meet the needs

of   the   people?  I  can  say  that  the  present

Government cannot meet the needs of the  people  of

Singapore  100  per cent. The Prime  Minister  said

just  now  that 80,000 British and Indian  soldiers

surrendered to the Japanese army after the Japanese

had  captured  the  reservoir in  Johore.  This  is

tangible   proof  to  us  that  if  we  know   that

conditions  in Singapore at present are  difficult,

then  why are we hesitating to use one method which

will get the blessing of the Federation `of Malaya?

Mr Speaker, the Federation of Malaya, I would like

to   say,  looks  upon  Singapore  with  suspicion,

because  the  number of Malays here as compared  to

the  Chinese  are  very few. If Singapore  and  the

Federation  are united and they have this  one  man

one vote, then the Federation of Malaya will become

a republic and its constitution changed. We will be

loyal and faithful to our motherland and we will be

prepared  to defend her in any way. Let  us  today,

when  we  know that militant Communism is  not  yet

finished  in the Federation of Malaya, declare  our

stand.  Whether this is right or wrong,  the  Prime

Minister  alone  knows. I do not know  whether  the

Communists receive aid from Singapore,  but  it  is

our responsibility to see that they do not. How are

we  going  to create a new peaceful and  prosperous

nation  if  we  are ideologically opposed  to  each

other?  So, Mr Speaker, I sincerely hope that  the

Government will overcome these dangerous  elements.

Whether these elements are dangerous or not  it  is

left  to the people to assess. It is hoped  that  a

more  intensive campaign will be launched  to  kill

the Communist elements or their supporters and that

together  we  will eliminate Communist elements  in

Singapore.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I  am  here to support  fully  the  Prime

Minister's motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



of  thanks to the Yang di.Pertuan Negara  for

his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member on the opposite side made a

very  lengthy  speech containing many  accusations.

Afterwards  my  colleagues  here  will  give  clear

replies to the accusations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reply to some of the accusations

regarding the rural area levelled by him.  We  know

that in Singapore the rural area is larger than the

City  area. Because of this, care of the rural area

is  especially difficult. The former Government did

not  take  good care of the rural area.  Since  the

P.A.P. has only come into power for a short period

of over one year, it is impossible for it to take a

100  per  cent good care of the rural area. Whether

the  P.A.P.,  since it came into power,  has  taken

care of the rural area, it is a question which  the

people  of Singapore can clearly answer.  The  fact

has  been observed by the people of Singapore  with

open eyes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kampong Kembangan area which the hon. Member

mentioned is near the City area and is so small, so

the  work involved there may not be entirely as  he

has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Member for the Jurong constituency which

is  quite  big in area. Some of the people  in  the

remote parts of `that area have to walk one or  two

trifles  to get to the nearest standpipe. Owing  to

past  negligence,  care is not well  given  at  the

present  moment. It is not that we do not  want  to

give  care.  First  of all, we  must  consider  the

finances  of  the  State. If the  State's  finances

permit,  we  will  do our best. I  believe  that  a

responsible Government has to look after a  lot  of

matters,  not  just  a few, and  there  will  arise

various problems. We have the faith and the ability

to  overcome  some of those problems  in  the  near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding other problems, my colleagues will give

more exhaustive and clear answers.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it is right and proper

for this Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



to  give  its thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

for his speech on the opening day of this session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that has been stated by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  will  surely bring about a  realisation  to

every  stratum of the people of Singapore regarding

their livelihood or their education. What I mean is

that  the  people of Singapore, although comprising

various  origins,  have come to  realise  that  the

Government  has been able to bring about  unity  in

the  field of education, as stated in column 20  of

the Hansard (Volume 13, No. 1).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past various schools

were proud of the opportunities given to them,  but

now they realise that the advantages enjoyed before

cannot  hold good any more, because the  Government

has  given  equal status to all the four  media  of

education, from primary school to secondary  school

and  then  to  university level.  Furthermore,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  when  pupils  study  in  the   same

building  and  play together, the realisation  will

naturally  come  about that they  are  Malayans.  I

believe that the unification of these schools  will

be further carried out in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has stated that

there  are  rumours that free education  is  to  be

given  to  Malay children in Singapore.  I  do  not

understand,  Mr Speaker, Sir, why the hon.  Member

is still unable to follow what has been achieved by

the  Government.  It is possible  that  he  has  no

children  of  his own and is therefore ignorant  of

the  steps  which have already been  taken  by  the

Government  in giving free education. Even  if  the

hon. Member does have children, he, in his capacity

as  a  representative of the people, should realise

that  the  Government has taken steps to give  free

education   to   the  children.  As  regards   free

education to Malay children, Mr Speaker, Sir, this

matter  was widely publicised in the papers on  6th

February, 1960 stating that all children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



born  in  Singapore or whose parents are  Singapore

citizens  attending Government or  Government-aided

schools   will   be  given  free   education.   The

newspapers  have published this fact; so  also  has

the  radio  announced that free education  will  be

given  as  from  the month of February.  I  do  not

understand,  therefore, why the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan,   representing   the   people   of   his

constituency, cannot follow what has  already  been

announced by the Government. The P.A.P. Government is

unlike  the  former Government which merely  stated

things  but  did  not  carry them  out.  When  this

Government says something, it will carry it out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards free textbooks, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

equally  surprised  that  the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan cannot follow what has been stated by the

Government - that free textbooks will be given to the

children.  In column 406 of the Hansard  dated  2nd

March,  1960,  the  Minister for Education  gave  a

reply to a question raised by an hon. Member,  that

the total allocation for free textbooks for 1960 is

$150,000 and that the allocation for Malay children

is  double  that for non-Malay children. Therefore,

this  means,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that  if  non-Malay

children  are  allocated $300, then Malay  children

are allocated $600, which is double that figure. It

is  clear, therefore, that free textbooks have been

given  to  all  strata of the Malay  population  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also succeeded in giving free

education  to  over-aged  children.  Just  as  free

education   is   given  from  primary   school   to

university level, likewise Malay children who  have

passed the Higher School Certificate Examination in

the  past  year are now' attending the  University.

Perhaps the Member for Kampong Kembangan is unaware

of  this,  because his own child has  not  attained

that  status  yet, but I believe that  children  in

secondary   schools  are  given   free   education.

Likewise,  Malay students attending the  University

are given assistance to get free education.

<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on 1st July, 1959, His Excellency Sir William

Goode   read  the  first  policy  speech   of   the

Government.  That speech, Sir, was so full  of  the

bravado  of  a cowboy thriller that we all  enjoyed

it.   The   observers,  the  Opposition   and   the

Government  all enjoyed it, although at  times  the

Opposition  had to wince at some of the unfair  but

nevertheless  fierce  accusations  and  attacks  in

language which cannot be deemed to be very  polite.

But on the whole we enjoyed the bravado part of it,

especially when it shouted out empty promises like:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government is pledged to make an all-out

effort  to ease the housing problem. The Government

will increase the annual output of houses built  by

the S.I.T."



<br><br>It  condemned the previous Government for  building

only - according  to  them - 2,000  units  a  year  and

pledged to increase the output. Then what did  they

do?  The S.I.T. hibernated for one whole year  and,

waking  up  on 20th July, 1960, rubbing its  sleepy

eyes, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people were aware what they could and could

not  expect of a P.A.P. Government. It was that the

Government would operate under a constitution which

did  not  give it complete freedom and independence

of   political  action.  It  was  emphasised   that

Singapore  was  a  small island,  with  no  natural

resources  and dependent upon a sensitive  entrepot

trade for its livelihood."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> From Hansard?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes, from Hansard of 20th

July, 1960, column 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an insult to the electorate. The

Government is under - estimating the intelligence  of

the public if it thinks that the public is going to

be  so  gullible as to swallow such a lame  excuse.

Does  the  Government really think that the  public

does not know that Singapore was as small an island

for the previous Government as it is for the P.A.P.

Government?  That  it  had less  freedom  and  less

independence of political action? And that  it  had

less natural resources and was as much dependent on

entrepot  trade for its livelihood as it is  today?

Can  the  Government deny this, Sir? How  come  the

previous Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



was  able, during its first year of office, to have

the   S.I.T. build  2,907  completed   flats   and

completed dwelling-houses; and on the whole,  under

that  Government in the first year, 6,734 permanent

buildings were altogether built? Sir, we heard this

morning that the S.I.T. under the P.A.P. Government

only completed 124.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next paragraph, Sir, the Government boasts

of never making promises that it cannot fulfill. It

comes from the same Hansard, column 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...P.A.P. had no intention of deceiving the people

into  voting  for  it with promises  it  could  not

fulfill."



Is  the building of 124 houses in its first year of

office  as against 6,734 permanent dwellings  built

during  the  first year of office of  the  previous

government a fulfilment of the promise to ease  the

housing  problem? Is it fulfilling the  promise  to

increase the annual output of houses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 1, col. 11,

Government  pledged to "make an all-out  effort  to

ease the housing problem." If 124 houses a year are

the  maximum result of "an all-out effort"  of  the

P.A.P. Government, do you not think, Sir, it may be

time  for  them to fold-up their tents  before  the

housing problem becomes a chronic disease?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claim that their plans are not

over-ambitious, but are realistic. If they are, why

were  they unable to implement them? Not  only  did

the  building projects prove to be still-born,  but

the education plans have thrown the whole education

system  into  a chaotic mess. At this time  of  the

year,  Sir, teachers are moved from one  school  to

another  like  pawns  on  a  chessboard.  Only  two

primary  schools  were built;  none  completed.  No

secondary  or  technical schools  were  built.  The

previous government, in their first year of office,

started  building 30 schools; completed  9,  and  7

were  in  an  advanced stage of  construction.  The

standard  of education has deteriorated  miserably,

as  proved  by  the poor results of  the  Cambridge

Examination  last  year. Now, there  are  talks  of

lowering the standard in the University of  Malaya.

Sir I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



to  read  to  you the impression of  one  "M.B.B.S.

(Malaya)."  He said, in the Straits Times  of  23rd

July, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, some doctors whose alma mater is the

local medical school are very worried that if  this

state  of  affairs  continues the  General  Medical

Council  may withdraw recognition of local  medical

degrees as so many departments are understaffed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living on' our old reputation, that is

all. It is time we woke up to this grim reality."



<br><br>Sir,  I  am  no doctor; neither do I know  anything

about  this. When I read this, I felt that if there

was  any  truth in it, then it would be  a  serious

state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrangement for teaching of the various

vernacular  languages in schools is gaily  muddling

along.  Something  must  be  done  to  prevent  the

successes  of  the  past becoming undone.  Hansard,

Vol. 13, No. 1, col. 5 says this Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"cannot permit itself the luxury of changing

with every puff of wind."



<br><br>But  the Government has changed its aims and policy

with every puff of wind, Sir. When the P.A.P. first

came  into power, the civil servants were described

by  the  Hon. the  Prime Minister as  devitalised,

emasculated and deculturised. And when I  stood  up

here and defended them in my Adjournment speech,  I

was  mocked  by  the Government. Then,  one  bright

morning about a week later, with one puff of  wind,

the  civil  servants  were changed  by  the  P.A.P.

Government  from being an emasculated, deculturised

and devitalised lot into the best civil service  in

the  Far  East. Another puff of wind seems to  have

blown the P.A.P. Government from the masses to  the

pawnbrokers. And another puff of wind blew in about

45  amendments to the Trade Unions Bill on the  day

after it was presented in this House. Something has

gone wrong somewhere, Sir, if the Government is  to

be swayed like this with every puff of wind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies governing youth clubs and community

centres  were changed so often that civil  servants

were  unable  to get any activity in the  community

centres   until  quite  recently.  This   lull   of

inactivity, I understand in many cases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



has driven away the original or old members who, in

some  cases, have been replaced by gangsters. There

have   been  instances  of  P.A.P.  Assemblymen

complaining that these youth centres have been used

by  the  gangsters as their dens. The  Ministry  of

National Development, needless to say, has been the

most  successful half-way house and  transit  camp,

where no policy ever remains for long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's inconsistency, Sir, creates this

question in the minds of the public - was the  P.A.P.

Government born under an inconsistent star, or  are

they  cooking  in a pressurised cooker?  After  the

bravado  in  last  year's speech, Sir,  the  public

expected  to  hear the Government crow  about  the

fulfilment of last year's promises in the speech of

His  Excellency  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  this

year. But there was no crowing, because cocks  only

crow  when  there is daylight. And  daylight  never

came. It never came from the time the P.A.P. came

into  power.  We have been living in 13  months  of

darkness, and are still living in darkness. So  the

cock  never crowed. Instead, the Government had  to

humiliate  itself  into giving nonsensical  excuses

such as "Singapore is a small island". Sir, we need

no  Minister to tell us that. Surely we  all  learn

that in school, The Government's misdeeds, such  as

the  slashing of the salaries of the civil servants

without  notice - believed by many to be a punishment

to   them  because  they  did  not  vote  for   the

P.A.P. - the  victimisation of people, especially  of

civil servants, who hold views different from those

held  by the P.A.P.; the waging of war against  the

English-educated for some time; the  steamrollering

of Bills in this House without giving the public or

the  Opposition an opportunity to study them: these

are so blatantly obvious, Sir, that the Government

has  been  forced  to admit them in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech and  to  promise  not  to

commit the same offences again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public would have forgiven the Government for

their  past  sins  had they been sincere  in  their

apology  and promise. But, instead of any signs  of

sincerity, Government tried to repeat their attempt

to mislead the public. In,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



Hansard  of 20th July, 1960, col. 5, line  10,  the

Government  very  proudly declared that  "Singapore

has   enjoyed   greater  political   and   economic

stability  that  it has known during  the  last  15

years."  The Opposition challenges the statement - we

maintain  ,that  this  statement  is  a  deliberate

attempt  to mislead the public. Government is  well

aware  that  there has neither been  political  nor

economic  stability in Singapore  since  they  came

into  power.  Even the collective leadership  which

they  boasted  has now splintered  officially  into

two, perhaps virtually three, groups. The expulsion

of three Members has not remedied the situation. It

is  easy  to dismiss from their minds the existence

of three Members whom they wish to forget. But, may

I  remind  the Government, Sir, and ask them:  what

about  the  10,000  odd people  who  supported  the

expelled  Members  at  the Badminton  Stadium  last

month?  How many thousands more might support  them

if  Government gave them permission to hold a rally

at  Hong  Lim? Can they just dismiss them all  from

memory  and  pretend they do not exist,  and  shout

out,   "We   are  enjoying  political   stability!"

Moreover, according to the Government, the split is

40 against 3. If there is any truth in the speeches

of the P.A.P. Assemblymen and Branch leaders at the

Badminton Stadium last month, then the ratio of  40

against  3  may  not last for long.  Can  there  be

political stability, Sir? I do not know whether the

Ministers  themselves  can  assure  us   how   many

Backbenchers  are really and truly  with  them,  or

whether  they are ruling supreme. Perhaps time  can

tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State of Singapore has become so unsafe, Sir,

that  millionaires  had  to  be  warned  to  employ

bodyguards,  and school-children had  to  be  given

anti-kidnap drill. A Judge admitted in  Court  that

crime has become a national past-time in Singapore,

and  one  of the leaders in the Straits Times  said

that  hardly  a day passed without a serious  crime

being  committed in Singapore. This,  Sir,  is  the

"stability"  that Singapore is enjoying  under  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the economic stability that Singapore is

enjoying under the Government, it comprises capital

flying  away from Singapore. This has been admitted

by Government several times. Of course, they blamed

the Opposition and said that it was because of what

they  called  our  stupid  utterances  at  election

campaigns  that  had  been  responsible  for  this.

Nevertheless, capital has flown away. They admitted

it.  Factories  and  firms are  closing  down,  Big

commercial  firms have moved their headquarters  to

Kuala   Lumpur.   Building  projects   are   at   a

standstill,  and small businesses are  folding  up.

Taxis are plying round and round without any fare.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Maybe the Opposition went for joy

rides!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Unemployment is increasing

at  an accelerating speed to the big figure that we

heard  this morning. This is the P.A.P. pattern  of

economic stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Hansard of 20th July, 1960, col. 5 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the first time in the Island's history the

interests  of  the  masses have been  more  closely

linked  with the purposes of Government. The  sense

of  oppression,  humiliation and  resentment  which

people  experienced under colonial rule has  slowly

given  way to feelings of national pride and  self-confidence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would humbly suggest, Sir, that it might have

depicted  a truer picture if it had been  corrected

to read like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the first time in the Island's history the

interests   of  the  masses  have  been  deplorably

neglected   by   the  Government.  The   sense   of

oppression,  humiliation and resentment  which  has

been  created by the P.A.P. Government  has  slowly

given   way   to   feelings   of   insecurity   and

frustration."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claimed that they were "setting

the  course for the year of construction". All that

we have seen in the steps that they have taken were

to  get  rid  of  the experts and specialists  from

several Government departments. And, continuing, it

seems  "the  Government does not wish to  give  the

impression  that there have not been  mistakes  and

shortcomings during the past year."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



How  could they, Sir? The mistakes and shortcomings

were so blatantly obvious. It claimed that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is aware that some of its measures should

have  been  more  carefully  planned  and  expertly

executed. In some instances, it moved too fast  and

without preparing public opinion adequately for the

changes,  Some  of  the  legislation  resulted   in

inconveniences  or  misunderstandings  which  could

have  been  avoided by a little more  foresight,  a

little  more consultation, discussion and a  little

more explanation."



<br><br>Sir,  if they were aware of this, then why did they

mock   and   insult  us,  and  even  threaten   the

Opposition when the Opposition tried to point  this

out  to them some time ago? You will remember, Sir,

that on two occasions you had to intervene when the

Hon, the Prime Minister attempted to threaten  the

Member  for  Tanglin. The Government say  that  the

errors  arose from the zeal and impatience  to  get

things  done. May I suggest that in some  cases,  I

believe  they  were  the result  of  vengeance  and

victimization too? Government now promise to temper

zeal with understanding. Let us hope that they will

keep their promise this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same Hansard, Sir, of this year, the

paragraph  on  Finance stated  that  "there  was  a

deficit  looming  on the horizon" - talking  of  last

year.  This  is one of the false alarms with  which

the  P.A.P. Government has been trying to  frighten

the  people. They hoped that by so doing they could

lay   the   blame   of  all  their   failures   and

shortcomings  on the previous Government.  This  is

not  a  straight  deal with the  public,  Sir.  The

P.A.P. is aware that the Budgets for the last  few

years have shown a deficit but have ended up with a

surplus. But the P.A.P. Government prefers  to  use

the  deficit  shown  in last year's  Budget  as  an

excuse  to  slash  the salaries of  the  Government

servants. This slash, Sir, has to a certain  extent

been   responsible   for   the   present   economic

depression  in  Singapore, while the Federation  is

enjoying a boom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government believe that there has been

considerable uncertainty as to the stability of the

political  foundation of the State, and this,  they

say, has led to hesitation on the part of potential

investors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



I  can assure you, Sir, that potential investors do

not  hesitate any more. They have gone into  action

now.  They  have  flown from this country.  Malaya,

says  Government, "then looked upon the  events  in

Singapore with some reservation." Are we sure, Sir,

that  Malaya is not still looking upon us with some

reservation?  If  not,  then  why  did  the   Prime

Minister  have  to say over a radio programme,  and

again this morning I believe, that merger will  not

take place in the immediate foreseeable future?  It

is because he realises that Malaya is still looking

upon  us  with  some  reservation.  The  Government

boasted  that  the  "far-sighted  policies  of  the

Government announced last year were firmly  carried

out  and in 12 short months we have seen a complete

reversal   of  position."  The  only  reversal   of

position  that  the public has seen,  Sir,  is  the

reversal of the economic stability of the past into

the  present economic depression; the living in the

freedom  of the past into the living of the  terror

of  today; the atmosphere of friendliness into  the

atmosphere of suspicion and hate of today. We  have

now,  I  am afraid almost gone back to life  during

the  Japanese  Occupation. The Government  declared

that: "The atmosphere of uncertainty and hesitation

in  the field of private investment was replaced by

a  climate of confidence." May I ask, Sir, how much

of  the capital that has flown away has come  back?

And if any has come back, why are we having so many

unemployed?  Government  gave  as  proof  of   this

climate  of  confidence the substantial  volume  of

private   investment  now  seeking  permission   to

operate in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in last year's Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 1,

column 7, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government has in the few brief weeks of

office received numerous enquiries from foreign and

local  firms  who want to' set up new factories  in

Singapore."



<br><br>And  now  they are still wanting, and I  hope  they

will  not  be  still in the wanting stage  by  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government promises the extension of economic

services,   such  as  power,  water,  gas   supply,

construction of roads, improvement to the port  and

airport  and  the Singapore river,  enlargement  of

telecommunications facilities, provision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



industrial   sites  and  so  forth,  as   well   as

investment in the social services, the main item of

which will be housing. As I have said before,  Sir,

last  year they promised to make an all-out  effort

to ease the housing problem, and all that they have

built were 124 houses compared with 6,734 built  in

1955, the first year of the previous Government. If

this  promise  is  as  bottomless  as  last  year's

promise,  I am sure the public will lose confidence

in Government,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government also warned that they would exercise

strict  economy in annually recurrent  expenditure.

The  last  time these words were uttered, Sir,  the

civil   servants   suffered  a   slash   in   their

allowances,  I am sure they will be very  happy  if

the  Government will assure them that this  is  not

another such warning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the factors which generate

confidence and stimulate industrial expansion  must

be  a  firm and stable government whose policy  and

actions  are  consistent and  predictable.  Another

precious   philosophy  of   the   P.A.P.!   It   is

incredible,  Sir,  that  they  are  known  as   the

People's Action Party, and yet I do not find  their

philosophy being put into action, For example, they

say  that Government policy must be consistent  and

predictable. And yet while preaching against yellow

culture,   they  encourage  gambling;  and   whilst

telling millionaires to have bodyguards because  of

the  danger of frequent kidnappings today,  in  the

same  breath they say that times are so much better

that they are going to withdraw small firearms from

the  people.  Then  while the  civil  servants  are

suffering  from  pay cuts and the public  from  the

shortage  of schools, hospitals, teachers, doctors,

nurses;   over   50,000  people   are   unemployed;

thousands  are living in the slums; and  while  the

State  of  Singapore  is experiencing  an  economic

depression;  and  whilst crime and  kidnapping  are

rampant,  the Government is concentrating  on  such

frivolous  projects  as  amusement  and  recreation

parks  at Kallang and Hong Lim, and on a first-rate

theatre to compete with Rome and a first-class bowl

to  compete  with  Hollywood, and the  Aneka  Ragam

Ra'ayat to entertain the hungry. Sir, are we having

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



group  of responsible people as our rulers, or  are

we  having a group of pleasure-seeking playboys  as

our   new  rulers?  How  can  we  hope  to  attract

investors  with  such  a  frivolous  programme   of

activity? It is Government's belief that a  further

important  factor  is  the  stability  in   labour-employer relationship. It is our belief, Sir,  that

this  cannot  be  achieved by Government-controlled

trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Government continues to promise "to avoid

taking any action that will damage our trade." Sir,

we  are  afraid that this action has  already  been

taken.  Trade  has already receded to  an  alarming

extent  in  Singapore.  There  has  been  no  trade

recession, generally speaking, in the areas  around

Singapore.   As  a  matter  of  fact,   Malaya   is

experiencing a boom. Why is Singapore going through

an  economic depression? The answer is, of  course,

people  have  no  confidence in the Government,  as

Government  has  deprived  the  minority  of  their

rights,  and speaks in proud, haughty and  arrogant

terms,  as  were used last year in the speeches  on

21st  July,  1959. In Hansard, Volume  11,  No.  6,

columns  355  and 356, speaking of the  Opposition,

the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we are not really concerned with them...they have

ceased  to  matter.they are there like  gunny-bags,

which I used to see in Japanese-occupied Singapore,

strung across the field for Japanese soldiers to do

bayonet  practices. Dead ducks, they could  not  be

deader!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How true!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> How true, Sir? The

Opposition  Members  have  not  been  appointed  by

Government.  They  too have  been  elected  by  the

people who, though in the minority, are citizens of

Singapore and who have the right to cast their vote

and  the right to choose their own representatives,

and  to  have  their representatives recognised  by

Government.  Now, how can they have any  confidence

in  a  Government which ignores the rights  of  the

minority, which declares that their representatives

have  ceased to matter, and that the Government  is

not  concerned  with  them?  How  can  people  have

confidence   in  a  Government  that   makes   such

declarations? Sir, after what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



has  appeared in the papers and in the Petir  about

the  quarrel or the split in the P.A.P.,  you  will

remember  that it is these "dead ducks  and  gunny-bags"  on the Opposition Bench that tried  to  warn

Government of the suicide that the ex-Minister  for

National  Development was plunging Singapore  into.

And  the Government deliberately misled the  public

by  shielding  him. They themselves  have  admitted

this, Sir, in their Party organ. And now Government

have made exactly the same charges as those made by

the  Opposition. Sir, the "dead ducks" were not  so

dead  after all! Not as dead as the Prime  Minister

tried to make them out to be. The "gunny-bags" were

right.  And  it was the Government which  tried  to

conceal  from the public the shortcomings of  their

Party  member  and which had used the strongest  of

terms  against the Opposition in order  to  silence

them.   The  Government  have  now  revealed  their

insincerity,  and  the public  has  no  longer  any

confidence  in them. If they are sincere,  Sir,  in

their promise to avoid taking any action that  will

damage  the trade of Singapore, they will endeavour

to   behave  in  a  manner  befitting  sincere  and

dignified statesmen and avoid employing the tactics

of cheap politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government have assured us that during the year

the  Singapore Telephone Board proposes to  connect

telephones  to kampongs and villages in  the  urban

and   rural  areas.  Sir,  in  view  of  the   many

accusations  flung by one Minister  at  another  of

favouritism,  we, the Opposition, hope  that  these

villages  and kampongs do not mean P.A.P. villages

and P.A.P. kampongs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Board is said to have given out

contracts  for the construction of 4,000 units.  It

is  said  to  have  drawn up a  five-year  building

programme providing for the construction of  52,000

units  at  an estimated total cost of $210  million

over  the  period  1960-1964, and 1,811  units,  it

seems,  will be completed by the end of this  year.

Sir, we have been hearing so much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



about  contracts and construction costs, and  units

to  be  completed ever since the P.A.P.  Government

came  in,  but we have not yet seen the houses.  We

hope  that  1960  will  not  be  another  year   of

still-borns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been promised that stand-pipes will be

installed  in  remote areas. May I  make  a  humble

suggestion, Sir? I have seen how the water from the

standpipes on roads has been allowed to run without

stop.  I  am  sure the poor people  would  be  much

happier  if  Government would bring the pipes  into

their  houses.  It  would also serve  to  ease  the

strain  on the reservoir during the drought.  I  am

quite  sure, Sir, that the poor people  prefer  the

standpipes  to  be in their houses. Standpipes  are

good, no doubt, but it is better if they are in the

houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Standpipes in houses?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Pipes in houses. They are

better  than  standpipes on the road,  because  the

people will not have to go to the standpipes to get

water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, we are told, will reintroduce the

Women's Charter Bill. Sir, the Opposition wishes to

reiterate  its stand. We support the  principle  of

monogamous marriage. But we say that the method  of

implementing  it  must be practical  and  must  not

cause hardship to the public. The Charter must  not

be  used as a means to bring extra revenue  to  the

Government at the expense of the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said, Sir, that the periodical joint

discussions   between  Assemblymen,  the   people's

representatives,  and  the divisional  police  have

proved to be a step in the right direction. I would

like  to  point out that Members of the  Opposition

have   received  one  invitation  to   meet   their

divisional  police  officer,  but  we  know  of  no

periodical  joint  discussions between  Assemblymen

and their divisional police officer. Privileges and

opportunities  offered  to  P.A.P.  Assemblymen  at

public expense should, do you not think so, Sir, be

afforded to Opposition Assemblymen also? For a time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



lectures  and functions that were paid out  of  the

public  coffers  were  thrown  open  to  Opposition

Members and I, myself, had participated in some  of

them.  But  of late, the Government seem  to  think

that they have a right to use public funds to build

up  their  defeated candidates and possible  future

P.A.P. candidates. Community centres are opened and

run at public -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Can I be allowed to

continue, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Community centres are opened

and  run at public expense, so that the communities

could  be  grateful to the P.A.P.  Assemblymen  who

play  an  important role in the centres by  getting

all  their  needs for them from the Government,  If

the  Assemblyman of the area happens to be  a  non-P.A.P.  member  then  either  the  defeated  P.A.P.

candidate  of the area or a possible future  P.A.P.

candidate - anyway,  a  P.A.P. member - is  given  the

opportunity  and the honour. Community centres  are

run  on  public  funds, Sir,  I  repeat - not  P.A.P.

funds.  We  have no objection if they  are  run  on

P.A.P. funds, Seeing that they are run  on  public

funds,  Sir, what right has the Government  to  use

public funds against public wishes? In areas  where

non-P.A.P. candidates have been elected,  it  is  a

fact that the people in that area do not want to be

represented by a P.A.P. member. And typical of  the

unilateral  policy of the P.A.P.  Government,  they

force  the people to accept P.A.P. members as their

representatives  and to ignore  the  representative

that  the  electorate in that area has  chosen.  In

several instances, Sir, where a registered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



community  association  already   exists,

Government, with just one single unilateral  sweep,

have  brushed aside hundreds of members  who  could

have  formed a nucleus of the new association.  And

if  the group is not a pre-dominantly P.A.P. group,

Government would manoeuvre it so that the community

is  forced to accept selected P.A.P. members as the

leaders,  in order to enjoy the facilities provided

by   Government   in   community   centres.   These

facilities are provided at public expense, and the'

public  should  not be educated to  feel  that  the

facilities are charities dished out to  them  by  a

charitable  government. The public  have  paid  for

these facilities through their taxes and should not

be  treated  like beggars who are  not  allowed  to

choose their leaders and their representatives.  To

exploit the electorate by using the taxes they  pay

for  party  propaganda, for  building  up  defeated

candidates   and   for  protecting   their   future

candidates  can  only  be  described  as  political

corruption  at  its highest level, played  only  by

political  adventurers.  Now,  surely,  the  P.A.P.

Government does not claim to be one!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claims, Sir, that it is aware that

bribery  and  corruption have yet to be  completely

eliminated. We are not at all surprised, Sir,  that

the  Government  has  not been  able  to  eliminate

corruption  when we read Press editorials  such  as

this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straits Times, 16th July, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The thought did occur at the time to some who

were not in P.A.P.'s ranks that Mr Ong was less of

a  success than he and P.A.P. claimed, The  party's

dilemma,  for it was aware of the damage the  Mayor

was   doing,  was  obvious  and  painful,  and  the

recollection  of  it  finds early  mention  in  the

current issue of Petir...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When finally the Labour Front or (S.P.A.)

Government wanted to expose the Mayor, says Petir's

editorial, "it was the Party's stalwarts  who  came

out and defended him and prevented his exposure  as

a  petty  pocket  Hitler." Personal  quarrels  with

Opposition    Councillors   and   petty    personal

intrigues,  the  editorial admits, were  among  the

Mayor's  "stupidities." How much  better  it  would

have been if the party stalwarts had said so at the

time, and how much better for Singapore if when the

P.A.P. government was formed, Mr  Ong's  peculiar

qualities and weaknesses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



had been borne more carefully in mind... But why was

he given important Ministerial responsibilities

when it was known that he could not shoulder them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Ong's sins against the party are certainly

of far less concern -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is exactly what I tried

to  stop the Prime Minister from doing, and that is

attacking the personal conduct of a Member  of  the

Assembly.  That  must not be  done  except  upon  a

substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not

intend  to  attack the Member at all.  I  was  just

quoting  what the Petir said. I was just trying  to

prove that if they thought this was true, why  then

did  they not take action and why did they make him

a  Minister? I am not saying that this is true.  It

is  their word, and if they think it is true,  then

why did they carry out the action that they did?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point is that certain

allegations  were  made in  an  article  against  a

Member  of  the  Assembly which the  hon.  Lady  is

reading,  and therefore the allegations are  there.

The  hon.  Member must be very careful in what  she

quotes.  If  she  quotes this  article  in  general

terms, it is all right, but if she chooses to  read

that  article in detail, then of course  there  are

allegations against a Member of the Assembly.  That

must not be done.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, even this article says

that this would automatically mean political death.

Sir,  if  the P.A.P. leaders have had knowledge  of

what  they  alleged  to  be the  mal-practices  and

inefficiency which they are now levelling against a

certain Minister when he was a Mayor, why did  they

make him a Minister if these accusations were true.

Why  then did they shield him from exposure by  the

S.P.A.?  This fact, Sir, is sufficient  to  suggest

that  Government  condones and  perhaps  encourages

such practices by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



a  Minister. How then can Government hope to punish

others for the same practices?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other Ministries of the P.A.P.

Government, the Health Ministry seems to be  rather

fond  of  the future tense. Reading the Hansard  on

medical  and  health  services  we  find  that  the

Government will do this and the Government will  do

that.  They  have been willing to do  a  number  of

things   which   until  today   are   "wills"   not

implemented.   The  only  "will"  that   has   been

implemented seems to be the "will" to  get  rid  of

doctors and specialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy speech concluded with the

promise  that  the  second year of  office  of  the

P.A.P.  Government will be a year of  construction.

What  about the first year, Sir? Was it a  year  of

construction?   If  it  was,  may   I   then   ask,

construction  of  what?  Not  of  dwelling  houses,

flats,   tenements,  factories,  business   houses,

schools,  hospitals,  or  economic,  political   or

industrial development. The only construction  that

Government   can  claim  is  the  construction   of

everything destructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is time that the P.A.P. Government start

using  public funds for the good of the  people  of

Singapore   and  not  for  P.A.P. propaganda   for

defeated candidates or possible future candidates,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to make this six-point recommendation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. That Government gets down to the task of

building  houses  for the poor people.  The  P.A.P.

Government  has built 124 in their  first  year  of

office  against  6,734  permanent  dwellings  built

under  the previous Government in their first  year

of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. That Government takes advantage of every means

of  solving the unemployment problem. The  rate  of

unemployment  has been accelerated at  an  alarming

rate by Government inefficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That Government utilises every available

resource to combat crime in Singapore. Today  there

is   no  sense  of  personal  safety.  Gangsterism,

extortion, kidnapping, robbery and hooliganism have

become national pastimes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. That Government employs every method of

fostering  among  the public a sense  of  security.

Today there is no security of any type. Favouritism

and victimisation seem to be the policy of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at this headline. This is what I mean

by favouritism and victimisation. In big headlines,

of the Straits Times of 28th July, 1960, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`I'm P.A.P.: Even officer with crown is scared

of me' CONSTABLE: TAXI DRIVER TRIED TO MURDER ME".



<br><br>Now,  such things go on. This may be the only  case

that  has been given publicity. But everyone  knows

that  such types of cases take place every  day  at

all levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. That Government does everything within its

power to ensure political peace in Singapore.  What

peace can the public have when two of the strongest

men  in Government are bitterly fighting each other

for  power?  Even if one can be forced out  of  the

Assembly, the fight may still go on, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. That Government restores to the State of

Singapore  its  prosperity.  What  prosperity   can

Singapore  enjoy, when capital has been driven  out

of  the State by bad government policies, when  the

chances  of  merger with the Federation  have  been

jeopardized by the extreme Leftist policy and  non-Communist  stand  of  the  P.A.P.  Government?  The

speech  of  Tungku Abdul Rahman, according  to  the

Straits Times of the 1st of August, 1960, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not sufficient to be anti-Communist, and far

less  to  be  non-Communist, as  some  weak  people

profess.  We  must  also stand up  and  be  staunch

believers in Malayan democracy."



<br><br>Sir,  the  S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. Opposition  entirely

agree  with  the  Tunku and give him  our  support.

After  all, it is a Malayan nation based on Malayan

democracy  that we want to build, and  not  a  non-Communist   nation  built  around  a  non-Communist

ideology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will give this six-point

recommendation  its careful consideration  and  not

use  them as the Japanese used the gunny bags  just

because they were suggested by the Opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in support of the

expression of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

for the speech which he delivered at the opening of

the Second Session of this Assembly, I wish to take

this opportunity to comment on the speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the speech covers all

Ministries and the programme which will be  carried

out  as  policies of the P.A.P. Government  in  its

second  year of office. In other words,  Sir,  this

year will be a year of construction. No longer will

it  be  a year of re-organisation as it was in  the

past.  I  believe  the Opposition  will  take  this

opportunity  to  attack or  to  criticise  a  small

section  of  this  Government - I  repeat  "a   small

section" - for  the actions or the errors  that  have

been committed during the past year. As a result of

this awakening, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  in

his  speech  has stated that the P.A.P.  Government

does  make  mistakes and commit  errors,  but  that

these mistakes and errors arose out of its zeal and

impatience  to get things done. But,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, let not the Opposition, or those people who do

not subscribe to or do not agree with the views  of

the  present  Government, close their eyes  to  the

excellent services that have been provided  in  the

national interest by the Government since  it  came

into  power. I am sure - and my colleagues will agree

with  me - that the Opposition Parties welcomed  many

of  the Bills which have been passed. I have  often

heard the Opposition praising the work done by  the

P.A.P.  Government. For instance, in the matter  of

trade, commerce, education, and the introduction of

Bills  in  this Assembly, the steps  taken  by  the

Government were not to meet the requirements  of  a

certain section of the population but to cater  for

the  entire  population as a whole,  including  the

Malays - a subject which has been harped upon by some

Opposition  Members, If they had taken the  trouble

to  read  the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,

they  would have seen that the special position  of

the Malays was touched upon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of finance which was raised by

some Members of the Opposition, it cannot be denied

that  the method of administration adopted  by  the

P.A.P.  Government has resulted in a saving  of  $9

million.  When  this Government took office,  there

was  not  a single cent in the coffers, but  now  a

considerable  sum  of  money has  been  saved.  The

Minister   for  Finance  has  stated   on   several

occasions  that  this is in the national  interest.

This cannot be denied by Members of the Opposition.

We  can criticise the ways and means or the methods

by  which  we  have achieved this surplus,  but  we

cannot  deny all the same that $9 million has  been

saved.   There   are  many  achievements   of   the

Government  that I could cite here,  but  it  would

take me too long to deal with them one by one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many matters on which I would

like to touch upon here. On the question of helping

the  Malays,  there  is mention  in  column  13  of

Hansard dated 20th July, 1960, of assistance to  be

given  to Malay fishermen. We are helping  them  to

raise their standard of living. In column 14 of the

same Hansard, there is also mention of Muslim law:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will introduce comprehensive

legislation  for the regulation of Muslim  marriage

and  divorce  and Muslim religious affairs  on  the

lines   of  legislation  in  the  States   of   the

Federation of Malaya."



<br><br>I  have  personally  received letters  from  Malays

expressing  the commendability of such a  step  and

advising that such legislation should be undertaken

forthwith  for  the regulation of Muslim  marriages

and divorces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a very important subject which

has received great support is the implementation of

Malay  as the national language. The P.A.P. is  not

afraid to declare boldly that the national language

in  Singapore is Malay. We believe that language is

like  a tree, because it is a means by which  human

beings  convey  their thoughts to  one  another.  I

would  like to repeat that language is like a tree,

and  in this connection the Ministry of Culture  is

confident  that the present policy of unifying  the

existing cultures in Singapore could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



be  achieved.  This,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  very

important,  because  the existence  of  a  national

language  will  not  only  integrate  the  existing

various  cultures, but it will also be a  means  by

which  the  various  races in  Singapore  could  be

united.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Opposition Member has said that Raffles was

not  the founder of Singapore as he was a foreigner

and  a  newcomer. Why did he not say  this  to  the

Member for Geylang Serai before the latter went  on

a  mission to London? In my opinion, Sir, there  is

no necessity to belabour this point. The problem in

front of us is to unify the various races and  weld

them  into one Malayan nation. I am a Malay. I have

been here for many years, but as a member `of a non-communal party, I feel that the various races  must

work  together  so that a Malayan nation  could  be

evolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of culture, Mr Speaker, Sir - I am

attached to the Ministry of Culture - I would like to

say  that the programme carried out since last year

were  for the sole purpose of unifying the  various

races in Singapore to make them feel that they  are

true  Malayans. There are many programme  which  we

would  like  to carry out in the future;  similarly

the programme which were carried out last year will

be  continued this year. For instance, in regard to

the  Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat, we will add a new feature

to  our  programme as enunciated in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech on the  national  service

network.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Speaker, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  has  said that there are  many  cultural

organisations which have called upon  the  Ministry

of  Culture  to  accept Malay as the  basis  for  a

Malayan  culture. I think the Member has  not  been

following closely what is meant by the basis for  a

Malayan  culture. In April this year, Mr  Speaker,

the  representatives  of  an  arts  group  had   an

interview  with  the  Minister  for  Culture.  They

submitted  a  memorandum. At the same  time,  views

were exchanged in a cordial manner to find out what

was  the  object  of  the  arts  group.  After  the

discussion, I was told by a member of the committee

of the arts group that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



results  of  the discussion were very  satisfactory

indeed. I would like to say here, Mr Speaker, that

the   representatives  of  the  arts   group   were

satisfied  with  the  answers  obtained  from   the

Minister  for  Culture.  I am  surprised  that  the

Member   for  Kampong  Kembangan  has   cause   for

complaint. The contents of the letter, inter  alia,

are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will encourage and will give

every  support  to  Malay culture  and  will  cause

investigations to be made on Malay culture."



<br><br>So,  Mr  Speaker,  in  that way,  they  could  say

frankly  that the definition of "basis" means  that

it  will take the form of a Malayan basis. It  does

not  mean  that joget modern could be  put  on  the

stage  and called Malayan culture. That is not  the

definition  given by the arts group. This  question

should  be asked together and the background should

have  a Malayan content. That is the interpretation

of  the  "basis"  of  Malayan  culture.  There  are

experts  who say that Malayan culture  is  a  mixed

culture and that the core of Malay culture has  its

source  from  Hindu culture, So, Mr  Speaker,  the

object  of  creating a Malayan culture through  the

medium  of the national language, which is  one  of

the  aims  of  the Government, will be achieved  in

this  manner.  Mr  Speaker,  if  this  is  made  a

communal issue, 2,000 years working on it will  not

bring  any result. Mr Speaker, this is a  part  of

our  findings and we need to do a lot  of  research

into culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech [Hansard,

20th July, 1960, col. 23], there is mention that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government has also plans to inaugurate a

National  Service  network.  At  the  moment  Radio

Singapore  broadcasts four language  programmes.The

National  Service  would  be  identified  with   no

particular language or cultural group. It will  try

to reflect a Malayan outlook and content."



<br><br>This, Mr Speaker, is an achievement of the present

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which is important in regard to

culture   is   contained  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech  [Hansard, 20th July,  1960,  col.

22]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government plans to establish, a National

Cultural  Brigade  in order to  give  positive  and

creative  impulse to Malayan art, music, drama  and

so on. Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



the  Brigade  will  consist of  artists,  painters,

musicians, dramatists and all those involved in the

arts  and  they will perform as well as  teach  and

organise  dramatic,  musical and  dance  groups  in

community centres and cultural associations."



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  this  has  been  welcomed  by  arts associations and I am sure that such schemes as are

put up by the Government will be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if it was our intention not to give our co-operation to create a Malayan culture, then

I  believe  we  would not be able  to  achieve  our

objective,



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we,  my colleagues and I, are sitting here on  this

side  of the House today because the Prime Minister

has  forced  us  to  sit here. He  has  evicted  us

unconstitutionally  and  by  force,  and  that   is

because  at  the moment he controls the Government.

And  that is also because at the moment he controls

the  Police  and the whole machinery of the  State.

Otherwise  the  position  today  could   be   quite

different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while I sat listening to the Government's policy speech delivered in this

Assembly two weeks ago, I asked myself whether this

policy  statement  could have come  from  a  P.A.P.

Government.  Between  this policy  speech  and  the

policy  speeches delivered by Marshall's government

and  the Lim Yew Hock government, I am sorry to say

that   I   can   hardly  notice   any   fundamental

difference. Mr Speaker, here [Indicating] are huge

volumes  of  the  Hansard.  Perusing  through   the

speeches made by the P.A.P. representatives in this

very  Assembly during the Labour Front  Government,

you  will  notice  the fundamental  differences  in

policy which distinguish the present policy of a so-called  P.A.P.  Government  from  the  real  P.A.P.

pronouncements in this very Assembly made from time

to  time  before the general elections, and  before

the time the P.A.P. formed the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are the days when the utterances of P.A.P.

leaders captured the hearts and imagination of  the

people.  Gone  are the days when the people  waited

eagerly for the morning papers to find out what had

been  said  in this Assembly by P.A.P. leaders.  At

the  opening of the present session of the Assembly

a  fortnight ago, it was necessary for the  present

P.A.P. leadership - there are only two of them,  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, as the

others do not make decisions and are still my  good

old  friends - to  direct six  lorry  loads  of  Work

Brigade  members  and scores of Party  workers  and

community  centre workers to stand at  the  Supreme

Court  building  to represent the so-called  masses

and  to  give a cheer to the leaders as they  filed

past the Supreme Court building from the City Hall.

The  organising  secretary  of  the  Tanjong  Pagar

Branch  led the shout of "Merdeka", but the workers

did  not  cheer  at all. Mr Speaker,  as  the  old

proverb  says, you can lead a horse to  the  water,

but  you  cannot force it to drink. What a sad  and

sorry spectacle!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the policy speech, nothing has been said about colonialism, about Malayanisation,

about  the  detainees, about the social revolution,

and  many  other  important and pertinent  subjects

which  can  be  found in the pages of  the  Hansard

here.  The  Government is not interested  in  these

things  any  more.  The  Secretary-General  of  the

P.A.P., who is now the Prime Minister, commented on

the  Labour  Front policy speech on 5th  September,

1956, col. 56 of the Hansard, and this was what  he

said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a statement of the policy of the Labour Front

Government for the second session of this Assembly,

the  Governor's Address was poor and feeble.  There

was  no coherent theme, no broad exposition of  the

country's  economic  or  political  situation.   No

master  plan, but just a collection of the  various

departmental  activities  puffed  up   with   pious

Ministerial hopes and good intentions.  Instead  of

specific  plans, figures, targets, there  was  only

fluff and empty exhortation."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I must admit that this is an apt and accurate description of the policy statement of the

Lim  Yew Hock Government in September, 1956. I must

also  say,  Mr Speaker, that this is also  a  true

description  of this policy statement. This  policy

statement  is not a policy statement  of  a  P.A.P.

Government, definitely not a policy statement of  a

real P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the basic fight

facing   us  today  is  still  the  fight   against

colonialism.   It   is  hypocrisy   to   say   that

colonialism  is  now  no more.  The  policy  speech

delivered two weeks ago said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sense of oppression, humiliation and

resentment which people experienced under  colonial

rule  has  slowly given way to feelings of national

pride and self-confidence."



<br><br>What  does  this  sentence mean by implication?  It

means  that  we have no more colonialism  here.  It

means that now we have national pride, and national

pride can only be achieved in a country where there

is  national  independence. No doubt, Mr  Speaker,

the  1958  Constitution is an  improvement  on  the

Rendel  Constitution.  But  this  statement,  which

implies  that  we  are now no more  under  colonial

rule,  is  far from being the truth. The  political

complex of our society and our present Constitution

is  still  predominantly colonial in character  and

content.   Our   economy  is  still   predominantly

colonial. These are hard facts which we cannot  get

away  from.  And listen to this. This is  what  the

P.A.P. manifesto said in 1954:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the constitutional concessions granted so

far  have been particularly careful to protect  and

perpetuate   the  basic  economic   and   political

interest  of  the colonial power, The retention  of

basic   colonial   interests   runs   through   all

constitutional    re-arrangements     since     the

reoccupation in 1945."



<br><br>This is what the P.A.P. manifesto said. And what we

have   said.  It  is  equally  true  of  the   1958

Constitution. At its best Singapore today remains a

semi-colony.   The   P.A.P. having   formed   the

Government, it does not mean that the fight against

colonialism  is  over.  The Progressive  Party,  as

represented here in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



this Chamber by the Member for Farrer Park, at  one

time   had   intimated  to  us:   "Do   not   fight

Colonialism.  The British will suspend  the  Rendel

Constitution." Now we are being told the  same  old

story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Petir dated 14th July, there is an article

purported to be written by S. Rajaratnam, but I  do

not  think he wrote the article, The Prime Minister

knows  that  Mr  S.  Rajaratnam  and  I  are  good

friends.  He  always writes the articles  and  just

gets  them out using other people's names. This  is

what is written in the Petir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other and more likely cause is suspension of

the  Constitution and the British taking over  once

more the administration of the island, if they take

it  over this time, let there be no mistake  as  to

what  will happen. All progressive forces from  the

left to the leftist adventurers will be wiped out."



<br><br>Mr Speaker, this was on 14th July, 1960. But may I refresh you as to what the Prime Minister said when

he was Secretary-General of the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b> He is still now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> "There are three things that

the  British Government can do: ", he said  in  the

Hansard,  Volume 1, No, 28, dated 4th April,  1956,

column  1796. That was four years ago, it  was  in

connection    with    the   discussion    on    the

constitutional question. At column 1794, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Freedom is the birthright of all peoples

everywhere  in this world. Because my  fore-fathers

migrated  for  purely selfish economic  reasons  to

what  they  call the South Seas, a whole generation

of  some  two  million Chinese are  today  left  in

Malaya   with  Malaya  as  their  only  home   and,

necessarily  thereby,  the  sole  object  of  their

loyalty.  The generation that I belong to  grew  up

under  British colonial rule. It is always easy  to

say,  "Let us forget the past. After all, that  was

colonialism.  It  was a mistake. Now,  let  us  get

together   and  let  us  be  friends."  Commendable

sentiment, Sir, and one to which I would  subscribe

if  I found that there was sufficient sincerity  on

the  other side. If I believe that the British  are

no  longer interested in either economic, political

or  military advantages to themselves more than  to

me,  then  there  would be a  basis  for  friendly,

comradely  cooperation. That is the  problem  which

faces  Britain  and  the people  of  Singapore  and

Malaya.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>The Secretary-General continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was only recently that the constitution of

British  Guiana  was suspended. It  was  said  that

there, a great error had been made. That, in  fact,

self-determination is only possible where you  have

an  educated  and  enlightened electorate  and  not

where you have largely an uneducated mass of people

incapable  of thinking for themselves  but  led  by

political extremists."



<br><br>The Secretary-General continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three things that the British

Government can do: meet us the whole way,  meet  us

somewhere  along  the way, or  not  budge  at  all.

Taking the three alternatives in the reverse order,

if  they  do not budge at all: the Hon, the  Chief

Minister -"



<br><br>It was David Marshall in those days -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"has already indicated that he does not propose

to  stay  in  office. In other words,  the  British

Government   must  be  prepared   to   revoke   the

constitution  and run Singapore  once  again  as  a

Crown  colony in every sense of the word. The long-term  consequences - I would not  say  the  immediate

consequences,  for  those  can  be  controlled  and

contained - of such a policy would be catastrophic to

the British."



<br><br>Remember, Mr Speaker, what was said in April 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the British Government must be prepared to

revoke  the  constitution and  run  Singapore  once

again as a Crown colony in every sense of the word.

The  long-term consequences.of such a policy  would

be catastrophic to the British."



<br><br>Now  the  story  is different. Now if  there  is  a

revocation of the constitution, then the  long-term

consequences will be "catastrophic" to the  present

leadership of the P.A.P. No more being Ministers!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are other theories being put up by the present leadership of the P.A.P. Just now

the  Prime Minister has said in his speech that  we

in  Singapore are dependent on Johore for water. By

implication it means, "Do not fight too hard. If we

do,  the British will ask the Federation Government

to  cut off our water supply." And this is what the

ex-Assemblyman for Changi, Mr Lim Cher Kheng, said

on  22nd April, 1958, Volume 3, No. 2, col.  89  of

the Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I want to see how the adviser to the Naval

Base  Workers'  Union and the Member for  Sembawang

(Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)-"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



Explanatory note - presently the Minister for Health -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"who is the Secretary of that union are going to

provide their workers with new jobs. That is why

we have to face the `political realities'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker,  in 1958 Lim Cher Kheng intimated  to  the P.A.P.: "Do not fight too hard. Who is going to

engage  the  40,000 workers employed by  the  Armed

Services?" Now we are being told, "Do not fight too

hard.  Tomorrow, when you turn on  the  water  tap,

there will be no water forthcoming."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Volume 1, No. 2 of the Hansard dated 26th

April, 1955, the Secretary-General said at col. 67:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we are not afraid to say that we are one

hundred per cent against colonialism".



<br><br>Now he does not say those words any more. Now these

same  people,  after  forming the  Government,  are

putting  up  the  same theories as the  Progressive

Party and Labour Front had once done. They now say,

"To   fight  colonialism  means  to  fight  British

troops."  That  was  the speech of  the  Secretary-General  made  at  a  special Party  Conference  on

Saturday,  18th June. If this theory is true,  then

the P.A.P. has not been fighting colonialism during

the  past  five  years, because in  the  past  five

years,  before it came into power, the  P.A.P. had

not  fought British troops. If this theory is true,

Mr  Speaker, then the political fighting that took

place  during the past five years was  between  our

group  and  the Lim Yew Hock group as to  who  were

going to become tile Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of colonialism is manifested in two

forms  in  this island. The open which is the  less

dangerous  form,  and the covert and  subtle  form,

which   is  the  more  dangerous.  I  shall   quote

instances  to distinguish between the two.  In  the

open  form.  British political power  lies  in  its

control  of  defence and external affairs,  in  the

powers of the Internal Security Council, and in the

many provisions of the 1958 Singapore Constitution,

which allow the British Government to intrude  into

many   spheres   of  Singapore's   internal   self-government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But British trade and influence do not rest

there.  They exercise their influences more tightly

by  controlling key positions in our political  and

economic complex, and these influences are far more

important and far-reaching in consequence than  the

open  control  which  they  exercise  through   the

legality of the 1958 Singapore Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often said that the forces of colonialism

are  now  stronger than ever. The fight has  merely

entered  a  new  and more subtle  phase.  We  stand

determinedly  for  the  completion  of  the   anti-colonial struggle which has now been betrayed. Just

now,  Mr  Speaker,  when the  Prime  Minister  was

delivering  his opening address on the debate,  his

method  was  very  simple.  On  the  one  hand,  he

condemns, for the first time in the past 14 months,

the  British colonialists, the Straits  Times,  and

K.M.T. sub-version. That is to convince the people

if  they  can that they are on the left  of  these,

They  find  that our exposure that  they  have  not

talked  about colonialism during the past one  year

is  being effective and accepted by the masses,  so

for   the  first  time  they  start  with  lukewarm

condemnation  if the British colonialists  and  the

Straits Timer. Since the crisis in the P.A.P.,  the

Straits  Times  have written no less  than  two  or

three editorials supporting the present leadership,

the   so-called  Russian  trade  visa,  the  K,M.T.

subversion (that is, the so-called detention of the

two    journalists,   that   they   called   K.M.T.

subversion).  We  do  not  interpret  the   present

political struggle in those terms. We interpret the

present  political struggle as it  was  interpreted

before  the P.A.P. formed the Government: that  the

fight  is a fight of the pro-colonialists,  led  by

the Prime Minister and his erstwhile colleague, the

Minister  for  Finance, and the  anti-colonialists.

This is what the Secretary-General said in Vol.  1,

col. 1798 of the Hansard, dated 4th April, 1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as the British are here - the common

target, the common foe are the British.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, could anybody deny that the British are still here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No word is mentioned in the policy speech about

the  presence  of  key  expatriate  officials,  the

colonial die-hards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



and  remnants  of colonial forces working  for  the

prolongation  of  the  colonial  system  which   at

present  exists  in Singapore. Mr George  Thomson,

whom the P.A.P. had pledged to dismiss when it came

into  power,  is  still at large  and,  ironically,

holding  a more important position than before.  In

addition  to  his primary duties of  indoctrinating

and  brain-washing civil servants, headmasters, and

police personnel at the Political Study Centre,  we

can also note his erstwhile and strange presence in

discussions   on   tourist  promotion,   television

discussions,  appearing  when  the  Prime  Minister

addresses    head-masters   of   middle    schools,

delivering  speeches,  appearing  at  forums,   and

writing articles; and only yesterday, appearing  in

the  Nanyang Siang Pao was a long article he  wrote

for  the  Police  Force, propounding  his  colonial

political  philosophy. What an irony! That  article

of  his contains at least 2,500 Chinese characters.

My  speech  was treated differently.  I  understand

that  the  vernacular Press in particular  and  the

Press in general were asked, or instructed, to back-out  or censor my speeches on instructions from the

Government. George Thomson was allowed 2,500 words.

But  the  speeches  of 10 to  15  speakers  at  the

Badminton  Hall  rally? They rang  up  the  Nanyang

Siang  Pao  and  the  Sin  Chew  fit  Poh  to  say,

"Gentlemen, this is an order - 500 words."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Mr Speaker, that another of

Thomson's main functions is to prepare material for

Ministers and Assemblymen who might require it  for

their speeches. I never used it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Thomson, we have Blades with other

expatriates  who are still controlling  the  police

force as it was in the good old days. After Blades,

there  is  P.H.  Meadows,  who  controls  all   the

Government  departments under the Prime  Minister's

Office,  namely, the Singapore Harbour  Board,  the

City Council, the Rural Board, the Land Office, the

Planning  Department,  the Survey  Department,  the

Registry of Deeds and the Registry of Titles, etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Planning Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> In addition to the Big Three,

there  are  also  many other expatriates  in  other

Government departments and Boards, where they  hold

key  positions  (Mr Speaker, these are  facts  and

cannot  be  laughed  off) in the Singapore  Harbour

Board,   the   Singapore   Telephone   Board,   the

Telecommunications   Department,   and    so    on.

Expatriates  who  have been malayanised  have  been

asked  to  come  back. In the City  Council,  three

expatriates  who had taken their compensation  were

asked to come back, and a local senior officer, Mr

Owen,  whom  I have known from my own knowledge  of

accountancy   to  be  a  brilliant   and   original

accountant, has been forced to leave the country to

find   employment   overseas.   Fortunately,    his

accounting   knowledge   is   recognised   by   the

Australians and he is now having a very  well  paid

job  in  Australia. On the question of expatriates,

it  is  necessary to remember two points.  Firstly,

often  it  is  the work that these  expatriates  do

which  is  not  known to the public  that  is  more

important and of a more vital nature than the  work

that is generally known to the public. Secondly, it

is  not  so  much the numbers but the key positions

that  the expatriates hold that really matters.  As

far  as the colonial power is concerned, it is  far

better  to  have one expatriate officer controlling

the  departments under the Prime Minister's  office

than  to have, say, 30 expatriate officers  in  the

Public Works Department, as happened under the  Lim

Yew  Hock  Government. To show what this  means,  I

seconded a local officer, Mr Estrop, to be  Deputy

Superintendent of the Pasir Panjang Power  Station,

so  that  when the post of the expatriate head  was

malayanised,  there would be a local officer  ready

to  take  his place. After the taking-over  of  the

City  Council  by  the Prime Minister,  Estrop  was

immediately  removed.  We know  that  many  of  the

expatriates deliberately do not want to train local

officers,   so   that  when  their  term   expires,

Government  will  be forced to  re-engage  them  at

fantastic salaries. Too many Government departments

and  statutory  bodies are under direct  expatriate

control. The rest can be influenced by them in like

manner  through the colonial octopus. This is  what

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister said about Malayanisation in  1956.

It  is  in Hansard, Vol. 1, dated 26th April, 1955,

cols.  57  and  58 and cols. 1806 to  1809  of  4th

April, 1956. Col. 58 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...unless the Government can pursue this policy of

Malayanisation  not only in the  Government  Public

Services, but in all the Public Services and,  last

but  not  least,  in the Singapore  Harbour  Board,

where a very important Public Service is run almost

exclusively by expatriate officers, there is  going

to  be  a  great  deal  of, I  would  not  call  it

sabotage,   but   I   would   just   say,   general

dislocation,   when  a  really   vigorous   Malayan

Nationalist Government takes over in the very  near

future,...".



<br><br>Compare this to what the Prime Minister said on the

27th  of  February,  1960, in the  launching  of  a

Singapore  Harbour  Board tug. The  Prime  Minister

continued [col. 57, Vol. 1 dated 26.4.55]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, Sir, it is always said that we, as the

Member  for  Serangoon has said (it was  Lim  Choon

Mong,  I think) have no talents. If we have talents

we  have  no experience. If we have experience,  we

have no talents. If we have talents and experience,

we have no qualification."



<br><br>This  is what the Prime Minister said when  he  was

Secretary-General in 1955. But what did he say now?

After  he  became Prime Minister, he told Mr  Owen

(the  accountant I referred to just now) at a local

officers'   meeting  where  the  expatriates   were

invited  to attend, that he had no experience.  Mr

Speaker,  Mr Owen had six years of good experience

in accounting both in Australia and Singapore. When

we  were  appointed Ministers, we had not even  one

day of experience as Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that has been the stand of the P.A.P. on Malayanisation. What the present

leadership  of  the P.A.P. is doing is  a  complete

reversal  of that stand. Because of this  trend  of

Government of un-Malayanisation, there are  British

commercial firms which are following the  footsteps

of  the  Government.  We stand  for  the  immediate

Malayanisation  of  all  expatriate  administrative

personnel and for the systematic training of  local

officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



to  take over the technical and professional  posts

now occupied by the expatriates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the policy speech mentions that Government does not wish to give the impression

that  there have not been mistakes and shortcomings

in  the  past year. Tell us what are those mistakes

and  those  shortcomings.  Are  they  mistakes   on

fundamental principles or mistakes on trivialities?

What  I  can  gather from this policy  speech,  the

recent  Petir  editorial, and the Prime  Minister's

address this morning, which sounded like the  voice

of Lim Yew Hock delivering it, is that the Minister

for   Labour  and  Law,  who  is  another  possible

scapegoat,  went ahead with too many  laws  in  the

past  year. The mistakes are not so much  with  the

laws  themselves as with the speed with which  they

were  passed.  We  are not so worried  about  these

little mistakes, trivialities and forms, because no

person  running a Ministry can avoid them. What  we

are  more  concerned  with  are  the  mistakes   of

policies  and  fundamentals.  If  you  are   really

sincere, then rectify those mistakes. Reaffirm your

faith   in   the  P.A.P. revolutionary  manifesto.

Reaffirm   your  faith  in  the  struggle   against

colonialism and all the avowed aims and policies of

the  P.A.P. before the formation of the Government.

Fight  for  the detainees in the Internal  Security

Council and get them released without conditions. I

made  my  stand clear at the first sitting  of  the

Internal Security Council. Since the first sitting,

I  have not been allowed to speak. Re-register  the

trade   unions  without  conditions.   Repeal   the

gambling  Bills  and reverse your present  taxation

policy  which is to tax the poor and subsidise  the

rich.  It  should be to tax the rich and  subsidise

the  poor.  Rectify  all those  mistakes  that  are

enumerated in the Hong Lim resolutions. You  cannot

fight   this   political  issue  by   intimidation,

suppression   and  temptation.  You   cannot,   for

instance, just ring up the vernacular Press,  after

the Badminton Hall rally, and order them to "black-out"  the speeches, and after protestations,  order

them  to  limit all the speeches to 500 words.  You

cannot  win  the political struggle by detaining  a

journalist 15 minutes after he attended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



my  Press  conference while he was on  his  way  to

cable  my Press releases to Kuala Lumpur,  so  that

you  can  use  him to intimidate other journalists.

You  cannot win by sending C.I.D. and other  people

to  the houses of Party members to intimidate them.

You  cannot win by intimidating the printing  press

which  printed my speeches, which were  blacked-out

by  the local Press according to your instructions.

You  cannot  win  by offering back  jobs  to  those

P.A.P. members whom you have sacked from the S.I.T.

You can only win by going back to pre-May 1959,  if

that is ever possible.
