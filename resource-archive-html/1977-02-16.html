<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister

for  National Development and Communications when the

tracks at Jalan Perisai will be made up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng hang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, work on metalling of the tracks at Jalan Perisai

<div align="center"><b>(Continuance of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister

for  National Development and Communications  whether

he  can  give an assurance that pig farmers who  have

been  resettled  will be able to continue  their  pig

farming  activity for a period beyond 15  years  as

many  of  them have been resettled on more  than  one

occasion and heavy capital is involved in the setting

up of pig farms.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

pig farmers have been resettled in Punggol because it

is  a  non-water catchment area where pig waste  does

not create the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



serious  pollution problems as in a  water  catchment

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has so far developed 507 hectares

(1,252  acres)  of  land in Punggol at  considerable

expense for pig farming as part of our policy  to  be

self-sufficient in protein food. Also 30-year  leases

are  given  to large commercial pig farms. Therefore,

as  far  as  I  can  see, pig farming  is  likely  to

continue there for the next 15 years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that

case,  I must thank the Senior Minister of State  for

his  kind comments. Sir, would he not agree  with  me

that  the  farmers will be there for more  than  15

years?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

categorically stated that pig farming  is  likely  to

continue there for the next 15 years. The very  fact

that  we  have given leases of 30 years, we can  even

speculate  that  it is very likely that  pig  farming

will be there for 15 to 30 years.

Development  and Communications if it is  planned  to

expand  the  Punggol veterinary extension  centre  to

meet  the  increasing demand for veterinary  services

with  the rapid expansion of the pig farming industry

in Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

yes. In fact, a new 2-storey addition to the existing

veterinary  centre costing $409,000 with  a  built-up

area of 702 sq. m. is under construction and will  be

completed by the end of this year. This new  building

will  have a laboratory complex, a post-mortem  room,

offices, a library and a meeting room.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three veterinary surgeons and other supporting staff

will   be  posted  to  the  Centre  to  provide  more

efficient diagnostic, treatment and advisory services

to the farms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [14th February, 1977],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the Speech of

the President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore.

express our thanks to the President for the Speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening of the First Session of this Parliament.".'.

- [Dr Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had originally

intended to take advantage of the Standing Orders  to

table an amendment to the Motion standing in the name

of  the hon. Member for Ulu Pandan in expressing  our

thanks  to  the  President for  his  speech.  Several

Members  have, in fact, indicated that they  expected

another   diabolical  manifestation  of  what   other

Members  might describe as the negative  part  of  my

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the lifting of the Whip, and the

assurance  given  by the Leader of the  House,  I  am

still  inhibited by the fear that being a  Member  on

the  Government  Bench, an amendment  might  well  be

regarded as a gesture of disrespect to the President.

Further,  having  listened  to  the  gentlemanly  and

eloquent  delivery of the speech by the  hon.  Member

for  Ulu  Pandan, I have come to the conclusion  that

any  amendment  to  the  Motion  will  certainly   be

repugnant.  I  decided, therefore,  that  the  Motion

should  remain  as it is, at least for  the  sake  of

etiquette,  and  I  shall  try,  though  not  without

involuntary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



restraint, to be less pungent in my remarks  at  this

Sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without formally moving the amendment, I think that

the Motion should more appropriately read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore.

express  our thanks to the President for  the  Speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening of the First Session of this Parliament,  but

regret  to  note  the absence of any mention  on  the

deficiency of the Government in the understanding  of

the  problems  of  the  people  in  the  process   of

implementing its policies'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously speaking, Mr Speaker, Sir, few can dispute

the  high  ideals expressed in the Addenda,  some  of

which  are  so  colourfully  dressed  with  so   many

jargons,  except to marvel a little in  disbelief  in

some  of  the  many intangibles and  inadequacies  so

innocently confessed through the statements  in  both

the  Addenda  to  the Ministry of Education  and  the

Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that some years ago, the Deputy Prime

Minister,  in  a  speech that typified  his  in-depth

knowledge  in  the potentials and prejudices  of  our

people,   went  to  great  lengths  to   define   the

characteristics   of  what  he  called   "Westernised

Oriental  Gentlemen", or WOGs  as  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister    endeared   these   people    with    that

abbreviation.  That  speech was  both  enriching  and

invigorating.  Indeed,  it  provoked  serious   mind-searching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have been quite satisfied with my

comprehension  of that speech if I had  stopped  just

there.  However, in giving his observations a  little

further probing, I discovered that the Government  is

not  totally  free from the symptoms of such  decried

qualities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to recapture just two previous instances

which,  I hope, will suffice to demonstrate the  lack

of  understanding  on the part of the  Government  in

both  the  culture and traditions, which  values  the

Ministries  of  Education  and  Culture  so  doggedly

promised in the Addenda to inculcate in our young.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, as a result of complaints of noise

pollution,  the Government imposed a partial  ban  on

cracker-firing. The letting off of fire crackers  was

made  an  offence  except  in  places  designated  as

permitted  areas, such as State-owned -  I  emphasise State-owned

-  open  land  and  community centre compounds.  Many

Members are aware in my discussions with them, in the

Members'  Room, that I was quite vocal  against  this

kind of a half-line action. I then held the view, and

I  still hold the view now, that the partial ban  was

doomed  to  failure. If the firing  of  crackers  was

regarded  as  obnoxious - indeed  it  proved  to   be

unconducive  to our well-being, apart from  being  an

annual money-wasting folly, then the ban should  have

been total.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "half-way-house" policy succeeded only to

expose the Government's ignorance in our culture  and

its complete lack of understanding of the meaning and

significance of cracker firing. It was, and still is,

believed  - total ban now notwithstanding,  that  the

ear-shattering  explosions promise a  whole  host  of

things,  from scaring away evil spirits  to  bringing

good   luck  and  fortune  to  the  family  and   the

household, not to forget that noise-making  has  been

part and parcel of the local mode of celebrations. In

fact,  Sir,  in funerals we happen to make  the  most

noise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, therefore, would spend money to bring good

luck    to    Government-owned   designated   places.

Fortunately,  these superstitious exercises  remained

as   superstition,  for  otherwise,  those  who  took

advantage  of  that `leeway' would have succeeded  in

bringing  good  fortune  to  the  designated  places,

perhaps  even raised the land value which, of course,

must  consequently  be put up for  tender  under  the

Urban Renewal Schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this `leeway' proved to be neither here nor

there. Eventually, as a result of a nasty accident, a

total ban was slammed. The nett result of that short-lived

concession  was a 100% disagreement  from  the

populace.  For those who favoured total banning,  the

frightening sound of crackers could still be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



heard;  and  for  those who refused to  warm  up  the

designated  places, they were utterly frustrated.  So

much  for one example of Government understanding  of

our culture and tradition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak without inhibition now, and

as  the Minister for Health is not here, it is not my

intention  to dispute the success of family  planning

in Singapore. On the contrary, I am confident that we

will  achieve  our target even more effectively,  now

that  the programme has been reinforced, I hope, with

new  vigor  and approach by the present Minister  for

Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time, Members will remember, when there

was  great  hullabaloo in this House on the  subject.

Hon.  Members will recall the day when the House  was

entertained  to some very amusing definitions  as  to

what an ideal family should be. Briefly, we were told

that  a one-child family would be too lonely for  the

poor  child; two would of course be most ideal; three

would  be  a luxury; four would be unpardonably  anti

social, and five, God forbid, criminal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population problem, in Singapore's context, is a

problem  not unrelated to Asian values. If a  Western

solution is the only feasible solution to this  Asian

problem, so be it. It has got to be done, and  so  it

must  be  done. I do not think that our people  would

quarrel with the concept, or even with the incentives

or  disincentives.  But the explanation,  propaganda,

publicity and exhortations must necessarily be Asian.

There   are  equally  convincing  axioms   in   Asian

teachings  and philosophies to get our people  around

to adopt family planning without resorting to threats

and name-calling. Here again is what I suspect to  be

another WOG thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent examples of WOGs at work in Government

policies are abundant, but it may be a relief for our

Ministers  in the Front Bench to note that  they  are

not alone in the pursuit of this title. In fact, only

yesterday,  they were mirrored in the appeal  by  one

such  latest exponent. This time, however, the  title

award must go to none other than the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



Member for Telok Blangah, who so seriously advocated,

of  course, with detectable traces here and there  of

imperfect  imitation of the Dale Carnegie style,  for

the implementation of Daylight Saving Time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am no geographer, neither am I a pilot. But I

do  know that Singapore is approximately situated  at

Lat. 1 degree 21 minutes from the equator, and if  it

pleases  the hon. Member for Telok Blangah.  I  might

add  that we are north of the equator, where the  sun

rises  every  morning at about 6 am, and  sets  every

evening  around  6.45  to  7.00 p.m.  Daylight  saving

certainly is useful to countries further to the north

of the equator, such as the United Kingdom. (The hon.

Member  for Telok Blangah might even tell us that  he

knows  exactly the latitude of London.) I was a  poor

geography  student  and I did not  quite  get  myself

round to the coordinates of longitudes and latitudes.

Sir,  the  episode does not end here. A colleague  in

this  House, who happens to be on the other  side  of

the  House, suggested to me out of kindness  that  an

alternative  might  well be to  advance  the  working

hours  by  one hour. Sir, in fact, last  evening,  we

were trying to extend the time up to 6 o'clock and  I

was  thinking that we ought to be home for dinner  at

not  to  forget,  that would be after  two  hours  of

recreation. Sir, that was a suggestion with the  hope

that  it  would not upset everybody or confusing  the

geographers or the pilots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received the suggestion with some reservation, as

I  am  conscious  of  my  official  position  in  the

Ministry   of  Labour,  under  which  portfolio   the

question  of  working hours sometimes  constitutes  a

rather  unpleasant  subject in negotiations.  I  will

therefore  leave  it to this kind  Gentleman  on  the

other  side of the House to muster sufficient courage

to  appease  the hon. Member for Telok  Blangah  with

that proposal. But to be fair to that Member, Sir,  I

did  caution him that in the event he decides to risk

his  reputation  in  offering this  counter  proposal

seriously, his arguments had better be of  such  high

standard  so  that  he may not, at  the  end  of  the

exchange of the conversation, emerge as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



being one who is bemoaned of lacking in eloquence and

found wanting in wisdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must apologise to the House for wasting your

time by dwelling too lengthily and ironically on  the

question  of saving time by wasting your time.  Allow

me now to acquaint you with a game which I shall call

`cancelling-out' for the time being until we  find  a

better  name.  The players in this game  involve  two

parties,  namely,  the Ministry of Education  and  of

course, its worthy opponent

-  the  Ministry of Culture. [Laughter]  Let  us  not

laugh  and dismiss this game too lightly, because  in

the  end, we, the spectators, will turn out to be the

real losers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the game is very simple. The principle is:

Whatever  you  can  do,  I can  cancel.  Accordingly,

whatever the Ministry of Education does, the Ministry

of  Culture promptly cancels out with an equally, and

sometimes more effective counter-action. This process

is then repeated with the procedure reversed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first weigh the stake which we stand to lose

so  that  we  can  watch the game with  more  vested

interests. If this rather stupid game does not stop,

I  fear  that the more successful the Ministries  of

Education and Culture in their efforts to -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on a point of clarification.  I  just

wish  to question the Member for Kampong Chai  Chee.

He  was  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Culture. We would like to know which side he  is

speaking for and whether he was cancelling  out  the

Ministry of Education,



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I left the Ministry

of  Culture  about five years ago. When  I  left  the

Ministry, it was in a happier state, Sir, I am  quite

confident in saying that at that time the cancelling-out

exercise was never mooted and it was a very much

happier  Ministry.  After  I  left,  I  cannot  vouch

whether  this Ministry is indeed the same as  before.

Apparently it is not, Sin, because now the cancelling-out

exercise is so blatant and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



shall  relate  more  later, I had expected  the  hon.

Minister for Health to take me on family planning.  I

was caught.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, now that I am

here I will be very happy to listen to the Member for

Kampong  Chai Chee on his remarks on family planning.

I can enlighten him. I can also send him to my Family

Planning Population Board for advice, if necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I am sorry. Sir, the hon. Minister

missed  the  boat, as I' have mentioned  it  earlier.

Lest    he   gets   anxious,   those   remarks   were

complimentary. I think I should know better, Sir,  if

you know what I mean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to go on, Sir. As I was saying, if this

rather  stupid  game does not stop, I fear  that  the

more  successful  the  Ministries  of  Education  and

Culture  in  their efforts to "imbibe the  tried  and

tested  Asian  cultural and moral values",  the  more

they are successful, the more resentment we will have

to   face.   There  will  be  more  antiestablishment

sentiments,   not  so  much  due  to  the   lack   of

understanding of our national problems on the part of

the  people,  but  due  to our  own  default  in  not

understanding them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, Sir, the questions that we should ask

ourselves  are:  Just  what  are  these  values   and

traditions  that are so vital to our  survival  as  a

nation?  And how are we going to achieve these  great

objectives set out for us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No attempt has been made in the Addenda to list out

what  those values, culture and traditions are.  Even

if  the  Ministries did try, there must  be  so  many

contradictions  rendering  the  exercise   a   wholly

frustrating one. This might well be a case of the 10,

in  this game two blind men trying to decide what  an

elephant looked like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, their handicap left us with

nothing but disorientated compasses with which we are

to take part in this cultural treasure-hunt. The most

profitable approach in this confusion, I presume, is

by taking stock of what has been going on and take a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



count on the scoreboards of these two players.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should begin with a conclusion already at

hand.  This  approach certainly appears  odd,  rather

unprofessional, even unenlightened and unorthodox  to

begin studying a problem. The conclusion is:

discourage all traditional operas, or wayangs as they

are  known,  at  least  make it difficult  for  their

stagings,  because  this will  be  the  best  way  to

`encourage' one aspect of cultural heritage which our

people are endowed with - by killing it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture, of course, pledged:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to organise a wide range of activities to promote a

better  appreciation of our cultural  heritage.  This

will  provide  our young with the necessary  cultural

ballast against the erosion of traditional norms  and

values.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what are these norms and how wide is this wide

range  of  activities? Music, or  Art  for  Everyone,

lyrics competitions? How are these activities able to

provide the cultural ballast?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer, if possible, would be welcome. If not,

then   may  I  venture  to  provide  one:  All  these

utterances have been repeated year after year in this

House.  The  result:  rampant drug  abuse,  still  no

cultural ballast in sight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To define the meaning of "traditional", the Ministry

preceded by stating that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is Government policy to develop Singapore's rich

cultural  heritage derived from the  Malay,  Chinese,

Indian and western civilisations'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Western civilisation enjoys the confidence of the

Ministry of Culture and becomes acceptable as part of

our   tradition.  Interestingly,  the   Ministry   of

Education  has  different ideas.  It  stated  in  its

Addendum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...they will be taught not to adopt the life styles and

values  of the West that are alien and pernicious  to

Singapore society.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this is genuinely the case of the right

hand not knowing what the left hand is doing, because

if  indeed one hand knows exactly what the other hand

does, then this mutually cancelling-out exercise must

give rise to doubts as to the seriousness and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



sincerity of the Government in our cultural policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now take a look at a few more scores in this

game that has been going on for too long a time.  The

schools encourage our young to be thrifty and this is

challenged  by the television which advises  them  to

buy,  or  pester their parents to buy  what  they  or

their  parents do not need. The school says you  must

save  money and open a POSB account, and the same  TV

teases you and the parents by suggesting why wait for

such a long time to get so little money, buy Toto and

your problems will be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school reminds our children that there is no

substitute  for  hard work, do not try  to  get  rich

quick.  But  the TV says, "Decidedly wrong!  The  Big

Sweep    is   the   alternative".   In   fact,    the

advertisements for Toto and the Big Sweep sounded  so

convincing that few people regard it foolish  not  to

throw  away a good portion of their salary so as  not

to be left out as non-starters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education regards Western life

styles   and  values  as  alien  and  pernicious   to

Singapore.  The  TV, however, offers effective  anti-thesis

to this proposition, one of which is  through

the  sometimes  less than tasteful advertisement  for

new jeans. They say new generation jeans but they  do

not  tell you the period between two generations.  Is

it six months or one year? So you buy new jeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Ministry of Education takes great pains

in  including in its curricula subjects such as music

appreciation, even resuscitate Civics under the cover

of  Education  for  Living, and  finally  the  annual

gigantic  Youth Festival. But the TV holds  steadfast

to  their  ground.  TV programmes have  been  equally

successful in forcing down our throat poorly produced

so  called local cultural shows, stuffed with  crazy,

frequently `electrifying' dances. Electrifying indeed

they  are - if only we can find out why those healthy

and able-bodied young men and women struggle in agony

resembling electric shocks or anything but  what  the

Education Ministry thinks of cultural dances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now come to the interesting part. Refusing

to be sidelined in this cancelling-out ingenuity, the

Ministry of Education also shoots into its own  goal.

To  encourage thrift, for example again, they  change

text  books  even  more frequently than  they  change

their Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its zeal to recover its tarnished image, the

Ministry of Education boldly stated in its

Addendum:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The education system has been revised to improve

its  effectiveness. Consequently the enormous wastage

II  underline) in terms of pupils not benefiting from

the  system  and  having to leave school  prematurely

will be drastically reduced'



<br><br>Is  this an ideal, or is it not, as it sounded in the

addendum,  a statement amounting to an indictment  of

all the previous efforts of the so many Ministers for

Education?   Enormous  wastage  will  be  drastically

reduced. That means in the past there must have  been

enormous wastage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of our education can best be reflected

in  what  one  hon. Member described  to  me  as  the

`Goondu'  TV  shows,  at which generous  prizes  were

given  away  to hide embarrassment. In  this  series,

simple  questions were asked of the participants  and

invariably, astounding, if not outraging answers were

promptly  proffered. Blessed is the poor  goondu  who

finds  the right answer to the question on  how  many

Ministers for Education there were in the  last  17

years!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mischiefs of WOGs unfortunately, are only one of

the  shots  in a double barrel gun. The  Housing  and

Development  Board  rightfully claims  the  right  to

trigger off the second shot. This time it is not WOG,

but  Santa Claus is at fault. Building decent  houses

for the people is the responsibility of the Board and

it  was  for this need that the Board was established

in  1960.  Whilst it is true that the Board has  done

much in what its Chief Executive is paid for, success

has  carried them away to the extent that  they,  and

only  they, are the saviours of Singapore. The  Board

is the philanthropist for whom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



hon. Members in this House must labour in return  for

its kindness!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are not capable to advise  the  Board,

still  less  influence  its  policy.  We  have   been

assigned  a  task  only to explain its  actions  and,

worse  still, to justify its misdoing. Sir, we  stand

on  the  platform. They do not. So we have to justify

their misdoings. This, I am sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

not  a  complaint only personal to myself.  The  hon.

Member  for Changi spoke on his part of the  woes  in

this  House  yesterday, and I am sure  other  Members

will also certainly have their share of woes too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mention is made in the Ministry of National

Development  Addendum under the subject  on  "Housing

and  Public  Projects" as to how the HDB proposes  to

alleviate  the  plight  of  the  one-roomers.   Other

housing estates may not be that bad, but if you go to

Manila  Street  you will find that you have  communal

kitchens.  Then you will know what it is. Many  years

ago,  I  cautioned  in this House that  the  one-room

units would degenerate into slums over a short period

of   time.   No   heed  was  paid  to   Parliamentary

discussion. To the HDB, we appear to them as  nothing

more than a debating society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind whoever lives under that illusion that

we  in  this  House survive because of his  or  their

works,  will  certainly  be  very  grossly  mistaken.

Again,  Sir,I cautioned about the high  plot  ratio

commercial  development  at the  city  centre,  which

inevitably  must generate a high volume  of  traffic,

particularly  the  Shenton Way and  the  Golden  Shoe

area. Today, we have the CBD restriction and the Area

Licensing as our jackpot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been a different matter if public

applicants  from the traditional slum areas  were  to

apply  for  HDB accommodation, but the  one-roomers

are,  hon. Members will agree, if I were to  describe

this  short-sighted design of first generation  flats

as  Government Planned Modernised Slum. Has  not  the

HDB  an  obligation to do something  for  these  poor

folks?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite repeated appeals by Members of Parliament,

the HDB has been completely oblivious to the problem.

From  recent  statements, we have been  assured  that

action  will  be taken to resettle these  one-roomers

into  larger units, but the whole process would  take

three  to  four years. Is this not an admission  that

the  HDB  has not been responding to appeals  by  MPs

until recently?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various proposals were offered. One involved the

conversion  of these one-room units into larger  two-room

units by combining them; another was to demolish

a  number  of blocks to make way for green areas  and

playing fields - this is a deficiency in planning now

requiring rectification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be worthwhile for HDB to take note of

Members'  views, if they accept that Parliament,  not

their  drawing office, is the supreme  body  in  this

Republic. I must state that in this matter, we  shall

not succumb to their whims and fancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for us to look far for inspirations

to  this  conversion programme. These one-room  units

can easily be retained and converted for a variety of

uses, to name only a few:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Homes for the Aged - The design of these units

is ideal for conversion into dormitories for the aged

so  that they can live as part of the community in  a

HDB  estate, without having to suffer the feeling  of

being  treated as castaways in some remote homes.  In

all  probability, some of these units might  actually

be  so  converted,  because I have great  confidence,

very rare confidence though, in the HDB's ability  in

quickly  responding to the recent calls for the  care

of the aged made by so many Ministers. One up for the

HDB on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A less rewarding proposition for the HDB. For

areas  urgently  in  need of  community  centres  and

lacking  in  suitable sites a conversion may  be  the

most     expeditious    solution,    although     the

superstructure  may  present some technical  problems

but these are not insurmountable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Conversion of some of these units to provide for

alternative accommodations for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



civic  organisations affected by development  schemes

or  urban renewal protects. One must not forget  that

our  civic organisations, whilst handicapped  by  old

fashioned  management methods, have proved themselves

to  be  useful and effective in serving the community

in  the  past. I have no doubt that given help,  they

will  continue to be so in the future. Through  their

mutual  assistance,  such as  scholarship  for  their

members'  children, they have been able to partially,

maybe  negligibly,  relieve the State  of  the  heavy

burden  on education and social services. It is  only

too  unfortunate  that nobody thought  it  useful  or

necessary  to  make  fuller  studies  into  the  more

positive aspects of their works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Resettlement Department is the most

controversial unit in this glamorous HDB outfit. This

Department  is even more hard-pressed to perform  the

dual  functions of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. A not  very

helpful Dr Jekyll but certainly a monstrous Mr  Hyde.

I will tell you why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dr Jekyll role is portrayed through the

hypocritical claim of help given to those affected by

redevelopment.  The  common  claim  is   that   those

affected  and entitled to resettlement benefits,  are

reminded  that they enjoy concessionary  rents,  etc.

Let  me say that these concessions are no concessions

at  all.  They  are  entitlements. These  people  are

entitled to these so-called goodies because they have

been uprooted from their steady livelihood, having to

plunge into uncertainties in the new environment  and

to  re-establish themselves once again.  It  is  only

over  and above all these `concessions' that the  HDB

can then justifiably claim to offer concessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hyde's role is understandably less humane.

Permanent residents are not entitled to rehousing nor

business  premises. I agree that permanent  residents

should  not  be  entertained when  applying  for  HDB

accommodation  under  the normal public  application,

but in the case of resettlement, it is highly immoral

that they be deprived of alternative housing or place

of  business.  After all, the HDB  requires  them  to

quit,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



otherwise  they are quite contented with  the  status

quo, and pose no burden on the HDB, knowing that they

do   not  qualify  for  HDB  accommodation  which   I

understand  about  95  to  100  thousand  of  citizen

families are on the waiting list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, with a grand

example of how hypocritical one can be. Here,  may  I

call to mention the recent good deeds of our MPs,  so

publicised  in the newspapers, notably our Ministers,

going  round their constituencies offering  gifts  to

the  old  folks  so  that it has  been  so  gallantly

claimed that the less fortunate people may also enjoy

the  forthcoming new year. This is an  annual  affair

and I salute those who do so much and so consistently

over all these years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In resettlement action, however, being old and worse

still,   alone,   is  a  sin  and   consequently   an

obstruction as far as the HDB is concerned. A single,

old  aged citizen, I emphasize old aged citizen, will

not be able to secure an alternative accommodation on

his  own.  He  is compelled to go round the  affected

neighbourhood    to   look   for   another    equally

unfortunately, lonely, old soul so that if they  both

agree, they may jointly be allocated a one-room unit.

But  if he happens to be the only such outcast,  (the

term  is what I suspect the HDB regards him as  such.

It  is not my term, Sir) then he is left to fend  for

his twilight years in the streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> In the slums!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> In the slums. Would you be able to

accommodate them? I know where to send animals to now

-  to  community centres. But I do not know where  to

send the old people to, I know I can send animals  to

the  Telok  Blangah  community centre  if  it  has  a

menagerie. But old people are not animals.  They  are

human beings.

They  are senior citizens and here they have to  fend

for  themselves in the streets. Even if this poor old

man  or  woman  has a son, who unfortunately  is  not

staying  with  him  or with her  for  one  reason  or

another, but keeps on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



discharging  his filial responsibility of maintaining

his  father's or mother's livelihood, the old  fellow

is  not  allowed to bring in his son or  daughter  to

form  a  family  unit  for  rehousing,  but  he  must

necessarily seek to put up with a total stranger,  if

he finds one, that is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for our double-standard show or care and

sympathy for our senior citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, just quote one last example? Many years

ago,  in reply, to a question by the hon. Member  for

Punggol,  the former Minister for Finance  said  that

claiming income tax relief for aged parents -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> For maintenance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> - for maintenance of aged parents

was  regarded as mercenary because it is  the  filial

responsibility  of the young to look after  the  old.

Asian  society values again, Sir,I would  have  been

quite   satisfied  with  the  former   Minister   for

Finance.Unfortunately,  our  present   Minister   for

Finance  has  found  the formula.  Asian  values  and

filial  piety can now be quantified; first,  by  $500

and  now  by  $750. So this is our responsibility  to

look after the aged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say how much I appreciate

your  patience in allowing me to take the  Floor.  To

you,  Sir, I render my respect, not so much  for  the

authority of the Chair, to which I always submit, but

for  your age and wisdom in your person that commands

your position.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

rising  to  support  the  Motion  of  thanks  to  the

President, moved by the hon. Member for Ulu Pandan, I

am  also  expressing the sentiments of the  community

leaders  and  constituents in Potong  Pasir,  who  so

overwhelmingly voted for the People's Action Party at

the recent election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to extend

to  you, Sir, my congratulations for being re-elected

Speaker.  The  unanimity of the  House  in  your  re-election

is  a  clear reflection  of  the  excellent

manner in which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



you have always conducted the affairs of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meeting, Sir, in this Fourth Parliament is

undoubtedly  an occasion of gratitude for  the  total

victory of the People's Action Party at the polls and

of  satisfaction  that our policies have  once  again

been  endorsed  by  the  electorate.  Our  happiness,

however,  has been diminished by the tragic  loss  of

the  Member for Radin Mas, who in the summer  of  his

life, has left vacant his seat in the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice, as I remember, resounded vigorously in

and out of Parliament, many a time, for the cause  of

his constituents and the workers of Singapore. As  an

hon.   Member  and  a  trade  unionist,   he   worked

unselfishly and unstintingly to improve the  standard

of  living  and  quality of life of those  under  his

charge, despite the fact that his tired and sick body

could  no  longer take the pressures necessitated  by

his  dedicated life. He spent the evening  before  he

died  -  he  passed away in the small  hours  of  the

morning  -  in his constituency, giving away  Chinese

New   Year  ang  pows  to  those  in  less  fortunate

circumstances, I will miss him much, in  and  out  of

the House, as I am sure many will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the opening of the Third

Parliament    in    October    1972,    international

developments   have  had  serious  repercussions   on

Singapore,  and  today Singapore  and  the  Southeast

Asian  region  are  facing  a  whole  range  of   new

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, the President's Speech and Addenda

indicated  optimism, with expectations  of  continued

economic growth and better lives for our citizens. We

were  then  enjoying a mini-boom and the Ministry  of

Finance,  indicating continued economic  growth,  was

able  to  assure us that there was no  need  for  any

major  increases  in taxation or revenue  collection.

However,  that prediction and euphoria did  not  last

long.  We were overtaken by circumstances beyond  our

control by inflation, increases in the price  of  oil

and  international economic depression, resulting  in

lower economic growth, the threat of unemployment and

social insecurity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that the world in general has

been able to cast off the shackles of stagflation and

the  future looks brighter than it did two years ago,

new  problems, that may rock the very foundations  of

democratic societies in this region, are foreseeable,

and  we have to be firm in our resolve to resist  and

repel   attempts   to  undermine  and   destroy   our

independence, our way of life and our security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the communist victory in Indochina, the

democratic governments of neighbouring countries have

been  threatened  overtly and  covertly  by  external

aggression  and  internal  insurgencies,   and   with

physical  and  moral support to communist  terrorists

within.  We  in  Singapore have to be ever  vigilant;

there  must  be  no  let-up in our internal  security

measures.  We  must not be misled by  the  peace  and

tranquillity enjoyed by all in Singapore,  which  has

only  been  made possible by the firm measures  taken

during the past years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are only a few miles away from the hot-bed of

terrorist  activities and our people must  be  warned

and  constantly reminded of the speed with which  the

communists can mount acts of terrorism against us  as

they have done in the neighbouring states of Thailand

and  Malaysia. We must be on our guard at  all  times

and  never  be lulled into a false sense of security.

Otherwise, all that we have worked for, all that  our

citizens  have striven for, all that they have  built

over  the  last  17  years will  be  destroyed  by  a

communist  take-over. We have only to  take  note  of

what  has  happened in Cambodia after  the  communist

take-over and the recent acts of violence on the Thai

border, to realise the sort of treatment that will be

meted  out  to our people if we are not vigilant  and

allow   communist  infiltration.  I  am,   therefore,

grateful to the prominence and emphasis given to  the

need of security in the Presidential Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in sharp contrast to the optimistic tenor of

the  President's  Speech in 1972, we  have  now  been

warned  to prepare for a slower growth rate and  have

been   advised   to   adjust  our   spending   habits

accordingly both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



as  a Government and as individuals. The Government's

decision  to  economise  in governmental  expenditure

became  noticeable  during the past  year.  It  is  a

matter of regret, however, that Singaporeans have not

learnt  to similarly restrain their spending  habits.

In fact, one could say that spending habits are still

indifferent and reckless, tending towards adoption of

Western contemporary life styles, which do no good to

our  citizens and our country. Indulgence in wasteful

spending  can  be clearly seen in the market  places,

shopping complexes, restaurants and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last Sunday, one of our local newspapers

exposed  the gullibility of Singaporeans who, because

of  a  desire to be up-to-date and fashion-conscious,

have  succumbed  to advertising expertise  and  high-pressure

salesmanship, and beguiled into  purchasing

locally-made  jeans and jackets, which are  exported,

labelled  with  a foreign trade mark, re-exported  to

Singapore and sold at prices about five to six  times

the  original  cost of production  in  our  Singapore

factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own mass media, especially our television, has

in  no  small measure contributed to this unnecessary

spending  and wasteful habits among our citizens.  We

seem  to  be succumbing to the phenomenon  common  in

developing  countries,  where  the  imported  product

acquires snob value, mainly because it costs more and

partly  because people wish to ape the  life  in  the

West,  in the mistaken belief that the West  are  the

trendsetters of fashion with a sophisticated  way  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that Singaporeans, falling prey to

high-pressure   salesmanship  and  advertising,   are

squandering  their hard-earned money by indulging  in

wasteful habits. If we are not careful and our people

not   warned, we  could  be  completely  misled  and

cheated.  I read recently an account of the  exploits

of  two enterprising young businessmen who decided to

take advantage of the American consumers gullibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



Realising that they could sell anything to Americans,

if  the  goods  were packaged well and  attractively,

they made a fortune by selling 450 gms of plain earth

for  $25.00.  They  sold them  as  potting  soil  for

plants,  in  chic  little  bags.  In  this  game   of

exploiting  the  gullibility  of  consumers,  I  must

reiterate that our RTS is where the shoe pinches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commercial television service appears to be

guided   only   by   the  amount  of   revenue   that

advertisements bring in and is not concerned with the

type of advertisements. This matter. I must add,  has

been mentioned in this House before and seems to have

fallen  on  deaf  ears.  For  example,  although  the

Government  has  introduced  a  ban  on  tobacco  and

cigarette advertisements and discourages smoking, our

television    commercial   service   quite    happily

advertises  cigarette lighters, which  is  a  product

ancillary to smoking. And, of course, there are other

misleading  advertisements, very skilfully portraying

unnecessary  products,  such  as  expensive  imported

apparel, etc., with jingles to promote their sales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of Finance

indicates that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singaporeans can enjoy an increasingly higher

standard  of living because we can pay for our  needs

in  food, housing, education and health and for  more

and better goods and services`



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an encouraging assurance which will be

welcomed by all. The increase in our GDP, which makes

possible  a  higher standard of living and  a  better

life,  represents the sum total of the output of  all

in  our Republic. The largest contributor to our  GDP

is  the industrial sector and we should therefore not

forget that the productivity of the industrial sector

represents   ultimately  the  productivity   of   the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be remembered as we enjoy the fruits

of  our industry, that our industrial progress,  has,

because  of certain omissions taken an undue toll  of

human  suffering in mangled limbs and lives. Remedial

action is called for immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore developed an industrial economy

during the past 17 years. In the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



process,  new  forms  of  machinery,  new  forms   of

production,  new  forms  of  construction  have  been

introduced  in our Republic. They have  brought  with

them attendant hazards for the workers - the man  who

operates  the  machines, the  man  who  services  and

repairs  the  ships, the man who works  on  high-rise

buildings and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, about 15 years ago, there were hardly

any  high-rise buildings. Construction was then quite

simple.   Wooden  scaffoldings  were   adequate   for

construction  work. Steel girders seldom  had  to  be

hauled  up to high places. Today, we have 30- to  40-

storey buildings springing up all over the Island and

wooden   scaffolding  is  quite   inadequate.   Metal

scaffoldings are necessary as steel girders  have  to

be  hauled to very high places. The whole concept  of

construction has changed and brought with it  dangers

to  the  workforce. But it is most  regrettable  that

very little has been done to retrain our workers  who

were  used  to the former methods of construction  to

cope with the new situation. Old habits die hard  and

this  has  resulted in a number of serious  accidents

and  deaths.  There has clearly been an  omission  on

somebody's  part to retrain our workers for  the  new

situations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Mr Speaker, Sir, Government legislation

has   been  very  slow  in  catering  for   the   new

developments.   It  is  not  as  if  the   Ministries

concerned were unaware of the hazards facing  workmen

in  the  building  trade  as a  result  of  high-rise

development. They must have observed the patterns  in

countries with high-rise buildings before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in factories the workers are faced with a

whole  range  of  threats  to  life  and  limb   from

industrial machines. The safety measures required  in

the  factories can easily be adapted to our needs  by

observing what goes on in the factories abroad.  But,

insufficient has been done and our workers are paying

the penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can hardly blame workers on ships to appreciate

the  dangers of gas in the ships' holds  and  of  the

fires  that can be generated from a spark from  their

shoes, when the dangers have not been explained Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



workers  are simple-minded people who concentrate  on

the  job  and on productivity, and it is  up  to  the

employers and the Government to ensure that they  are

given  protection from the dangers of modern industry

and chemistry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that with the British pullout,

because it posed a major problem, it received serious

attention,  and among other things, training  schemes

were devised to retrain those who lost their jobs, to

fit    them    for    other   work,    But    because

industrialisation has gone on quietly and steadily in

Singapore, the re-training of our workers, to  enable

them to cope with new methods of production, with new

forms  of  machinery, has received  scant  attention.

Safety   measures   have  similarly   not   attracted

sufficient scrutiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the total percentage increase in the number

of   accidents  over  1974  was  an  alarming  18.8%.

Although for the same period the number of fatalities

dropped, the position is still not under control. The

1976 statistics is still to be made available by  the

Ministry  of  Labour, but as I understand,  there  is

still  a  marked  increase in  the  total  number  of

accidents last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States in 1959, the long-term trend of

declining  accident  rates  was  reversed   with   an

increase  in  industrial  activity,  influx  of   new

workers  and  a  more  rapid  introduction   of   new

processes and activities. Legislation was immediately

updated and comprehensively provides for measures for

the prevention of industrial accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, however, although there was generally

little increase in industrial activity, in the influx

of  new workers, etc, the percentage of accidents, as

I have said earlier, has increased tremendously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, attitudes have yet to be

changed.   Employers   show   little   interest    in

implementing  safe  working methods,  self-regulatory

systems, and in providing satisfactory safety apparel

and   a   safe  working  environment,  with  machines

regularly  maintained and guarded. Workers also  lack

safety consciousness, sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



disobey safety rules and regulations and fail to  put

on personal protective equipment while on the job. In

addition,  the  enforcement machinery lacks  adequate

strength   in  numbers,  discipline  and  dedication.

Inspections at factories and pressure vessels  seldom

result    in   severe   action   being   taken    for

contraventions of legislation. Similarly, seldom  are

effective  recommendations made to  alleviate  common

ailments  such  as poor house-keeping and  misuse  or

lack  of  safety appliances which could quite  easily

result in accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the important techniques of accident

prevention is the analysis of accidents to  determine

their  underlying causes so that positive action  can

be   taken   to  prevent  recurrence.  The   American

Standards   Association  provides  a  procedure   for

selecting,    classifying   and    summarising    the

fundamental  factors in accidents. The Annual  Report

of  the  Ministry  of  Labour  lacks  vision  in  its

statistical data and leaves little room for employers

and workers to pin-point the areas that need greatest

vigilance.  In  addition,  it  must  to  some  extent

handicap  the Factory Inspectorate in its enforcement

and  accident prevention duties. Before judgment  can

be  made  about  the  magnitude of  the  occupational

disability problem, aggregate data on the  number  of

injuries  and  deaths must be standardised.  To  draw

comparisons  between industries and  plants  or  even

between  departments  in  a plant  or  factory,  such

standardised  data  would be of  tremendous  positive

value  in  preventive  action. Standardised  accident

frequency  and severity rates therefore should  be  a

part   of  the  responsibility  of  statutory  Safety

Committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, registered with the Social Welfare Department

are more than 10,000 handicapped or disabled persons.

By  modest estimates, there could be as many that are

not registered. Their disablement is congenital or as

a  result of the toll taken by industrialisation.  Of

those   registered,  more  than  4,000  are  in   the

employable age-range.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



A quota scheme for the employment of disabled persons

is  necessary. The scheme has to be strictly enforced

if  it  is  to be successful and employers should  be

required  to  make quarterly returns  indicating  the

percentage   of   disabled  persons  employed.   Dis-incentives

could  perhaps be  introduced  to  ensure

compliance with the quota scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those that are not employable should be given

realistic public assistance, This would also  include

the  aged.  It  is right not to encourage  misuse  of

public  assistance by increasing its quantum to  such

an  extent  as  to  make  it  attractive  enough  for

citizens  to cease supporting their aged or disabled.

Incentives introduced to ensure such support could be

introduced. But where such incentives cannot  benefit

those  who support the aged and disabled, the quantum

of   public  assistance  must  be  realistic,  Humane

treatment by civil servants of those receiving public

assistance is essential. I had occasion to take up  a

case  of a bed-ridden paralytic Constituent who lived

with  his unemployed, old and sick wife. Each  month,

she had to travel a good five miles from Jalan Potong

Pasir  to  collect her husband's allowance  from  the

Social  Welfare  Department. This  meant  a  one-mile

trudge   to   the  bus-stop  from  the  kampong,   an

unnecessary  waste of bus-fare, a long  wait  at  the

Social  Welfare  Department and the tiresome  journey

back home. All the while, her helpless husband lay on

his  back without her care, awaiting her return. Most

certainly,  the  authorities  concerned  could  quite

easily  have saved her the strain and cost by  making

available at her house the public assistance  due  to

them. To make matters worse, when she was admitted to

hospital    for   an   operation,   the    cost    of

hospitalisation   was  deducted   from   the   public

assistance  allowance leaving  them  a  mere  $20  to

survive  for  the month. This inhuman practice  turns

assistance  into cruelty. There surely must  be  many

other such cases which merit immediate attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real incentive to labour organisation is

the  control  of the work environment, stemming  from

the  realisation that control over the conditions  of

employment can be achieved only by workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



who become organised and who act collectively. Hence,

trade  unions  are the essential instrument  for  the

achievement  of collective freedom, which  is  itself

the   prerequisite   for  the  protection   and   the

advancement  of  the  individual  worker.  Throughout

their history trade unions have had to battle against

powerful enemies, not the least of which has been the

law.  The law seems to favour employers, and as such,

the  advantage they take against trade unions  leaves

much  to  be  desired. Employers  have  even  lowered

salary and fringe benefits to workers the moment they

are  organised in order to hit back at trade  unions,

If  there  is  to  be a continuation of  co-operation

among  Government, unions and employers to  ensure  a

united   contribution  to  economic  growth  by   the

promotion   of  a  stable  and  peaceful   industrial

relations climate, immediate steps must be  taken  to

ensure that employers do not act arbitrarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, job-hopping is not a symptomatic cure sought by

workers. It is also not a frivolity they are fond  of

indulging  in.  Let us look at the reasons  for  job-hopping

before we consider penalising job-hoppers  by

reducing   their  share  of  the  NWC  wage  increase

recommended.  If  the  reasons  for  job-hopping  are

justified,  I  do  not understand why  these  workers

should be penalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first reason that comes to mind for workers

who  job-hop  in Singapore is distance from  home  to

place  of work. With the rapid building of HDB  flats

and  many  workers  wanting  to  live  in  them,  the

tendency for them to move house is almost certain. In

addition,  many  of our workers are  young  and  earn

small  wages.  They usually live with their  parents.

With  greater number of people moving into HDB  flats

due  to resettlement and the need for them to improve

their living conditions, they will have to move  away

from  their  former abodes which in  most  cases  are

close to their working places. In addition, when they

marry, they normally make their own home, which means

movement  of both husband and wife from their  former

abodes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next reason is almost always due to inadequate

wages. One cannot penalise a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



worker who goes for another job that pays more. After

all, he is willing to give his best and why should he

not  receive  his worth? This situation  will  always

exist  in order that a competitive labour market  can

function   to   the  benefit  of  both  workers   and

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our workers who are not choosy and who

realise that a bird in hand is worth more than two in

the bush, accept jobs that they were neither educated

for nor trained for. After such time, when a suitable

job,  commensurate  with his  training  comes  along,

should he not be at liberty to change jobs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other legitimate reasons for changing

jobs, such as an unreasonable and tyrannical employer

who   makes   life  miserable  for  employees.   Such

circumstances do not warrant the penalty of a loss in

NWC  wage  increase recommendations, I must therefore

stress that Government should take heed not to  upset

the  labour  market  by applying constraints  on  the

individual's freedom to choose his own employment and

employer. After all, does not the employer  have  the

right  to hire and fire? So why should not the worker

also have the right to opt in or opt out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion

of the Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's speech, mention has been made

that  Singaporeans should formulate their own way  of

life. This is of particular interest to me. Over  the

last decade, we have been groping our way about for a

solution. Today we can say that we have found  a  way

out.  Just like what the English proverb says:  Where

there  is a will, there is a way. After some  effort,

we  have found a way out to a better future. It is to

learn  and  absorb Western science and technology  in

toto. By doing so, our life has bettered that some 10

years  ago. For instance, 10 years ago we built  many

one-room  units of flats to accommodate thousands  of

people. At that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



time,  this  sort of flats was considered  good.  But

today  these  flats do not appear to be good  enough.

During the last general elections this type of  flats

had  been  given  an airing of views, Our  candidates

made a promise in the general elections saying, "All.

right,  we  will  modify these one-room  flats."  The

Government has to improve them by converting two such

units into one bigger unit. Otherwise people will not

want  to  stay in such one-room flats. On  the  other

hand,  the  Government has to build four-room,  five-room

and even six-room flats. As the people like  to

live  in  them,  the Government is even  prepared  to

build luxurious flats and apartments as condominiums,

costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in order  to

satisfy  their  needs, This is obviously  in  keeping

with  our  economic progress and the success  in  our

family  planning. While the number of  members  in  a

family has become smaller, the living area of a  flat

has   become  larger.  In  the  newspapers   and   in

magazines,  interior  decorators  have  designed  the

layout  of  a  flat  for a family  of  four.  Besides

designing separate bedrooms for the parents  and  the

children, they have also provided a bathroom in  each

bedroom, or next to the hall a balcony is added.  The

rooms will be well ventilated and bright, and flowers

and  birds  have been added to turn the flat  into  a

paradise.  So now the urge to work hard in  order  to

make more money so as to raise the standard of living

has  become the norm as well as a factor for progress

in  this  pragmatic society. If we had discarded  the

principles   of  "reward  according  to  merit"   and

"distribution according to labour", our  construction

programme would not have progressed so fast.  In  our

present  more and more westernised family  structure,

usually  only two generations live together  separate

from  the  grandparents, just as what  our  textbooks

have now taught our pupils. We find that the children

are  taught that every morning when they get up  they

must  say  "good morning" to daddy and to mummy,  but

these  textbooks  do not include  "good  morning"  to

grandfather  and to grandmother. To the  majority  of

us, we have parents and children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



living together at the same time. The only difference

is  that under the western influence parents stay  at

one  place whereas we ourselves and our children live

at  another  place. So this has caused a twin  social

problem relating to two generations. On the one hand,

the  aged and weak parents have been forsaken by  the

children   and  some,  when  they  are   faced   with

difficulty  in  their  livelihood,  had  to  ask  the

Government  to put them into a home for the  aged  so

that  they could pass away their twilight years under

some shelter,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem is the case with young couples

with children. If the wife finds that she cannot  get

a housemaid to help in the household chores, she will

resign  from her employment to run the house  and  to

teach the children. In this way, the family budget is

increased while income is reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays in view of the increasing number of

Government  flats more and more children would  leave

their  parents to live separately when they are ready

to raise their own families, This gap between the two

generations resulting in the twin social problem  has

become  acute.  In  view  of  this  trend  in  family

structure,  I would like to ask the question  whether

Singaporeans  should accept in toto western  cultural

values  and  concepts.  To  me,  personally  I  think

western  science and technology is our life-line.  We

must endeavour to seek these for our own good. On the

other  hand,  we should not allow the individualistic

liberalism  produced in the very rich  West  to  form

part of our culture, because it will only divide  our

people  and weaken our thoughts and split our society

so  that we become poor, weak and cannot stand on our

own.  There  is  the  example of  Tan  Wah  Piow  who

illegally  entered England. All along in his  way  of

life and education he has been thinking that the moon

in the West is very round, much rounder than the moon

in  the  East. He does not know that the moon in  the

East  is  just  as round. Thus he is  imbued  with  a

dubious concept of values, which makes him think that

to  be born a foreigner and to die a foreign ghost is

very  glorious to him. What I want to  point  out  is

that  after  all we are Singaporeans living  in  this

strategic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



geographical area in Southeast Asia where western and

eastern  cultures meet, We have our own way of  life.

While  there  is  certain similarity with  the  West,

there  is  also some difference from the  West.  Even

when  compared with the Chinese, Indian or Indonesian

ways  of  life, there are differences in similarities

and  there are also similarities in differences.  But

these are our characteristics. This goes to show that

we are ourselves, Singaporeans, masters of ourselves.

We are not the play-things of the colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once more I support the Motion of the Member

for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the Motion standing in the name  of  the

hon. Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech has re-asserted the

Government's  position  that, other  than  education,

medical  treatment and housing, nothing else will  be

subsidised by the Government. This position has  been

well  understood  and largely accepted  by  the  vast

majority  of  Singaporeans,  otherwise  the   present

Government  would  not have been returned  to  office

with the highest percentage of votes cast in the last

six  general  elections. But what many people  cannot

understand  and have cause to grumble  about  is  why

they  are  sometimes made to pay over and  above  the

economic cost of certain commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the price of petrol. When oil

prices were increased by the OPEC countries in recent

years,   oil   companies  in   Singapore   made   two

adjustments  to  the  retail prices  of  petrol.  The

Government also at the same time increased  its  duty

on  petrol correspondingly. Was this not imposing  an

additional financial burden on the consumers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the tax surcharge on the

consumption  of  PUB utilities if  the  total  amount

exceeds  $30  per month. The rates have already  been

revised  by the PUB in line with the additional  cost

it  must  incur from increases in the price  of  oil.

People can accept the fact that their consumption of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



petrol  and  PUB utilities cannot be subsidised,  and

they  must  be  prepared to pay for'  the  periodical

increases in the costs of these commodities. But what

they  find it a little difficult to swallow is having

to  pay additional taxes over and above the increases

in economic costs that they have to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that in relation to the commodities such

as those I referred to, Singaporeans are not only not

subsidised  by  the Government but are  also  heavily

penalised by the Government for their consumption  or

use  of those commodities. Whatever may have been the

reason  for the Government to do this, the net effect

is  that all this additional tax burden is passed  on

by  the manufacturers, businessmen and shopkeepers to

the final consumers, most of whom are workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President stated in his address that the PAP won

in   all  the  69  constituencies  with  the  highest

percentage  of  votes cast in the  six  last  general

elections.  He  went  on to say  that  this  vote  of

confidence  imposes  a  heavy responsibility  on  the

Ministers  to  act fairly but firmly,  and  that  the

Government   will   exercise   its   authority   with

circumspection and moderation. This is most welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, life can never be too easy for the two

million-odd Singaporeans because of the political and

socio-economic  circumstances  we  are  in.  We  must

sometimes have tough policies to see us through if we

want  to  survive, prosper and progress as a  nation.

There  are  no  easy solutions to  the  problems  and

challenges  ahead  of us. This is  what  Singaporeans

have  been  told and what Singaporeans have accepted.

But  sometimes we are asked to swallow pills that are

unnecessarily   bitter;  at  least,   that   is   the

impression created. People do not expect the pills to

be  sugar-coated, but neither do they want them to be

more  bitter than is necessary. Take the case of  the

recent announcement by the Education Ministry that in

1979,  students entering Pre-University classes  must

have  attained certain standards in their  first  and

second  languages. I do not know what earthly purpose

can  this  move serve. Is it to achieve our objective

of a multi-lingual society? Or is it to raise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



academic standards of undergraduates? I really do not

know,  But  what I do know is that this is  going  to

impose  an additional and unnecessary strain  on  the

future  Pre-University  students.  By  imposing  this

requirement of proficiency in two languages,  how  is

it  going  to help our future Pre-University students

to   succeed  better  in  their  special  fields   of

university studies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Government not realise that a simple

statement  like that from the Education  Ministry  is

already  causing  such  a  widespread  anxiety  among

parents with children aspiring for further studies in

1979   and  thereafter?  The  parents  are  naturally

concerned over this recent announcement as it affects

their children's chances of securing a place not only

in  the  Pre-University classes but also, eventually,

in   the  Singapore  society.  Is  this  acting  with

circumspection and moderation? It may be too  extreme

to  dismiss it as a rash and an ill-conceived action,

but the element of consultation and public debate  on

the matter is conspicuously missing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest service that the Education authorities

can do for education perhaps is not to come out every

now  and then with some startling new ideas which may

cause  more  harm than good. Instead, the authorities

should  concentrate on testing every new scheme  more

carefully and thoroughly over a period of years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been several policy

decisions  in  the  past where the raison  d'etre  is

sound. But their implementation might sometimes  have

caused  unnecessary  hardship to  those  affected  by

them.  This  was  largely due to the over-zealousness

and  the  lack  of experience of those in  charge  of

implementing the policy decisions. Perhaps it is  not

just  the  future policies and actions of  Government

that   should  be  carried  out  in  moderation   and

circumspection. The Government should also review its

past  policies  and  actions to ascertain,  with  the

benefit  of hindsight, whether some of these policies

and  actions  can in fact be carried  out  with  more

circumspection and moderation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the Area Licensing Scheme. Will the

scheme not achieve the same purpose and objectives if

cars are allowed to enter the restricted zone at 9.45

a.m. or 10.00 a.m. instead of 10.15 a.m. as at present?

Can  we  not  achieve the same degree of  success  in

family  planning, if we do not insist  that  Catholic

schools take in children on the basis of priority for

those  with one of their parents sterilized, as  this

is  causing unhappiness and is a matter of  religious

conscience for 100,000-odd Catholics in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot the Government be a little more liberal in

granting   citizenship  to  the  more  deserving,   I

emphasise,  more  deserving, cases of  blue  identity

card  holders?  Whether we like it or not,  they  are

either  the sons or daughters, fathers or mothers  of

our  citizens, and they have nowhere else to  go.  We

allow  them  to  stay.  We  even  allow  them  to  be

considered  as part of the family unit when  applying

for HDB flats. Giving them the citizenship in many of

these  cases  is  not going to impose  an  additional

national  burden  on the Republic's  resources.  They

are, in fact, part of the national burden that we are

now carrying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no doubts that, in the issues such as I

have   mentioned,  the  Government  can  easily   and

profitably  review its past policies and  actions  to

take  off some of the unnecessary bitterness  of  the

pills  we must take for our nation's health  and  for

our individual health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech

delivered on the 8th February at the Opening of the

Fourth Parliament. The President has laid out the

various Government policies and guidelines to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



implemented  in  the next five years. These  policies

and  guidelines are very pragmatic and practical.  In

the  past  we have never had policies and  guidelines

more  realistic, more considerate to the  people  and

more  virtue-inspiring as those that have  just  been

presented in this Fourth Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book of the Great Learning of ancient

Chinese  Scholars  there is the teaching  that  great

learning  lies  in understanding the virtues,  loving

the people and arriving at that which is perfect.  It

means  to say that we must carry out good government,

love  the people like our own children, and  that  we

must  try  and do our best to look after the  people.

This is the way of good government valid universally.

As the seas and oceans are made up of water droplets,

countries are made up of people, the individuals. The

strength of the country lies in the security  of  the

people. Therefore, although state policies are  based

on  national interest as the first premise, they must

also  be  able  to  take into account  the  immediate

interest  of the majority of the people. That  is  to

say,  the implementation of state policies must  suit

the  interest  of the people in such a way  that  the

people  can bear it. That means we have to study  and

discuss all plans and policies in depth carefully  in

order  to understand the wishes and get the views  of

the people before implementing the policies, so as to

ensure  practicability and conformity. In  this  way,

all beneficial policies which are implemented will be

accepted by the people. If we can arrive at  a  state

where  the  people regard the State with respect  and

importance and the State looks after the people  with

esteem  and  care,  and there is harmony,  unity  and

cooperation  between the State  and  the  people  for

mutual progress, then it will be the great fortune of

both the people and the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the present international situation

which  has  great repercussions on  us  and  with  Mr

Carter's  assumption of office as  the  new  American

President,  there  is an air of  uncertainty  in  the

international scene. The Southeast Asian situation is

like-wise not clear. The Middle East problem  is  not

yet solved. The oil crisis is not over yet. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



whole  world  situation is in a state of fluctuation.

With  such  external  factors and internal  situation

before  us, we are faced with problems in formulating

and implementing Government policies laid down in the

speech  presented by the President. The way ahead  is

difficult, The future may not turn out to be what  we

all expect. However, we have the will and capacity to

survive  and  succeed. We have the experience  gained

from  the past years of independence to help  see  us

through.  We have once more been given such  a  heavy

mandate,  and so we must do our best not to  let  our

people down. But in circumstances beyond our control,

there may be some factors present to prevent us  from

achieving or what we have set out to achieve. In this

case it then becomes our bounden duty to explain  and

to  analyse  to the people what the causes  are  that

prevented us from achieving our goal. Civil  servants

also   have  to  take  up  the  challenge   and   the

responsibility to help the nation solve its problems.

They  also owe the people a duty to explain what  the

problems and hardships are. It is only when there  is

such  a  general understanding of the situation  that

the people will be enabled to continue to support the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experience gained in the last general

elections,  we  can  see  that  we  have   a   higher

percentage  of  support from the lower income  groups

compared to the earlier elections. This heavy mandate

placed on Members of Parliament means that we must be

fair  and  do our best to solve the problems  of  the

people. It is only then that we will not let down the

voters  who have put us in power. The PAP has  always

been  pragmatic.  We are known for  not  making  wild

promises.  In  spite  of  free  things  or  giveaways

promised by the opposition, our voters have the  guts

and  the  resolve  to discard these  wild  and  empty

promises  of free things but opted for self-reliance.

They  have instead voted us in, It is from the people

in the lower income group in the less developed parts

of  Singapore who have given us more votes than  ever

before. Without their support, we would not have been

able  to  get  72.4%, the highest percentage  of  the

total number of votes ever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



cast.  Since they have put such great trust on us  we

must also take special care of them, such as building

and  metalling  more  roads, installing  more  street

lights and creating more employment opportunities for

them. This is the bounden duty of the Government.

<br><br>5.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, now

that  the present Government has been re-elected,  it

should  not continue to do what it used to do in  the

past,  that is, to pass or implement many  heavy  tax

measures  and  levies within the  first  three  years

after the elections thus increasing the burden of the

people  affecting  their livelihood.  The  Government

should  not,  as it did before, continue to  increase

taxes  and  tariffs by decrees without any debate  in

this  House, particularly where such tax  and  tariff

increases affect the livelihood of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech the President said that Members of

this  House have "the duty to ensure that all  shades

of  opinion  out in the constituencies are vigorously

voiced in Parliamentary questions and debates."  This

is a very categorical and precious guideline which  I

believe Members of this House will happily accept and

implement with all earnestness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Shyn-Tze, an ancient Chinese philosopher said

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To know is better than not to know. To see is better

than  to know. To practise is better than to see.  The

end of learning is to practise. He who practises is  a

sage`



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this proverb, Sir, we are told that there are many

problems in the world which the common people may not

understand  fully.  It is only  those  who  have  the

experience,  who  have seen, and who have  practised.

will  they be able to appreciate the problems.  I  do

not  want to be a sage nor do I claim to be  a  sage.

Neither  do  my  colleagues in  this  House.  But  as

representatives of the people we have  the  duty  and

responsibility  to reflect the views of  the  people.

Particularly so, in this Parliament where all the MPs

belong  to  the  same Party and where the  Government

Whip  has been lifted so that we can freely and fully

reflect our views in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people hold the view that as

representatives of the people we enjoy high  prestige

and  a good life. But in my humble opinion that is  a

wrong concept. On the contrary, as representatives of

the  people,  we  act as the bridge of  communication

between the Government on the one hand and the people

on the other. The Government has its policies and the

people  have  their  difficulties.  Our  position  in

between  these two forces always makes  us  feel  the

pinch and the worse off. As MPs, we do not expect  to

be  rewarded for doing this. We do not expect  to  be

appreciated  or thanked for what we do.  In  my  many

years  of  service to the people as a Member  of  the

House, I can say that I understand this truth. If new

Members  have  the attitude of expecting  rewards  or

thanks  for doing a service to the people, they  will

be  greatly  disappointed. They  can  also  tell  the

people that it is not easy to be a Member of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



Parliament. But after the elections they would have a

different  view  to  what they  had  when  they  were

fielded  as  candidates,  because  they  would   have

realised that things are not completely within  their

control.  To  serve the people, you have to  dedicate

yourself to the point of making sacrifices and  this,

I  am sure, is the experience they have gained during

these past few months. Take the case of the late hon.

Member  for  Radin  Mas.  He dedicated  his  services

without  any expectation of reward or thanks.  During

his life time the late Member for Radin Mas dedicated

himself  to  the service of the people. Even  on  the

last  day of his life he went to his constituency  to

distribute ang pews to the old and needy people. This

is  the  kind  of Member of Parliament  who  will  of

course  command the respect of his constituents.  Now

that  he is dead, who will look after his family?  We

have to look up the Parliamentary Pensions Act to see

whether our late MP is due for any entitlement  under

this   Act.  If  there  is  no  provision  for   such

entitlement,  I  think an amendment  Bill  should  be

tabled  in  this House to ensure that an MP  who  has

rendered his services in the interests of the  people

will  have  something provided in  the  Act  for  his

family in the event of his death,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my career as a Member of

Parliament  I  have gone through different  kinds  of

experience at the elections. In 1963 I tasted defeat.

In  1968 and 1972 I had the experience of winning the

elections by contest and in 1976 I had another  round

of experience of the election in which I was returned

unopposed.  Some  people might say  that  I  had  won

without effort, and the newspapers also said that  we

got  it  without effort. Regrettably, even our  Petir

also  said  that  16 MPs have been  returned  without

effort. In other words, you got something without any

effort. But I would say that 1 5 MPs at least  cannot

be  included  in this category. There  is  only  one,

perhaps  the  new  MP, who can be said  to  have  won

without any effort.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> It is

not his fault!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But the 15 old MPs

cannot be classified in this category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have difficult responsibilities as MPs. In this

House,  we  spend a lot of time debating  the  policy

statement.  Before we can do that, we have  to  study

the  speech  and the addenda, and then  to  test  the

ground  by  finding out the views of the  people.  We

spend so much time and effort to get to the ground in

order to reflect their views in this House. The press

also  labours to carry out speeches. After all  these

efforts, my question is this: Do civil servants spend

as  much time to study the Hansard so as to find  out

how  problems  should be solved?  Or  how  the  views

reflected  by  MPs  in this House could  be  properly

dealt  with? Do they think that we come here just  to

make noise and to fill up a beautiful looking Hansard

without any follow-up action?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech the President

referred  to the simple truth that to get  from  each

his  best, rewards and recognition must go  to  those

who excel in consistently high performance. There  is

no  dispute  about  this simple  truth.  Rewards  and

punishment must be clear and well-defined. It is only

then  that the people will take the trouble of facing

all difficulties and to do what they are supposed  to

do  and be inspired with a forward-looking spirit for

excellence. Rewarding according to performance is, in

fact, a motivating measure for our national progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in the promotion and rewarding of civil

servants, the people are often given a bad impression

that  civil servants have been rewarded and  promoted

not  because  of  their outstanding  performance  but

because of their outstanding merit-seeking cum profit-making.

The plans and schemes proposed and submitted

by  such  civil servants are aimed at increasing  the

revenue and to curry favour with the Minister and  be

in  the good books of the Minister so as to secure  a

favourable  assessment of their  performance.  In  so

doing,   such   civil  servants  have  forgotten   or

overlooked the political consequences and  the  chain

of social problems that might be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



caused. In the case of the working class we have  the

Industrial  Arbitration Court to act as the  tribunal

to  judge  who  is to be properly rewarded  for  high

performance. In the case of the civil service,  there

is no such tribunal or proper authority to assess the

performance  or  the  merits  or  demerits  of  civil

servants.  We have a number of senior civil  servants

holding different corporate posts. According  to  the

Straits  Times of today, we can see that  Temasek  is

the biggest holding company in Southeast Asia with  a

number   of   subsidiaries,  including  SIA,   Keppel

Shipyard, Sembawang Shipyard, etc, all with Singapore

Government  participation. Who is the  Chairman?  SIA

Chairman  is also the Chairman of this giant  holding

company,  and  he  continues to be on  the  board  of

directors  of  so many other companies.  How  do  you

assess  the  actual performance of such a person?  If

you  want to know his actual performance, I will deal

with it in depth later on. There is a duplication  of

posts. The directors of the new Temasek Holdings  are

the directors of the other subsidiary companies under

the  Temasek  group.  Who is there  to  assess  their

performances  with such a duplication  of  directors.

You  have  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and  the

Estimates  Committee to examine public accounts,  but

there  is no such committee with the rights or  power

to look into the accounts of such companies. These so-called

directors  have  become  directors   without

contributing a single cent to capital. They  are  all

civil  servants  who  have become  directors  without

having to contribute any capital themselves, They are

different  from directors of private enterprises.  In

the  case of a private enterprise, if a person  wants

to  be the managing director or the Chairman, he  has

something  at stake or has a vested interest  whereas

civil  servants become directors without  any  vested

interest.  They  have  not contributed  any  capital.

There  is  nothing at stake. How many such  companies

have  lost  their business? There is no  report.  Who

looks into them? Nobody. Are they capable? How do  we

know  whether  or  not they are capable?  What  about

those companies that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



have suffered losses? We have the case of the Granite

House purchased in London which lost tens of millions

of  dollars  - public money contributed by  the  hard

work and sweat of the people of Singapore. And now we

have exonerated the director who had dealings in  the

Granite House affair and awarded him director-ship to

a  profit-making  company  elsewhere  -  chairman  of

Temasek  Holdings. Who can say that he is capable  or

not capable? There is no proper accountability in the

case  of a State-owned company. So you have one civil

servant  responsible for the failure of one  business

at one time and now promoted to another capacity in a

successful  company.  He is  thus  rewarded,  but  no

penalty for the failure of his action. So how can you

say  "to  each according to his worth"?  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  there are civil servants holding several posts.

Their plans and schemes for the Government are mostly

profit-orientated for their own credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the President also stated that "no

major  policy or legislation should be passed without

the  closest scrutiny and passed only after the  most

thorough debate" in this House. This again are  words

which we must pay heed to. However, my colleagues  in

the  previous Parliament sittings had also  reflected

their grievances and levelled criticisms against some

IegisIations  being rushed through the House  in  all

three  Readings without adequate time for  study  and

debate. This has been a very common occurrence.  Very

often  we come to this House after only a glimpse  of

the Bill itself when it was tabled. Where have we got

the time to study the Bill for a thorough debate?  In

a  case  like this, Members of Parliament  cannot  be

blamed  for  not having studied the Bills  and  other

measures.  You can blame the Ministers for this.  The

Minister  responsible for the Bill  should  supervise

its  drafting by civil servants. If the drafting  was

done  in a hurry, there will always be omissions  and

flaws  in the Bill. Sometimes more haste would result

in more delay. There were occasions when Ministers in

moving  the  Bills  were not  very  clear  about  the

legislative  principles and spirit therein.  So  very often



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



amendment  Bills had to tabled within  a  few  months

after passing the original Bills. This is well within

the knowledge and experience of many hon. Members  in

this  House. In some cases even Ministers responsible

for such Bills did not know the actual meaning of the

Bills  because  we  tell from their  answers  to  the

questions  raised by Members of Parliament  that  the

Ministers did not really know what they were saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are also examples to show

that  within  two  or three months of  a  Bill  being

passed in this House an Amendment Bill was brought in

again   to   look   after  a  certain   interest   or

deficiencies.  All  these are illustrations  to  show

that  when Bills are passed without a thorough debate

or  scrutiny,  the blame cannot be  entirely  put  on

Members  of  this House. The Ministers  have  also  a

certain measure of responsibiltiy for all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the reference to the Polytechnic

and other tertiary institutions as hotbeds or targets

of  recruitment  for  the Communist  Party,  this  is

something  that we must be vigilant about.  We  learn

from  experience that it is only when dissatisfaction

exists  that it can be made use of as a tool  against

the  Government  or  the  people.  According  to   my

understanding, the reasons for dissatisfaction  among

students of the Polytechnic and other institutions of

higher   learning   are  that   some   students   are

pessimistic   and   uncertain  about   their   future

employment  opportunities and are  dissatisfied  with

the existing conditions. Thus they lend themselves to

manipulation. Take Nanyang University,  for  example.

It  is  still fresh in our memory that from the  late

1950s  up to the early 1 960s Nanyang University  was

infiltrated by the communists. Nanyang University was

then  still under the old system. There was a feeling

of  dissatisfaction among the students then  and  the

situation  was  exploited  by  the  communists.   The

students were made use of for all kinds of agitation.

Thus,  Nanyang University was in a state  of  turmoil

and  unable  to make any headway. To remove  all  the

root  causes leading to the dissatisfaction, negative

prevention is not the basic solution The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



fundamental solution lies in the removal of the  root

causes  of  the dissatisfaction. We must resolve  the

students'   problem   of  employment   opportunities.

Students are also dissatisfied with their status quo.

We   must   look   for  a  proper  diagnosis   before

administering  medicine. Although the Government  has

accorded  equal  treatment to Nanyang University  and

the   University  of  Singapore,  frankly   speaking.

Nanyang University needs a Vice-Chancellor with drive

and some efficient senior executives of high academic

standing  in  order to raise academic  standards.  It

should  open its door to students of different  races

in  keeping with our national policy so that  Nanyang

University  may  develop to the  same  level  as  the

University   of   Singapore.   Ideally,   where   the

University  of  Singapore does not  want  to  conduct

certain  courses  they  can be conducted  at  Nanyang

University  and vice-versa. There must be cooperation

between the two universities and no duplication which

will  cause  wastage.  In this  way  the  feeling  of

dissatisfaction  can  be eliminated  psychologically,

wastage of manpower will be avoided and the graduates

will  also  not  have  a sense of  uncertainty  about

employment  outlet.  The academic  standards  of  the

university  will  also be improved and  its  prestige

enhanced internationally.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for several years I did not have a

chance to speak for my constituents. This is the time

for  all the one hundred flowers to bloom. Now we are

also  allowed free expression in this House. I  would

like  to  say something and do something for  my  own

rural  constituency, (In English) This  is  the  first

time. I had no chance before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) In the Nee Soon constituency 80% of

the  votes  came from the rural areas. I  am  not  as

fortunate as the other Members of Parliament who have

the  HLJDC or HDB flat dwellers to support  them.  My

constituents in Nee Soon have not had the opportunity

to   enjoy  public  facilities  available  in   other

constituencies.  They only enjoy  limited  facilities

provided  by the Urban and Rural Services  Committee.

Many of my voters who live in the rural areas are not

served by metalled roads. Their houses or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



villages are not accessible to vehicular traffic.

The funds provided by URSC for the development of the

constituency  are  not  sufficient,  particularly  in

respect  of  road  development. Up to  date.  I  have

received  requests in hand which  need  at  least  $1

million  to  develop roads over the next five  years.

The  amount allocated each year is quite limited, and

I  can  anticipate many roads cannot be completed  by

then. How are we to satisfy the rural voters in their

demands?  How are we to express our appreciation  for

the 72.4% votes which had been cast in our favour  as

an expression of the confidence that they have in us?

If  this  rate of progress is continued,  in  my  own

constituency, even if I can carry on for the next ten

years  -  they  would  not be able  to  complete  the

construction  of  the  roads  with  the  meagre   sum

provided. It is my hope that the Ministry of  Finance

will allocate more funds for road construction in the

rural  areas. This is also in keeping with  what  the

Prime Minister had said after the elections - that we

must look after the needs of the people in the poorer

areas. This is the time for such care to be given. If

it is not possible to allocate more funds to the URSC

for  the development of the rural areas, then perhaps

the Minister for National Development could study the

question  that for any request for more than $100,000

provision for road construction, whether the work -an

be  done  by the PWD direct instead of going  through

the URSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nee Soon area, more than half the number of

shops have been affected by road development and have

to be resettled elsewhere. The remaining shops cannot

meet  the  requirements  of  the  people  there,  The

Government  has no plan or intention  to  build  more

shops   or   shopping  centres  in   Nee   Soon   for

replacement,  as in the case of Thomson constituency.

It  is therefore my hope that the Government will  be

flexible  enough  in  formulating  policies  and   in

implementing  them, that is to say,  where  there  is

vacant  private land available by the side of  public

roads, shops may be allowed to be erected there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in road construction development,

there  is one thing we cannot accept, that is a wrong

assessment of the width of the road. As a  result  of

such  wrong  assessment by civil servants responsible

for  the  project,  more land  and  shops  have  been

acquired  than  necessary. This was discovered  after

construction work had actually begun. As a result the

land  by  the  road upon which the  shops  have  been

acquired   is   still  in  the  possession   of   the

Government.  Now the shopkeepers or shop-owners  have

to  apply to the Government or to tender for the  use

of  their shop premises and land. This is an  example

of  a  lack of proper planning which becomes  obvious

after  the completion of the project. But the  people

who  are  affected  suffer  at  the  lack  of  proper

planning.  So  when we talk about  rewards  for  high

performance and so on, the civil servants responsible

can  tell  the Minister that they have completed  the

project  and  hope  to get some  promotion  which  is

obtained at the expense of a lot of people as in this

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, in the north-eastern part of Nee

Soon  constituency, in the Simpang area, certain land

has   been  under  acquisition  or  redesignated  for

industrial  purposes,  giving  rise  to  resettlement

problems.  Of  course, the Government has  its  fixed

policy  in  regard to the compensations that  may  be

given to the farmers. Farmers in this area have  been

encouraged and influenced by the experimental farm of

the Primary Production Department to grow orchids and

rear  tropical fish as an occupation. The  Government

does  not have a fixed policy on compensation in this

respect.   So  I  hope  that  when  resettlement   is

underway,  the Primary Production Department  or  the

Ministry  of National Development can think out  some

suitable  measures  to help the  people  affected  by

resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to deal with the hawker problem

as other Members have already touched on this matter.

But I must emphasise that all the matters that I have

brought up should receive the proper attention of the

Government, as the Prime Minister has said after  the

elections that we must give greater attention to  the

livelihood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



of  the poorer groups of our people or people who had

been neglected in the past.



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to support the Motion in the name of the Member

for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my friends was complaining the other day that

he  has to earn $1 in order to spend 50c, as he is in

the  50%  income  tax bracket. He  did  not  seem  to

realise  that he is one of the fortunate few  at  the

top  of  the income ladder and that in 1975,  141,485

out  of 638,432 or 22% of the CPF contributors earned

below  $200 per month in wages. Many of these workers

have families to support. Imagine. Sir, the plight of

a  widow  in her forties, who is illiterate  and  has

three or four children still in school. She qualifies

only to be a sweeper or cleaner, earning no more than

$200  per month. Out of this amount, $26 goes to  the

HDB  for  the cheapest one-room emergency-type  flat,

$30  or  so  goes to the PUB; the rest of the  paltry

wage must sustain a family of four or five.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy, therefore, to read the Addendum on

the  Prime  Minister's  Office  that  Government   is

committed to help the most needy. May I venture  some

suggestions?  First  of all, the Hawkers'  Department

should  be  less stingy in issuing hawkers' licences,

particularly to widows, old people and people who are

unfit  for  other work. Apparently,  there  is  a  5%

provision  for hardship cases but, in practice,  very

few actual hardship cases are granted licences as the

rules  laid down are too rigid and nobody  knows  how

the 5% rule is really interpreted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that, when revisions are

necessary in respect of health, education and  rental

charges, we should bear in mind the plight of the low-income

people.  A  $2  charge  means  nothing  to  a

Permanent Secretary or Deputy Secretary, but it means

a lot to the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that the PUB should make a

special effort to estimate bills for the poor  fairly

and  accurately. An extra $10 per month in  estimated

charges is a big blow to a poor person; moreover, the

extra estimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



may  require an increase in the PUB deposit,  not  to

mention the surcharge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noticed that the HDB tends to provide

more  open spaces and recreational facilities  nearer

the  three-room, four-room and five-room flats,  This

is  certainly  true  in Balestier  Estate.  The  more

pressing  needs  of the people who live  in  one-room

flats should be given priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand also that the HDB is planning to

remodel  the old one-room emergency flats to  convert

them  into  two-room units. My colleague, the  Member

for  Kampong  Chai  Chee, referred to  this  earlier.

Although  this  seems  to be  an  improvement,  I  am

wondering  what will happen to the present  dwellers.

Their present rental of $26 per month will surely  be

increased.  This happened to four blocks of  the  old

emergency  flats in Whampoa some three or four  years

ago.  The  people were just moved out of these  flats

and  they  had to move to more expensive flats  as  a

result.  I  would  therefore urge  the  HDB  to  make

improvements in ventilation and lighting but  without

depriving residents of their cheap rental.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The Member for Katong is rather

concerned  about this. I think he has such  flats  in

his  constituency. Well, if they do not have  private

toilets, then I would say instal the private toilets.

But  make  sure that the HDB does not add on  to  the

rental for the inclusion of the toilets. Furthermore,

as  I said earlier, more recreational facilities  for

the poor people can be provided nearby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like the HDB to reexamine its

concept of family income used in its housing rules. A

family income of $600 per month earned by the head of

household  is meaningful, but when the sum is  earned

by  himself  and  three or four  children,  what  the

family  has at its disposal depends on the generosity

of  the  children and you cannot expect a  young  man

earning $150 or $200 to contribute more than $20. $30

or  at  the most $50 per month to the family. A rigid

application of the family income rules,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



therefore,  imposes hardship on some people  who  are

forced  to buy instead of renting their flats or  who

are  forced in many cases to accept bigger flats than

they would wish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to suggest that the Ministry

of  Social  Affairs should re-examine the quantum  of

welfare   relief  payable  to  needy  and   destitute

persons.  An old person with no children or relatives

to  support them and who has no savings and is unable

to work cannot possibly survive on the $40 or $50 per

month  given  by  the Social Welfare Department.  For

such  destitute cases, Sir, there is no  question  of

disincentives   for  working  that   higher   welfare

payments might bring to the able-bodied,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office also

states  that we have achieved a more equal  and  more

just  society than it has ever been in  the  past.  I

fully  agree with the observation, Sir, but  I  would

like  to  ask why there is no provision of legal  aid

for  criminal cases apart from murder cases.  A  poor

person who is unfortunate enough to be involved in  a

criminal  case  and  who cannot afford  a  lawyer  is

likely  to suffer more injustice. I hope hon. Members

who  are  in  the  legal profession  will  give  some

thought  to  this  and perhaps even  volunteer  their

legal services to the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I understand, of course, that poor

lawyers  have got a living to make but some  of  them

make it rather comfortably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I make some further reference to the HDB.

Recently,  some  of the coffee-shop operators  in  my

constituency  were  summoned for placing  tables  and

chairs for the use of customers in the five-foot  way

and   public  concourse  areas  nearby.  I   appealed

unsuccessfully to the HDB to allow them to do  so  as

the  customers  clearly prefer  the  open  air.  Sir,

obstruction  can be prevented by careful  delineation

and  the  HDB can certainly charge additional  rental

for  a  specified number of chairs and tables  placed

outside the coffee-shop and proprietors can be held



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



responsible  for  maintaining  cleanliness  and   for

keeping  noise to a minimum. Sir, in many  countries,

as in Singapore, side-walk cafes are very popular.  I

do not see why the HDB should so unreasonably confine

coffee-shop operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of National Development

states  that 55% of our population is already  living

in  HDB flats and that by 1980, two million residents

are  expected.  Sir,  I  have noticed  that  the  HDB

insists  on  a  lot of uniformity,  for  example,  in

designs of window grilles and iron-doors. Why  cannot

the  Board  allow residents some variety?  I  suggest

that,  as  the  vast  majority  of  our  people  will

eventually live in HDB flats, the housing regulations

should   be   carefully  examined  to   prevent   the

imposition of unnecessarily drab uniformity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum on the Ministry of the

Environment,  it is stated that the Ministry  intends

to  move  unlicensed hawkers into  vacant  stalls  in

existing hawker centres whether they like it or  not.

From  my  knowledge of hawker centres. Sir, vacancies

persist only in those centres where business is poor.

I  think, therefore, that it would be unfair to  move

hawkers  forcibly  into sites  which  are  likely  to

result  in  poor business or even losses. Instead.  I

would  urge the Hawkers' Department and HDB  to  make

careful  studies of the sites of proposed new  Hawker

Centres  to  ensure that business will be there  when

they are operational. Population concentrations, easy

accessibility  and  ample parking  places  are  three

critical   factors,  With  regard  to  the   proposed

increases  in hawker licence fees. I would  urge  for

careful  study to prevent an escalation  of  cost-of-living

increases to workers. Moreover, not all hawker

centres are equally prosperous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last year I heard that the Hawkers'

Department intends to phase out Pasar Malam sites.  I

think it would be a pity to phase out what has become

a  colourful feature of our night life. Sir, even  in

advanced countries, bazaars are popular and colourful

events.  We  should not be over-anxious to  establish

such an orderly existence that life



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



loses  some  of its colour, Furthermore, Pasar  Malam

allows  hawkers  that extra elbowroom  to  earn  that

extra  margin that makes life more tolerable. Already

the  urbanisation and rapid development of  Singapore

has  unsettled  lives  and removed  some  traditional

means  of livelihood. We should therefore make  every

effort   to   provide  a  little  leeway  for   small

enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Ministries' Addenda referred to the problems

of   the   young,  particularly  the  Ministries   of

Education, Home Affairs and Social Affairs.  I  think

the  emphasis  is  very  necessary.  I  welcome,   in

particular, the greater efforts being expended by the

Singapore  Sports Council. However, I would  like  to

recommend  that  Constituency Sports Clubs  be  given

more  generous funds in order to cater adequately  to

the   needs   of  the  young  and  to  promote   mass

participation in sports. In Whampoa, for  example,  I

have  to  look for $1 5,000 this year to finance  the

enthusiastic plans of my Sports Club.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the needs of the young, Sir, I should

also like to urge the National Library to set up more

branches, at least one in every housing estate.  Sir,

the costs of encouraging healthy pursuits like sports

and  reading will bring rich dividends like  reducing

drug addiction and delinquency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aged also need increasing attention, as the

Ministries  of Health and Social Affairs  remind  us.

Over  the last few days, MPs and Ministers have  been

handing out ang pows and hampers to the aged.  And  I

am  doing so tonight. If I may say so, this is a fine

gesture. However, let us also think about how some of

these destitute old people are going to survive until

the  next  distribution of ang pows. Government  will

have to do more for the aged. Unfortunately, this may

also in the process encourage the abandonment of  the

aged  by their children and grandchildren who  simply

pass  the  buck  to the government.  Nevertheless  we

should  not  allow ourselves to be deterred.  At  the

same  time  we  should make every  effort  to  instil

filial piety in our youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two Members, the Members for Marine Parade

and Toa Payoh, spoke about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



the  problem  of job-hopping among young workers  and

executives. I agree substantially with both  of  them

that  we  should  refrain from unnecessary  and  even

detrimental  action.  Job-hopping  usually  increases

when  there is more rapid economic growth.  Over  the

last  two  years there seemed to be fewer  complaints

about it because our economic growth had slowed down.

To  some extent, of course, job-hopping reflects  the

problems  of  adjustment that  result  from  lack  of

information  about  the jobs undertaken.  Perhaps  we

should  provide more counselling in schools, colleges

and  universities to help graduates pick the  careers

more suited to their temperament and attitudes and so

on, instead of penalising them later for hopping from

job to job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour, in its Addendum, rightly

reiterates that our workers must work harder, upgrade

their skills and increase their productivity. Despite

the  efforts of the Labour Ministry and the  National

Wages Council, productivity is still not sufficiently

understood as a concept and as a principle  governing

our  livelihood.  Put  simply,  productivity  is  the

relation between output ,(what is produced) and input

(what is used in the production process). Output  can

be  in  the  form  of  goods such  as  cloth,  shoes,

transistors,  watches,  etc, or  services  such   as

typing,  transport,  serving in  a  restaurant,  etc.

Inputs  are the labour expended by workers,  machine-time

and  materials used in the production  process.

Singapore  is  crucially dependent on the  degree  of

productivity of all of us who work. Since we have  no

natural  resources, we make use of imported  machines

and  materials  and  export our goods  and  services,

earning our livelihood in the process. The process is

the  same, whether we are engaged in entrepot  trade,

manufacturing  or  financial and other  services.  It

follows,  therefore, that we can better our standards

of  living only if we become more and more productive

or efficient, in other words, only if we can increase

our  output without increasing our input or if we can

increase  our  output  faster than  we  increase  our

input.  This is meant by increasing our productivity.

Hence we can see that if we increase our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



wages  without  increasing our productivity  we  will

raise  the  prices  for  our  exports  of  goods  and

services.  If foreigners find other countries'  goods

and  services  to be cheaper, we shall  lose  out  in

export sales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me on to the unfavourable world economic

conditions  referred to by the Ministry  of  Finance,

Early  last  year,  in this Chamber,  I  warned  that

economic  recovery in the industrial countries  might

stall  because of insufficient new investments.  This

has  been  clearly  vindicated by  events.  The  main

reason  is that the rate of technological innovations

appears   to   have  slowed  down  in  the   advanced

countries, therefore leading to fewer investments. At

the  same  time,  the aging population  structure  in

those  countries has altered the pattern  of  demand,

necessitating  painful  and  difficult   changes   in

production patterns because in the aftermath  of  the

Second World War there was a big population boom  all

over  the world, even in the advanced countries. This

big  population  boom gave rise to a lot  of  demand,

initially    for   maternity   services,   nurseries,

kindergartens, schools, colleges, universities, teen-age

fashions like 2nd generation jeans and so on and

so  forth. But since the early sixties, the  rate  of

population  growth  in  the  advanced  countries  had

declined  very  drastically so that  the  numbers  of

young  people in some cases, have gone down not  only

as  a  proportion of population but also in  absolute

numbers. So those industries catering to the  demands

of the young suffer excess capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, there are many more older

people  proportionately as well as absolutely in  the

advanced  countries, and we are catching up  in  this

respect.  In America, I understand about 10%  of  the

population  are above the age of 60. This means  that

they  would demand wheel chairs, nursing care and  so

on  and  so forth. But they lack the effective demand

to  buy  those goods and services. So it is difficult

and  painful for the industries there to adjust their

production  patterns. Therefore, both on  the  supply

side and the demand side, there has been these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



difficulties.   Indeed,   Sir,   the    studies    of

productivity and profitability in America have  shown

that   both  rates  have  declined  since  the  early

sixties. If this is true, then we are in for a period

of  painful  adjustments which  monetary  and  fiscal

measures will do little to alleviate, In fact, my own

belief is that both these policies will lead to  more

inflation  rather than more employment. In  addition,

energy prices are expected to rise inexorably for the

foreseeable future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, too many of us allow ourselves to

be  beguiled  by  the  talk of alternative  forms  of

energy,  like  solar  energy, gasification  of  coal,

thermonuclear  energy, and so on  and  so  forth,  In

actual  fact,  the alternative forms  of  energy  are

still far off in the future. Even Edward Teller,  the

father  of  the  H-bomb, says that the hydrogen  bomb

principle   as  a  form  of  energy   will   not   be

commercially practicable until the 21st  century.  In

the  meantime  the  known reserve  of  oil  is  being

rapidly  depleted. We read of new oil fields  in  the

North  Sea, in the Arctic, in China, and so  on.  But

these are marginal fields in the sense that the costs

of  production are very high. What good does it do if

it takes $10 per barrel to extract a barrel of oil in

the  Arctic circle to sell for $1 1 a barrel. In  net

terms  we  only  realise $1 worth of  oil.  In  other

words,  it  takes energy to recover  energy.  So  one

should  not  be beguiled by the actual numbers  which

are  bandied about. Right now, there is  one  of  the

severest winters in America which is highlighting the

energy crisis in no uncertain terms, particularly  in

terms of the gas shortage. I think we should take the

warning  very  seriously indeed here in Singapore.  I

note  that a lot of new office buildings and shopping

complexes have got central air-conditioning. Even  in

this  very Chamber, a lot of my colleagues and myself

have  to  put on sweaters and coats. I think  we  can

show a good example by raising the thermostat here in

this  very  Chamber to conserve energy. I would  urge

that,   in   designs   for  new  buildings,   natural

ventilation should be provided for. I have seen  some

of   the   buildings  which  have  got   no   windows

whatsoever.  If  the  air-conditioning  breaks  down,

there is just no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



natural ventilation, It would be very stifling. There

is a lot of wastage. A lot of common corridors and so

on have got central air-conditioning. Very often they

are  so  cold that when the number of people  is  not

sufficient  one  just cannot stand the  cold  or  one

catches flu in the process.
