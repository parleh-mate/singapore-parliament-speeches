   <b>REVISED STRUCTURE OF EDUCATION</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Paper Misc. 3 of 1979)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Amendments [28th March, 1979] to Question [27th March 1979].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House having noted the Report on the Ministry of Education, 1978, contained in Paper Misc. 3 of 1979,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) supports the revised structure of education which will allow each pupil to study at a pace suited to his learning capacity and which will make him as bilingual as he can be,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) approves flexibility in implementation particularly to accommodate the wishes of parents,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) recommends periodic adjustments and changes to the revised structure which experience and advice of principals and teachers show to be desirable in the long term interests of pupils.". - (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education).
  <br>
  <br>Which Amendments were,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) at end, to add a comma and the following new sub-paragraph -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(4) resolves that the Minister of Education do report to Parliament after 2 or 3 years on the progress, unresolved problems and state of implementation of the revised structure of education". - (Mr Fong Sip Chee, Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) at end, to add a comma and the following 2 new sub-paragraphs -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(4) advocates that the Ministry of Education collates the suggestions and criticisms raised during the debate in the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) urges the Ministry to study the implications of policy changes in depth and to give schools and parents adequate lead time to implement such policies". - (Dr Toh Chin Chye, Minister for Health).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the comma and new sub-paragraph (4), proposed to be added by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour, be there added."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> As had been agreed, the debate may range over both amendments and the original Question. Dr Tan.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last few days we have listened to many speeches in this House on the subject of education; some eloquent, some wise and some humorous. But if there is any one factor which emerges from the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> presentation of the speeches, it is this. On the subject of education, as on no other, everybody considers himself an expert. The objectives which have been outlined by hon. Members have been many and varied, recommendations profuse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just draw attention to three points brought up by three Ministers for illustration. One Senior Minister thought that having two languages, like English and Chinese, involves a cancelling out process. However, he seems to have been affected by the New Mathematics which he has been studying together with his daughter. One minus one does not equal one, but equals zero. He said that because one language cancels out the other, therefore you get a monolingual product. Another Minister wants the standard of the second language to be higher than that provided for by the Goh Report. Yet another wants more time to play marbles. We have got to be realistic. We can be wide-ranging in our objectives but we have to look at the resources available to us. We cannot turn the Education Ministry nor the teachers into supermen and superwomen. We cannot achieve everything that we desire even if these objectives are all valued and worthy ones. There is a time constraint. There is a nerve constraint on the part of those who are being subjected to the process.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the value of the Goh Report is in pointing out the tremendous wastage of our system. I find the wastage shocking, not merely in terms of literacy as pointed out but, as on the first chapter, page 3, that there seems to be a correlation between illiteracy and drug abuse, delinquency, attempted suicide, and court martials. In other words, there are disciplinary problems of various kinds. We have got to stop and think not merely in terms of why or how this illiteracy has come about but, more fundamentally, why the products of our schools are so prone to such delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point which the Report did not cover. Perhaps the sheer size of the task did not provide enough time but which we ought to look at over time, that is, what about those 39% who eventually attain three GCE
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 'O' level passes and the 40% who fail to attain three GCE 'O' level passes. What kind of students are we producing here? What are their values and attitudes? One Member brought up an important point, namely, that we seem to be hearing and reading reports about very highly educated people, professionals, who are criminals. These are the ones who surface and get caught, but how many countless others have gotten away? Sir, it will be interesting to find out what the graduates' values and attitudes are.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Motion standing in the name of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education is one which, I think, most of us can support. It is harmlessly stated and has some utility in terms of highlighting that each person should be given the chance to proceed at his or her own pace, which should have been obvious many years ago. It is quite strange that we have only now paid attention to this problem. I think one can improve the Motion in various ways as some of the Members have done, but what is more fundamental is the process of implementation. For all the good intentions and all the good objectives it is the implementation which is going to be crucial. Here the Prime Minister put his finger on the problem correctly. If I may quote him: [page vi, paragraph 30]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, the more fundamental principle of good education is recognition by the Ministry that the basic teaching organisational unit is the school.'
  <br>
  <br>Here again, one would have thought that this was a rather obvious point but it took the Prime Minister to bring it to the attention of the Ministry of Education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that there has been too much concern with the exercise of power by civil servants in Singapore. Just look at the principals and teachers having to hurry to some obscure counter at the Ministry of Education to receive a circular or the most recent order on what to do and what not to do, or the latest changes to be implemented. Little account was taken of their views and reactions. Little account was taken of their morale and, more fundamentally, no account
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> was taken of the values and attitudes of the teachers themselves. Even the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour, a man whom I respect for his linguistic and other abilities, in pointing out the problem of teachers' morale and the need to do something about it, referred to them as "digits". Perhaps his encounters with the Prime Minister have resulted in some of the terminologies rubbing off on him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Close influence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, this is something which we want to pay particular attention to and many Members of Parliament have complained that the question of teachers' morale has been dismissed too easily in the Report. If I were a teacher and I got this bright young systems engineer coming to me asking all sorts of questions: are you fed up?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Are you happy with your pay?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> No.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Are you happy with your principals and officials of the Ministry of Education? I would be rather hesitant to be frank and honest in conveying my true feelings and views. It would have been better if a questionnaire had been sent out to all school teachers and principals anonymously. I would think that the result would be drastically different.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of proper treatment of people, since we are making much use of Confucianist ethics, I would like to quote the English translation of The Analects of Confucius by Arthur Waley: [page 88, paragraph 3]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Master said, Govern the people by regulations, keep order among them by chastisements, and they will flee from you, and lose all self-respect. Govern them by moral force, keep order among them by ritual and they will keep their self-respect and come to you of their own accord.'
  <br>
  <br>Interesting, is it not, Sir?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Very wise.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> We subscribe to Confucianist ideals but why do not the people who govern, the people who hand down orders, listen to what the Master has to say? If people are treated with proper respect and given their proper due, their creativity will be released. They can flower in their professions. We have the recent example of women doctors being berated in this House for watching the clock. We might advise them to buy watches instead. But they came out with a reply to the Minister for Health. They stood up to him like a man!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the medical students were chastised by the Member for Anson and reminded of their debt to the ground. It is a valid point. We can turn around and chastise and scold many other people, professionals, intellectuals, academics, teachers, and any small group that does not have the voting power; we can do that. But let us remember one point. These groups may be minorities in terms of voting power but they too have rights. Their principles are principles. Truth is truth. In the case of these medical students, there can be no question that the principle of bonding is correct. But how they go about doing it is important, and the "how" tells us whether we have got the refinements that Confucius told us we ought to have, or we simply rub people's heads into the dirt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University lecturers too have their grouses. It is not uncommon for university lecturers to be hauled up by a petty administrator at the university, sometimes even a former student who has assumed the position of Assistant Registrar, to be told what to do and what not to do, or which agency to turn to buy a particular plane ticket even if it should cost twice as much as some other agency, and so forth. Sir, I could tell this House endless tales of this sort - where people feel that they are not treated properly and that they are not given their due. Sir, if Singapore were to survive as a state respected by others, we need to produce people who can stand up for their rights. So to those people whose rights are trampled upon but who have the guts to stand up and point out what is wrong, I say, more power to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to page 35 of the Goh Report. I am sorry. It is a very confusing system. It is Chapter 3, page 5. The last paragraph (5.1) talks about the "Pupils' Home Background", and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Good schools have higher percentages of pupils from better home background, in terms of pupils' fathers' occupation and educational level than the other schools. In both the Chinese and English streams, the differences in the percentages between the good schools and the poor schools are significant.'
  <br>
  <br>Note, Sir, "better home background". Now, Sir, if we really want to give everybody an equal opportunity, I think we should stop and think in terms of that 20% who are going to be relegated to the lowest stream of the primary school and study what are the factors affecting these poor children. I think there have been studies which show that diet plays a very important role in terms of the concentration level of children when they are in school. If the children do not have a full breakfast, their concentration level suffers a severe decline by about 9 o'clock. The child gets fidgety, becomes mischievous and is penalised. He is simply unable to concentrate for the simple medical reason that the glucose level in his blood stream has fallen below normal. Are we doing anything about this? Do we realise that there are still many poor people among us who are struggling along and cannot provide proper food or a proper diet for their children?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have pointed out the need for study facilities. I have also pointed that out and I was therefore aghast when the National Library banned students from studying in the Library - a most unwarranted step. We simply evade problems when they become too great for us to face up to. If the ratio of library facilities to student population is too low, well, raise the ratio.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, children who come from the middle class or upper middle class homes have got the benefit of tutors. We are therefore going to see an accentuation of income or wealth disparities under the new system, because there will be pressure to provide more tutors for the children so that they will go to the first two streams and not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the last. What about the poor? They will be left behind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor we have got to bear in mind, Sir, is the role of parents in monitoring the performance of their children. Here we seem to contradict ourselves in terms of policy. The Ministry of Finance says that we need more labour, particularly more woman power, so that we will not have to rely too much on immigrant labour. So try and get more women to do the work. It will be good for the economy. But is it good for the soul of the youngsters who are going to be left behind? Is it good for their education? Is it good for their values and attitudes when their mothers slog away at an eight or nine-hour job per day? This is something for us to think about. Yes, there are economic benefits, but what about the social costs? Why do we not think in terms of providing half-day work for women? If women doctors watch the clock because they have to rush home to cook the evening meal, then there is a legitimate reason for them to do so. Why do we not let the women doctors work half-day at half-pay? It is a simple solution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another consequence of our policy is the small family that we have today. We are constrained by land - economic circumstances, no doubt. But have we stopped to think about the long-term implications of small families? Many of us here in this House come from large families. We have many brothers and sisters. There were fights, there were quarrels. There was deprivation in many cases. But there is one thing we learn from large families, that is, to share, to give and to take. I am afraid, Sir, that too many of our youngsters today do not know how to give. They only know how to take. They have too much pocket money, too many toys which, in any case, destroy creativity, and too much freedom, even freedom from parental control. We admonish parents to have small families so that they can have more facilities and more time for their children. Yes, they have more facilities and more money. More time? No, not for the children because the extra time is taken in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> working for the mother so that the parents can have greater leisure outside. They can go out dancing and gambling. They do not mind the children. What the children have are the school's ECA, homework and TV. So the consequence over the long term is greater selfishness in our younger generation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had countless cases, Sir, of young men complaining to me at my "meet-the-people" sessions, furious with the Housing and Development Board for refusing to let them change the tenancy of their flats which they were about to buy. They had registered three or four years previously, to buy these flats, using their parents' names, brothers' names, and sisters' names because they were as yet single. But since then they have got married. And now the wife says, "Let us live alone by ourselves. There is a nice new four-room flat. Why do we want to bother with our parents, your parents especially?" So the young man went to the Housing Board and said, "I wish to take out the names of my parents, my brothers and sisters. Let them live in the rented flat where they are right now, and my wife and I will go to the new flat." The rented flat might be a one-room flat or a two-room flat. The new flat is a four-room flat or a five-room flat for two people. Of course, the Housing Board would say to them, "This cannot be done. If you wish to get a new flat, you have to take out a new registration number because you were not married at the time when you registered to buy a flat." They got mad with the Housing Board and came to me. I therefore explained to them and said, "Look, why don't you take your parents with you and then let them apply for a flat for themselves? It may take one or two years. They have put up with you for 24 or 25 years. Why can't you put with them for another one or two years?." This is the kind of attitude which our young people have. I am worried and I am sure the MPs here are worried too. If you have five or six children and half of them are not filial you will still be taken care of in your old age. But when you have one or two children, and half of them are not filial, you have had it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to page 6, Chapter 3 of that Report. There are some interesting findings
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> here. One is that the Government-aided schools seem to have performed better. I will quote from paragraph 5.3.2:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While only 44% of all the schools are government-aided, 71% of the good schools are government-aided and 84% of the poor schools are government schools ...'.
  <br>
  <br>Surely, Sir, this is something for us to pause, think, and ponder at length. Why should this be so? What is so special about the Government-aided schools?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 5.4 points out to "Other Factors - Dedication of teachers. Teacher's teaching method, and Quality of pupils." But these are dismissed in a sentence:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Besides those factors that have been considered in the previous paragraphs, there are many other factors which are intangible and yet important. They are:'
  <br>
  <br>They are simply dismissed in one sentence. Sir, these qualitative factors - dedication of teachers, teacher's teaching method and quality of pupils - are obviously important. They are crucial elements to be considered. But since these are not amenable to the computer and the systems engineers do not know what to do with them, they have simply been brushed aside. Yet the very finding that 71% of the good schools are Government-aided schools should give them plenty of food for thought. Why is this the case? Why do the Government schools perform so badly? But no explanation has been provided.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another paragraph deals with the pupil-teacher ratio and it simply dismisses the idea because the finding was that despite the fact that there was a higher pupil-teacher ratio in the good schools the results of the good schools remain good and, therefore, there is no need to look into this pupil-teacher ratio. Absurd, is it not, Sir? If we are serious about raising the quality of our education, we should not base our reports on such spurious findings. There is such a thing as spurious correlations which simple human commonsense can tell systems engineers about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we talk about market value. Let me just give an illustration from the University. After obtaining a first degree, a First Class Honours, a man goes off and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> spends four or five years to get a Ph.D. in Philosophy. He comes back and joins the University. When the time for promotion comes and he is not promoted, he starts asking questions. He is told, "But what is your market value?" Of course, after teaching Philosophy for 10 or 15 years he would have no market value. That should be rather obvious. But he has got a special value - educational value. Look at the effect this has on the young graduates! The University is getting very short of staff. The brighter young graduates are not going to pursue higher degrees. What is the point? You slog away for four or five years to get a Ph.D. only to be told at the end of it that you have no market value. We had a better system before: Lecturers, Readers and Professors - just three grades. Today we have Lecturers, Associate Professors, Professors, and now Senior Professors. The British system is one thing. The American system is simply -

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Paragraph 5.4 pointed to three important factors: Dedication of teachers, Teacher's teaching method, and Quality of pupils. I was just complaining that these factors were simply stated as "intangible and yet important." I was pointing out that this should be related to the difference in performance between the government and government-aided schools. That is one. The other point concerns the pupil-teacher ratio. The finding is perhaps spurious and should not inhibit the Ministry from pursuing the improvements to schools and lowering the pupil/teacher ratio. May I continue?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> All right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I was talking about some problems of the University. The British system is simply Lecturer, Reader, Professor. The American system is Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor. But we have a system which fits neither one. We have Lecturer, Associate Professor, Professor and Senior Professor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Senior Lecturer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I am sorry. Thank you. There is a Senior Lecturer. So we have Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Associate Professor, Professor and Senior Professor. The intention behind this system was good, namely, the University was losing too many staff and therefore greater pay should be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> given to the teaching staff. However, if we look at the actual promotions, we find that people like doctors, Business Administration lecturers, lawyers get promoted more rapidly, not because they are intrinsically better in terms of education and educational value but because their market value is higher. This is one more example to illustrate this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson recognises this problem, Sir, and emphasised that we should look for quality of commitment and, I should add, professional excellence, academic excellence. Titles matter to people. Professionals are not so much concerned with pay if they are accorded proper status, proper respect. But if teachers and professors do not get the social esteem which they think is their due, then they can only feel aggrieved that they have lost out somewhere along the line. And if we add to this the huge discrepancies in pay between the civil service and the teaching profession, then I think the discontent gets all the greater. I think what is important for us to realise, Sir, is that from the point of view of new graduates, what are the inducements for them to go into a particular profession or career? In other words, the concept of opportunity cost is more important than market value. What has the person got to give up to pursue a University career, to pursue a career as a teacher? Just the other day, one Institute of Education official complained to me that their lecturers were being paid no better than teachers themselves. These lecturers are teachers to teachers. If the morale of these lecturers is low, then they can only present glum faces to the teachers who will, in turn, present glum faces to the pupils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what about the so-called brilliant 8% that the Report extols? Here, I think there is a danger that because they are recognised as brilliant, we might overload them. The proposal to introduce a third language at some stage is one which I would not support.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the values and attitudes of these people? Having the bilingual capability, having eight distinctions and so on do not necessarily make these people good leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> If I may quote from one Minister whom I overheard in the Member's Room, he said, "What good is it to me to have a First Class Honours Permanent Secretary if that fellow is not practical?" He has a point. Another person in an exalted capacity said, "Under the new system, I would not have survived. I am a monolinguist." How many people in this Chamber would have survived? Do we make enough room? In other words, is there a necessary correlation between intellect and linguistic ability? And if there is none, is there sufficient leeway in the system for transference or for emergence of the brilliant monolinguist, or even the above average monolinguist? I have trouble as I read through the Report on streaming. To go from the higher step down to the lower step, yes, it is very easy. It is like falling off the ladder. To climb up the ladder, both primary and secondary, the language is quite a barrier. I think the Education Ministry should look more carefully at this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the flexibility which is given to parents, it is a good gesture. But at the same time I am just wondering what the end result would be if the parents all sign for their children to be admitted to the higher streams of education. Is there indeed sufficient room for the late developer?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me get down to the objective of education. The Goh Report simply puts it that the basic objective is to achieve literacy in at least one language. The Prime Minister is more ambitious as usual. In the second paragraph, he says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was, and is to educate a child to bring out his greatest potential, so that he will grow up into a good man and a useful citizen.'
  <br>
  <br>I have no quarrel with either the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister on the stated objective. I would just like to emphasise a few points. One is that from my observation, even university students do not know how to think for themselves. It is a surprising statement but it is a statement of fact. Because they have been programmed right throughout the school system to be recipients, to be like a computer taking in some input and providing some output.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> When students organise seminars nowadays, they turn to lecturers and also to people outside, established in their fields, to come and speak. In my time when we organised seminars, we were the ones who were the speakers at the seminars. When we had debates, we thought through the ideas ourselves. I took part in many debates. We thought through. We did not go up to lecturers to ask for ideas. But now the university teams come up to us and say, "Can you give us ideas on this subject because, if you don't, the other team will win because they are approaching Professor so-and-so." It is something serious for us to think about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I go back to my good friend Confucius, and I quote him in CL3 (Chinese as a Lower Second Language):
  <pre>
   xue er bu si ze wang    (                 )
   si er bu xue ze dai     (                 )
</pre> "He who learns without thinking is lost. He who thinks without learning is in great danger." I might add, "dangerous to others and to society as well," Our students also need to have the ability to select. Singapore is a small open economy. For all our educational efforts, unless the proper values and attitudes are instilled in the students, these efforts can be undone through the TV, through magazines, through the movies, through contact with tourists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to The Analects of Confucius, page 206. This time I will quote in EL2. Master Kung said:
  <pre>
     'Highest are those who are born wise.
     Next are those who become wise by learning.
     After them come those who have to toil painfully in
         order to acquire learning.
     Finally, to the lowest class of the common people
         belong those who toil painfully without ever
         managing to learn.'
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>I quote that, Sir, not to discourage the working class but tO show that not all Confucianist values and ideas are valuable. We have to be selective. Do we know, for example, that in the Confucian scale of hierarchy, the scholars and officials are at the top followed by farmers, artisans and merchants. In a developing society, we value the entrepreneurial class. The status must be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there. But in a Confucianist system, his class is at the bottom. That is obviously not what we want. In our society, we need to have much respect for technical and physical or manual labour. But the Confucianist value system relegates them to the bottom. Sir, I quote this because, as high a regard as I have for Master Confucius, we need to be selective in adopting values either from the East or from the West, or both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, our students should have the ability to cope with stress that comes with competition, rapid change, and the stress that comes from the compact living environment. It must be a great sense of tragedy to us to read from the newspapers from time to time of young students committing suicide on the eve of an examination. Are we giving them sufficient to cope with such stresses? Then our students have to be tolerant of others, but most important they have to be cultured individuals, not people who look towards a philosophy of crass materialism, not people who eventually assume positions of power and exercise power in petty fashion. Above all, students must be moral beings. Here, there is a dilemma of a secular state where we cannot teach religious values. We have to take ethical values distilled from various religious systems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education should set a good example. I have here some problems with the English. On Chapter 1, page 2, in the middle of paragraph 4, there is a sentence which reads as follows: "The retention being between 2-5% in most cases." It is a sentence that does not have a verb. In Chapter 1, page 5, line 4 of paragraph 3, the sentence reads: "But in Singapore, much of the problems ...". It should be, "But in Singapore, most of the problems ...". In the fifth line of the last paragraph of page 5, Chapter 1, it reads: "One way to overcoming the dangers ...". Not only is the word "overcoming" spelt wrongly but the proper word is "overcome". Sir, we are all human. So perhaps we can be forgiven. We make mistakes but God does not.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be permitted just to end by quoting from the Book of Proverbs, Chapter One.
  <pre>
    'The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of
        Israel:
    That men may know wisdom and instruction,
        understand words of insight,
    receive instruction in wise dealing, righteousness,
        justice, and equity;
    that prudence may be given to the simple,
        knowledge and discretion to the youth -
    the wise man also may hear and increase in learning,
        and the man of understanding acquire skill,
    to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of
        the wise and their riddles.
    The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,
        fools despise wisdom and instruction.'
Amen.

  <!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the one hour long discourse about Jesus Christ and Confucius, it causes me, the one who intends to speak in CL1, to wonder whether I should speak on Confucianism further without taxing the patience of my colleagues. May I perhaps be allowed to use a few sayings from the Western philosophy so as to counterbalance the Eastern philosophy of my colleague who has just spoken to help mutual interchange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report on the Ministry of Education presented to the House on the 16th March, 1979, by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education is one of the most important historic documents after the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore since our independence. The Report makes special reference to the most complex language problem that exists in our multi-racial society. At the same time, it has also boldly and fully by self-criticism disclosed the seriousness of mistakes made by the Government in this respect in spite of what it has achieved in other fields. All these errors have been enumerated in detail in the Report. So after having carefully studied the Report, I asked myself, if the Education Study Team had not been led by Dr Goh Keng Swee, our Deputy Prime Minister, and his Study Team members had not been officials from Ministries other than the Ministry of Education, would we be presented with a Report that is both self-derogatory and not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> painting a good picture of the Government? I do not think so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a developing multi-racial society, language education is a common problem. It is a thorny problem as it seeks to streamline or accommodate all the languages or the various ethnic groups into a unified education system. This is not easy. However, we have done quite well in this respect. Let me give some examples. Yesterday, the Minister for Labour mentioned about the Government changing the 3.3 system of the Chinese stream to the 4.2 system so as to enable the Chinese stream secondary students to sit for the same examination for the English stream. This was good and of advantage to them. The atmosphere then was quite different from what it is today. As related, what the Senior Minister of State, Mr Lee Khoon Choy, experienced in those days none of us new MPs here, including myself, could have experienced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second example. The Nanyang University changed its four-year system to the three-year system so as to put the Pass Degree students on the same footing as the students in Singapore University, thus giving equal treatment. This was also good. So I can say that we have done quite well. After independence it was decided to embark on bilingualism. In addition to learning English, students of various races have to learn and master their respective native languages. So far, we have not been able to boast of any great success. Many students after leaving school have not been able to converse in English nor in Mandarin or Tamil or Malay. So much so that when the Deputy Prime Minister was the Minister of Defence, he had to set up a special Hokkien platoon in the national service in order to enable certain soldiers unable to converse in English or Mandarin to converse in Hokkien on military strategy and other matters. Therefore, the Report advocated a multi-stream or multi-channel system in order that schools could allow students of different abilities to develop at their own pace. This will enable the younger generation to be taught according to their talent and capacity and not become
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> illiterate in this modern age. For example, it has been found that certain students after studying for 10 years still know nothing and are good for nothing. Therefore, other than what many Members have considered to be difficult to implement, theoretically I think that the multi-stream system is a very sound method. All the principals, teachers and Ministry officials know that this is a good system. If we can succeed, it will mark a significant progress, a progress which has not been achieved by other developing countries. In fact, there are many difficulties ahead. I would just like to cite two examples. The first prerequisite is to solve the problem of the syllabi. We cannot use the same textbooks for all students of different streams and levels. They should use different textbooks. The writing of textbooks should be undertaken by those who are well-versed in education as well as in the languages. At present, there is some fault in this respect. That is to say, some people who are well-versed in languages may not be equally good at education. So when such people write the textbooks, although the textbooks to the adults appear good in phraseology and very beautiful, however, they are more suitable for adults than for school children, because to the students such textbooks would be too difficult to comprehend and a heavy burden to them. I once looked at a lesson in a textbook on Education-for- Living. The title of the lesson was "We go to school." wo men dao xue xiao qu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). I remember when I was a primary student, I had also a lesson whose subject title was in these words shang xue (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) "Going to School". I thought to myself, why should the term dao xue xiao qu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) be used, which is a longer term instead of shang xue (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) as commonly used? Why not the other way round? Those who are knowledgeable in linguistics or who are educationalists can perhaps enlighten us on this. Sir, if I may recommend one, our Minister of State for Labour is an educationist as well as a linguist. Am I correct, Mr Sia? Another is the Member for Delta who is also a linguist. If they can say which one is better: shang xue (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) or dao xue xiao qu ( ) it will be good to our children. If shang xue (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> fang xue (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), shang ban ( ), xia ban ( ), shang ke ( ), xia ke ( ), etc, are better and more familiar terms, we should use this sort of brief and pithy terms rather than using lengthy and circumlocutory terms. One should not try to be too smart by creating innovations to replace commonly accepted terms of usage. So I say textbooks are very important, because without good textbooks the teachers, the principals and the students will face difficulties and a host of problems and we may find ourselves back to square one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise is that we must not only have teachers and principals who are dedicated, we must also have Ministry officials who are equally able and dedicated to the cause of education. For example, take myself. I studied in primary 3 up to primary 5 before I took the enrolment examination to join a middle school. I spent another five years from lower junior school to senior middle school before I took the university entrance examination. During this course of schooling within this prescribed system, if I had not come across good teachers, good principals and good Ministry administrators, then a problem child like me who did not fit in properly with the prescribed standard in the formal education system would long have become an illiterate nondescript.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I would like to point out that the bilingual policy stipulated all along by the Government has been a correct one but because of the lack of expertise in educational administration, it has resulted in everybody having a say in education and everybody having a finger in the education pie. I am not saying that the Ministry of Education is lacking in experts. I am not saying that our schools are devoid of good teachers and good principals. What I am saying is that an officer who has not studied education at all was sent to work in the Ministry of Education. For example, I met one officer one day and he said that he had just gone to work in the Ministry of Education and he was reluctant to make any decision on educational measures. Under the civil service
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> system, he had to work under established rules and regulations. So he would do just as he was told. He was unfamiliar at the beginning but later on he became familiar with the business of giving orders and instructions, directing people around. However, we soon began to see deviating results from this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see some good principals faithful to their duties had become bad principals working to rules. Some good teachers dedicated in their profession had become bad teachers by following bad examples. Once this vogue was set, then in the educational circle very few people would want to talk about how to be decent persons and very few people would want to talk about moral education because nobody talked about moral education. Therefore, few of the teachers interviewed by the Education Study Team talked about moral education. That is why there is very little mention of moral education in the Report, and this has caused the Prime Minister to jump on his feet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest here something which has not been mentioned by other Members. One is that we must reorganise the Institute of Education. The Institute of Education was formerly known as the Teachers' Training College. The name has been changed, and the signboard has also been changed. But in my view, generally speaking it is still a case of old wine in new bottle. The Institute of Education has not been able to shoulder its sacred tasks. The basic requirements of the Institute are good teachers, good principals and good staff. In my view, the Institute of Education should get in touch with some primary schools and secondary schools and other establishments where there are educational facilities to set up some primary experimental classes and educational research centres at those places. In this way, we shall be able to produce, on the one hand, good teachers and, on the other hand, various experts needed as good educational administrators. Such outstanding teachers and personnel can be sent overseas for further tudies to acquire new knowledge. But, it will serve no useful purpose to send those con-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> descending and hardworking good teachers and good principals abroad. Some who have gone abroad in search of treasure have come back but have not become good teachers and good principals. I feel that if the Institute of Education is well organised, its success will provide the main pillar of strength by enhancing the upward development of our education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, I would say that this Report on education together with the letter from the Prime Minister, embodies the sum total of our experience on which to build our multilingual education system. With this foundation and under the insistent direction of the Government on bilingualism, we can build up our new, multi-channel education system. If our educationists can do well by matching the rich educational experience and thesis of the Report with all the views presently suggested and expressed in this House and apply them with speciaL methods in their educational specialties or through any measure considered best by them, they may be able to set up a good educational system in this complicated and plural society of ours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has taken over the portfolio of the Ministry of Education and this has been well received by members of the public. Everybody is glad. Everybody is full of confidence. However, as Sir Winston Churchill had said, let me quote him in EL3, "Give us the tools and we will finish the job." Just as what I think the Member for Jalan Kayu had quoted in Chinese some two days ago, "Gong yu shan qi shi, bi xian fi qi qi" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), that is to say, if we want to do a good job we must have good tools. So, if we give the Deputy Prime Minister adequate time, and I think we should, he will then be able to spot talent. There is no lack of talent in the Ministry of Education. I know there are many. Even if he is not able to spot the talents we should let him have the opportunity to develop the talents. Only when he has developed enough talents can he make use of them. Then, we Singaporeans Will be able to achieve what appears to be unachievable.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing his Motion the Deputy Prime Minister has said that Singaporeans are a resourceful people and have got out of many a desperate predicament. Therefore, I express my support for the Motion and I also express my confidence in him that step by step an ideal system of education in keeping with the needs of our multi-racial society will be established.

  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to know that there will be flexibility in the implementation of the revised education system and that the wishes of parents are to be taken into account. In this spirit of tolerance and willingness to consider points of views of others, I shall mention later certain undesirable controls and directives from the Ministry of Education which could be done away with for the good of everyone concerned and in the best interest of education as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the number of experiments or rather changes in the education of our young in the last few years, one wonders what is the object of education. One moment it is the acquiring of language skills; one moment it is technical skills (so much so that students, both boys and girls in the first two years of the secondary schools had to spend one or two mornings or afternoons a week in a workshop), and the next moment it is extracurricular activities (so points are awarded for participation, so much so that some students find no joy in participating because they had to go to school outside their normal school hours but some participate because they need the extra marks for promotion). No doubt these are desirable qualities that need to be acquired by the young if possible, but they have been blown out of all proportion until other aspects of education suffer as a result.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our children sent into the world after years of schooling equipped to live, in the words of the Prime Minister, as "worthy citizens guided by decent moral precepts?" We who would be scandalised if we were to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hear of men sent to fight armoured tanks with rifles must feel the same if large numbers of our young are sent into society to fight the battle of living with a smattering of knowledge of "subjects" and language skills. Maybe that is what we have been doing all these years. Maybe I am exaggerating. Nevertheless, I think our schools must make it a point to give paramount importance to the realm of moral and character aspects of education. No doubt knowledge and the acquiring of skills to do a job is necessary, but far more important are the qualities enumerated in paragraph 19 of the Prime Minister's letter addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education. Or to put it in an all-embracing way, in the words of Jesus: "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Singapore society is a multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious one. The Prime Minister is perfectly right when he says that the best of the East and of the West must be blended to our advantage. He mentions "Confucianist ethics, Malay traditions, and Hindu ethos", and I would like to add "Christian teachings." We must remember the great contributions made by the Mission schools, in particular the inculcation of moral values in the pupils under their charge. The dedication of the teachers, their concern for the total welfare of the pupils are cherished memories of many.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also mentions about the transmission of the norm of social and moral behaviour through stories. In 1959 the Ministry of Education published five small volumes of "stories" selected by the Ethics and Religion Committee for use in primary schools in connection with the 'Right Conduct' syllabus. The Singapore Inter-Religious Organisation played a major role in the Committee. I find the stories are mainly taken from the English sources as they were then easily available. The stories could be expanded to include more Chinese, Malay and Indian folklore. The five little volumes are not textbooks. They are meant for the use of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> teachers and I believe, in the hands of capable and enthusiastic teachers, a lot can be achieved. The proverbial anecdotes sheng yu gu shi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) published currently in the Straits Times in the bilingual page are also useful. Some of the picture series published in three languages in the New Nation are suitable also. Such stories could be told (not read) by teachers in the language best understood by the pupils. This in some measure could help to ward off the undesirable effects of the so-called rat race in our midst and get down to the fundamental and real foundation of a good education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is ground to believe the allegation that Mission Schools have been losing their distinctive character over the years because of too much control from the Ministry of Education and if this trend is to continue long enough it might just reduce the Mission schools to the level of Government schools. We have heard hon. Members say and it is also in Dr Goh's Education Report that aided - schools are in many respects superior to Government schools. Unless we want the aided-schools to come down or degenerate under the management of the Ministry of Education to the level of Government schools, I suggest that many of the controls should be done away with. I would suggest that the Mission schools be left completely under the management of the schools' Board of Governors, but since the Government has the responsibility for the welfare of all citizens, whether young or old, and has put in a share in the form of capital grants, pay the salaries of teachers, etc, it is only right that the Government be represented on the Board of Governors just like the many industrial undertakings in which the Government has a share and that the Government appoints certain members to the Board of Directors. Such industrial undertakings are then left to carry on business under the watchful eye of the Board of Directors. For the Mission schools, the Ministry of Education could spell out what the schools are expected to achieve in general terms and then let the Board of Governors run the school. The Ministry need not come down to the level of insisting, for example, that the Catholic Junior College or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Anglo-Chinese Junior College must function three long days and two short days a week just like the Government run National Junior College. Surely the principals of the Mission junior colleges run by their own Board of Governors should know how to arrange the classes according to the needs of their students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is no need to insist that the Mission schools conform to the number of hours to be spent each week on certain subjects as in Government schools. There is no need for the Ministry of Education to insist that religious teaching must be conducted at certain hours. It is a detail best left to the principals to arrange. If we are to have schools of distinctive character, the control and regimentation from the Ministry head-quarters must be minimal and, if possible, abolished altogether. The heads of schools and Boards of Governors must be given a freer hand in the management of their schools. The teachers who choose to teach in the Mission schools must not be transferred out against their wish and, in the case of appointment of the aided-school heads, the Board of Governors should have the final say. I know that the Ministry of Education requires the School Board to advertise the vacancy in the press and then submit three names to the Ministry for its selection. I think this is wrong and is an unnecessary interference with the management of the school. I think it is important to bear in mind that if a school were to preserve its character, the choice of the principal must be left to the school authorities. The Mission school authorities and the Ministry of Education should not, and need not be on two opposing camps. Rather, they should be partners and together find solution to problems, never losing sight of what their common goal is - i.e. to provide the best environment and the best way to turn out "worthy citizens". Thus, both sides can learn and adopt the good points of each other.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the impression that the Mission school authorities have been receiving the directives from the Ministry headquarters as though they are 'edicts', or perhaps they have given up suggesting alternatives because the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> suggestions in the past had fallen on deaf ears? Whatever it may be, they should not take without question the directives from the Ministry headquarters. If they had done that, they would have been vindicated by the Goh Report. I must state categorically here that it is not my intention to cast aspersions on individual officers in the Ministry. For all I know, not one of them is responsible for the sorry state of affairs in the Ministry as revealed in the Report.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland has been put up as an example of having a successful system of bilingual education and, mind you, this is without a Ministry of Education. I wonder what would be the reaction if I were to say, "overhaul completely our existing Ministry of Education". I mean abolish the part of the Ministry's work which could be considered "shackles" by the schools but just keep a minimum staff for the reduced administrative work: return the majority, if not all the professionals to where they really belong - the schools. Would this, in the final analysis, not be good for our younger generation? Or is this suggestion a preposterous one?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now say just a few words on the proposed streaming of primary school children. Since it is proposed that the parents be given a say in the matter and it is also admitted that there is no foolproof way of assessing the children at this stage, I would suggest that only general principles and guidelines (including syllabus for the different streams, if you like) come from the Ministry of Education and whether the children will go into the Primary 4A, 4B or 4C or from 4A to 4C or from 5C to 5A classes and so on, could be left entirely to the school principals and teachers because they are the people who know the children best. In this way we can avoid the problems and the stigma that can come about if all the children are put through a standardised mill at Primary 3 or 4 level. In this way, do we really lose anything if we do the streaming on a national scale as is being done in Primary 6 now?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be allowed in passing to mention that the present system of selecting students for admission to secondary schools and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> junior colleges may after some years result in the branding of schools and colleges into different classes, that is. A class, B class and C class; or first, second and third grades. The selection for admission to junior colleges is based on the number of points attained at the 'O' level examinations. If a student has less than so many points, he is allowed to join, say, National Junior College: and if he has more than a certain number of points he goes to, say, Catholic Junior College. I have no doubt oversimplified the selection process. I understand it is done by the computer, What I want to ask is whether this, in time to come, would lead to the concentration of the brightest in one college, the next best in another, and so on. If so, is this desirable?. Shall we not consider other alternatives, such as grouping students according to the subjects they propose to take, e.g., those taking Mathematics and related subjects go to, say, the National Junior College and Temasek, those doing English and related subjects go to, say, Hwa Chong Junior College and Anglo-Chinese Junior College, and so on?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that almost every citizen has an opinion about education, including Members of Parliament, though the great majority claim ignorance about education. No apology is needed. For all at one time or another have been taught and are now parents with kids in schools, the hon. Member for Alexandra excepted. In any case, we have complete freedom of speech. Biologists talk about metaphysics, inorganic chemists about theology and blunt men write to the press to say that Lim Chong Yah does not know anything about economics. In our context the question is whether the various points made and proposals put forward in the last few days will ever be accepted by the authorities. Accepted or not accepted, I feel that the contributions to the debate must have some potential value.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an optimist. Of all the thousands of words of wisdom uttered in this House, some no doubt will fall on fertile ground and bear fruit in the years to come. I have no doubt
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whatsoever, none whatever, in fact not I alone, for I can confidently say on behalf of all my colleagues in this House, having heard them all, that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education and everyone of his officers would put their whole heart and soul in their job, that is, to make sure that our young citizens get the best education that is humanly possible to give.
  <br>3.55 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we spent four days debating the problems of education. I cannot, with the time at my disposal, give justice to all the comments made by Members on the subject. I therefore welcome the amendment made by my colleague, the Minister for Health, that a proper account should be taken by the Ministry of Education of the wise words spoken by wise men and that at various stages of implementation, due consideration be given to them. What I can do, with the time at my disposal, is just to refer to some of the more salient points and I will discuss them not necessarily in order of importance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is pressure on pupils due to an overload of the curriculum, and to allegedly misguided parents who put pressure on their children to perform well in mental tests, and so on and so forth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hon. Members have compared the present plight of school children with the happy days they themselves enjoyed while they were in school. The Senior Minister of State (Prime Minister's Office) said that he spent a lot of time during his school days catching fish and flying kites, and so did other Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not let this occasion pass without telling Members how I spent my school days. I regret to say, almost to confess, that my school days were a period of idleness. I showed a total lack of ambition. My parents made no attempt to pressurise me to study. Perhaps I exhibited no dragon-like qualities. Whatever it was, I never did my homework. I did my Mathematics homework during
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Geography or History periods. For this purpose I found it prudent to get a desk right behind in the classroom so that the distance between the teacher and myself was the maximum. Fortunately, Latin was taught after recess, so I found time during the recess to do Latin homework with the generous assistance of considerate fellow students. When discussing this, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember, during the tea break two days ago, that my colleague, the Minister for Law and Science and Technology, did exactly the same thing. He never did his homework. However, he had the misfortune of being caught because I suspect he did not take the precautions which I did. So he was sent to a detention class. But thereafter he decided to do his homework and topped the class each year from then on. He became a model scholar and won the Queen's scholarship. Sometimes I wonder whether I am fit to hold this job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, when I heard the Member for Kampong Kembangan complaining bitterly yesterday that school children instead of studying in tuition classes were actually spending their time frolicking around, I thought that was a sensible thing to do. I would have done it myself. However, as a Minister, I must suppress my instincts. I must work the system, however poor it may be. And I must commend my colleague, the Minister for Law and Science and Technology, as a model student and not myself.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You are being too humble.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why is it that in our time we took our studies very lightly, whereas today's children are working very hard? Is it because our parents were enlightened whereas today's parents are not enlightened? I do not think so. I think the reason is an economic one. During our time the British were in charge. The good jobs were held by Europeans whether they be in the Civil Service, the Police, the hospitals, the University, in business or in the professions. So the schoolboy at that time saw very little prospect of a satisfactory career. There was very little inducement to excel. In fact, career
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> opportunities were so poor that another colleague, the Minister for Health, seriously contemplated entering the priesthood. Fortunately for Singapore he changed his mind at the last moment and opted for a career as a scientist, so that we are not deprived of his distinguished services to the party, to the Government and to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> What about his soul?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Today, the opportunities for talented young men and women are vast. The whole world is virtually their oyster. Is it to be wondered then that they will try to excel? And they do their best to get four distinctions at 'A' levels, or even five distinctions if we allow them. There is nothing wrong about this. There is nothing wrong about parents pressurising their children to study hard, of course, with the caveat that all this must be done within limits of their children's capability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not share the alarm which many Members have expressed about too heavy a pressure on children because of curriculum or monthly tests or whatever. After all, the curriculum at 'O' level is very much the same as the curriculum for Senior Cambridge which the Minister for Labour and I had to sit for in our time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to moral education. Almost every Member who has taken part in the debate has expressed his strong opinions about this. In my view, we should take special note of the views expressed by the Member for Mountbatten and the Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office, on the dangers of deculturisation. As we move more and more towards a predominantly English form of education, as we are more and more exposed to the media influences coming to Singapore, this would become an increasingly difficult problem to counter. It is a problem because the danger is greatest, not with the least educated but with the most highly educated, as the Member for Serangoon Gardens has explained. It is not a problem with the PSLE failures who are attracted by the counter-culture, but a problem with university undergraduates and even university post-graduates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many views have been expressed on the content of moral education, how it should be conducted, what kind of citizens we want to produce. All these will be duly considered. But I think Members have missed the essential point. So far as the process of education in schools is concerned - and here I am concerned with moral education in schools - we have to embody these ideas, these norms, these principles or whatever we call them, into the teaching system, and this has to be spelt out in the curriculum and syllabuses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need now is not so much more ideas about what should be taught. We shall get a fairly good solution - at least I look forward to that - from the committee headed by the Minister for Communications. What we need is not so much more discussion of ideas or content but implementation - how to bring all these excellent and very desirable objectives into a system that can be applied in our schools. Let me explain more simply what I mean. Last night I was at the Conference Hall listening to a concert by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Then it occurred to me that the whole point about moral education was exemplified by the Conductor of the Orchestra, Choo Hoey. A year ago when I wanted to start the Orchestra, I invited him to Singapore and asked him whether he was interested in starting an orchestra here and becoming the Conductor. He immediately replied yes. He would like to take on the job. I asked him, "Why?" And this is interesting. He has two children and he did not want his children to be educated in Europe. He wants them to be educated in Singapore. He said he came from the Chinese stream. That is one cultural advantage of Chinese education. He is a colleague of the Minister for Communications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we really need is a Choo Hoey in the Ministry of Education who can advise the Ministry on how to spell out all these excellent objectives into a working programme. I hope the Minister for Communications' committee will give some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> thought to this because this is a crucial element. Once we move from the realm of discussion into the realm of implementation, we must get someone who knows how to do it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many tricky problems here. Morality is not culture-free. In other words, different peoples and different societies have their own different moral values. Morality is also linked with religion and this is a very sensitive subject in Singapore. Therefore, we should really try to look for a fairly level headed, practical educational expert with experience of curriculum development in this particular field of moral education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true, as some Members have suggested, that moral education is not taught in other countries. Moral education is taught in British schools for instance, though not as a compulsory subject which we intend to make in Singapore. This is a very crucial area in the future development of our educational system. The various views which have been expressed by Members coming from different school backgrounds, different cultural streams, different religions, will be valuable to the Ministry when we plan our programme in this field.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents have come in for a lot of critical comment, not only in regard to over-pressurising their children but also in regard to their role as moral educators of their children. I am not as pessimistic as most Members are about present-day parents. After all, they must be a pretty good bunch of people. Otherwise we would not have made the grade in the face of so many difficulties, so many problems and so many crises in the last 15-20 years. If the adult population which are parents today have not the right quality and the right moral attributes, I do not think we could have made the grade. What concerns me more is the next generation of parents. When children are more and more exposed to influences of modernisation or Westernisation, and their parents, especially the present-day younger ones, have not instilled in them the same conviction of the Confucian ethics or Christian values or what have you, so that they could rub off these on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to the children, such moral values will decline. For this reason, we shall have to pay special attention to the teaching of moral education as a subject in schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry administration has been criticised severely in the Report. I am very glad to hear some Members saying that Ministry officials should not be regarded as scapegoats. I entirely agree with this sentiment. In fact, the Report has explained at some length the defects of the system and not the inadequacies of individual officers who have to operate the system. In our discussion with them, we found that they are very concerned with the problems. They are very hard working. But at the same time, one gets the feeling that they found the problems facing them rather overwhelming.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought the team of systems engineers with me so as to try and make improvements. Improvements cannot be done overnight. One of the things which needs to be done very quickly is the installation of a computer. We have asked the Finance Ministry for money, and approval has been forthcoming with unusual speed. It is quite an economical type of computer costing $588,000 only. It is a mini-computer with print-out facilities and 15 on-line terminals. It should be ready and in operation in about 16 months' time, after which if I am still Minister of Education, I will have less reason than my predecessors to make errors in decision making.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the mechanics of management is not the core problem in our education 2system, even with the computers and even with a better system of decision making. We still have to solve other problems. Members have rightly identified that one of these is creating better relationship, better communication between schools and the teachers and principals and Ministry headquarters. The relationship at present is unsatisfactory. The Schools Division is overhauling the whole system of working. Why is it unsatisfactory? How did it come to such a sad state of affairs? I have gone into this problem in some detail and I have come to the conclusion that the Singapore Teachers' Union must bear
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> part of the blame. This matter has a long history, probably going back to colonial times when teachers felt that they stood in great danger of being victimised by the principals, many of whom were Europeans. And quite rightly the Union insisted that evaluation of teachers should not be left to school principals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any system in any bureaucracy, once a practice is introduced it goes on. It has its own momentum of inertia. So the result is that when the school inspectors go on their rounds they are regarded as a threat by the principals and teachers. They are there really to find fault and see whether the principals and teachers are doing their jobs properly, whether the drains are properly swept, tuckshops kept clean. We cannot have good relationship between teachers and principals and the Ministry headquarters if the relationship is basically an adversary one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we in the Ministry are thinking of is to make the objective of the Inspectorate different. We feel that they should go to schools, not individually to inspect the teachers but as a team, to see what are the problems facing the school and how teaching methods can be improved. In this way the Inspectorate could assist principals and teachers to achieve better professional standards. In fact, this is the way inspection of schools is done in other Commonwealth countries. But for some reason or other the system of individual inspection of teachers which originated in the long past just kept on going, with very unfortunate results.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I come to the comments of the Member for Whampoa about variation in school performances dealt with in Chapter 3 of the Report. The Study Team found considerable differences between schools, insofar as they are judged in terms of percentage passes in Primary School Leaving Examination and 'O' level examination. Some schools have 100% passes and others have about 20% passes. Then the Team examined some of the factors which gave rise to this variation. One would expect that where the ratio of pupils to teachers is small, the school would produce better results. That is the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> normal expectation: one teacher to fewer pupils. But, in fact, we found the reverse relationship. This is explained by the fact that parents know which are the good schools and send their children to these schools. Parents know also which are the bad schools and avoid them. That is what paragraph 5.3 is about. The hon. Member should have read the first two sentences and then he would have found the reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. My point was that the finding, legitimate as it is, does not point to any policy conclusion that there should not be improvement in the teacher/pupil ratio. It is as simple as that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is the Member's inference. There is nothing said about policy on improving or not improving the teacher/pupil ratio. This is a study on the causes of variation. Then there are other factors listed out in paragraph 5.4: Dedication of teachers, Teacher's teaching method, and Quality of pupils. The Member says, "The Team should have gone into greater detail. Why did they not do it?" The answer is simple. It is not a Ph.D. academic dissertation. The Systems Engineers have to do a practical job and they have got to finish their work in time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. Sir, I was not advocating that the education officials, the Systems Engineers, embark on a Ph.D. exercise. Far from it, Sir. I am concerned with commonsense approach, that is, if the finding is that the majority of good schools are Government-aided schools and no explanation is given, why this is so? If no attempt has been made to explain why this is so, then I say, they lack commonsense. That is all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think the reasons why Government-aided schools perform better than Government schools are known to all Members. It is not necessary to state the obvious. First, they are older schools. Many of them have histories of up to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 100 years. My old school celebrated its Centenary only two years ago. Second, many of them, being private schools, have teachers with strong religious backgrounds. They are more highly motivated. I must really give the Member for Whampoa a word of advice. He is an academician. It is very praiseworthy for an academician to want to know everything. But when you are running a Government Ministry and you have to run a policy, there is one state of mind a good administrator and a good policy maker must avoid at all costs. I call it "Child in toy shop syndrome" - what do you want? I want everything! You cannot have everything.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. It is a serious point which I am pursuing. It is no laughing matter. What I am concerned about is: how do we produce better schools? How do we produce better students? If the finding is that there is something in the Government-aided schools that tends to produce good quality students, then we had better examine what these qualities are. Off-the-cuff, the Minister gave several reasons, and I say, "That's it." And they are very crucial points. There is the dedication of the teachers, dedication of the principals, the values, the attitudes, the morals of the teachers and the principals. These are critical. This is no toy-shop syndrome, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If anybody in the Ministry does not know that the better schools are produced by better teachers and that better teachers are more dedicated, then he should not be there. We have to deal with the practical problems of the world and there are enough at hand to occupy our attention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, a new working relationship must be established between the Ministry, schools and principals. We have started it and I hope in course of time it will show results.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members were concerned about the morale of teachers and questioned the conclusion of the Study Team that the low morale of teachers was more apparent than real. The Member for Nee Soon put the proposition very succinctly. He said that 72% of those interviewed believed their social status was poor, 92% were worried about too
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> many changes, 82% said they had no chance to air their grievances, 74% claimed that they have no chance for promotion. Then he asked this question: how can only 18% have low morale? The logic of this argument is relentless. If this were a chess game, I say, this is "checkmate." I concede the point to him that the conclusion drawn by the Team is faulty in logic.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I go on to say that those Members who doubted the conclusion of the Team on the ground that we interviewed only 140 teachers and not 18,000 teachers were on the wrong track. We did in 1977 send confidential questionnaires to 18,000 teachers. Only 30% of them expressed dissatisfaction with the work as compared with a much higher level of dissatisfied teachers encountered by the Systems Engineers. So it is not the number of teachers you get data from that counts, but the way you approach them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that teachers were overawed by the Systems Engineers who in most cases are much younger than the teachers. I assume their approach to the teachers was such that they had to gain their confidence. So I concede the point to the Member for Nee Soon that the morale of teachers is a problem and it is a problem which we have to tackle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members said that we should not take a decision on this and that we had better wait until we get more opinion. I completely disagree with this view. It is not necessary to wait any longer. We spent four days debating on the Motion. Some Members have gone out of their way to seek the opinion of their constituents, parents and teachers in their constituency, and I think we have got inputs from all strata of society and at all education levels. Now, to defer a decision on this is to show a pathetic indecision on the part of the Government, an inability to decide to come to a conclusion when on the whole the response of the general public has been favourable. Secondly, it is implicit in the Motion that there will be flexibility in implementation and that parents' views will be fully taken into account.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour has moved an amendment proposing an additional resolution which I accept, that is, in two or three years' time the working of the new system will be reported to Parliament and debated again. The Minister for Health has tabled an amendment proposing two resolutions which again I think will be very useful. In the face of all this, I think we should proceed with the Motion and the amendments. We will be voting on them and not defer a decision on this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual education has always been a very tendentious issue. I listened with great attention to what my colleague, the Minister for Health, said about how the brain absorbs knowledge on language when it is presented in the form of phonograms or ideograms. It is just as well that I did not take up Medicine. When I left school I was toying with the idea of becoming a doctor. Then someone told me that I had to know the names of all the bones. I decided that this was too tiresome. Anyway, after listening to his account, I am very glad that I did not take up a medical career. I have great difficulty following his talk. If I understood him right, he was against bilingual education because in the learning of one language one part of the brain is working and if two languages have to be learnt, the same person will find -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Point of clarification. Mr Speaker, I think my colleague, the Minister of Education, has got me wrong. I did not say that I was against bilingual education. I was saying how, in the case of the Japanese, two operating systems in the brain reinforce each other because they were teaching one language, whereas in Singapore we have got two separate languages but they do not reinforce each other. I distinctly added that bilingualism can be practised in Singapore provided certain parameters or weightages applied to one language as against another are clearly spelt out. The other point which I very seriously made is that the fault lies with the Ministry of Education, namely, they have been teaching Chinese for so many years that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> up-to-date they have not been able to produce the list of 2,000 characters which the pupils ought to know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I stand corrected, Mr Speaker. I am very grateful for the Minister's clarification.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for Labour, believes that the standard of Chinese taught in schools should be raised and that an additional year should be allotted for this. I am not sure whether this proposal would be acceptable to the majority of parents. Singaporeans are an impatient people. They want returns from their children very quickly. If we tell the children, "You spend one more year so that your Chinese language can be more proficient", I think it is likely to generate opposition to the Chinese language and may well be counter-productive. However, it is provided in the Report that if some parents want the teaching of Chinese or Tamil or Malay to be of the highest possible standard, then we will make provision for these children. But I do not think we should enforce higher standards all round and ask that 'O' level be done in five years as a consequence of this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Chinese schools are going to vanish. In fact, at the instance of the Prime Minister, nine of the best Chinese schools have been selected for special assistance. They will be given extra attention by way of allocation of teachers, provision of teaching aids, new buildings, and so on. They will also be encouraged to receive the best of our primary school leavers. In this way, we would minimise the negative effects on Chinese education in Singapore as a result of parents' preference for education in English.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the controversial subject of streaming. I agree it is a beastly thing to do to children at Primary 3 or Primary 4. I also agree that it offends against the egalitarian instincts of most Members of Parliament. Most Members have to be responsible to their constituents and they want fair play all round. The mere idea of streaming slow learners from fast learners lays it open to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> criticism of being elitist. No Member of Parliament can be more fair and more conscious of the rights of the working class than the Member for Anson, Mr Devan Nair. I think what he said on this subject bears repetition and I would want to read extracts from the excellent speech he delivered four days ago. I quote him:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Egalitarian societies which have sought to bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator have invariably come to grief. Thus it is that even in the professedly egalitarian society like the Soviet Union, special schools are provided for the exceptionally gifted and talented, in the spheres of music, art, mathematics and science. My colleagues and I in the NTUC have had no difficulty in satisfying the working class on the ground that talent and ability must be assessed and paid for at their market value and sometimes at their international market value.'
  <br>
  <br>Then he goes on to sound a note of warning to the elites, the high-flyers who make their way to the top, and he said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... our meritocratic elite must never forget that the rewards of their excellence and high performance are ultimately justified only by the quality of their commitment and service to the general social good.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a few words about the meritocratic elites produced by our educational system over the last decade. Unlike the time when my colleague, the Minister for Law and Science and Technology departed for England on a Queen's Scholarship (I think there were only two of them), today we send more than 200 of our best scholars abroad on various scholarships each year. Unfortunately, too many of them come back as Engineers. There are not enough engineering jobs in the Government Service to employ all of them. After all, the Public Works Department workshops repair trucks and broken-down bulldozers. How many engineers can they employ? The Telecommunication Authority of Singapore can employ some of the electronic engineers but only a limited number because they find that those produced by the Polytechnic are more useful and down-to-earth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to the Ministry of Defence in 1970, things were in an awful mess. Quite frankly, it was far worse than the Ministry of Education ever was. This was because of the very rapid expansion that took
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> place in 1968-69 which outstripped all our manpower capabilities. So there was a desperate need for talent of any kind. Fortunately, there were lots of these engineers around. So we got them into Mindef and they assembled themselves into all kinds of teams in logistics, manpower and so on. Eventually we found that their skills acquired in engineering colleges abroad could be put to good use in solving management and administrative problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also learned a number of lessons from this exercise. It may be useful if I were to relate this experience to Members, not because it is directly relevant to the Motion but it is relevant as to how best we can make use of high-quality manpower. Of course, there are some who are basically selfish. There is nothing we can do about it. They serve their bond and after that, whatever we do, they say, "Goodbye. Now I want a job in the private sector." There is a lack of commitment. Unfortunately, there are some like that. There are others to whom money is less important than the satisfaction they get from their work. For instance, the team of systems engineers who helped me with this Report. They could have got much more pay if they left Government service and work in the private sector. But they found that the work is of value. They found that it was a challenge to their intellect. They believe that the outcome of their work, if successfully implemented, will be of value to Singapore as a whole and they derive enormous satisfaction from this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to get commitment from them we must put them in jobs which are challenging to their minds and in which they can produce results. I must say that quite often they have to work as a team because in solving complicated problems one person alone cannot achieve results. We need a management team to do the job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this point because some 45 or 48 engineers have recently been recruited into the Administrative Service and they are now being distributed to the various Ministries. So I do urge my colleagues, the Ministers and Ministers of State in charge of those
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Ministries, to bear in mind that if they have high-quality talent they must know how to use them. Otherwise, they will lose them. And that is because if the talented ones feel that they are not making any contribution and that their work is not challenging, then the fault is not theirs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely agree with the Member for Anson that we should train our talented young men and women to the highest level of excellence they are capable of and we should not place any constraints or handicaps in the path of their development. That is why I cannot agree with the proposal by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour that all students should have a common five-year stream for 'O' level and we allow double promotion for high-flyers. Everyone knows that accelerated promotion is seldom practised in schools. Further, he forgets that the five-year stream 'O' level is meant for those who could not do 'O' level in four years. If they can get 'O' level in four years, why spend an additional year? I see no point to this. Where is the stigma in getting your 'O' level in five years or getting your 'O' level in four years? I would have thought that the stigma is more on those who do not get 'O' level at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. I did not suggest accelerated promotion alone. I proposed then that the system could consider double promotion but it would be better if the brighter students were to be creamed off to classes using syllabus as that proposed for those who can complete GCE in four years. There is the difference between creaming-off and downward streaming-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think this is really an exercise in semantics. If you cream off the better students and put them in a four-year stream and allow the rest to do the five-year stream, then what is the difference between his so-called common system and the one proposed in the Report? In fact, it is not a common system because there are two streams, one four years and the other five years. Some Members have recommended that when streaming is done they should remain in the same school. I agree with this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> proposal. I think it is a very practical one and should be a feature of the system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming is invidious and it is against egalitarian instincts and yet most Members have recognised this as necessary, an evil necessity as one Member has put it. The experience in Japan as well as in Taiwan could be instructive. According to the Systems Engineers who studied the Japanese system in more detail than I have, the Japanese do not tolerate inequality among themselves. For instance, in the big Japanese companies, like Mitsubishi or Mitsui Company, the big multi-national companies, the difference in pay between the President, the top executive, and the office girl is only six times; a very narrow margin. This means that, taking the case of a bank which I know of, if the office boy gets one-sixth that of the Managing Director, you have to pay him $30,000 a year. But this narrow margin of income in Japan is just an illusion. The Japanese know that if you want a good man you have got to pay him well. The take-home pay of the Managing Director is peanuts. He finishes it off in one evening out. What he gets is an unlimited expense account, Somebody has calculated that the expense account of Japanese business executives is greater than their total defence budget! Perhaps "wily" or "cunning" is not the right term.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are a very ingenious people. They know how to get the best of all systems. Look at their school system. They know that if they have common examinations, as we have in the primary school and secondary school at 'O' and 'A' levels, then children of different abilities will be 'showed out' to be different. Many of them will fail and they think that is bad. So they do not have any common examination. Every school sets its own examination and everybody passes. Everybody is happy. Now, what will happen if we were to try it here? At one time we had a semblance of the Japanese system in the sense that we had automatic promotion. The result was that for many school children, as they got promoted upwards, they under-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> stood less and less of what was being taught. In the end when they failed the Primary School Leaving Examination, they joined the Army as illiterates. But in the Japanese system it does not matter. Here in Singapore you are teaching them in English and if they cannot understand what is being taught in school, they cannot speak in English. But in Japan, if they cannot understand all the kanji and katakana, they can speak Japanese. That is one option open to the Japanese which is not open to us. All Japanese school children move from primary to secondary school and 38% of them go on to the universities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet we know for a fact that competition under the Japanese school system is extremely fierce, much fiercer than it is here, How do you explain this? The difference is that their streaming is not within schools, that is, slow learners, average learners, above average and brilliant students. They stream between schools. The best students try to get to the best schools. So there is fierce competition for entry into the best schools. The average students have to be satisfied with average schools, and the slow learners go to the slow schools. So it solves itself. The slow learners can learn at the same pace because they are all slow learners in the school. But since the Japanese parents are also like Singapore parents, they also believe that their children will become dragons and they all want to send their children to the best university, that is, the Tokyo University. Once you have gone into Tokyo University your life is made. You can choose jobs because the big businesses will woo you into their service. You can choose the Government Ministries. Every prestigious Government Ministry, like the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will want your services. From then onwards there is only one way you move - upwards. There is something about Tokyo University which is called Todai - in Chinese it is Tung ta. If you acquire the aura of Todai, this will ensure you success in your post-graduate life. So to get the Todai, you must get to the best secondary schools. To get to the best secondary schools, you must get to the best primary schools. To get to the best primary schools, you must get to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> best kindergartens. Therefore, competition begins at the kindergarten stage. Whichever way you arrange your education system, there will still be competition. The best will want the best. The average will lose out to the above average.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have said that in future we must pay greater concern to the majority. This sentiment was warmly received by Members of the House. Quite rightly so. Indeed, the purpose of this Report is to pay more attention to the great majority. As we have explicitly stated, the brilliant 8% can look after themselves. We make no recommendations. It is for the 92% who somehow do not fare as well as the 8% that we have to make various adjustments so that they too can develop at their own pace to realise the fullest potential during their school career. That is the purpose of the Report.

   <b>CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will make several amendments to our Constitution. The principal amendment will restore the two-thirds majority rule in regard to future amendments to the Constitution. This was the position before December 1965 when the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1965 (No. 8 of 1965) was enacted after the Separation. The amendment was required because of the constitutional changes that took place, firstly, in Singapore when we gained independence through federation with Malaysia, and later when we separated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 14 years have gone by since. All consequential amendments that have been necessitated by our constitutional advancement have now been enacted. The Government has therefore decided that the time has come to restore the position before December 1965, so that after this Bill goes through, all future amendments to our Constitution will require a two-thirds majority of the total number of Members of the House. This provision is set out in clause 7.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to amend the Constitution in so far as it will allow the appointment of extra Judges of the Supreme Court who will be known as Judicial Commissioners and will be appointed for limited periods of time and with such limited jurisdiction as may be deemed to be appropriate in order that they may help out in the disposal of cases in the High Court. Similar provisions for the appointment of temporary Judges to deal with any backlog of cases that may arise are commonly found in the laws of many countries of the Commonwealth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change relates to our citizenship laws. As the law now stands, renunciation of citizenship can be made by any citizen. Once this renunciation is registered with the Government, the act of renunciation is complete. Together with this, the citizen not only loses all his citizenship rights, but he is also free from any obligations (for example that of national service) which he may still owe to the State. It is solely for the purpose
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of dealing with such-minded citizens that clause 6 has been drafted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 6(2) the Government may withhold the registration of a declaration under this article:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the declaration is made during any war in which Singapore is engaged: or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if the declaration is made by a person subject to the Enlistment Act unless he has -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) discharged his liability for a full-time service, or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) rendered at least three years of reserve service in lieu of such full-time service; or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) complied with such conditions as may be determined by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution, as I said, was first enacted as the Constitution of the State within a larger federation. Accordingly, in dealing with the qualifications for eligibility for election as Head of State, the Constitution requires that such a person should be born "in Malaya". Now that Singapore is an independent sovereign nation, it would seem incongruous to have a provision stipulating that a person cannot be President of Singapore without his having been born in Malaya. Accordingly, the Bill seeks to amend Article 2 by deleting the words "born in Malaya" therein. As a result, a citizen will qualify to be President notwithstanding where he was born.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken about the main amendments. There is another amendment which I have not referred to. It deals with the reprint of the Constitution, and it merely provides the Attorney-General with the necessary powers to print and publish the consolidated reprint of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>5.31 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a few observations on this Bill. It is to be welcomed that at last the Con-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> stitution of the Republic of Singapore will be consolidated into one compendious volume. At the present moment, to find out what the Constitution of Singapore is we have to look into the Malaysian Constitution and also at various Acts that were passed by this House from time to time. So it is to be welcomed that at last we are going to have one document that will have within itself the entire provisions of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more important, Sir, is the provision that is being made now for the appointment of Judicial Commissioners. While it is to be welcomed, I find it a little strange as to why it should be difficult for us to appoint full-time Judges instead of appointing Judicial Commissioners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I would also recommend that the time has come for us to develop our judicial system by the appointment of a permanent Court of Appeal instead of having an ad hoc Court of Appeal, so that our Judges would have more time to develop the law instead of being harassed by having to listen to cases at first instance. In this Court of Appeal, our Senior Judges could be appointed on a permanent basis and the new Judges appointed can hear most of the cases at first instance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Sir, I welcome this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Kuo Chuan asks why it is necessary to appoint Judicial Commissioners when we can appoint more Judges of the High Court. The answer is this. As in England where Judicial Commissioners are appointed just to hear divorce cases, a situation might arise in Singapore where we have so many claims with regard to personal injuries or deaths caused by accidents on the road - we have a spate of cases - and in order to help the High Court get rid of this backlog of cases, a Judicial Commissioner is appointed just to deal with accident cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the permanent Court of Appeal, this is a matter which we will give consideration to. But I must remind the Member again that the appointment of Judges is a matter for the

   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>5.37 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Income Tax (Amendment) Bill is necessary, first, to give legislative authority to a number of tax concessions previously announced and, second, to streamline procedures and improve existing legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the concessions. In my 1977 Budget Statement, I announced that to further develop Singapore as a financial centre, the 10% concessionary tax will be extended to cover all offshore income derived from Asian Dollar Market operations, other than exchange profits and transactions with domestic banking units and residents. Clause 13 of the Bill now provides for this concession by re-enacting section 43A of the Income Tax Act so as to confer greater flexibility in specifying the types of offshore income which will qualify for the 10% concessionary tax. This concession takes effect from Year of Assessment 1978.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also taking effect from Year of Assessment 1978, tax on income from reinsurance business will be reduced from 40% to 10%. This concession is designed to develop Singapore as a centre for reinsurance business and to encourage reinsurance companies to remit back into Singapore
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> premia earned from parties overseas. Clause 14 makes provision for this, by legislating a new section 43C to the Income Tax Act. As a consequential amendment, clause 9 seeks to amend section 26 of the Income Tax Act to provide for maintenance of separate accounts by insurance companies in order to ascertain income derived from reinsurance business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income derived from Asian Currency Unit operations and offshore reinsurance is taxed at the concessionary rate of 10%. Clause 2 provides for a new section 13B to exempt from tax the dividends declared by a financial institution or an insurance company engaged in such activity so that the dividends when received by the shareholders are not taxed further. The 10% concessionary tax is the final tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export promotion has been the cornerstone of our trade development policies. The double tax deduction benefits currently given to participation in approved overseas trade fairs and trade missions have been of assistance to our manufacturers. In order to further encourage these efforts in export promotion, three concessions have been granted. First, with effect from 13th September, 1977, the double tax deduction benefits are extended to manufacturers who participate in approved local trade fairs which are organised to promote the export of Singapore-made goods. This concession, however, does not apply to enterprises which are already enjoying export or other incentives under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act. Second, the eligibility for claiming double tax deduction in respect of participation in overseas trade fairs has now been extended to include traders and banks. Thirdly, with effect from 1st January, 1978, the double tax deduction benefits have also been extended to resident companies in Singapore, engaged in the manufacture of goods in Singapore or the export of goods manufactured in Singapore, for expenses incurred in maintaining an approved overseas trade office established exclusively for the purpose of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> promoting the export of Singapore manufactured goods. This concession which was announced in my 1978 Budget Statement is aimed at encouraging our exporters to undertake direct and intensive export promotional activities. These three additional concessions are incorporated in clause 4 of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial and farm buildings are currently eligible for depreciation at an initial allowance of 10%, with the balance of the capital depreciated over 45 years. To lessen the tax burden on owners of industrial buildings I had, in my 1978 Budget Statement, increased the initial allowance of 10% to 25% and reduced the depreciation period to 25 years with effect from Year of Assessment 1979. Since farm buildings are exposed to more rapid wear and tear, such buildings will be allowed an even faster rate of depreciation, over 15 years, besides the initial allowance of 25%. Clause 6 seeks to amend Section 16 of the Income Tax Act to provide for this. This amendment also provides for the granting of initial allowances to purchasers of an unused industrial building or structure, including the purchase of a leasehold interest therein of not less than 25 years, which was not occupied previously and for which no initial allowance has been granted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in the personal income tax rates applicable to individuals and Hindu joint families which was announced in my 1978 Budget Statement is provided under clauses 12 and 21. Clause 12 also limits the rate of tax on remitted income of the individual or a Hindu joint family to 40%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the amendments in the Bill designed to streamline procedures and improve existing legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definitions of "business service passenger vehicles" and "private motorcars" under the Motor Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Rules, 1972, have brought about an anomalous situation. A sole proprietor or a partner of a professional firm can register his motor car as a private vehicle, use it in connection with his business, and claim tax deduction for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> expenses under section 14 of the Income Tax Act without having to pay the double road tax and Area Licence Fees applicable to business vehicles. To rectify this anomaly, clause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend section 15 of the Act to restrict the deduction for expenses only to motor cars which are registered as business service passenger vehicles. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 1979. Clause 8 makes a consequential amendment to section 19 of the Act to restrict the granting of capital allowances only to cars which are registered as business service passenger vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there have been increasing instances of companies with accumulated trading losses acquiring the entire shareholdings of profit-making companies for the sole purpose of off-setting dividends declared by the acquired company against the accumulated trading losses of the "loss" company. To plug the exist4ng loophole in tax, it is proposed to amend the Act by introducing a new section 37A to disallow a deduction for any losses incurred by a company against dividends received by it from an associated company. This is provided under clause 10. The proposed section 37A also has provisions to ensure that bona fide companies are not thwarted in making acquisitions for normal commercial reasons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Income Tax Act, an employer's contribution to CPF is an allowable deduction in ascertaining income, provided the CPF contribution does not exceed 15% of the remuneration paid by the employer to the employee. In July, 1977, the maximum CPF contribution was raised from 15% to 15 1/2%. In July, 1978, the Government again raised the maximum CPF contribution from 15 1/2% to 16 1/2%. To reflect these changes, clause 3 of the Bill seeks to correspondingly raise the employer's maximum contribution to 15 1/2% and to 16 1/2% for the purpose of tax deduction for the relevant periods. This clause has retrospective effect from 1st July, 1977, and from 1st July, 1978.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of administrating the Act, the Comptroller of Income Tax has been faced with the difficulty of collecting the 40%
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tax on director's fees paid to non-resident directors of Singapore companies. At present, although the tax liability exists, there is no provision in the Act to instruct the paying company to deduct the 40% tax at the time of payment of such fees. To enforce collection procedure, it is proposed to amend the Act to introduce a new section 45B to allow deduction of the non-resident director's tax liability at the time of payment. This is provided under clause 16. Clause 17 makes a consequential amendment to section 46 of the Act as a result of the insertion of the new section 45B.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill amends section 79 of the Act to ensure that no peremptory objection can be made to the Chairman of the Board of Review in the hearing of an income tax appeal. This amendment is to tighten up the existing legislation in order to ensure effective functioning of the Board of Review.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to bring about necessary and desirable changes to the Legal Profession Act in the light of present day conditions. These changes have been contemplated for some time and have been rendered all the more urgent as a result of the recent spate of cases involving lawyers who have failed to live up to the high ethical standards required of their profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of a practising solicitor involves handling large sums of money on behalf of his clients. On any day a solicitor may have a few million dollars in his Clients' Account. So this demands a high standard of reliability and honesty. This may be said to be true of all professional men, but with regard to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> solicitors these requirements are a sine qua non to practice. The law itself recognises that the relationship between a solicitor and his client must always be one of uberrimae fidei, a Latin expression that presupposes the existence of the utmost good faith on the part of the solicitor towards his client.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act confers on advocates and solicitors the exclusive right to legal practice in Singapore. In effect, it creates a monopoly. It is of utmost importance that this exclusive right is not abused, if public confidence in the profession is to be maintained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the respect for the professional code of conduct and its strict adherence is the responsibility of the governing body of the profession - the Council of the Law Society. It follows that the law has to ensure that the Council can and will effectively discharge its duties and obligations as guardian of those in practice so that the public standing of the profession will be maintained if not enhanced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interests of both the profession and the public, the main provisions of the Bill seek to -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) reconstitute the Council and vest it with adequate powers to intervene in a solicitor's practice when circumstances so warrant;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) secure tighter control over solicitors by quicker and more effective disciplinary procedure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides that the Minister may nominate not more than three advocates and solicitors to sit on the Council of the Law Society. Though this is new, it should not affect the independence of the profession or its self-regulatory character. The great majority of Council members will still be elected by those members of the profession who are in practice, but it is hoped that the Minister's nominees will spur the Council into action.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 deals with elected members of the Council who will consist of -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) six practitioner members of not less than 12 years' standing;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) five practitioner members of under 12 years' but not less than seven years' standing; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) four practitioner members of under seven years' standing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 makes it compulsory for an advocate and solicitor to vote for the election of members of the Council. If he fails to do so without good excuse, he must pay a penalty of $500, which will be credited to the Solicitors' Compensation Fund maintained by the Law Society, before he can apply for a practising certificate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is designed as a preventive measure to safeguard the public from dealing with solicitors who are financially embarrassed. Accordingly, a solicitor will be disqualified from applying for a practising certificate if he is an undischarged bankrupt, or he has entered into a composition with his creditors, or he has one or more outstanding judgments against him amounting in the aggregate to $100,000 or more which he is unable to satisfy within six months from the date of the judgment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 read in conjunction with clause 22 will extend the powers of the Council of the Law Society so as to enable the Council to intervene effectively in a solicitor's practice in the circumstances enumerated in paragraph 1 of the new Schedule to be inserted in the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present an Inquiry Committee must inquire into any complaint against a solicitor and report the matter to the Council before the Council can apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a Disciplinary Committee. This has led to considerable delays.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expedite disciplinary proceedings, clause 15 makes it mandatory for the Council to apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a Disciplinary Committee, without having to refer the matter first to the Inquiry Committee, in any case where a solicitor has been convicted of the offence of criminal breach of trust or of any other offence involving fraud and dishonesty. Sir, there have been some recent cases where solicitors have been convicted in court, have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> gone to jail, have served their sentence and yet the Inquiry Committee has not completed its investigations and findings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, where a case is referred to the Inquiry Committee, clause 16 requires the Inquiry Committee to commence inquiry and present its report within certain time limits so as to preclude the possibility of undue delay. On receipt of the report from the Inquiry Committee, the Council too will, under the amendment contained in clause 17, be obliged to act expeditiously within one month of the receipt of the report. It is hoped, Sir, that as a result of these changes the procedure of disciplinary control over solicitors will be streamlined, and be made more effective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, the amendments contained in this Bill are designed to give better protection to the public in their dealings with and reliance upon solicitors. This piece of legislation should be welcomed not only by members of the public but by those lawyers who would like to see the maintenance of the highest ethical standards in the profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all said and done, Sir, not all lawyers are crooks even if they take to politics. Otherwise, Sir, the administration of justice in the Republic will collapse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>6.00 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I note with regret that this Bill has to be introduced in this House. I am not a member of any profession and therefore it might well be a good idea for me to speak my mind on what the people of Singapore expect of those who have benefitted from society by the training they get to be professionals. Among these professionals we find many of them in high office, including membership of this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are black sheep in every profession, be it the medical profession, engineering, architecture or accountancy. We have gone through a number of seasons. At one time it was the season of the doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> We aimed the rifle at them, and then it subsided, and came on again, recently. We had an accountants season, and an engineers season. There was a very brief architects season. But none of those "shooting seasons" culminated in so grave a situation as to justify the introduction of a Bill in this House to strengthen the measures regulating the legal profession. In the absence of any statistics from the Minister on the black sheep in the other professions, I think it is singularly unfair to highlight one profession by the introduction of this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One factor which weighs unfavourably against the legal profession is the custody of a large amount of cash held by solicitors. I wonder if we are not overdoing things. It is agreed that the clients and members of the public who enlist the services of legal practitioners must be protected. We do not disagree with this fundamental right of protection of their clients. In the same way, Sir, a medical doctor can, by negligence, cause the death of a patient. An engineer can, by negligence, cause the collapse of public buildings or bridges. I cannot mention a particular case, as it may be sub judice - perhaps some lawyers would come forward to defend me free of charge after I have spoken on their behalf! There are architects who put up defective designs resulting in a loss of money - invisible to members of the public - and having to make good certain defects of a building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to point out to Members of the House the peculiar system (I think it is a good system) in the legal profession. It is that the Law Society has the power to conduct a Committee of Inquiry and the law in this regard seeks to place a time limit for the submission of a report on the deliberations of the committee. The Law Society will have to inquire into the matter and establish a prima facie case. I stand corrected, Sir. There are so many members of this profession here in this House - the Law Society has first to establish a prima facie case before referring it to the High Court, and then the disciplinary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hearing is in open court. Am I correct there, Mr Minister?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Therefore, the public media are fully informed of the proceedings of an action against a legal practitioner, quite unlike the other professions where they have closed-door sessions. I do not think there is any other profession which is bound by the procedure of disciplinary action being conducted at the High Court. If a bad engineer, a crooked accountant, or a negligent doctor is debarred for six months or a year, the case is not made known to the public. The respective Society just de-registers him; once in a while such a case might catch the attention of the public media and is reported in the press. But the integrity of every member of the legal profession suffers the singular disadvantage of being exposed in open court. Fair though, it may be, that the member can contest and is entitled to legal representation. But I want the House to be aware of this. It is not that there are more crooks in the legal profession. As I said, there is an equal number of black sheep in all the other professions. But why should the legal profession be singled out by the very system of inviting the attention of the media?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister has any statistics of the number of black sheep in the various professions who have been disciplined. Unless he has statistics to justify the case that the legal profession is way above the other professions in producing, so to speak, dishonest members, I am afraid I have to vote against this Bill. I wonder if the Minister could also produce statistics from other countries, say, from the United Kingdom from which we derive most of our legislations, as to the number of black sheep in the legal profession and, for that matter, the other professions too. Perhaps the Minister would like to enlighten the House whether he also contemplates introducing legislation to regulate the professional behaviour of the other professions. To the legal profession which I have no vested interest, I feel that they deserve the same treatment accorded to the other professions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Just because it is entrenched in the rules and regulations of their profession that their cases are to be heard in High Court and with the publicity given to it, they should now suffer the end result of the introduction of this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of voting, Sir, I have no quarrel. It is a good innovation to compel every member to exercise his vote to determine who should be the leaders of their profession. But, very unfortunately, some senior members of the profession had been found to have misbehaved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of a time limit for the Committee of Inquiry to submit its report may well seem reasonable. As the Minister has explained, some Committees of Inquiry take an unduly long time to inquire into a matter. But I should like to invite the Minister's attention to the possible counter-productivity in this matter because the time limit may well force members of the Committee of Inquiry to come to a decision one way or the other, in which case justice is not done. I do not know whether there is provision for flexibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of bankruptcy, Sir, the Bill does not appear to contain any provision to consider cases of exceptional circumstances. Members of the legal profession are also very frequently involved in other business and, just because of mismanagement of his business, or that he has no business acumen (not everybody can be a businessman), or because of his wrong judgment in business opportunities, he suffers financial loss which might lead to bankruptcy. This does not mean that a person who is a bad judge in business should be automatically branded as unfit to practise his profession. It is the same with doctors, architects and engineers who are involved in business. There are instances where their business failed. This does not mean that the capability of the doctor, architect, engineer or accountant is that much less as a professional. There appears to be no provision to cater for this contingency. I think it is unduly wrong. It is unfair to bar a person from practising his profession just because he is not a good businessman or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> maybe he stands surety for another party who absconds and lets him down. So a blanket statement on bankruptcy which might lead to barring a legal practitioner from practising his profession is a point which the Minister must consider.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just been reminded that I have to withdraw my threat as I am not supposed to vote against the Bill. The Whip is not lifted in this case. After the conclusion of the Minister's reply, I shall not be present in this House as a gesture of protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I did not know that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour was also an expert on the law. As for bankruptcy, if he thinks that the provision is unfair, let me remind him and other Members of this House that if they should go bankrupt, they will also lose their seats. So what is wrong with putting this provision on lawyers who deal with millions of dollars of their clients' money?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. We do not depend on our position as Members of Parliament for a living. But professionals do.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, maybe the hon. Senior Parliamentary Secretary does not depend on his MP's allowances for a living, but some other Members do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to him for pointing out that when a solicitor gets into trouble, a disciplinary committee is appointed, and the hearing is public. If there is a case against him, he is prosecuted in court. One lawyer prosecutes and another lawyer defends and everything comes out in public, whereas in the case of a doctor, the Medical Council hears the case. What goes on inside we do not know. But the case can, on appeal, go up to the High Court and it is only there that it is heard and made public, but the original hearing is within closed doors.

   <b>PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>

  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Public Entertainments Act to tighten the supervision of public entertainments in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pin-table" as defined in the present Act means any machine operated by coin or disc. In this Bill the definition has been widened to include any machine operated by electricity or by hand. This will prevent operators of pin-tables from circumventing the provision of the Act by altering the mechanism of the machines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "film" has never been defined in the Act. It is therefore necessary to have a definition. In this Bill, the term "film" has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been defined to cover cassette films, video tapes and video records which are being widely used as media of entertainment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present definition of public entertainment in the Act includes, among other things, "sporting contests of any kind between any number of persons or animals". With regard to the sporting contests, this Bill seeks to exclude those contests organised by any registered society, trade union, company or association from the definition.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the present wide range of public entertainments, the Licensing Officer should have greater flexibility in administering the Act. The wordings of sections 10 and 14 of the Act are too restrictive. Section 10 has accordingly been amended to enable the Licensing Officer in issuing a licence to impose such conditions as he thinks fit. Similarly section 14(1) has been amended to enable the Licensing Officer to cancel or suspend a licence if he is satisfied that the public entertainment provided is contrary to the public interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a deterrent to those who contravene the provisions of the Act, the maximum penalty has been increased from a fine of $2,000 to $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>6.22 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I welcome the amendments to the Bill, but I would like to seek clarification with regard to clause 4. Clause 4 seeks to add to the original provision, that is, section 14(1), the phrase, "or is contrary to the public interest". The effect of clause 4 of the amendment is to empower the Licensing Authority in the Ministry of Culture to cancel or suspend a licence if he is satisfied that it is contrary to the public interest to provide the entertainment. Implicit in this amendment is that the Licensing Officer will not issue any
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> licence to any person running an establishment which seeks to provide any public entertainment which is not in the public interest. I think this is correct.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to seek clarification from the Minister as to what is meant by the term "public interest" in the field of entertainment, and to ask the Minister a specific question in relation to this, i.e. whether he thinks the public entertainment promised by the Playboy Club of Singapore is or is not in the public interest. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope this is not an unfair question to ask of the Minister. In consideration of this question, I hope the Minister will be guided by the following comment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the advertisement of the Playboy Club in the Straits Times of 26th March, 1979, page 8, the club will provide certain services and facilities, and I am sure Members are interested to hear what these are. On the surface, they appear to be similar to those offered by other entertainment places. These include, "a main restaurant area, VIP room, cocktail lounge, discotheque, health centre, video-tape library, games [what games, I wonder] and board rooms and international shows." Now, Members may ask, what is so objectionable about all these?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Straits Times, page 8 of Section 2, the Playboy advertisement stated it would provide, "very special facilities which are not available in other Singapore Clubs." Unfortunately, it did not give details of what these ..very special facilities" are. But from what I can gather, what is special is that all these services and facilities will be spiced with the Playboy paraphernalia, which will properly reflect the Playboy philosophy. The Club, as we all know, is part of the empire of this person, Hugh Hefner, and its role will be to propagate the Playboy philosophy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Playboy philosophy? Sir, may I be allowed to quote the Club's advertisement put out today: it states inter alia:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a catalyst for positive social change, the Playboy Club initiates and looks for projects that are innovative, experimental and frequently controversial.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1965, the Foundation has provided extensive support for groups striving to advance human rights and freedom. Its 1978 priorities provided assistance to organizations concerned with the issues of First Amendment freedom, women's rights, drug-law reform, sex-law reform, capital punishment and government surveillance and police spying.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent recipients of Playboy Foundation grants include the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is seeking to end the death penalty in the United States, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union: and the E.R.A. Political Action Committee of Illinois."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one Minister perceptively read the statement, it would appear that the Playboy Club is more political than it is recreational. If it is so, it must state so. It is also very clear that the Playboy Club is an American institution, and is a banner of its permissive society. Its worst and pre-dominant feature is its advocacy of total permissiveness and sexual freedom. Its symbol is the Playboy Bunny, which aptly portrays one of its principal beliefs: that the woman is merely an object and plaything of the man; she is all body and no brain. Thus, the Playboy paraphernalia will include the Playboy bunnies, magazines and other articles of interest which cater to the prurient taste of the clients. This is what sets it apart from other entertainment places. Sir, lest Members have the wrong idea, I must confess I have not been inside any Playboy club, nor do I have the wish to visit one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister will examine the case carefully and comment on whether the existence of the Playboy Club of Singapore is in the public interest. The Minister should not only consider the types of services and facilities that the Club states it will provide but look into what it stands for. That is really the crux of the issue and on which the Minister must base his decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the past few days we have in this House highlighted the need for moral education in schools and the Hon. Minister is also the Chairman of the Committee of Parliamentarians studying this issue. He surely cannot fail to see the relevance of this matter to moral education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Further, as the Acting Minister for Culture, he is the guardian of public morality. I am, therefore, certain that he does not want all his good efforts to go to waste: that is, our moral education programme be undermined by such a brazen organization as the Playboy Club of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a coincidence that the Playboy advertisement in the Straits Times of 26th March, 1979 was published side by side with a story about a case of communist subversion in Singapore. So you see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the worst of yellow culture represented by the Club and the devious work of red culture represented by the communist cells were displayed side by side. How extraordinary! To me, they symbolise the twin threats to our society; moral decadence and communism are threats to our society that we should constantly guard against and prevent them from overwhelming us, So may I ask the Minister: what is he going to do about this particular threat?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as Acting Minister for Culture, I have on a number of occasions stated the cultural policy of the Government. One of the aims is to equip our youths with the necessary ballast to withstand the adverse influence of the permissive West. During the last few days, we have heard in this House the emphasis and the need of moral education in our educational system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that we should not allow the moral standard of our society to be unnecessarily undermined by activities in the public entertainment field. In view of what I have just stated, the meaning of the term "public interest" is quite obvious. I am afraid I am not familiar with the Playboy philosophy. Like the Member, I have not visited the Playboy Club and I am therefore not familiar with its activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Playboy Club Singapore (Pte) Ltd, as I have ascertained very recently, was registered with the Registry of Businesses in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> early 1977. It has yet to set up a club premises and yet to conduct any business activities. I will therefore instruct my officials to consult the Attorney-General on the status and proposed activities of this company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern of the Member in this regard and I would certainly instruct the Licensing Officer of the Ministry of Culture on the entertainment activity field to keep a close watch and supervision on the activities of this company and to ensure that the conduct and activities of this company will not in any way work be contrary to our public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how does the Hon. Minister propose to keep a close watch on the activities of the Club?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, if the club intends to put up any live shows, it will have to apply for a licence from the Ministry of Culture. As the Member has mentioned earlier, according to the advertisement published in the Straits Times by the Club, it intends to have a video tape library and maybe providing viewing rooms for these tapes. If so, I will assure him that all these tapes will have to be submitted to the Film Censorship Board for approval which is the subject of the Cinematograph Films (Amendment) Bill which I will introduce later.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Yap, before you start, may I remind you that you have to speak on the merits of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, in the public interest, I feel that the Playboy advertisement in today's Straits Times is contrary to public interest because it is rather misleading.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Before I go deeper to comment on the Bill, I would venture to say that I have got nothing to do with this club and I have not been following its advertisements at all. I happen to read this advertisement in the Members' Room. I therefore take this opportunity to support the Member for Serangoon Gardens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, I submit that the name "Playboy", if it is to serve the intentions of the club as advertised, is misleading. Also some of the words used in the advertisement are couched in vague terms. With your permission, Sir, may I just quote. First, it says it stands for "refinement, distinction and perfection." I wonder in which field of refinement, distinction and perfection?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it says the club is against "topless shows", but it does not say what other shows it is not against. Then there is a "taste for excellence." Here again, I would like to point out that it is couched in vague terms. It says, "to provide very special facilities which no other club in Singapore can provide." Also, "in the promotion of tourism in Singapore" - I wonder how they can do this by talking about "public assistance to organisations concerned with the issues of First Amendment freedom, women's rights, drug-law reform, sex-law reform, etc." and then claim that they hope, with that philosophy to create an everlasting impact on the tourists so that they will go back to their homeland as goodwill ambassadors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the public interest, I support the Member for Serangoon Gardens.

  <b>The Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cinematograph Films Act came into force on 8th January, 1954, and some of its provisions are already outdated. The Bill now before the House seeks to update its provisions to meet the changing needs of present circumstances. I will, however, touch only on the more important amendments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "film" has been widened to include cassette films, video tapes and video records which are widely used nowadays as media of entertainment. As films are increasingly made available for sale or rent to the public for home viewing, their distribution needs to be controlled. It is proposed to widen the scope of the Act to cover the exhibition as well as the distribution of films.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to amend section 9 of the Act to prevent film exhibitors or distributors from presenting the films for censorship after having removed the objectionable parts, and upon approval, restoring them for public viewing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All films intended for exhibition in Singapore have to be submitted for censorship. However, section 14 of the present Act provides that a film is deemed to be exhibited when it is projected in the presence of eight or more persons, including the operator. In order to plug this loophole of uncensored films of undesirable nature being shown in groups of less than eight persons, it is proposed to amend section 14 so that no uncensored film is allowed to be shown in the presence of any person, including the operator, except to show them to buyers, exhibitors or their agents or for the purpose of manufacture or censorship.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also requires all advertisements of films for exhibition or distribution to be approved by the Board of Film Censors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to exclude from its ambit films which are reproduced from local television programmes, or reproduction of any feature, commercial or documentary films, made by an individual for his own private use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for contravening provisions of the Act have also been increased generally.

  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been complaints from the public about the inequitable manner in which some developers conduct the sales of their shop units. The main complaints are the exorbitant option fees and the absence of a completion date in the sales agreement. In some cases the option fee is as much as 10% of the purchase price. The whole sum is forfeited if the option is not taken up. By signing such an option, the purchaser binds himself to terms which are unfavourable to him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of a completion date in the sales agreement enables the developer to escape liability to pay liquidated damages for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> late completion. On the other hand, the developer charges interest for late payment of instalments. Buyers are compelled to take possession and pay property tax when the Architect's Certificate of Completion is issued. This is inequitable because premises cannot be occupied until Temporary Occupation Licences are issued. Some developers demand exorbitant fees for consenting to assign an agreement. There are also cases where a purchaser has to pay the full purchase price even before separate title is obtained. These abuses must be checked and purchasers protected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will regulate the sale of commercial units. It will not, however, apply to buildings containing four or less separate units or to buildings having a Certificate of Fitness or to buildings as may be exempted by the Minister. "Commercial property" is defined as any property approved for non-residential use. Such premises shall not be offered for sale unless the plans have been approved by the building authorities. Rules to be enacted under this Bill will require agreements for sale and option forms to contain such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. Any terms or conditions of sale which are inconsistent with the prescribed terms shall be null and void.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties are provided for offences. Where a company commits an offence, its officers will be held liable unless they can prove otherwise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will put an end to prevailing abuses by developers. By laying down proper safeguards, it will inject confidence in commercial property transactions thereby encouraging the healthy development of this sector.

  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will give legislative authority to two major tax concessions announced in the 1978 Budget Statement. These are the investment tax credit scheme for companies engaged in an approved manufacturing or related technical servicing project; and the 20% concessionary tax rate for companies engaged in regional warehousing and servicing of technical products, providing consultancy and technical services overseas, export of approved Singapore manufactured products, and offshore trading in non-traditional commodities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Expansion Incentives Act has been one of our key policy instruments for industrial promotion. As in the past, the latest amendment is necessary because of our need to be flexible and to adapt to changes in domestic and external economic conditions. As Members are aware, the world
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> economy, upset by the 1974 recession, has not fully recovered. Singapore therefore faces greater difficulty and keener competition in getting investments from abroad. While foreign investments will continue to be vital for economic growth in Singapore, local entrepreneurs must also be encouraged to invest more. We will continue to attract multi-national companies to expand and invest in higher value-added production. At the same time, more of our local companies should improve and diversify their business into the manufacturing of better kinds of products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus an investment allowance scheme is provided for companies investing in projects for the manufacture or increased manufacture of any product or for the provision of specialised engineering or technical services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Part VIA (comprising sections 46A to 46I) is introduced for this purpose. The investment allowance granted will be up to half of the fixed capital expenditure incurred within a specific period not exceeding five years. During the qualifying period and within two years after the end of the period, the company shall not sell, lease or dispose assets acquired under such expenditure. The investment allowance will be credited against the chargeable income of the company and could be carried over to subsequent years until it is exhausted. Dividends which are distributed to shareholders out of such exempt income will also be exempted from tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme will complement the existing pioneer and export incentive schemes. It will benefit projects with long gestation periods and which do not generate profits in the initial years of operation. Manufacturing companies can make use of the scheme to expand and improve their operations. Existing profitable trading or servicing companies can also benefit from the scheme to diversify into manufacturing. The scheme will further encourage industries to use newer and better plant and machinery to raise productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services sector has been doing well despite the recession. Export of services has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been less vulnerable to protectionism. With the fast expansion of our financial, transport and communication and other services, this sector will continue to sustain our economic growth, complementing the contribution of the manufacturing sector. The prospect for further expansion of the services sector is promising. We shall encourage the development of warehousing and servicing, international trading, and consultancy activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build up a more diversified services sector, the 20% concession tax rate is being introduced under the new Parts IVA, VIB and VIC. Part IVA (comprising sections 37A to 37L) deals with the incentive scheme for international trading companies which increase their exports of qualifying Singapore manufactured goods and domestic produce. It also applies to international trading companies doing entrepot trade of qualifying non-traditional commodities, i.e. other than commodities such as tin, natural rubber, crude palm oil and pepper. A company may apply to be an international trading company if:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) its exports of qualifying manufactured goods or Singapore domestic produce separately or together exceed $10 million per year; or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) its export sales of qualifying non-traditional entrepot trade commodities exceed $20 million per year.
  <br>
  <br>If approved, its income from annual incremental export sales will be taxed at 20% for a period of five years. Dividends declared out of such exempt income will also enjoy tax exemption.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI B (comprising sections 46J to 46S) deals with the incentive scheme for companies engaged in regional warehousing and servicing activities. To qualify for this incentive, a company must be spending not less than $2 million on building (excluding land) and capital equipment in Singapore. The portion of its export income which exceeds a base value derived from its
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> average income of the preceding three years will enjoy the tax concession of 20% for a period of five years. Where the company has less than three years of operation, the base value shall be such amount as the Minister may specify, taking into account the export earnings of other warehousing or servicing companies. Tax exemption will be extended to dividends distributed out .of the exempt income.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIC (comprising sections 46T to 46AA) provides for incentive scheme for consultancy services performed on approved overseas projects. Such consultancy services include technical, construction or engineering consultation, design and engineering, fabrication of machinery and equipment, and the management and supervision of the installation or construction of any project. To qualify for the incentive, a company must have gross revenue (excluding costs of materials used or subcontracts made) exceeding $1 million per annum. Again, the incremental income above a base derived from its average income of the preceding three years will enjoy the tax concession of 20% for a period of five years. Where the company has less than three years' operation, the base period shall be such amount as the Minister may specify, taking into account the revenue of other consultancy companies. Dividends paid out of such income will similarly be tax-free.

  <br>

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before this House seeks to improve the administrative machinery of the Rubber Association of Singapore (RAS) and to empower the Association with more authority to deal with members who contravene the Rubber Industry Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Rubber Shipping and Packing Control Ordinance, 1949, of Malaysia permits persons holding shipping licences issued under Singapore's Rubber Industry Act, 1973, to export rubber from Malaysia. However, the Rubber Industry Act of Singapore does not provide for reciprocal validity of shipping licences issued under the Rubber Shipping and Packing Control Ordinance of Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment under clause 2 of the Bill is advanced to provide reciprocal treatment. The proposed amendment exempts a person who is holding a valid shipping licence issued under the Rubber Shipping and Packing Control Ordinance of Malaysia from applying for a similar licence issued under the Rubber Industry Act to export rubber from Singapore so long as the reciprocal arrangement remains in force between Malaysia and Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Act, an applicant for a licence to pack or ship rubber or to manufacture Technically Specified Rubber is not required to be a member of the RAS. This is undesirable as a licensee who is not a member of the RAS will not be bound by the rules, by-laws and regulations made under the Rubber Association of Singapore (incorporation) Act, 1970.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to remedy this by providing that a licence will not be granted or renewed unless the applicant is a registered member of the RAS and is also holder of a valid licence issued under section 4 of the Rubber Dealers Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safeguard against discrimination, my Ministry has also made provision in the Bill to enable a person whose application for a licence has been rejected to appeal to the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Act, a licence is valid for a period of one year from the date of issue. To simplify the issue and renewal of licences, my Ministry has proposed that this provision be amended to allow for licences granted to expire on the last day of the year in which they are issued.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the penalties that the RAS may impose on its members who have contravened the Act or its rules include, among other things, the imposition of a fine. The maximum fine is limited to $10,000 which is insufficient to deter malpractices. My Ministry has, therefore, proposed to raise the fine to a maximum of $25,000. In addition, it is proposed that the quantum of security which may be imposed on an offender to ensure his future compliance with the Act be raised from $10,000 to $25,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is proposed under clause 6 of the Bill that powers be given to the RAS to warn a person of the consequences of further contravention of the Act or any rules made under it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before this House seeks to facilitate the operation of the rubber trade and to ensure that the activities of the Rubber Association of Singapore (RAS) are in line with accepted Government practices
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure there is no discrimination, my Ministry has introduced a provision in the new Bill to enable a person whose application for membership of the RAS has been rejected, to appeal to the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10 of the Rubber Association of Singapore (Incorporation) Act, 1970, provides for an officer of the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR) to be appointed as a member of the Management Committee of the Association. This provision was made in 1973 when discussions were underway to make SISIR the testing laboratory for Specified Singapore Rubber (SSR) samples. However, the SSR producers have established their own testing units. Therefore, SISIR's membership of the Management Committee is unnecessary. Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to delete this provision from the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Singapore Rubber Fund" is a general fund of the Association established under the Act. Its proceeds pay for expenses connected with the administration of the Act. The Association has a fidelity fund to meet claims arising out of default by members of the Association in the course of their business. As the two funds are not related, the Bill seeks to clarify that provisions under section 13 of the Act relating to the "Singapore Rubber Fund" do not apply to any fidelity fund established by the Association.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the activities of the RAS are to be in line with Government practices, clause 5 of the Bill requires the Association to submit its Annual Report at the close of each financial year to the Minister for presentation to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as the RAS is controlling and administering public funds, my Ministry has introduced under clause 6 of the Bill a Schedule containing provisions regarding the keeping of records and audit of accounts of the Association by the Auditor-General or an
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> auditor appointed in consultation with the Auditor-General.
