<div align="center"><b>DEREGULATION IN ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Divestment of Tuas Power)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  if  he  will  give  an  update  on  the  progress   of

deregulation  in  the  electricity industry;  and  what  is  the

current status of the divestment of Tuas Power.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b>

Sir,  in  1995,  the  Government  decided  to  restructure   the

electricity  industry to make it a competitive  market,  but  to

achieve  the  final outcome in several steps over  a  period  of

time.  As a first step, it corporatised the electricity and  gas

undertakings of the Public Utilities Board (PUB) on 1st  October

1995  to  form Singapore Power Ltd (SP).  To facilitate  further

measures  to  introduce  competition, SP  was  structured  as  a

holding company with five separate subsidiaries.  These are  two

generation   companies   (PowerSeraya   and   PowerSenoko),    a

transmission  and  distribution company  (PowerGrid),  a  supply

company (Power Supply) and a piped-gas company (PowerGas),  each

with  its own board of directors and independent management.   A

new  power station being built in Tuas was put under a  separate

company, Tuas Power Ltd (TP) owned directly by Temasek Holdings,

so that it could compete against the SP generation companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since corporatisation, SP has performed well. SP has

ventured overseas, while maintaining an excellent utility system

in  Singapore.   Productivity has increased sharply.   This  has

been  achieved  through  the  joint efforts  of  management  and

employees,  and has enabled SP to offer $720 million  in  tariff

rebates  as  part  of  the  off-budget cost-cutting  package  in

November last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st April 1998, we set up the Singapore Electricity Pool

(SEP), which is an exchange for trading electricity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>

Since  then, PowerSeraya and PowerSenoko have been competing  to

sell  electricity through the Pool.  More recently,  Tuas  Power

Ltd  has begun bidding to sell electricity into the Pool.   TP's

first  600  MW  unit was commissioned on 1st  March  1999.   The

second  unit (also 600 MW) is expected to commence operation  in

January 2000.  TP will begin constructing its second stage power

plants soon, to be operational from year 2001 onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides TP, SembCorp Cogen has also been issued with a

licence  to  generate  electricity.  The  SembCorp  Cogen  power

plant,  when operational in year 2001, will generate 650  MW  of

electricity for sale into the Singapore Electricity Pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing the progress of restructuring in the

electricity  industry, the Government has decided  that  as  the

next  step, SP should fully divest its two generation  companies

in  year 2001.  SP will retain the transmission, supply and  gas

operations, which together form the large part of SP's business.

PowerSenoko  and  PowerSeraya will  be  transferred  to  Temasek

Holdings,  the parent company of SP. Temasek Holdings may  bring

other  suitable shareholders into one or both of the  generation

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will separate the ownership of generators from the

ownership  of  the transmission and distribution  network.   The

generators   are   the  contestable  part   of   the   industry.

Competition between different generators is possible and  should

be encouraged, whereas the transmission grid is non-contestable,

because  it  is  a  natural monopoly.  This  split  between  the

contestable  and the non-contestable parts of the industry  will

assure  all  generators  of a level playing  field  and  enhance

competition in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this change in the structure of the power

industry,  Temasek Holdings is reviewing the divestment  process

of Tuas Power.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this decision to hive off PowerSenoko and

PowerSeraya from SP, my Ministry has been mindful of its  impact

on  SP and its staff.  Government's intention to list SP and  to

structure  the public listing as an asset enhancement  programme

remains unchanged.  SP's regionalisation effort will also not be

affected,  as  SP  can  still  leverage  on  the  expertise   of

generation  companies  within the  Temasek  group  for  overseas

ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring will directly affect the employees of the

two generation companies.  SP management has therefore explained

the  plans  to  the union, which is the Union of Power  and  Gas

Employees  (UPAGE).   The  union  has  expressed  to  management

workers' concerns, including job security, status of employment,

and  the  terms and conditions of service.  SP has assisted  the

union  in  getting the reassurance that this transfer is  not  a

down-sizing  exercise  but  a planned  evolution  of  the  power

industry.   Hence,  there will be no change  in  the  terms  and

conditions  of the employment contracts, and no retrenchment  at

the  time  of  ownership  change. Employees  of  the  generation

companies will be treated fairly and will be no worse off  as  a

result of the transfer.  SP will work closely with the union  to

carry   out   the  restructuring  smoothly  and   with   minimum

disruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Loh Meng See].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if we

had  not  preserved  our own language and  tried  to  learn  our

culture through the use of another language,  can we retain  the

essence of our own culture?  I think it will be very difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read the Chinese version of Shakespeare's works, I

must first of all find out whether it was translated by the best

translator.   Even  then,  I cannot be  sure  whether  the  best

translator   can   translate  100%  of   the   quintessence   of

Shakespeare's  works and the intricacies of the English  culture

at  that time.  Sir, it may not be very difficult to find a good

Chinese  translator.  But, to get a very good Chinese translator

who can genuinely understand the famous works of Shakespeare and

the English culture will be extremely difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after reading the Chinese translation of Shakespeare's

works,  I  tell my English-educated friends that I have  already

understood  the  quintessence and  intricacies  of  the  English

culture,  I  will  certainly make a laughing  stock  of  myself.

Likewise,  if my English-educated friend tells me  that  he  has

read  the English translation of the Chinese classics,  and  has

therefore  fully  understood  the  quitessence  of  the  Chinese

culture, I will just dismiss it with a laugh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bilingual language system implemented by the

Singapore  Government  all  these  years  is  a  very  important

education  policy.   It  has at least  trained  Singaporeans  to

concurrently know two languages.  If we say now that  they  know

two  languages  (with  English as the main language  and  mother

tongue  as the supplementary language) and our students will  be

able to understand the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>

essence  and intricacies of their own culture,  it will   hardly

be convincing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, only very few Singaporeans are truly effectively

bilingual.   Most  Singaporeans  are  proficient  only  in   one

language  and concurrently know another language.  If they  only

"concurrently know" and are not proficient in Chinese, they  can

speak  and  listen, but not so good in reading and  writing,  it

will  be  very  difficult for them to genuinely  understand  and

preserve the quintessence of Chinese culture.  They may  perhaps

feel that although they are not proficient in Chinese, they  can

still preserve the essence of Chinese culture through the use of

other  languages.  This is unrealistic.  I have spent a  lot  of

time  reading  and studying a Chinese translation  of  the  Holy

Quoran.   Until  now,  I can only say that I  know  the  Islamic

teachings of my Malay compatriots a bit more than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I feel that people from different language

backgrounds  may  be  able to understand  another  language  and

culture  through  translation, but it will  still  be  extremely

difficult for them to fully comprehend the quintessence of  that

culture and strike up a sympathetic chord with it.  In my  view,

most people can acquire only superficial understanding this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient Chinese classic "Chronicles by Zuo Qiuming",

there  is  a  saying, " With the skin gone, what  can  the  hair

adhere  to?" - meaning a person or thing cannot exist without  a

basis.   Therefore,  I urge the Ministry of Education  to  avoid

thinking  that  one  could  learn the quintessence  of  his  own

culture through another language.  Only if our students can make

conscientious  efforts to pragmatically learn their  own  mother

tongue,  can  they  preserve the essence of their  own  culture.

Moreover,  Chinese  culture  is rich  and  profound  with  great

compatibility with and accommodation for other foreign cultures.

This  will  indeed be very important for a multi-racial,  multi-lingual society in Singapore.  This will indeed be of great help

to Singapore's future development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Prime Minister said in his National Day Message in 1997 that our

standard  of  Chinese should be enhanced so that we can  nurture

our  Chinese  elite.   This  is very important  because  of  the

regional  needs.  The Chinese market is now open.  To  establish

better  trade relations with China, we need to have  people  who

have  good  command of the Chinese language.  The Chinese  elite

can  also  contribute  in  the fields of  journalism,  politics,

education, the arts and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Chinese family should cultivate and practise

Confucian  teachings, such as honour the elder and  respect  the

wise,  filial piety and harmonious relations.  In order  to  let

the  5%  of our students who have difficulties learning Chinese,

the  Government  has proposed to set up a CL  (B)  programme  to

encourage  them  to carry on studying Chinese  and  learn  their

mother  tongue.   On the other hand, to attract more  people  to

learn Chinese at a higher level, more students will be given the

opportunity to take Higher Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent dialogue session of the Feedback Unit, out of

32 attendees, 27, ie, 85%, supported this move.  I hope that the

Ministry  of  Education  would ensure that  the  principals  and

teachers  of our schools will understand the intention  of  this

new  policy, give it their full support so that the  new  policy

can achieve the desired results.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to produce students with a high Chinese standard, we

need  to  have high quality teachers.  As such, the Ministry  of

Education should take the training of Chinese teachers  strictly

and  seriously. I would propose that the Ministry  of  Education

set  up a special college with Chinese elite lecturers to  train

our  Chinese  teachers to enhance their quality.   At  the  same

time,  those who are now serving as Chinese teachers  should  be

sent  to this college or even overseas for specialised training,

so  that  their  standard of Chinese and their pedagogy  can  be

further improved, and their professionalism

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>

enhanced.   This is particularly important for Chinese  teachers

who  are now 40 years of age and above.  By now, they would have

been  teaching for some 20 years or more.  They should be  given

the  opportunity  to  attend some refresher courses  to  upgrade

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a long-term plan to ensure that we have sufficient qualified Chinese

teachers to teach Chinese and Higher Chinese to meet our  future

challenge.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Sir, I wish to declare my interest.  I am a teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the learning of the mother tongue has been made

compulsory  for  students in all schools.   Proficiency  in  the

mother tongue will enable our students to inherit the culture of

this  community  from  the  older  generation.   Recently,   the

Ministry  of Education has decided to allow more Malay  students

to study Malay at Higher Malay level (HML) in secondary schools.

This is most welcome by the Malay community.  Today, 30% of  the

best Malay students at PSLE are allowed to take HML.  More Malay

students  will  have the opportunity to study  Higher  Malay  at

Secondary One level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the increasing number of students, I would

like  to ask if the Ministry of Education has provided competent

teachers  to  teach  Higher Malay effectively.   Following  that

move,  I would like to ask if Higher Malay will continue  to  be

taught  at  Junior  College and whether  Malay  Studies  in  the

National University of Singapore can be taught at Honours level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay community needs students who are proficient

in  Malay  who  would take over from the current specialists  in

Malay  such as Cikgu Mohamed Arif, Cikgu Masuri, Cikgu Suratman,

and  so  on.  I would like to ask the Minister for Education  if

the  Ministry of Education will set up a committee to study  the

teaching  and  learning of Malay language  in  Singapore.   This

committee, I feel, will be able to make a study as to

whether  the  Malay  community wants an  SAP  school  for  Malay

students or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, we do not need a SAP school for Malay students.

What  has happened to the two well-known Malay schools, ie, Sang

Nila  Utama  and  Tun Sri Lanang Secondary Schools,  will  be  a

lesson  for  our community.  To me, the move by the Ministry  of

Education  today to place the top Malay students in  12  of  the

best  schools such as Raffles Institution, RGS, Tanjong  Katong,

Cedar  and Victoria Schools, and so on, is a wise move.   And  I

feel that if there are 30% of the top Malay students, the number

will  be  about 500.  Certainly, the number of schools allocated

will  be  increased.  At these schools, they  will  be  able  to

compete  with  students from other races of  equal  calibre  and

maybe  even better.  So they will have the opportunity to  study

and  interact  with other races.  We can expect  this  group  of

students,  who  will  be scholars of the community,  to  be  the

professionals  who will be the pride of the Malay  community  in

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that the Ministry provide

additional  teachers  to  teach  Higher  Malay  (HML)  in  these

schools.   These schools will not only be able to  teach  Higher

Malay  and also outside the curriculum hours, they can introduce

the  Malay  students to the culture, literature and heritage  of

the  Malay  community.  In this way, we will ensure a  group  of

Malay  scholars  who  will be the role  models  of  the  younger

generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could give consideration to these

proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, the Indian

community  welcomes the recent announcement by the  Ministry  of

Education of a review of the teaching and learning of Tamil.  In

recent  times,  the Indian students, parents as  well  as  Tamil

teachers,  have  expressed much concern over this  matter.   The

feedback  is  that  the standard and content of  Tamil  language

should reflect the fact that it is being taught and learned as a

second  language  within  the Singaporean  context.   Otherwise,

students  would  lose the interest in their  mother  tongue  and

culture.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for the Minister's response to some key

questions  that  are  being raised at this early  stage  of  the

review.   Firstly,  will  the review be completed  in  time  for

implementation in the year 2000 so that another academic year is

not  lost? Secondly, will the eligibility criteria to do  Higher

Tamil at the primary and secondary levels be broadened as it has

been  for  Mandarin and Malay?  Thirdly, will the scope  of  the

review  cover  the  recruitment, deployment and  development  of

Tamil  teachers? In particular, will the Ministry be considering

initiatives  to enable students to learn Tamil in  their  school

during curriculum time rather than having to go to Tamil centres

after school?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the

establishment  of a Department for South-Asian  Studies  at  the

tertiary level.  When will it start offering courses and will  a

Tamil module be included?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, at a recent sitting of

this House last year, I had said that the learning of our mother

tongue  gives  us a sense of identity and bearing in  our  moral

conduct.   I  thought  then,  and I  still  maintain  now,  that

learning  the mother tongue would help us preserve our  cultural

roots  and  give us a sense of identity.  I also said then  that

the  experience  of  the Chinese in Singapore  is  unique,  only

because  we  are  geographically cut off from the  others.   Our

experience may not be compared with the experience of the  other

ethnic  Chinese  in  Taiwan, China  or  Hong  Kong.   There  is,

therefore,  an  increasing divergence in  the  manner  in  which

cultural  norms and practices are carried out.   Two,  three  or

four generations down the road, I am not sure if the Chinese  in

Singapore can say that we are culturally the same as the Chinese

elsewhere  in  the  world.  Just take a look at  the  third  and

fourth generations of American born Chinese.  If you listened to

them  speak  with  your eyes closed, you would be  forgiven  for

mistaking that it is a non-Chinese who is speaking.  How Chinese

are they?  Could their parents have prevented the tide of change

by  forcing  the learning of the second language on them?   Will

their children or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>

their  grandchildren be as Chinese as they are 20  to  30  years

down the road?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the SAP schools and the policy of

producing a new breed of Chinese cultural elites to my mind only

serves to slow down the inevitable tide of change.  The cultural

norms of the Chinese in Singapore will continue to evolve  in  a

way  that  is totally divorced from the developments in  Taiwan,

China and Hong Kong.  Yes, there will be the external influences

from  these countries.  However, the development of the  Chinese

culture  in Singapore will not be the same.  We have  to  accept

it.   Up  until now, there has to my mind never been  any  clear

policy  statement on the part of our Government as to the extent

to  which Chinese in Singapore should preserve their Chineseness

vis-a-vis their mainland counterparts.  Be that as it may, there

are clear indications that we are losing our edge on our Chinese

speaking  ability.   We  learn  that  an  increasing  number  of

households  in  Singapore are using English as the  language  of

communication rather than Chinese.  Even in households where the

parents speak Chinese well, English is often substituted as  the

language  of  choice.  Just looking at some  of  the  programmes

hosted by our Chinese comperes, many Chinese-speaking friends of

mine  had commented that they are still some distance away  from

their  counterparts in mainland China or Taiwan.   Someone  once

said in an exaggerated manner if only to prove a point, that our

counterparts on television in China rattle off at 1,500 words  a

minute  whereas  we rattle off at 800 words a minute,  and  even

then,  we make mistakes.  This limitation on our ability in  the

Chinese language did not come by chance.  Our people suffer from

a  real  handicap  from speaking Chinese well, compared  to  the

ethnic speakers of the language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we decided on the policy of ensuring that our

standard in the Chinese language is not diluted further  through

the  effluxion  of  time.  We have decided  therefore  that  the

Chinese language should be preserved in the form of SAP

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>

schools  and  recently  the promotion of  the  Chinese  cultural

elites  that  was  perhaps to serve as  a  bulwark  against  the

further erosion of our culture and heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps unfortunate, Sir, that the promotion and

discussion  of  the  teaching of Chinese in schools  in  a  high

profile  and  significant manner, such as the promotion  of  SAP

schools,  cannot yet be carried out in Singapore at  the  moment

without  the  risk of being misunderstood.  As it is,  the  very

suggestion  of  promoting Chinese cultural  elites  is  seen  by

others  as possibly raising a new generation of Chinese  leaders

in Singapore who have little or no contact with minority members

and who then, when placed in a position of public policy making,

make decisions which show very little sympathy for the others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such fears, with all due respect, do not appear to be

founded.  In the first place, I believe that raising a new breed

of  cultural  elites or the Chinese elites is not  the  same  as

raising  political  elites, or civil  service  elites.   I  have

understood  the  term  to mean, in the  context  of  our  recent

debates, raising a group of Singaporeans who are highly  skilled

in  the  Chinese  language, so that they  in  turn  can  act  as

custodians of the standard and quality of the spoken and written

Chinese in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even if some of these cultural elites do become

policy makers, it would be wrong to assume that having spent six

to 12 years in a Chinese speaking environment, these people will

not  have  any sympathy for the minorities.  We seem  to  assume

that  these  people live in a vacuum and would have  no  contact

with  the  minority races.  We have forgotten that  80%  of  our

Chinese  in  Singapore live in housing estates which are  multi-racial  in composition.  We have also forgotten that we have  to

do  National  Service which is also multi-racial in composition.

In  my own experience, I went to a school that did not have many

members  of the minority groups.  Most of my friends  then  were

predominantly Chinese.  It did not matter for me, because  right

from  young,  the  school taught me to respect the  customs  and

beliefs of others who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>

not  like  me.  The society that I operated in believes  in  the

multi-racial   principle  and  expects  me  to  conduct   myself

accordingly.   When I served my country in national  service,  I

had  plenty of opportunity to interact with the minority members

and  I got along well with them.  I never had any problem  if  I

had  to  fight to save my fellow Singaporean who may  not  be  a

Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a multi-racial country and will continue

to  be so.  Having said that, I would like to say that there are

a number of principles that we should observe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are never a melting pot of cultures and should

never be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should maintain our distinct identity and let

it  evolve  in its natural and different way.  As  I  have  said

earlier,  we can never be as Chinese as the Chinese in  mainland

China;  and  I  am not sure whether we want to  be.   We  should

therefore  not insist on maintaining standards at all costs,  as

it  may  come across as being chauvinistic to others.  We should

not  be  ashamed to say that as Chinese, our cultural  practices

have evolved in its own unique way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, each ethnic group in Singapore must accept and

respect  the desire of other ethnic groups to maintain  its  own

identity  through its cultural practices, including the teaching

of  the mother tongue so long as these practices do not harm  or

affect  the interest of the larger society.  In this regard,  we

cannot  demand,  for  instance, that schools  run  by  the  clan

associations  and  which have a history  of  providing  a  total

environment for the teaching of the mother tongue be required to

teach  non-Chinese as second language and, in the process, alter

the  character  of  the school.  As long  as  there  are  enough

schools  in  the  area, there is no compelling reason  why  long

established policies should change.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, our belief in maintaining our separate and

distinct identity should always be subordinated to the demands

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>

of  national and social cohesion.  While we want to preserve and

promote our mother tongue and prevent it from being adulterated,

we  should be aware that rifts may be created within our society

as  well.  We are at the moment beginning to see indications  of

this.  Take the teaching of Chinese language, for instance.   We

have over the years evolved the teaching of the Chinese language

to  the extent that we have differentiated between those who are

able  to take Chinese at first level and those who are not.   In

class  and status conscious Singapore, this is a constant source

of  pressure  and unhappiness.  And now, we have created  a  new

super  class of the Chinese elites, giving much concern  to  the

others about how this would affect our multiracial society as we

know it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, care should be given when relocating clan

schools  that do not offer Chinese as a second language  to  the

residential  neighbourhoods.  It would surely be  a  recipe  for

unhappiness  if  the  school was the only school  within  a  one

kilometre radius and the minority groups are told that they  are

not  eligible to apply and would have to go elsewhere where they

may not have any priority in admitting their children.  I am not

saying that our language policies at the moment have resulted in

any  undermining  of  our national unity that  we  enjoy  today.

However, I would say that if in maintaining our present language

policies, there is a great deal of unhappiness to a point  where

social  cohesion is eroded in the process, the Government should

step  back  and reassess its bearings to see if it is worth  the

sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reviewing the Ministry's policy on the teaching of

mother tongue, I would urge the Minister to bear in mind what  I

have just said.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in the

Ministry's  efforts to improve the teaching of  mother  tongues,

the  quality  of  teachers should be given  emphasis.   This  is

relevant to all mother tongues.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of Malay language teaching in schools, the

younger  Malay  teachers,  like most  other  young  teachers  in

Singapore, are likely to have had an English-based education and

most  would have taken Malay as a second language.  With  regard

to  this, how competent are they in teaching ML1 or higher level

Malay?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has stated that the percentage

of  students taking ML1 will be increased from 20% to 30%.   Are

there  currently enough Malay Language teachers to  be  able  to

cope with an increase of students from 350 at present levels  to

500  in  the  next  year?   If we are short  of  Malay  language

teachers, how will the Ministry increase the number?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other professions that are based on vernacular

languages, for example, journalism in Mandarin, Tamil and  Malay

in Singapore, we are likely to see continued shortage of capable

people  to teach the mother tongues, particularly at the  higher

language  level.   We  can always look  at  the  possibility  of

recruiting suitable teachers from overseas to fill the need  for

such  teachers.  But we can actually still tap the local  talent

pool  for language teaching if we provide the proper incentives.

The  Ministry should consider offering scholarship to `A'  level

holders who are deemed capable to teach the mother tongues at  a

higher level.  At the same time, the Ministry should also  state

clearly  that  second language teachers who have the  leadership

potential stand a chance to be promoted not just up to the level

of senior subject teacher, but also to the level of Principal or

Vice-Principal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

last year, the Government announced a new policy on the teaching

of  Chinese  Language.  Since then,  there  have  been  numerous

debates,  and  both  educators and laymen  have  expressed  keen

interest   on  the  subject.   Judging  from  the   new   policy

promulgated, the Government's approach is very pragmatic for  it

not only concerns itself

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>

with the nurturing of Chinese elite, but also takes heed of  the

need  for  Chinese  language to be learnt by everybody,  and  to

create  an environment conducive to the learning and application

of  Chinese.  In this regard, the policy has laid down  a  solid

foundation.  However, I would like to raise a question on the CL

`B' course which many people are concerned with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are indeed some students who have found

the  learning of Chinese an uphill struggle because  of  certain

special  background and lack of conducive conditions,  and  have

therefore lost interest.  Some people are even worried that this

will affect the future prospects of these students.  In order to

help these students, the Government has devised an easier CL `B'

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in reply to my question on 11th February, the

Minister for Education stated categorically that no student will

be  deprived of a place in the university just because  of  poor

performance  in  his mother tongue.  Students  who  have  failed

their mother tongue were not successful in gaining admission  to

the  university because their results in the other subjects were

also not up to the required standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, relevant figures published by the Ministry of

Education in the newspapers on 1st February showed that only  1%

of  the  `O'  level  and `A' level students failed  in  Chinese.

According to the Ministry, only 260 students out of last  year's

cohort  of 26,000 failed their Chinese papers.  This shows  that

the  vast  majority  of students do not  face  too  much  of  an

obstacle in learning Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot help asking, "Why do we go through all the

trouble  and  mobilize so much resources to set up  the  CL  `B'

course  just to cater for this small group of 200-odd students?"

Some  people  may  even  say that the Government  is  "making  a

mountain  out of a mole-hill".  Moreover, the failure  of  these

students may well be due to some complex factors, involving  the

learning environment and the attitude of the students. This is a

problem that cannot be resolved just by lowering the standard of

the curriculum.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we must not neglect the plight of this small

group  of students and their future.  But looking at it  from  a

wider perspective, to formulate a new course will entail a  huge

amount of manpower, financial and material resources.  Will this

be  in  keeping  with practical economic efficiency?   Moreover,

under  our  present  secondary  education  system,  the  Chinese

language course has already been split into "Higher Chinese" and

"Ordinary  Chinese"  to suit the progress  of  learning  of  the

students.   Now, we are going to have yet another lower-standard

CL  `B'.   Will this not lead to uneven standards in the Chinese

language in our schools?  Besides, will the students who opt  to

take  CL  `B'  not  become  "extra-territorial  beings"  and  be

alienated  from the present mainstream Chinese?   What  is  more

worrying is that by the use of this "downgrading" method to help

the students learn their Chinese, the effect may well be counter-productive.   The  end-result is: students will  avoid  learning

their mother tongue, become opportunistic and take the easy  way

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To students who are weak in Chinese, we must suit the

medicine  to  the illness, and give them ample opportunities  of

study  and immersion. Use more counselling and flexible  methods

of  teaching, to enable them to master Chinese by following  the

prescribed order according to the curriculum indicators, thereby

enhancing their interest in the learning of the Chinese language

and literature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Government's decision to set the

university  admission  criteria based on  a  point  system,  and

students  who fail to obtain the minimum pass of a D7  in  their

mother  tongue will be granted a provisional admission, provided

the  said  students enrol for a one-month mother  tongue  course

during  the  University Year I vacation and pass the  prescribed

examination thereof.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that if the university can continue to

implement  this norm of strengthening the students' learning  of

their mother tongue, ensure that the students have adequate time

to learn their mother tongue, and adopt flexible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>

teaching  methods, it can prevent the students  from  alienating

themselves  from the Chinese mainstream, and at  the  same  time

enable  the  students to master their Chinese in an  environment

conducive to learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we are able to live harmoniously with our

brothers  of  various  races,  and together  contribute  to  the

development of our nation.  This can be attributed to the mutual

understanding   and   tolerance   among   the   various   ethnic

communities.  Therefore, we must continue to preserve and uphold

the  deep bonding among us and promote mutual cultural exchanges

among  ourselves.  In view of this, apart from  encouraging  our

people  to  learn  their  own  mother  tongue,  we  should  also

encourage  everyone  to learn the language and  culture  of  the

other races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Ministry conduct non-examination courses

on  ethnic  languages and cultures in the primary and  secondary

schools  as an optional subject or an extra-curricular activity.

This will provide our students with better understanding of  the

other ethnic communities and improve communications among them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially so for the Malay language. It is not

only  one  of our official languages, but also the main  working

language of our immediate neighbours. Therefore, encouraging our

people  to learn Malay and understand the culture of our  fellow

citizens  not only helps to enhance our social cohesiveness  but

is  also an important way to promote friendly dealings with  and

better  understanding  of  our people  and  the  people  of  our

neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Ministry of Education will give the

proposal  of offering the option of CL `B' a further and  deeper

re-thinking.  Make an overall evaluation of the pros  and  cons,

so as not to commit the mistake of "trying to save a little only

to  lose a lot".  At the same time, please give my suggestion of

having  non-examination courses on ethnic languages and  culture

some serious consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, let me congratulate Mr Iswaran for

having spoken in Tamil.  He has made us all proud and the Indian

community  proud.   This is the first time I  am  hearing  Tamil

since  I  entered the House.  I hope more Tamil will  be  heard.

The only Tamil here is the translated Tamil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's bilingual policy has been the cornerstone

of  our  education.  I applaud the Government's  and  Minister's

assurance  that  it  will be so, despite SAP schools  and  other

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to continue where Mr Iswaran has left.

As  far as the Indian community is concerned, in fact last year,

I  rose to speak on the question of Tamil language, and being  a

small community, we do not have the resources to propagate Tamil

language as the other communities have.  Therefore, I would urge

the  Government to give us a helping hand which we need.   Being

the  underdogs,  we  require  some help  and  support  from  the

Government and the community at large.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is this problem that, in many schools in

Singapore, there are not enough Tamil teachers.  So the children

have  to  go to another school in the afternoon.  May I  make  a

suggestion to the Minister?  Probably, we should appoint  roving

teachers  who could cover two neighbouring schools.   The  other

alternative  is this.  This has been experimented in  the  Hindi

centre  which  runs  Hindu classes.  There are  many  expatriate

teachers  from  India  who  have settled  here.   In  fact,  the

experience of the Hindu Centre is that most of the teachers were

trained in India and they have done very well.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>

Could I suggest to the Minister to try and get these teachers on

a  part-time basis?  They could cover many schools and, in  this

way, the Tamil students will not be disadvantaged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem, which I feel ought to be also addressed,

is  the  question of standard, to which the Minister and BG  Lee

have  both  given  assurance.  It is important  for  the  Indian

community,  especially the Tamil community,  that  the  language

which  we  are going to teach the students reflects the existing

standard.   Let  us not take Tamil Nadu as our  yardstick.   Our

linguistic requirements and our environment are different.   So,

we must nurture the Tamil language.  I am glad that Tamil Murasu

is  doing its best and I am happy that its circulation is  going

up.   But  what is required is an effort to see that  the  Tamil

language is reflective of our standard here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area, which I would like to ask the Minister to

consider,  is  Higher Tamil.  Because, as my  Malay  friend,  Mr

Hawazi,  earlier pointed out, most of the Indian students  offer

Tamil,  as  a  second language, and unlike the SAP schools,  the

standard will definitely be lower.  I would urge the Minister to

consider  ways and means of having more Tamil students  offering

Tamil at higher level.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I just

like  to  ask  the  Minister whether he would consider  allowing

school  premises to be used for religious classes  after  office

hours  at certain designated schools, and, of course, taught  by

religious  teachers from outside.  I say this because  for  some

parents  who want to have their children to have both  religious

and  secular education, they can go to aided or mission schools.

For  others, they go to secular schools in the day, for example,

and  the  later  part of the day, they go to religious  schools.

The travelling time is quite difficult for the children.  But on

a  broader side, I thought if we can somehow teach religion in a

more  secular environment, I think there is a wider  benefit  to

students  and  to all of us.  Of course, schools can  be  better

utilised  and  perhaps  we  can keep these  students  longer  in

school.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

first, I would like to acknowledge and thank Members and members

of  the  public as well for the many useful suggestions and  the

feedback  that  they  have provided.  We  will  take  this  into

account  when  we  design  our systems and  recommendations  for

mother tongue languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I wish to re-affirm our policy objective in the

teaching  of  mother tongue, which is to have every  Singaporean

study his mother tongue for as long as possible, and to as  high

a  level as possible.  I note the concerns expressed by  Mr  Tay

Beng  Chuan  on the CL `B' syllabus.  I would like  to  reassure

Members that strong incentives and disincentives will be put  in

place to encourage students to offer CL, rather than CL `B',  if

they  have the ability to handle the CL.  The reason why we  are

doing this, as we have stated earlier in this House, is that out

of  the  top 30% of students, one in 10 of them is in the bottom

30%  for  CL.   Out  of  the  top 30% of  students  in  English,

Mathematics and Science, one out of 10 is at the bottom  30%  of

CL.   So there is some concern in this area, and it leads us  to

believe  that there is a difference in distribution  of  ability

when  it  comes to language versus other subjects.  The Ministry

is  studying  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  CL  `B'

syllabus,  and we should be ready to announce the details  later

this year.  Yesterday, I have already explained the reasons  for

arriving at our current bilingual policy in our schools and I do

not propose to go through that again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua has said that to imbibe culture properly,

students  must  master the language, and being able  to  listen,

understand  and  speak the language are not good  enough.   They

must  possess  good,  perhaps outstanding  reading  and  writing

skills as well.  I completely agree with Mr Peh.  Obviously,  if

you  have the mastery of the language, you can imbibe and absorb

the  culture much better.  But that is not the point.  The point

that  we are trying to address, at least in part of the proposal

for  the  CL  programme, is that for those who have difficulties

coping with the language, are we better off also to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>

give them some sense of the richness of the culture, even though

it  is via other languages than not to try at all?  I think that

is  the  point.   But  it is quite clear that  if  you  want  to

completely  imbibe the culture and the richness of the  culture,

it is best done in its own language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other non-language written sources of

culture  which are very good.  For example, there are a  lot  of

audio-visual  materials, and a great deal about Chinese  culture

has  been written by people who have studied in other languages.

I  think  we  should not confine ourselves to just insisting  on

transmitting  culture and cultural values via  this  medium.   I

think  we  will  be unnecessarily limiting ourselves.   And,  in

fact,  during  the  Chinese Language Review, many  parents  have

provided  feedback of how they got their children, who are  weak

in  Chinese,  to  be interested in learning more  about  Chinese

culture  and  folklore  through reading translated  versions  of

famous works, such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and so on.

And  perhaps, subsequently, they will then pick up some interest

and  a greater interest in the language and they want to go back

to  the  language.   So  I think these are  mutually  supporting

pillars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incentive we have in place today to encourage students

to  offer  Higher mother tongue at the secondary  level  is  the

award of two bonus points for admission to junior colleges,  for

students  who  pass higher mother tongue in the  GCE  `O'  level

examinations.  This has increased the pipeline of  students  who

are doing higher mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently announced the expansion of the Chinese

Language  Elective  Programme to a third junior  college.   This

will  allow  these students to develop themselves  at  a  higher

level  and  to  go on to be able to become part of  the  Chinese

literary elite which we are talking about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent announcement on the teaching and learning of

Chinese language in schools has also elicited feedback from  the

minority communities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>

First,   let  me  reiterate  that  students  from  the  minority

communities  will  not be disadvantaged  by  the  changes.   The

Ministry  of  Education will apply the same philosophy  for  the

Chinese language to our other mother tongue languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Malay language, I have discussed the current status

of  the  teaching and learning of ML in schools with  our  Malay

MPs,  and  we  agreed that it would be useful  to  carry  out  a

review,  as suggested by a Member over there.  It is timely  for

us  to  take  a  look  at ML teaching to  see  if  we  can  make

improvements,  and  if  we can do more for  those  doing  Higher

Malay.  Our initial assessment is that Malay students are faring

reasonably  well  in  Malay language, but  that  some  non-Malay

students   who   are  doing  Malay  language   may   be   having

difficulties.  So, the study will look at this and other areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will spearhead this review. I

have  invited Minister Abdullah Tarmugi to sit on this Committee

with me.  Other members will include Parliamentary Secretary, Mr

Mohamad  Maidin, and our colleague, Mr Hawazi  Daipi.   It  will

also  have Ministry of Education officials and language experts.

The  Committee  will  have access to all the  resources  of  the

Ministry,  and  will  seek the views of  parents,  teachers  and

others where these are helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review is expected to be completed by about the end of

March  next  year.  Some of the recommendations on the  teaching

and  learning of Chinese language can be considered for adoption

for   the   Malay   language.   In  any   case,   two   specific

recommendations  that we will already be implementing,  starting

from  the  year  2000, are the relaxation of  the  criteria  for

students to offer Higher Chinese at Primary 5 and Secondary 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Tamil language, a review is already

under way.  I expect that this review will take about a year  to

complete  before it is ready to be implemented.  A  TL  Advisory

Committee,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>

chaired by Mr Iswaran, is providing inputs and feedback  to  the

Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues being studied is the standard of TL.

Some  members of the public have written to the press  to  share

the difficulties that their children face in learning TL and, at

the  same time, we have other calls that suggest that the  level

of  TL  is  not quite high enough.  More than 50% of  Primary  1

pupils  offering  TL  today  come  from  predominantly  English-speaking  homes.   As  part  of  the  review,  the  Ministry  of

Education  will carry out an in-depth evaluation of the  current

TL   syllabus  and  textbooks,  analyse  performance  at   major

examinations,  and  gather feedback from students,  parents  and

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides reviewing the TL syllabus, we will also study

whether there is a need for a second TL syllabus, or TL `B', for

the  small minority of students who, despite putting in a  great

amount of effort at school and at home, still do badly in TL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For students who are strong in the language, the relaxation

of  the  criteria  at Primary 5 and Secondary 1  would  also  be

implemented for Higher Tamil.  The Ministry will also review the

current  standard of Higher Tamil, to ensure that it is  pitched

at  an  appropriate  level,  in relation  to  the  international

benchmark,  Tamil  Nadu, but at the same time,  recognising  the

different   context  within  which  students  learn   Tamil   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Tay Beng Chuan's point on learning yet more

languages, Malay in particular.  Those who are able are  already

encouraged to do so, and some students do three languages.   But

these are exceptionally able students.  For most students,  they

have  quite enough on their plate already, by trying  to  master

two languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Ibrahim bin Othman, Mr Hawazi Daipi

and Mr Shriniwas Rai have rightly pointed out whether we achieve

our  intended  objectives  in the teaching  of  mother  tongues,

depends  critically on our mother tongue language  teachers.   I

would like to assure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>

Members  that the Ministry has been stepping up its  recruitment

of  mother  tongue language teachers to meet the  needs  of  our

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of graduates and `A' level holders recruited to

teach  Chinese language, for example, has increased by four-fold

since 1995, to 193 in 1998.  The increase is nearly two-fold for

Malay  language teachers, to 60 in 1998.  In the case  of  Tamil

language, the number of teachers recruited has decreased from 44

in  1995  to  18 in 1998.  This is because of lower  replacement

needs, but the recruitment levels are still generally sufficient

to cover our long-term replacement needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the stepped up recruitment efforts over the past

three  years, the staffing situation for mother tongue  teachers

in  the  schools today is not perfect but relatively good.  With

the  current  batch  of NIE trainees posted to  schools  in  the

middle of this year, the average teacher vacancy per school  for

the mother tongue languages will be about 0.3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further increase the pool of mother tongue teachers,

especially  for the primary schools, besides the  graduates  and

`A' level holders, we have introduced a 4-year Diploma in Mother

Tongue  Language Education, started in 1997.  This is to recruit

`O'  level  holders  who  have done well academically  in  their

mother  tongue  language, and have the  interest  to  teach  the

language  at the primary level.  Over the past two years,  about 30

CL  candidates  per  year  have  been  recruited  into  this

programme.   The figures for ML and TL are 60 and  20  per  year

respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training that teachers undergo in this programme is

very  rigorous.   In  the  first two years,  the  mother  tongue

language  proficiency of the trainee teachers will be raised  to

at  least  `A'  level standard.  They will study  higher  mother

tongue and Literature intensively.  In the final two years,  the

trainees  will  take pedagogical studies and continue  to  study

higher  mother  tongue  and  Literature.   The  first  batch  of

candidates from this programme will graduate from NIE and be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>

deployed to our primary schools starting in the year 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interim, to ensure enough mother tongue teachers for

the  schools,  retired and retiring mother tongue teachers,  who

have  a  good  performance  record  will  be  re-employed.   The

Ministry  will,  at  the same time, also  intensify  its  mother

tongue  teacher recruitment efforts, both locally and  overseas,

and we will take the various suggestions into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from ensuring that a sufficient number of other

mother  tongue  teachers are recruited, the Ministry  also  pays

attention to the quality of the teachers recruited.  The  number

of  graduates recruited to teach the mother tongue languages has

nearly doubled from 82 in 1995 to 154 in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teaching scholarships and awards granted for

other mother tongue language studies has also increased by four-fold,  from  7 in 1995 to 29 in 1998.  More serving non-graduate

mother  tongue  teachers have also been granted study  leave  to

pursue  a  university degree.  A total of 183 applications  were

approved  in 1998, and this is a significant increase from  1995

when only 20 applications were approved.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education recognises the importance of

constantly  upgrading  our mother tongue teachers'  proficiency,

and  ensuring that their teaching methodology remains  relevant.

Besides  scholarships and awards, seminars, workshops,  training

courses  and  briefings  are  organised  on  a  regular   basis.

Examples of recent training include workshops on the use  of  IT

in  the  teaching  of  the mother tongue languages.   And  MOE's

curriculum  specialists also monitor the teaching of the  mother

tongue languages to provide teachers with the necessary guidance

and advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Hawazi that while it is true that

the  younger Malay teachers were educated in the English  medium

and most of them studied Malay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>

at the second language level, these teachers are native speakers

of  Malay  and have done well in the subject.  Furthermore,  the

training  at  NIE for Malay language teaching is  intensive  and

covers  both  knowledge of the language as well  as  appropriate

methodology in language education.  Our young Malay teachers are

competent  teachers  of  the Malay language.   And  those  Malay

language  teachers who are more experienced or who have  studied

the  language  at  higher levels are deployed  to  teach  Higher

Malay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to assure Mr Hawazi that mother tongue

teachers  are  considered for promotion to higher  appointments,

whether  they  are  Heads  of Departments,  Vice  Principals  or

Principals  in  the same way as any other teacher is  considered

for  appointment to these posts.  The Ministry is always looking

for  good  Principals and Vice Principals and it  will  make  no

sense  for  us to exclude any group if they are able to  perform

these roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry will continue to intensify its efforts in

both  recruitment and training.  The more mother tongue teachers

we can recruit, and the better we can equip them with the skills

to  deliver  lessons  that are interesting and  innovative,  the

higher the quality of mother tongue instruction in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I proceed to some other specific areas that

Members have raised?  Firstly, with regard to various studies in

the  universities.   There was a question on  Malay  Studies  at

Honours level.  I think that really depends on whether there  is

a demand from the students.  I will ask NUS to consider this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the South Asian Studies Programme (SASP), this will

be  launched at NUS' Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at  the

beginning  of  academic year 1999/2000.   Preparations  for  the

SASP's  implementation have proceeded smoothly, and the  Faculty

will  be  ready to admit its first cohort of students  in  July.

But we must remember that the South

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>

Asian  Studies  Programme is not a Tamil Studies Programme,  but

there will be Tamil language modules offered as electives.  This

will  provide  an  opportunity for those students  who  wish  to

pursue Tamil language at a higher level to do so, but it is  not

primarily a Tamil language programme.  Tamil language will  also

be  available  as  cross faculty modules to  students  of  other

faculties in NUS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the question of religious education being

conducted  in  schools.  In fact, today, we do  allow  religious

education  to be conducted in schools for preparing students  to

take religious knowledge examinations in the approved courses at

the  'N'  or  the  'O'  level.  For example,  Islamic  Religious

Knowledge (IRK) is an elective subject taught outside curriculum

time  but  in  schools, and it may be offered in English  or  in

Malay.   In  1998, I am told there were four schools serving  as

IRK  centres,  but  this year, because there  are  fewer  pupils

offering IRK, I think there is only one school offering  IRK  in

Malay.   So  this  is already possible, but  this  is  only  for

students taking religious knowledge courses which are leading to

an 'N' or an 'O' level programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I wish to speak on

technical  education, specifically on the Institute of Technical

Education (ITE).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE graduates provide the critical pool of technicians

and  skilled workers in Singapore's economy.  In the  knowledge-based  economy, ITE needs to adjust and adapt their  courses  to

suit  the  new  requirements of the manufacturing  and  services

sectors.   I  wish to ask how is ITE preparing the students  for

the new skills and competencies required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language proficiency is important in the knowledge

economy.   Is language learning given due emphasis  at  ITE?   A

number of students are 'N' level students entering ITE.  I would

like to know for those who wish to pursue further to GCE 'O'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>

levels, what arrangements are being made to help them to do  the

GCE 'O' levels?  How well are ITE graduates doing to qualify for

polytechnic education?  Because if many ITE students  know  that

there  is a route for upgrading, I think more will be interested

in ITE education.  Can more be done to improve the number of ITE

graduates entering into polytechnics?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE has emphasised the importance of apprenticeship

training.   Many  parents  and  students,  however,  shun   such

apprenticeship training, because of the long years of commitment

and,  most  probably, the bonded service.  Enlightened employers

actually are the ones who like apprenticeship training,  because

they  see the value of it, and they know that they would not  be

able to recruit employees with the specific skills required from

the   open   market.    Therefore,  they  are   very   open   to

apprenticeship  training.   Even  in  today's  adverse  business

conditions,  skilled  workers are the ones keeping  their  jobs.

ITE  graduates with good skills and experience credentials  have

the best prospects of stable and secure life-long careers.  Sir,

I  would  like to know from the Minister what is being  done  to

attract more of their students into apprenticeship training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE also suffers from the poor image as an institution of

poor  achievers.   Unless we remove that  stigma,  it  would  be

difficult  to raise the self-esteem of the students and  attract

good   students  to  join  them.   The  students  may   not   be

academically inclined, but are gifted in technical subjects  and

in working with their hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, many ITE graduates have been successful in

their  jobs and careers.  They serve as good examples  and  role

models to encourage others to follow.  More media promotion  and

publicity  efforts  should  be  undertaken  to  show  the   vast

improvements in training facilities and resources  at  the  ITE.

In  fact,  many  of us would be surprised with the  very  modern

facilities  that  we  have.  Perhaps ITE  could  work  with  the

community organisations to change the attitude and perception of

the public towards ITE training.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may the Minister respond?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b>

Sir,  thank you for allowing me to respond at this time  on  the

points on ITE and technical education raised by Mr Loh Meng See.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Loh, first of all, for pointing

out  the  critical role played by ITE graduates  in  Singapore's

economy.   Technical education has indeed been critical  in  the

development  of  Singapore into an industrialised  nation.   The

thousands  of  ITE  and polytechnic graduates  we  have  trained

constitute our national human resource of technical skills.  The

industries  of  today  and  of the  future  all  require  modern

technology.   They  require  enormous  capital  investment   and

technical  skills  at all levels - the engineer,  the  assistant

engineer,  supervisor, technician and the common operator.   Our

ITE  and  polytechnic graduates join the ranks of this important

group of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move towards a knowledge-based economy, technical

skills  remain just as important.  A knowledge-based economy  is

not   just  about  producing  new  ideas.   It  is  also   about

experimenting,  testing and prototyping  of  ideas.   And,  more

important,  it is the subsequent transformation of  these  ideas

into products or services that makes the real money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole process continues to require the support of

technical  skills in every phase and at all levels.   There  is,

however,  a  new  dimension.  More than ever,  it  requires  our

workers  to  have a new mindset, one that requires  them  to  be

adaptable to rapid technological changes and have a passion  for

continual  life-long learning.  Our polytechnics  and  ITE  have

always  stayed  relevant  to the needs and  development  of  our

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare students for the future economy, polytechnics

and  our ITE have already started to reshape the curriculum  and

programmes.   ITE,  in  particular,  makes  sure  that  students

undergo  a minimum of 20 hours of ITE basic skills training,  40

hours of industrial and social studies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>

and  80  hours of communication skills training, which  includes

language  capabilities  in both written  and  oral  presentation

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the image of an ITE education, there is

nothing  to  be  ashamed  of  if we are  not  of  PhD  material.

However, all of us are born with some talent, although  not  all

of  us are born with the same talent.  My Ministry believes that

every  student  should  be developed to his  fullest  potential,

depending  on  his  capability  and  interest.   In   1994,   we

introduced  the Normal (Technical) Stream in secondary  schools.

This is to ensure that everyone attains a minimum of 10 years of

basic  education  before  he starts his  training  in  technical

skills.   The  first  cohort of Normal  (Technical)  Stream  was

admitted  into  ITE in January 1998.  At the end  of  the  first

year,  93% of them passed the first year examinations.  This  is

the  same  rate  as  their 'O' level counterparts  in  the  same

courses.  They have indeed done well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For students who have a strong technical inclination, ITE's

apprenticeship trainee scheme is an attractive form of technical

training where you earn as you learn.  Apprentices take pride in

their work and are valued for their good technical and practical

skills.   That  is  why when they complete their  courses,  they

command a higher salary, 20% more than those who complete  full-time institutional training.  I would like to encourage students

and   parents  to  consider  seriously  the  ITE  apprenticeship

training  as an attractive option to take.  An apprentice  earns

as much as $800 per month even as he learns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh mentioned also the reluctance of some parents to

send  their  children  to  take up this apprenticeship  training

scheme, because of bonding.  That is unfortunate.  But fortunate

in  the  sense  that  today, 85% of the apprenticeship  training

places  do not require bonding.  I am not sure whether  this  is

responding to the market or not.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of ITE in 1992, concerted efforts

have  been  made  to  improve the public perception  of  an  ITE

education.   I  would  like to thank the media  for  the  strong

support given to ITE and its students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the quality of ITE intake has improved considerably.

90% of the intake are students from the 'O' and 'N' levels.  ITE

graduates  continue  to be widely accepted  by  our  industries.

Despite  the economic downturn, 96% of ITE graduates  last  year

managed  to obtain their first full-time job offer within  three

months  of  graduation.   The monthly average  salary  has  also

remained  stable at $1,233 per month.  The proof of the  pudding

is in the eating!

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance which the Government places on technical

education is evident in the investment of $371 million in modern

facilities for ITE over the last 10 years.  This is in  addition

to  the  $1.7 billion of infrastructure investment in  the  four

polytechnics.  ITE today has better facilities, better  teaching

staff and better students.  ITE today has earned its name  as  a

reputable post-secondary institute of technical education.   ITE

graduates can walk out of its gates with their heads held  high,

straight  into  jobs,  and in many cases,  into  a  polytechnic.

Indeed,  there  are many role models ITE students and  graduates

can  look up to.  Every year, new and fresh publications of  the

courses and the success story of ITE graduates are published.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the reports in the

Straits  Times  of  23rd  August 1998  and  17th  November  1998

highlighted  the plight of an increasing number of  students  at

our  schools  who  are unable to pay for their school  fees  and

textbooks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the qualifying income of $530 for our MOE's assistance

scheme  is too low.  The main household income of a 1-room  flat

was  reported to be $630 way back in 1987.  Last week a resident

came to seek my help at my meet-the-people session.  He earned a

monthly income of $650, has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>

four school going children to support, two in secondary and  two

in  primary schools.  I think we should consider the per capita.

I  hope  the  Ministry  will do a comprehensive  review  of  the

matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we all know about

the  incident at Jin Tai Secondary School where, in  conjunction

with   the  Total  Defence  Day,  an  exercise  simulating   the

historical  invasion  of Singapore by the  Japanese  troops  was

conducted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the newspaper report, the teachers and

students in the school did not know that there was going  to  be

such  an  exercise. After the 400-odd teachers and students  had

assembled in the school auditorium, the lights went off, and six

masked  men  dressed up as Japanese soldiers suddenly  appeared,

shouting and yelling.  Some students were ordered to kneel down,

while  some  were  forcibly dragged on to the stage.  Some  were

slapped  and  many  were sobbing and crying.  According  to  the

Straits  Times report, even some teachers were punished  by  the

"Japanese soldiers" and forced to kneel down facing the stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Jin Tai Secondary School exercise has left me with

some  deep thinking. Firstly, the teachers and students did  not

know  beforehand that this was just an exercise. Secondly, there

were  more  than  400  teachers  and  students  and  only  eight

simulated "Japanese soldiers", including the two standing  guard

outside  the  door.  They were overwhelmingly  outnumbered,  and

unarmed.   Thirdly,  more than 400 people,  including  teachers,

timidly submitted to the six unknown invaders, and allowed  them

to do whatever they wanted in the school auditorium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reaction was that of a great shock. How could the

400  teachers  and  students, who clearly  outnumbered  the  six

unarmed  members  of  the National Cadet  Corps   who  acted  as

Japanese  soldiers,  allow themselves to be humiliated  in  this

manner?  Moreover, the teachers and students were not forewarned

of such an exercise. Did they think that this was the real thing

and were so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>

scared that they did not have the strength to defend themselves?

Or is it because they decided to be worldly wise and played safe

to  avoid  worse treatment?  Having thought about all  these,  I

just could not help feeling dejected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I was not present at that time, and I do not

know  what  was in the minds of those who were present.   But  I

feel that this incident has indeed inspired us to think over and

make an in-depth study on what has become of our people and  our

society in these 30 years of nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that in the early years of our nation building,

the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that we should build a

staunch and vigorous society.  It is with this connotation  that

we selected the lion and the tiger to put in our State emblem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, from the reaction of the teachers and students in the

Jin  Tai  Secondary School's exercise, I cannot help asking  how

much  we  have achieved in our target of building a staunch  and

vigorous  society.  Is it because under the strong authoritarian

control  of  our Government, our people have become  soft.   Our

people  have developed the kiasu mentality and the social  value

of being afraid to get into trouble.  Since Singapore is just  a

little  red  dot in the ocean of Southeast Asia,  what  kind  of

impact  will  this mentality have on our future and security  of

our nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no answer to this question. Due to time

constraint,  I will not be able to go into details  on  how  the

social  values  and  mentality of our people today  are  closely

related  to the style of governance of the political leaders  in

this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this incident has reminded me of a small article

in  the  Lianhe  Zaobao which said that when the Government  was

adjusting  its language policy, a reporter tried to interview  a

student  but the student did not dare to be interviewed  because

his  school principal was attending a meeting and he  would  not

commit  himself.   He  insisted  that  without  the  principal's

approval, he could not agree to the interview.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Jin Tai Secondary School's incident,

could  it also be because the principal was attending a meeting,

and  the  teachers and students could not decide for themselves?

They  did  not know whether to put up a resistance or to  submit

timidly.    As  a result, they were humiliated for no  rhyme  or

reason,  and  they  did not even dare to  make  any  noise.   My

goodness, all is lost!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our National Education, I think emphasis should be given

on  how  to  inculcate in our younger generation of Singaporeans

the spirit of resistance and defence.  They should be cultivated

to  rise  up and resist any injustice and unreasonable treatment

upon  them.   They should not be left at their  wits'  end  when

confronted by a sudden attack or invasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> In view of the time, I shall try to be

brief.   Mr  Yeo  Guat Kwang raised the concern about  financial

assistance  for needy students.  Yes, indeed, the  threshold  at

which assistance is given does appear low, but one must bear  in

mind  that  the  Ministry of Education  is  also  following  the

guidelines  set by the Ministry of Community Development.   This

is  something which one has to look at.  However, no student  in

Singapore  who  wants to study in our school has been  denied  a

place  in  a school for want of financial assistance.  If  there

are any cases, we will be very happy to look at them.  There are

numerous agencies and sources of funding.  This year alone,  the

Ministry  expects to offer financial assistance to nearly  3,000

students  totalling $340,000.  But this is in  addition  to  the

help given by schools, community and charity organisations.  The

involvement of the community is important. For example, in 1997,

nearly 53,000 awards totalling more than $11 million were  given

by CCCs and CDCs to our students.  More will also be done at the

universities. The Government has decided to increase the cap  of

the  dollar for dollar matching for NTU's and NUS' student funds

from  half  a million dollars to three-quarter million  dollars.

More bursaries and book grants for the needy undergraduates will

now be possible.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On National Education, Mr Low Thia Khiang has raised the

point that perhaps our students have become soft judging by  the

recent incidents at our school.   I agree with Mr Low.  Perhaps,

in  many  ways,  we  are a victim of our own success.   We  have

become prosperous and perhaps we have become somewhat soft  over

the  years.   It is because of that that we do want  to  promote

resilience  among  our  students and we  can  only  do  this  by

actually  bringing reality and imagination to National Education

lessons.  I would also ask perhaps that Mr Low should not be too

over critical and begin to finger-point scapegoats because we do

not   really  want  to  discourage  the  continuation  of  these

innovative and lively ways of bringing reality to our lessons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has earlier on very eloquently pleaded that

this  sort of activities should continue rather than be stopped.

The answer is not to stop it but to make sure that our processes

are right and well thought through.  I would therefore thank  Mr

Low for pointing this out.  Indeed, we do agree that perhaps our

success has made us somewhat soft and we would try to do more to

move in the opposite direction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I just wish to clarify that it was

not  my intention to pinpoint anyone as a scapegoat.  It was not

my intention.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Would you want to ask your

question quickly, Mr  Rai?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Could I ask the Minister to set up more

boarding schools?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Currently, there are already eight

Government  funded school hostels providing around 1,900  places

to  both  local  and foreign students.  Two other  hostels  with

1,000 more places will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>

ready  by the year 2001.  This is to encourage families who  are

working  and  residing overseas to send their children  back  to

study  in Singapore.  In order to do that, the Ministry has  put

in  place  a  boarding  award scheme in July  1998.   The  award

provides  for 50% of boarding fees for students who are studying

in  Singapore's  secondary  schools  and  is  given  until  they

complete  their  secondary education and  for  as  long  as  the

parents continue to work overseas.  That is the good news.   The

bad news is that there are only 19 students on the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Betting and Sweepstake Duties

Act to introduce a sports betting duty on bets at fixed odds  on

football  games  or  sporting  events  held  inside  or  outside

Singapore.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legalised football betting would be introduced for the

first  time  on 31st March 1999 together with the 1999  S-League

season.   The objectives in legalising football betting  are  to

provide a source of funds to support the development of S-League

and  local  football and to promote sports in general  and  help

stamp  out  illegal football betting.   Based on the nature  and

market for football betting, I have decided on a betting duty of

20%  of gross profits on football betting.  The tax rate of  20%

was  decided taking into account the need of the legal  operator

to  compete  with illegal operators as well as to give  adequate

funding  for  S-League which is in its development phase.   This

rate would be reviewed after two years when the market for legal

football betting is better established.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Betting and

Sweepstake Duties Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Introduction of a new section 2A relating to sports betting

duty  to  put  into legislative effect of the 20% tax  on  gross

profits  on football betting as well as any other sports events,

where the bets received or negotiated are at fixed odds;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Repeal of existing section 4 and substitution of a new

section  4.  Whilst the tax rate on other forms of betting  such

as  horse racing, Toto, 4D and Singapore Sweep is based on gross

bets,  the  tax  rate  on football betting  is  based  on  gross

profits.   Promoters of football betting are  thus  required  to

submit additional particulars such as the winnings paid. The new

section 4 provides for this requirement;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Miscellaneous consequential amendments to sections 3 and 5

upon the introduction of the sports betting duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  football  sweepstakes will be  introduced  here  soon.   A

number  of reasons have been offered why this has to be provided

for.   Singapore Pools, which conducts the football sweepstakes,

says that the Singapore Football League (S-League) is a national

project which deserves to be supported.  There is also a need to

increase  the  funds of the football clubs involved  to  attract

more supporters and to eliminate illegal football betting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the S-League football clubs are very supportive of

the  introduction of football betting, there are others who have

expressed their concern and even some who are against  the  idea

altogether.   I do not deny and indeed believe that  betting  in

any  form is a value that we should not encourage and should  be

deterred.  I also believe that, besides Islam, gambling is  also

against   the   major  religions  in  this  country,   such   as

Christianity, Sikhism,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>

Buddhism and Taoism.  However, in regard to the Singapore  Pools

S-League  football sweepstakes, I would like to see  this  in  a

wider  perspective, in the context of a secular country.   There

are  already various forms of betting such as Big Sweep, 4D  and

Toto,  as  mentioned by the Finance Minister just now.  Football

betting has also been around for some time, although it has been

going   on  illegally.   I  also  believe  that  the  Government

certainly does not have the intention to encourage gambling with

the  introduction  of the S-League football  betting.   Besides,

with more effective control and supervision, I believe that  the

introduction  of  this  Bill will also strengthen  the  football

funds  so as to develop this game further to a higher level  and

to  attain  our  vision to enter the finals  of  the  World  Cup

football competition in 2010.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is, with the legalisation of the S-League

football  betting, are we indirectly encouraging more people  to

gamble?   Or  by not introducing this, will football betting  be

eliminated  altogether?   In  my view,  the  choice  depends  on

ourselves.   Just  like  other things, the  individual  has  the

choice.  With regard to this, whether to stay away from gambling

or to be involved in it, it is up to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Muslims, we play the role of educating our children to

stay  away  from  gambling, in whatever form altogether.   As  a

Muslim  society  in a secular, multi-racial and  multi-religious

country,  this  is  a  dilemma.  And this  requires  that  every

community seeks its own solution.  I believe that no matter what

we do, only an effective education can overcome it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the Bill is timely, especially we

all know that betting is quite prevalent in Singapore.  Football

betting is something that is not new.  Other countries have  it.

And  I  think we should have no qualms about it.  But the  money

will be for a good cause.  The only concern I have is this.  Why

has  he decided to have 20%, instead of a lower figure?  I  know

he  could, by Government Gazette, prescribe another figure.  But

I thought he could probably start with 15%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

main  purpose  of  this Amendment Bill is to  legalise  football

betting.  The Government's decision to legalise football betting

will create a precedence in pegging sports with gambling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to know what kind of signal or

values  are we trying to send to our citizens by this  Amendment

Bill.   Is  the Government thinking that gambling  can  help  to

rectify  the kiasu mentality of our Singaporeans? Do not  worry,

lay your bets.  Give it a try, no venture, no gain!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government's reason is that if football betting is

not  legalised, people will still bet on football  anyway,  then

there  are now, in the market, various forms of illegal gambling

in  Singapore, for example, the traditional chap ji kee, betting

on  billiards,  betting on bowling, and betting  in  high  class

games  such  as golf.  So, is the Government going  to  consider

legalising all these forms of gambling as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the greatest difference between illegal and legal

gambling  is that the illegal operators do not dare  to  promote

their  activities  openly and they do not receive  bets  openly.

But   the   legalised  operators  can  brazenly  promote   their

activities.   They  can even advertise in the newspapers,  which

they  do.  They are licensed to set up betting stations all over

Singapore.  The extent of influence on our society is  certainly

different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why do we want to peg betting with sports? Does

the Government feel that only by pegging betting with sports can

we  make  Singaporeans  love  the  game  of  football?   If  the

Government  believes that this is the only way  to  promote  the

game  of  football  in Singapore and to make  more  Singaporeans

support the S-League Football started by the Government, then  I

would  like  to know for those who are crazy over football,  are

they  crazy  over the game of football, or are they  crazy  over

gambling?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fans or spectators who support a certain football team,

are they supporting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>

the  team  from the area where they live to express cohesiveness

in the community, or simply because they are betting on the team

winning money for them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially when the Government decided to let the Singapore

national  team drop from the Malaysian Cup football  league  and

started its own Singapore S-League, was it already intending  to

legalise football betting?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am worried is that in future if a certain team loses

and  causes  the  football  spectators to lose their  money  and

hence their temper, will their feelings run so high  as to cause

a  riot like what had happened in the other countries, and  take

it  out  on the footballers after the game?  This would be  very

unfair to the footballers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government feels that public feeling in Singapore is

such  that  we  can  only  go through  gambling  which  involves

personal interest to promote certain sports or events, then will

the  Government also consider amending the law to allow for  the

betting on inter-school basketball or volleyball tournaments  to

promote   basketball  and  volleyball?   Later  on,   will   the

Government  also  start a National Election Lottery  to  receive

bets from the people on the results of the General Election  and

the Presidential Election?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the only advantage of this

Amendment Bill is that the Government would be able to collect a

lot  of  tax money from this new form of  gambling and  lots  of

money   will  go  into  the  coffer.   Perhaps,  this   is   the

Government's  novel idea of opening a new source of  revenue  in

view of the tax reduction due to the current economic crisis!

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

would  like to thank Mr Ahmad Magad for his support of the Bill,

notwithstanding his reservations about the religious aspects  of

gambling  which  everybody recognises.   It  is  an  undesirable

activity  but,  nevertheless,  not  one  which  we  can   easily

eliminate.   I think tolerance, understanding and education  are

the only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>

routes  to  eventually  solve it.  The  parents  should  try  to

dissuade  their  children  from  taking  up  gambling.   So  his

understanding of the issue is very commendable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai asked why 20%, and not 15%. This was based on an

estimate of the amount of revenue which will accrue to Singapore

Pools   for   use  in  promoting  football  and  other   sports.

Government  will take its reasonable share, but we  will  review

this after two years, depending on the actual outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the more general philosophy expressed by Mr Low,

I  do  not  disagree with him that promoting gambling is  not  a

desirable  objective nor something which the  Government  should

engage  in.   Unfortunately, we are dealing with  human  nature.

People,  many of them, are inclined to take risks, and  gambling

is  a  manifestation of risk-taking.  By and large, the majority

of people engage in gambling as a form of recreation, small size

gambling with $5 on a football match, a golf match, or a private

bet on some other event, so that for us, as a Government, to say

that there should be no gambling altogether is unrealistic.   Of

course,  it can be done.  But I doubt whether we could eliminate

human  nature.  All you would do is in fact push it  underground

and, eventually, the only people who will profit are the illegal

operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked what is our objective in legalising football

betting.  Why not legalise all other forms of gambling, such  as

chap  ji  kee  or some of the other minor gambling  forms?   The

simple  answer  is that we try to avoid as much  legislation  as

possible until the activity reaches a level which requires  some

form  of  regulation.  Football has reached a  stage  where  the

activity of illegal gambling in football which is happening now,

is  quite large.  And we do not want to leave the field open  to

illegal  gamblers who will use their revenues to promote bribery

and match-fixing.  We must do all we can to eliminate this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the primary objective, apart from the funds made

available for promoting S-League and other sports, is to try and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>

regulate  this  and  try to knock out, if we  can,  the  illegal

operators.  It may not be possible to reduce them entirely.  But

by  and  large,  our  experience with  legalising  horse  racing

gambling and 4-D has proven that this substantially reduces  the

scope for illegal operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion that Government has introduced this Bill

in  order  to  generate new sources of income, he could  not  be

further  away  from the truth.  We have estimated that,  in  the

first couple of years, the total volume of football betting will

probably  be around $250 million a year gross.  After  deduction

of  bet payoffs and the operating cost, Singapore Pools will  be

able to provide about $9 million per year of funding for the  S-League plus other sports activities, leaving the Government with

$4  million a year of new tax revenue.  He will understand  that

this is a very small sum and, obviously, it is not a new revenue

source of any consequence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, based on the Minister for

Finance's  answer, it seems to me that if any form  of  gambling

has  reached  a  level of popularity, the Minister  for  Finance

might consider legalising it.  Chap ji kee is a traditional form

of  gambling in Singapore with a long history and many old folks

like it.  If the popularity of chap ji kee increases, would  the

Minister for Finance consider legalising it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think we will have to wait to see

what  is the size of it.  At the moment, as far as we are aware,

it is quite small.  It is played by some of the older folks.   I

am not aware of any young Singaporeans playing chap ji kee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we have finally come to the end of a very long sitting.  On

behalf  of the Members here, I would like to thank you and  your

Deputy for chairing this session and for your patience in seeing

through these nine days of debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I put the question, may I just thank

the  Leader  for his complimentary remarks and I would  like  to

thank  hon. Members for the cooperation that they have  extended

to  me and my Deputy over the past two weeks.  I assure you that

my  Deputy  and  I  have  enjoyed listening  to  your  excellent

speeches, certainly with great pleasure.  True to your  role  as

representatives of the people, you have discharged  your  duties

in  a  responsible  and faithful way and you  have  raised  many

interesting topics in the House,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>

certainly  many stimulating matters, and this time around,  even

topics of a "hair raising" nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have had the indignity of the "guillotine"

exercised  on  you.   But  I think it  is  important  to  remind

ourselves that the "guillotine" is a necessary tool in order  to

allow  us to carry out the business of the House in an efficient

and  expedient manner.  Nevertheless, I assure you that we  will

endeavour to ensure that, in future, there will be less occasion

for us to have to exercise the "guillotine".  On that note, once

again, I thank you for your kind cooperation.  [Applause.]

<div align="center"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>SOLAR ENERGY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  if  Singapore will fund research into  and/or  acquire

technology to exploit the abundant solar energy we have so as to

reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harnessing solar energy for heating water, cooling (solar

cooling)  and solar-powered lighting are applications that  have

already been commercialised by the private sector and are in use

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale commercial exploitation of solar energy in

Singapore  is,  however, still limited because of basic  factors

like  land requirement and high costs. A large surface  area  is

required  for  the installation of solar panels. In  land-scarce

Singapore,  it  would not be practical to harness  solar  energy

this way. The capital cost of solar panels is also high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Government has not funded any private-sector

projects on solar energy research.  MINDEF, in a pilot trial for

solar-powered lights, is using solar energy for streetlights  in

a  Kranji  military facility. Its pilot solar power  project  at

Tuas  Naval Base has shown the potential of incorporating  solar

panels into the design of a building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) has funded

projects which aim to develop systems and devices for optimising

the  use  of  energy,  for example, in "intelligent"  buildings.

Private sector companies which are keen to undertake research on

renewable  energy sources, including solar energy research,  can

apply to the NSTB for R&D funding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government continues to encourage the use of energy-saving equipment. The Ministry of the Environment administers

the   accelerated  depreciation  allowance  scheme  for  energy-efficient  and  energy-saving equipment and  technology.   Under

this  scheme, solar heating or cooling systems, and solar energy

collection systems can qualify to be expensed off in one year.

<div align="center"><b>LIQUID PETROLEUM GAS POWERED VEHICLES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Communications if

Singapore will allow the introduction and encourage the  use  of

Liquid  Petroleum  Gas powered motor vehicles  in  view  of  the

environmental and economic advantages of such vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority does not object to the

introduction and use of LPG vehicles in Singapore if  they  meet

internationally recognised safety standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry

of  Home  Affairs have certain requirements regarding  the  bulk

handling and storage of LPG which may impact the feasibility  of

using LPG vehicles. For instance, though Liquefied Petroleum Gas

or  LPG  vehicles might be emitting lower levels of particulates

and  other  pollutants than diesel-driven  vehicles,  LPG  is  a

highly  flammable  substance - more so than petrol  and  diesel.

With Singapore as a densely populated society and where many  of

the  petrol  stations are co-located with housing  estates,  the

bulk  transportation and storage of LPG in petrol  stations  are

potential fire hazards. These safety standards would have to  be

properly addressed if LPG vehicles were to be used in Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>MOSQUE IN HONG KAH GRC</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  and  Minister in charge of Muslim  Affairs  when  a

mosque  will be built at Hong Kah GRC (Nanyang, Jurong West  and

East).



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a mosque (Masjid Al Mukminin) in Jurong

East  and  another mosque (Masjid Assyakirin)  in  Jurong  West.

Under  the  Mosque  Building Fund (MBF) programme,  the  current

policy  is  to  build  one  mosque in each  area  covered  by  a

Development  Guide Plan (DGP).  There is therefore no  immediate

plan to build another mosque under the MBF programme in Hong Kah

GRC.
