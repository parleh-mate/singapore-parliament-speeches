<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I have to inform the

House  that  Inche  Mahmood Bin  Abdul  Wahab,  who

entered  the service of the House in April 1955  as

its  Serjeant at Arms, retired from the service  of

the House in April 1966 at the age of 72 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House, I feel sure, will agree with me when I

wish  him  and his family many years of happy  life

and retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Bulat Bin Ismail, who now holds the office

and  his  appointment dates from the 8th  of  June,

1966.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>PESIARAN KELILING</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Traffic Arrangements)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether he will give early  consideration

to  (a)  making Pesiaran Keliling a one-way street;

(b)  permitting the extension of bus services  into

the  Macpherson Housing Estate; and (c) the parking

of vehicles on one side only of Pesiaran Keliling.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed) (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  answer  to  (a) ,  entry  into  Macpherson

Housing  Estate and Pesiaran Keliling is via  Jalan

Merpati  and  exit  via  Mattar  Road.  Both  these

approach  and  exit  roads are  made  into  one-way

streets because of their narrowness. Mattar Road is

18 feet wide and Jalan Merpati 22 feet wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pesiaran Keliling, however, is 31 feet wide and

the  total  distance is 1.1 miles round the  Estate

from  its  commencement at its junction with  Jalan

Merpati.  This  road  was constructed  sufficiently

wide  enough to carry two-way traffic. If this road

were  to  be  converted into one-way,  it  will  be

causing     undue    hardship    and    unnecessary

inconvenience  to  the residents  in  this  Housing

Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to (b) , the Omnibus Services Licensing

Authority  has approved extensions of bus  services

into  the  Macpherson Housing Estate. The  Omni-bus

Services  Licensing  Authority  has  approved   two

S.T.C. bus  services which would operate  in  this

Housing Estate. The first is a deviation of part of

S.T.C.  Service No. 12, to be known as Service  No.

12A,  from  Macpherson  Housing  Estate  via  Jalan

Besar, New Bridge Road/North Bridge Road to Shenton

Way.  The second is an extension of S.T.C.  Service

No.  9 from Shenton Way via Alexandra Road, Tanglin

Road, Orchard Road and Serangoon Road to Macpherson

Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Omnibus Services Licensing Authority also has

before it two applications from the Tay Koh Yat Bus

Co.  Ltd. to deviate its Service No. 11  from  the

junction of Aljunied Road/Geylang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



Road   to   the   junction   of   Upper   Serangoon

Road/Woodsville Circus, and Service No. 12 from the

junction  of  Aljunied  Road/Geylang  Road  to  the

junction of Macpherson Road/Woodsville Circus  into

Macpherson  Estate.  These  two  applications  were

advertised in the local Press on 13th May, 1966 and

will   be   considered  by  the  Omnibus   Services

Licensing   Authority   one   month   after   their

publication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to (c) , it is proposed to draw a

continuous  white  line  along  Pesiaran  Keliling,

Jalan Pipit and Jalan Balam. This will ensure  that

no  vehicles are parked along this road  and  there

would  be a smooth flow of traffic. Sufficient  car

parks  and parking bays have been provided in  this

housing estate to cater for the residents. The  car

parks   and  parking  bays  are  now  occupied   by

unlicensed  hawkers, causing the  owners  of  motor

cars  to  park  their vehicles on the road  proper.

This  has  created  some confusion  along  Pesiaran

Keliling,  particularly at its junction with  Jalan

Merpati.  Once  the  hawkers  are  removed  to  the

market, which has been completed recently, the  car

parks  and  parking  bays could  be  used  for  the

purpose  for  which they are constructed.  It  will

not,  therefore, be necessary for residents to park

their vehicles on the road proper.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICANTS FOR DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Change of Parking Test Site)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister whether arrangements will be made for  the

parking  test  of applicants for driving  licences,

carried  out  on the roadway in front  of  the  new

community  centre  under  construction  behind  the

Traffic  Police  Office  at  Maxwell  Road,  to  be

conducted  at  some other place when the  community

centre is completed.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Most of the activities at a community

centre  take  place  after  office  hours  and   on

weekends  or  public  holidays. Therefore,  driving

tests  conducted  on  the  road  in  front  of  the

community  centre should not in any  way  interfere

with its activities. Even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



the  present construction work carried out  in  the

day-time  is  not affected at all  by  the  driving

tests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): There is a

school  erected  at the place where  the  community

centre is situated now, and school children may  be

playing  in the field in future. At the  time  when

the tests are taken there, the children will not be

able to take a short cut. That is why I say that it

is necessary to change the venue.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the question? Is there a

supplementary  question which the Member  wants  to

ask?



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): The Minister has

replied  that  there  is no  interference  at  that

place.  But I say that when the school is  erected,

the school children will be going to the playground

and  I think that it is not a proper place to carry

out the tests.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a supplementary question,

but  if the Minister of State wishes to answer what

is  troubling the hon. Member, he may  do  so.  The

hon. Member is worried about children crossing  the

street.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The question is

about the erection of a community centre. If it  is

a  question of the erection of a school, then  that

is another question completely.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>APPLICANTS FOR DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Use of Tamil Language for Highway Code Test)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether  complaints  made  in  the  Tamil

dailies about not using the Tamil language for  the

Highway Code Test for the issue of driving licences

were  brought to his attention, and whether he will

appoint persons to conduct the Highway Code Test in

Tamil  also,  as it is done in Malay, Mandarin  and

English.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  in  October  1965,  3,384  persons  took  the

Highway Code test of whom 108 were Tamils.  In  May

1966, 3,519 persons took this test of whom 105 were

Tamils. This works out roughly at three per cent as

being Tamil-speaking testees, and most of them were

also able to speak either English or Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present two Senior Testers, both

Chinese,  and  18 testers, of whom 13 are  Chinese,

two  Eurasians, one Malay, one Singhalese  and  one

Tamil. The number of Tamils at the moment is small.

When  the  number justifies it, more Tamil  testers

will  be  employed  and the use of  Tamil  will  be

permitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testees for Highway Code tests are assigned to

various  testers so that testees cannot choose  the

tester  nor  the tester his testees. If the  testee

fails  his test, a different tester is assigned  to

him for his next test. It would be a departure from

this  fair  and reasonable practice for  the  Tamil

tester to test Tamil testees only.

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE IN RACE COURSE ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr S. Rajoo</b> asked the Minister of Defence if

he will consider the building of a community centre

on  the children's playground opposite No. 130 Race

Course Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the proposed site is barely 800 yards from the

Pek  Kio  Community Centre. The Minister  therefore

will not consider building a community centre there

both  for  this reason and because it is  wrong  to

deprive children of their playground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had, on a previous occasion,

reminded  hon.  Members  that  the  policy  of  the

People's Association is to improve the standard and

scope  of  activities of community  centres  rather

than  build  new  ones.  To  this  end,  Management

Committees   have   been  established   to   direct

activities  in community centres. These  Management

Committees have local leaders and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



is  important  that Members of Parliament  who  are

advisers  to  these Management Committees  keep  in

close  touch  with  them and attend  their  monthly

meetings.

<div align="center"><b>STATISTICS OF HOSPITAL BED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ACCOMMODATION AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY UNIT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AT THOMSON ROAD HOSPITAL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a)  how  many  beds  there  are  in   each

hospital, giving separate figures for beds  in  the

different  classes, where applicable;  (b)  whether

the  number  of  beds in each type of  hospital  is

adequate  to meet present needs; (c) whether  there

is  a  programme  for  expansion  of  hospital  bed

accommodation to meet future needs, and if he  will

give  details; and (d) if he will consider  setting

up  an  emergency unit at the Thomson Road Hospital

for the treatment of casualties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  first  part  of  question (a) ,  there  are  14

Government hospitals in Singapore with a  total  of

6,797  staffed  beds  at  present,  of  which   the

majority  6,433 or 90 per cent are free  of  charge

(i.e. 'C' Class). There are 249 'B' Class beds at a

charge of $12 per day and 115 'A' Class beds  at  a

charge  of  $30  per day or $40 per  day,  if  air-conditioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Member has asked for details of the

number   of  beds  in  each  hospital,  and   their

classification  as well, I am therefore  submitting

the  details in a separate schedule for tabling and

circulation instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (b) , as a general rule, it can

reasonably be said that the present bed capacity in

Government  hospitals as a whole are adequate,  but

the  following three are either congested or  under

great   pressure,  namely,  Woodbridge   Hospital,

Outram  Road  General Hospital and  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before answering (c) of the question on proposed

programme  of  expansion,  may  I,  Sir,   indicate

certain  steps  which have already  been  taken  to

lessen the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



present congestion or pressures of the three  named

hospitals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the case of Woodbridge Hospital,

thanks  to  the  efficacy of modern  drugs  and  in

accordance  with  modern  practice,  it  has   been

possible   for  more  and  more  patients   to   be

discharged from hospital and to continue  treatment

in  what  are  known as Day Centres.  Secondly,  as

Trafalgar  Home, which adjoins Woodbridge Hospital,

is  only half-full, a section of Trafalgar Home  is

now  being renovated and converted for the transfer

of  the  chronically sick from Woodbridge Hospital,

in  order  to relieve the congestion at the  latter

hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Outram Road General Hospital, it

has  been  necessary to alleviate the  pressure  of

numbers  by a quicker turnover of patients and  the

average  length of stay of patients is around  nine

days per patient. It is agreed that this is not  an

ideal method, but has to be resorted to until  such

time  as  more hospitals can be built and, what  is

even  more  important,  more staff,  i.e, doctors,

nurses   and   technicians,   and   equipment   are

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effort, however, has already been made to

relieve   the  pressures  on  Outram  Road  General

Hospital  with  the  setting  up  of  two  surgical

theatres in Thomson Road Hospital in January  1965,

thus  converting it into Singapore's second General

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two effective steps have already been taken to

relieve the pressure in Kandang Kerbau Hospital. In

order   to  encourage  greater  use  of  our   Free

Domiciliary Midwifery service, a nominal charge  of

$10 was levied for 'C' Class patients from December

1964. Next, Government has given full publicity for

some  time  regarding the need to  offer  Singapore

mothers  the  latest techniques in Family  Planning

and  have,  in fact, established a Family  Planning

and  Population  Board  in  January  this  year  to

implement a 5-Year Family Planning programme in all

Maternal and Child Health Centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these measures, I am glad to say, have shown

immediate and heartening results. Out of a total of

58,217



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



births  in  Singapore in 1964,  there  was  a  peak

number of deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital  at

39,598.  Last  year,  1965,  the  total  number  of

deliveries in Singapore fell to 55,736, and for the

first  time Kandang Kerbau Hospital also  showed  a

drop in its deliveries at 38,849.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the response to Family Planning under the

auspices  of  the  Family Planning  and  Population

Board,  I  am pleased to say that for the  first  5

months of this year, a total of 15,718 mothers  are

now  receiving family planning assistance, made  up

of  4,691  new  cases and the balance being  former

Singapore Family Planning Association cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for future plans of expansion, firstly, we

intend  to build more Day Centres for the  mentally

ill; secondly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



to build a third General Hospital of about 700 beds

for  the eastern part of Singapore under the second

5-Year Development Plan 1966/1970, and, thirdly,  a

Maternity  Wing  of  120  beds  has  already   been

provided  for in this year's Development  Estimates

in   Thomson  Road  General  Hospital  which,  when

completed,  should greatly relieve  Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of (d) of the question under reply,

Sir,  Thomson Road General Hospital has a  Casualty

and  Emergency Unit with effect from July 1965  but

limited  to  admission of casualties  and  accident

cases between the hours of 8.30 in the morning  and

3.00  in  the afternoon. It is planned  to  operate

this  Emergency Unit on a 24-hour basis as soon  as

nursing staff are available to man it.

during certain seasons of the year. Action has, in

fact, been taken to provide a reservoir with

pumping stations at Poole Road and Wimbourne Road,

adjacent to the Geylang River, to deal with normal

flooding situations, but the flooding cannot be

prevented at all times because of the pumping

capacity of the pumping stations. In any case, such

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE MISSION'S VISIT TO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, I propose to give a brief

report  of  the  recent visit to the East  European

countries of the Singapore Mission led



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



by  the Prime Minister. The countries visited  were

Poland,   Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,   Rumania   and

Bulgaria,  and the tour itself lasted  18  days.  I

think no useful purpose will be served by giving  a

detailed account of our conversations with each  of

the  many  Government leaders in every  country  we

visited.  What  I propose to do, therefore,  is  to

give  a general assessment based on our discussions

with  our  East  European  hosts  of  the  kind  of

relations we hope to develop over the years between

them and ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting for one moment that, as a

result  of  this one visit, we have mapped  out  in

detail  the  scope and character of  the  relations

which  we hope to develop. This is something  which

must   gradually  evolve  in  the  course  of   our

dealings,  particularly as this is the  first  time

that Singapore and the East European countries  are

building up direct contact with one another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when Singapore's foreign relations

were  not in our hands, the East European countries

were cut off from us by an iron curtain erected not

by  the  Communists but by those who were  then  in

charge  of our foreign relations. It was  no  doubt

felt  by  them  that  any  contact  with  Communist

countries would be bad for our souls and  bring  us

eternal  damnation.  Partly as  a  result  of  this

policy of sheltering us from contact with Communist

countries, the Communists too have formed their own

image of Singapore as an anti-Communist bastion and

as an armed base for the protection and furtherance

of British imperialist interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one immediate and positive result of our visit

has  been  to dispel this false image. We  went  to

Eastern Europe as democratic socialists and not  as

Communists. What has emerged as a result  of  these

personal contacts is that relations between  States

with   different  systems  of  government  can   be

sustained on the basis of mutual respect  and  non-interference in each other's affairs. For our part,

from  the  free and frank discussions we  have  had

with  East European leaders, we are satisfied  that

trade  and other relations with Communist countries

impose no greater or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



lesser  trials  and tribulations  than  trade  with

capitalist countries. In their discussions with us,

the East European leaders stressed that ideological

differences  need  not  be  serious  obstacles   to

friendly  political and economic relations  between

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, they drew our attention to

the  many trade agreements they had concluded  with

the  new  countries of Afro-Asia. They pointed  out

that  even  anti-Communist countries  like  Western

Germany  had  substantial and  growing  trade  with

them. As one East European Foreign Minister said to

us,  "Trade  knows  no scent and  no  colour."  The

impression  we  formed was that the  East  European

countries, the bulk of whose foreign trade is  with

Communist countries, particularly the Soviet Union,

have  now  reached a stage of economic  development

where  they feel it advantageous for them  to  seek

trade  outlets outside the Communist bloc. In their

discussions with us, their approach to questions of

trade  with Singapore was couched in very practical

and  very  realistic terms. This may have  been  in

part  due  to  the  frank  and  practical  way   we

approached the economic relationships which we wish

to  establish with them. We stressed that  we  were

not  asking for aid, but trade. We pointed out that

Singapore would pay for whatever she gets and  that

she  had lived and prospered for over a century  on

the  basis of buying at the best prices and selling

at the lowest. The East Europeans told us that they

appreciated  not  only  the  business  acumen   and

trading experience that Singapore had gathered over

the  years as the hub of trade in South-East  Asia,

but  also  the sophisticated and delicate  entrepot

infrastructure  that  Singapore   has   built   and

continues to develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw the attention of the

House to a point that was stressed by all the  East

European  leaders in our discussions with them.  We

talked  frankly on trade and political matters.  In

both these matters, there is friendly understanding

on different points of view. Understanding does not

necessarily mean agreement on every point. It means

that there can be differing points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



of   view   without  there  being   hostility   and

suspicion.  We explained why Singapore was  a  non-Communist  socialist country committed  to  a

non-aligned  policy of wanting to be friendly with  all

countries.  The  East European  leaders  said  that

given  such  a  policy, satisfactory  and  fruitful

relations  could be developed between us and  them.

As far as they were concerned, their relations with

Singapore  would  be founded on  the  principle  of

mutual  respect, non-interference in one  another's

internal   affairs   and   mutual   benefit.   They

enunciated  this  principle  both  in  our  private

conversations and in their public statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our belief that, as a result of the visits

and  discussions,  we have managed  to  dispel  any

false  image  of  Singapore  as  an  anti-Communist

bastion  and  as  the armed stronghold  of  British

imperialism. I think we have left the East European

countries  with  the impression that  Singapore  is

essentially  pro-Singapore, and friendly  with  any

country  which  does not resent our furthering  the

legitimate  interests of Singapore. The  cordiality

and respect with which our Mission was received  in

all  the  five countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia,

Hungary,  Rumania and Bulgaria is a good foundation

for our growing relationships. They received us  as

the   representatives  of  a  friendly  independent

country,   a   friendly  non-Communist,   socialist

country, with which they wish to establish mutually

advantageous  relations. Two  of  these  countries,

Bulgaria  and  Poland,  have already  signed  trade

agreements  with  us. Czechoslovakia,  Hungary  and

Rumania  have  agreed  to send  trade  missions  to

Singapore in the very near future. They have  shown

an   interest  not  only  in  trade  but  also   in

industrial projects, facilities for their ships and

for  their airplanes, both of whose operations they

hope  to  expand  in this part of  the  world.  For

Singapore, these trade and other contacts with East

Europe mean a diversification and broadening of our

international   trade  and,   therefore,   of   our

international relations. It does not and should not

mean  abandoning  or displacing our  older  trading

partners.   It   merely  means  an   extension   of

Singapore's shop-window in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



Asia  by  the addition of goods and customers  from

the  Communist world. The Communist world is a fact

of  life.  That  world  exists.  It  constitutes  a

significant  part  of the world. Its  economic  and

industrial achievements are no less real than those

of anti-Communists and the non-Communist world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be naive, Sir, if we believed that trade

with  East  Europeans  and other  Communists  would

start on a spectacular scale. The Communists,  like

capitalists,  are quite realistic  and  hard-headed

when it comes to trade. They are not going to trade

or  participate in industrial activity in Singapore

just  for the benefit of Singapore. It is up to  us

to  prove to them that there is something for  them

also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the happy position in which we find

ourselves  only some ten months after  independence

is  due  to the practical and matter-of-fact policy

we  have  followed  so far. Non-alignment  has  not

meant  isolation  but instead an expansion  of  the

circle  of friendly countries. It means having  the

maximum  of  friends and a minimum of enemies  from

both  of the power blocs and from those not aligned

to these power blocs.

business of Supply has been completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill seeks to authorise the

Government  to become a member of the International

Monetary  Fund  and of the International  Bank  for

Reconstruction and Development and to enable effect

to be given in Singapore to the Agreements by which

the Fund and the Bank were constituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Monetary Fund and the

International    Bank   for   Reconstruction    and

Development  were  founded at  the  United  Nations

Monetary  and Financial Conference held at  Bretton

Woods  in  June  1944.  The Fund  was  designed  to

stabilise exchange rates and promote a freer system

of  world  trade  and payments by assisting  member

countries  over  temporary  difficulties  in  their

international balances of payments.  The  Bank  was

intended primarily to make available capital  which

could  not  be  obtained from  private  sources  to

finance productive investments in member countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has never had any transaction with the

International  Monetary Fund but has  received  two

loans from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



the   International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and

Development  -  the  World  Bank  for  short,   Mr

Speaker. The first loan of U.S. $15 million for the

Pasir  Panjang Power Station, Phase I, was received

in  1963, and the second loan of U.S. $6.5  million

for the Johore River Water Project was received  in

1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is now an independent and sovereign

nation.  We must become a member of the World  Bank

before  the  Government  or  statutory  bodies  can

obtain   further  loans.  In  1965,  the  Port   of

Singapore  Authority successfully  negotiated  with

the World Bank for a loan of U.S. $15 million. This

loan  is  for  the moment held in abeyance  as  the

agreement for it can only be signed after Singapore

has been admitted to the World Bank as a member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One pre-requisite of membership of the World Bank

is  membership of the International Monetary  Fund.

It  is  necessary, therefore, that Singapore should

also  be a member of the I.M.F. Membership  of  the

I.M.F. gives Singapore some advantages. Should  we

encounter temporary difficulties in our balance  of

payments  position, we can purchase  the  necessary

gold or other currencies from the Fund with our own

currency. Otherwise we would probably have to pay a

premium or institute drastic measures at home which

might   have  undesirable  long-term  effects.   By

accepting the Articles of Agreement of the  I.M.F.,

the Singapore Government will be indicating that it

will  abide  by acceptable practices regarding  the

par value of the currency of Singapore and exchange

control.   This  will  instil  in  other  countries

further confidence in Singapore. Besides, Singapore

will   be  able  to  get  competent  and  objective

assessments  of  its  own  economy  and  advice  on

economic problems from both the Fund and the Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's subscription to the I.M.F. is U.S.

$30 million of which 25 per cent is payable in gold

and  the  remainder in local currency.  Singapore's

subscription to the Bank, which is a derivative  of

our  subscription to the Fund, is fixed at U.S. $32

million. Only 10 per cent of this is required to be

paid  in initially; one per cent to be paid in gold

or  U.S. dollars, and nine per cent to be paid  in

local currency. In all, Singapore has to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



pay  U.S.  $7.5 million in gold, U.S.  $320,000  in

gold  or  U.S, dollars, and U.S. $25.38 million  in

local  currency. Except for a very small  fraction,

the  portion  to be paid in local currency  can  be

paid  in  the  form of non-interest  bearing,  non-negotiable notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the subscriptions to the Fund and

the  Bank deserves a closer examination. So far  as

the   Fund  and  the  Bank  are  concerned,   these

subscriptions  should  understandably  be   charged

expenditure so that the Fund and the Bank would not

be subject to further anxiety as regards the actual

payment  of the subscriptions after the legislation

has  been passed. However, it should be noted  that

these subscriptions are returnable to the Singapore

Government either upon the withdrawal of  Singapore

from  the Fund and the Bank, or upon the winding-up

of  these Organisations. It can be seen, therefore,

that the subscriptions, while not available to  the

Government  for appropriation so long as  Singapore

remains  a  member  of the two  Organisations,  are

really  different from subscriptions which one  has

to   pay   when  one  joins  a  private   club   or

association. The subscriptions to the Fund and  the

Bank are a kind of deposit of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary, Mr Speaker, Sir, for countries

applying  for membership to be given six months  to

accept membership of the Fund and the Bank. In  the

case  of  Singapore,  this period  begins  on  21st

February,  1966,  which is the date  on  which  the

Boards  of  Governors  of the  Fund  and  the  Bank

approved  the  terms and conditions of  Singapore's

membership. Subsequently, a considerable amount  of

administrative  details had  to  be  considered  as

drafting of this Bill proceeded. As a result,  this

Bill  could not be introduced earlier. There are  a

number of formalities still to be carried out, such

as  the payment of subscriptions, the depositing of

Instruments of Acceptance, and the signing  of  the

original Articles of Agreement of the Fund and  the

Bank.  These  formalities can only be  carried  out

after  this  Bill has become law. It is  for  these

reasons that this Bill has been introduced under  a

Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think  it  is  befitting  the  status   of

Singapore  as an independent sovereign  country  to

seek  membership of international bodies  like  the

International  Monetary Fund and the  International

Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Membership

of  these two international organisations would not

only  enhance the status and prestige of Singapore,

but  would  also help our development. However,  we

must consider whether the price we are called on to

pay  in the form of membership fee is not too  high

for  us. We must also consider what benefits we can

derive  from being a member. There is no  point  in

joining  an  international  organisation  just  for

prestige  sake. It may be a luxury which  Singapore

can ill afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank helps in the financing of specific

projects  approved by it, and developing  countries

like  Singapore  can  take advantage  of  both  its

financial    and    technical    facilities.    The

International Monetary Fund, on the other hand,  is

more  geared to helping developed countries to meet

their  short-term balance of payment  problems  and

would  not  be  of much benefit to Singapore  as  a

developing  nation.  Unfortunately,  as  the   Hon.

Minister informed us, we cannot become a member  of

one without becoming a member of the other. It is a

condition of membership of the World Bank  that  we

must  also  be  a member of the I.M.F.  And  it  is

ironical  that membership of the I.M.F. from  which

we  do  not  derive  much benefit  should  be  more

expensive  than that of the World Bank which  would

substantially  benefit  us.  Although   Singapore's

subscription to the World Bank is U.S. $30 million,

25  per cent of this will have to be paid in  gold.

The  balance  of  the money would  have  to  be  in

Singapore currency. This means that -

<br><br><b> Committee of Supply.</b>

<br><br><b> Later -</b>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just before

I  sat  down,  I was saying to the House  that  the

amount  of  money  that  we  have  to  pay  to  the

International Monetary Fund is 25 per cent of  U.S.

$30  million  in  gold  and the  balance  in  local

currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was under the impression that the balance of

the 75 per cent to be subscribed could, in fact, be

subscribed  in  the  form of  non-interest  bearing

notes.  But  it  would appear from  what  the  Hon.

Minister has told us that this is not the case;  in

which  case,  it would appear that  the  amount  of

money  tied  up  would  be much  more  than  I  had

thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the World Bank is concerned, that is

the   International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and

Development,  the amount we are asked to  subscribe

in  gold  is,  in fact, much smaller.  We  have  to

subscribe  to  320 shares, each at  U.S.  $100,000,

making a total of U.S. $32 million. But only 20 per

cent of one-half of the 320 shares are to be called

up  straightaway and only two per cent of the  half

of  320  shares are payable in gold. The amount  of

the subscription payable, therefore, will only come

to  one per cent of U.S. $32 million, meaning  U.S.

$320,000  or about M$1 million. The balance  of  18

per cent of the half, that is, nine per cent of the

total  U.S. $32 million, is to be paid in  our  own

currency. It will, therefore, follow that about  90

per  cent of the shares of the World Bank will only

be  subject to call, and of this 20 per cent of the

half  called up, 18 per cent is to be  in  our  own

currency. The amount tied up, therefore,  will,  in

fact,  be quite extensive. The question to be asked

is,  is  it worthwhile to spend all this amount  of

money?  I think the answer to this question depends

on how much we expect to borrow from the World Bank

over,  say,  the next five years, and how  easy  it

would  be,  and how much more expensive it  is,  to

borrow from other sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have tied up in the Bank, as we are

informed in the Explanatory Statement to the  Bill,

something  like U.S.$62 million, or something  like M$180



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



million. If we have all this money tied up, I  fail

to  see why we cannot, in fact, use it for our  own

development  rather than joining  the  World  Bank,

putting  this  in  as  subscription  and  in   turn

borrowing money back from the World Bank. No doubt,

the  World Bank gives other facilities as well. For

example, it offers technical help in the evaluation

of  projects  which  it is called  on  to  finance.

However,  in  the past, the World  Bank  has  shown

extreme  conservatism in its  lending  policy.  For

example,  it  has only recently been lending  money

for water schemes and for educational purposes.  It

did  not do so in the past. It is to be hoped  that

the  World  Bank will now extend its facilities  to

cover other social development schemes like housing

and  sewerage. However, should we become a  member,

it  is also to be hoped that the World Bank will be

more  generous  to us in financing local  costs  of

development  projects.  This  will  enable  certain

development  projects,  such  as  the  East   Coast

Reclamation, to be financed by the World  Bank.  On

balance,  however,  taking into account  the  money

that  has  to be tied up, it may, in fact,  be  far

cheaper for us not to join the World Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to oppose the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Explanatory Note here under "Expenditure of  public

money"  does indicate that our initial subscription

to  the Fund will be U.S.$62 million, but it is our

commitment   rather   than  an  outright   payment.

Initially,  only ten per cent will be paid  to  the

World  Bank and 25 per cent to the I.M.F.  I  quite

agree with the last speaker that if the benefit  we

are  going to get from joining the I.M.F. and  the

World  Bank  is  less than having a  sum  of  M$186

million  tied  up,  then  we  should  have   second

thoughts.  But  as I have indicated in  my  speech,

this   is  a  world-wide  Organisation  whose  main

purpose  is  to  furnish a sort of  system  whereby

difficulties   in  balances  of  payments   between

countries could be adjusted. And also it  is  there

to  see  that countries which run temporarily  into

currency problems could be assisted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken everything into consideration.

Although I agree also with the hon. Member that the

I.M.F. and  the  World  Bank  have  been   rather

conservative   in   their   approaches   to    loan

applications  from  developing countries,  we  have

made  it very clear to the World Bank that if  they

do  not streamline their methods in approving loans

for  developing  countries, we  would  have  second

thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered the problem very carefully

and,  at this stage of our development, I say  that

it   would   be  preferable  that  we   join   this

Organisation and if, later on, we find that  it  is

not  moving  as fast as we want to and  is  not  of

great assistance as we hope it to be, it is not too

late to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legitimacy Ordinance was first enacted in

Singapore in 1934 and, apart from a short  amending

Ordinance  in  1940,  the  law  relating   to   the

legitimation  of  children  born  out  of   wedlock

remains substantially the same.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal amendment which the Bill now before

the  House seeks to bring about is the deletion  of

subsection (3) of section 3 of the Ordinance  which

provides that nothing in the Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



shall  operate to legitimate a person whose father

or  mother was married to a third person when  the

illegitimate  person was born. The Bill  seeks  to

exclude the operation of this provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By another amendment, a reference to the Women's

Charter,  1961, is added at the end of  subsection

(2)  of  section  3  which now provides  that  the

Ordinance will not operate to legitimate a  person

unless  the  marriage leading to the  legitimation

was  solemnized and registered in accordance  with

the provisions of the Christian Marriage Ordinance

or  the  Civil  Marriage Ordinance. The  Bill  now

proposes  that a reference to the Women's Charter,

1961, be added here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to make certain

amendments  of a formal nature: thus at subsection

(1)  of  section 4, the expressions  "natural-born

British  subject"  and "Her  Majesty"  are  to  be

deleted, and the expression "citizen of Singapore"

and  "the Government" respectively substituted  in

their  place, and the term "the Colony" is  to  be

replaced  by  the  term  "Singapore"  wherever  it

appears  in the Ordinance. The Bill also seeks  to

make  the  change  in name from  "State  Advocate-General" to "Attorney-General".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of provisions in this Bill seek only to

make  amendments of a formal nature, some of which

are consequent on Singapore ceasing to be part  of

Malaysia whilst others are purely changes in name,

such  as the substitution of the word "Government"

for   "Crown",  "Singapore"  for  "Colony",   "the

Commonwealth"  for "Her Majesty's dominions",  and

"the  President"  for  "Her Majesty  in  Council".

References  to the expression "British subject  or

British protected person" are also deleted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons admitted as advocates and solicitors of

the  High  Court  are now no longer  on  admission

required  to  take the oath of allegiance  to  Her

Majesty.   Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the   Bill

provides that if an applicant for admission as  an

advocate  and solicitor has obtained a certificate

from the University of Singapore or the University

of  Malaya that he has satisfactorily completed  a

post  graduate practical course organised  by  the

University,  the  requirement  as  to  reading  in

Chambers, that is to say, receiving instruction in

law  from  a practising advocate and solicitor  of

not  less  than seven years' standing,  is  for  a

period  of  six months only, whereas otherwise  he

would  have had to read in Chambers for  at  least

twelve months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also removes the exemption hitherto

granted   to  persons  in  the  service   of   the

Government  from  undergoing an  oral  examination

which is conducted by the Attorney-General and two

other advocates and solicitors before admission to

the Bar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now expressly provided that the annual

certificate to practise issued by the Registrar of

the  High Court to advocates and solicitors  shall

run  from  the  1st of March to the  last  day  of

February  in  the following year.  A  transitional

provision  is contained in the Bill to the  effect

that  the  certificate to practise issued  between

the  1st  of January, 1966, and the 28th February,

1967, shall be in force until the latter date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill should come as no

surprise  to Members of this House. In  June  1964,

the  Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2) Bill, which

proposed  certain  changes in  regard  to  the  law

relating to the acquisition of private property for

public purposes, was sent to Select Committee.  The

passage  of this Bill was, however, delayed because

of constitutional difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill embodies (in

the  form  of a revised consolidated Act) both  the

provisions in the existing law, that is to say, the

Land Acquisition Ordinance, Chapter 248, as well as

the  provisions in the Land Acquisition  (Amendment

No.  2)  Bill.  The major departures from  existing

legislation are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the assessment of compensation provisions

have been re-drafted on the basis of two principles

enunciated by the Prime Minister in December  1963.

Firstly,  that  no  landowner should  benefit  from

development which has taken place at public expense

and,  secondly, that the price paid on  acquisition

of  land  for public purposes should not be  higher

than  what the land would have been worth  had  the

Government not carried out development generally in

the area, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) provision has been made for the hearing of

appeals by an Appeals Board instead of the Court as

at present. Thus, the person who is aggrieved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



by  the Collector's award will, under the new  law,

have  the  right  of appeal to the  Appeals  Board,

consisting of a Commissioner of Appeals or a Deputy

Commissioner  of  Appeals either sitting  alone  or

with two assessors, depending on the quantum of the

award against which an appeal is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other changes in the proposed

legislation  which widen the powers of  acquisition

to  meet  various situations envisaged  with  urban

renewal, industrialisation, etc. A more expeditious

procedure for taking possession of land in cases of

extreme urgency has also been provided for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have stated

earlier, the main alterations proposed in this Bill

were  embodied  in a previous Bill  which  went  to

Select  Committee in June 1964, and  at  that  time

only one representation -- and that too a late  one

--  from  the  Real Estate Valuers  Association  of

Singapore,  was received. However, as  this  is  an

important  piece of legislation, it is proposed  to

refer  the Bill again to Select Committee in  order

to give members of the public an opportunity to put

forward their views and representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to

dwell  at  length on the provisions  of  this  Bill

which will receive full consideration by the Select

Committee.  It is my hope that when representations

are  called  for, those with positive contributions

to make will come forward with their suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of the Malaysian Modification of Laws

(Government   Proceedings  and  Public  Authorities Protection)  (Extension  and  Modification)  Order,

1965,  which came into operation on 25th  February,

1965,  the  Crown Suits Ordinance (Chapter  12)  of

Singapore  ceased to have effect and the  Malaysian

Government   Proceedings   Ordinance,   1956,   was

extended  to Singapore, with certain modifications.

The  latter  Ordinance is, therefore,  the  law  in

Singapore in so far as it relates to proceedings by

or against the Government, and it is this Ordinance

which the Bill seeks to amend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good part of the Bill makes merely formal

amendments  which are necessary in  consequence  of

Singapore ceasing to be part of Malaysia. A  number

of other amendments to the Ordinance are also made.

By a new subsection to section 14, which deals with

proceedings against or on behalf of members of  the

armed  forces,  the Bill provides that  no  act  or

omission of a public officer shall subject  him  to

liability in tort for death or personal injury,  in

so  far  as the death or personal injury is due  to

anything suffered by a member of such armed  forces

being   a  thing  as  to  which  certain  specified

conditions are satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires the Minister to publish in the

Gazette  from  time  to time a list  of  Government

departments which may sue or be sued in  their  own

names. The Attorney-General may also represent  the

Government, and no change in the person holding the

office of Attorney-General or in the person or body

of persons constituting the department is to affect

any   proceedings  instituted  by  or  against  the

Attorney-General or a Government department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



Provision is also made for the service of documents

required to be served on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clause relates to the appearance of legal

officers  in  civil proceedings by or  against  the

Government  or in any such proceedings to  which  a

public officer is a party; it is also provided that

an  advocate  and  solicitor  of  the  High  Court,

retained  by  the Attorney-General in the  case  of

civil proceedings by or against the Government or a

public officer, may appear as advocate on behalf of

the  Government  or  the  public  officer  in  such

proceedings.  The  provision for representation  by

public  officers,  other than  legal  officers,  is

being repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court is empowered to order the transfer

to  itself  of any civil proceedings in a  District

Court to which the Government is a party, where  an

application is made by the Government to  the  High

Court that the proceedings may involve an important

question  of law or may be decisive of other  cases

arising in the same matter, or that it is otherwise

desirable  in the public interest or for any  other

reason   that   such  proceedings  should   be   so

transferred  from the District Court  to  the  High

Court, and there is also produced to the High Court

a  certificate  of  the  Attorney-General  to  that

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill further seeks to repeal the special

provisions as to limitation of actions against  the

Government  arising  from  the  Public  Authorities

Protection Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill are simple. It is the

intention   of  the  Government  that,   with   the

expansion  of  the activities of  the  Housing  and

Development Board in the field of redevelopment and

public  housing,  it is desirable  to  enlarge  the

composition  of the Board so that more persons  may

be  appointed and the Board may benefit from  their

experience  and  expertise. At present  only  three

members  can be appointed, but under the  amendment

not  less than three but not more than five members

may be appointed.

<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main objects of the Bill is to amend

the  Road  Traffic  Ordinance to provide  for  more

effective action



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



against  pirate taxi operators. There has  been  an

increasing  number  of pirate  taxis  in  Singapore

(some  estimates  put  them  at  about  7,000)  and

appeals and petitions have been received urging the

Government to take effective action against  pirate

taxi  operators  whose  activities  have  seriously

affected  the earning of public transport companies

and licensed taxi operators.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police action against pirate taxi operators has

not  been  a  deterrent, as the penalties  provided

under  the  law  appear to be inadequate  to  check

them.  The  present penalty is a fine not exceeding

$500 and in the case of a subsequent conviction,  a

fine   not  exceeding  $1,000.  In  addition,   the

magistrate usually disqualifies the owner  and  the

driver  of the car from driving for periods of  one

to  three years. Heavier penalties are now provided

in  the  Bill  against these operators.  These  are

imprisonment for a term not exceeding  six  months,

or  a  fine  not  exceeding $3,000,  or  both,  and

confiscation   of  the  vehicle  on   the   written

application   of   the  Public  Prosecutor.   These

increased  heavier penalties are  provided  for  in

clause 9 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to amend the

existing  definition of "park",  which  the  Police

have  found  unsatisfactory, by  a  new  definition

which  will assist the Police in enforcing  parking

restriction effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of Singapore's independent status,

another   amendment  deletes  the   provisions   in

sections 46 and 47 of the Ordinance which expressly

exempt   vehicles  of  the  United   Kingdom   from

registration   and   vehicles  of   the   Malaysian

Government,  Malay  Rulers and the  United  Kingdom

Government from licence fees. Should the Government

wish  to  continue  exemption,  the  Minister   can

exercise  such  powers  under  the  provisions   of

section 86 of the Ordinance. This amendment is made

in clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 is a presumption clause which will also

assist the Police to enforce the law against pirate

taxi operators and in prosecutions against them  in

Court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 repeals section 79 of the Ordinance to

provide  that the power to compound offences  shall

be   exercised  by  the  Police  instead  of  being

transferred  to  the  Courts.  Section  79  of  the

Ordinance has not been brought into force  and  the

Police have been compounding offences under section

80  of  the  old Road Traffic Ordinance, Cap.  227.

This  amendment  in clause 12 will  regularise  the

present  practice of the Police compounding traffic

offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to include in

the  Bill certain other provisions which would give

the authorities more power to tighten up the law in

respect  of Malaysian-registered vehicles operating

in Singapore, some of which are operating as pirate

taxis,  and also against vehicles suspected by  the

Registrar  of  Vehicles  of  having  been  used  or

intended to be used for unlawful purposes or in  an

unlawful  manner.  These powers  are,  firstly,  to

require  a Singapore resident using in Singapore  a

motor  vehicle  first registered in Malaysia  after

30th  May  1966 to inform the Registrar of Vehicles

of  such  use,  and  to provide  the  Registrar  of

Vehicles  powers to change the registration  number

of  a  vehicle  bearing  a  Malaysian  registration

number, the owner of which is normally resident  in

Singapore, to a Singapore registration number. This

provision is contained in clause 6 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another amendment in the Bill prohibits

residents of Singapore from possessing or  using  a

motor vehicle in respect of which the first licence

is issued outside Singapore. Such persons would not

be  able to use such motor vehicles until such fees

as  are  required to be paid have been paid to  the

Registrar.  A  number  of Singapore  residents  are

buying their vehicles from Malaysia because of  the

better  discount they can get from Malaysian  motor

dealers  and subsequently transferring the  vehicle

and  its  registration to Singapore. This  practice

results in Singapore losing revenue in that it does

not get the additional registration fee payable  on

the   first   registration  of  such  vehicles   if

purchased   and   registered   in   Singapore,   as

prescribed in the Motor Vehicles (Registration  and

Licensing) (Amendment)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



Rules, 1966. The intention here is to require

Singapore   residents  who   have   purchased   and

registered  cars  in Malaysia to  re-register  such

cars   in  Singapore  and  to  pay  the  prescribed

additional registration fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, under clause 4 of the Bill the Registrar

is  empowered  to refuse to issue a licence  for  a

motor  vehicle  or  to cancel a licence  if,  after

giving  the  owner  an opportunity  of  making  any

representation he may wish to make, he  has  reason

to  believe  that the motor vehicle in  respect  of

which  an application has been made is intended  to

be  used  for an unlawful purpose or in an unlawful

manner.  Provision for appeal to  the  Minister  is

provided for against the Registrar's decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in sub-clause (10) of clause 6 of the

Bill,  the Registrar is empowered, if he has reason

to   believe  that  a  motor  vehicle  licensed  in

Malaysia has been or is intended to be used for  an

unlawful  purpose  or  in an  unlawful  manner,  to

notify the owner by registered post that the  motor

vehicle   shall   not   be   used   in   Singapore.

Corresponding  provision exists  in  the  Malaysian

Road Traffic Act in respect of vehicles licensed in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above are the main provisions of the

Bill,  but I would like to point out that clause  5

is  tied up with clause 6 of the Bill and gives the

Registrar  power to allocate Singapore registration

numbers  to  vehicles registered in  Singapore  but

bearing Malaysian registration numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to sound a

word  of  warning  to  pirate taxi  operators  that

action  will be taken against them if they continue

to  pursue their illegal activities after this Bill

becomes law. I hope those concerned will take  heed

of this warning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of the House

to the Report by the Milton Tan Committee which has

been tabled in Parliament today. This Committee was

set up to review the position of licensing of taxis

and   taxi   drivers   in  Singapore.   Among   its

recommendations  is a scheme to  license  at  least

4,000  private  motor vehicles as school  taxis  to

ferry school children to and from schools. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



school  taxis  will  be licensed  only  for  school

children  and will be required to provide insurance

cover  for  their passengers, to be subject  to  an

annual inspection by the Vehicles Department and to

carry a special identification mark. They will also

have to pay a licence fee of $2 per month. The date

when applications will be received for school taxis

and  other details will be announced later. I would

also  mention  that another recommendation  is  the

licensing  of  an  additional  300  taxis  to   the

existing  number of 3,206. The Committee felt  that

the  present  number  of  licensed  taxis  may   be

increased by 300 in view of the following -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the bus services not being sufficient for the

whole Republic;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the opening up and development of new housing

estates  by private developers and the Housing  and

Development Board:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the increase in population;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) many of the taxi drivers have difficulty in

finding a taxi to drive; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the increased number of tourists visiting

Singapore.



<br><br>The  date will also be announced later as  to  when

applications  for  these additional  taxis  can  be

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a number of amendments have been

made  which  have  been rendered necessary  by  the

constitutional   changes  in  Singapore   and   its

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

relief will be felt all round at the passing of the

Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill into law. To my mind,

however,  the passing of this new law will  not  be

sufficient. We would be extremely unrealistic if we

expect  our public transport problems to be  solved

solely  on the passing of the new law. Yes, if  the

new  law is properly imposed, then the pirate  taxi

menace  will  be  eliminated. But  what  about  the

aftermath? As I once before remarked in a speech to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



Taxi Drivers' Association, Singapore today is  not

the  Singapore  of  the suburban  area  of  Katong,

Geylang,   etc.  Suburban  areas  like  Queenstown,

Kallang,  Toa Payoh have emerged with  their  heavy

demand for public transport. In the first place,  I

should  like to say that it was their demand  which

gave  rise to the pirate taxi business, although  I

read  in  the newspaper that the President  of  the

Taxi Hire Car Association, Mr Simon, said that the

pirate taxi problem has been existing for 20 years.

It  seems to me that he said nothing at all in  the

present context. It was no problem then, but now it

has  become a problem of some dimension and  action

has  had to be taken, and further a solution sought

not by just giving the history of the existence  of

pirate taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to congratulate

the  Minister  of  State for the  Prime  Minister's

Department   on  introducing  this   Road   Traffic

(Amendment)  Bill  which,  when  passed   by   this

Legislature  and incorporated in the  Road  Traffic

Ordinance, will remove the ambiguities in the  Road

Traffic Ordinance, 1961, and also put an end to the

pirate taxi menace in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone through the relevant clauses of this

Bill  and it was with great pleasure that  I  noted

from the relevant clauses that in future it will be

extremely  difficult  for  the  pirate  taxi  which

appears to have invaded the city traffic to a great

extent  to continue reaping illegal profits at  the

expense of the licensed taxis and buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this pirate taxi problem

essentially  consists of two evils. First  of  all,

the  owners  of  cars registered in  Malaysia  have

invaded  our city traffic with a view to earning  a

living  at the expense of our own citizens.  If  we

move around the city streets, we can observe pirate

taxis  with  Malaysian number  plates  plying,  the

drivers'  eyes  glued  to the  pedestrians  with  a

desire to attracting them to their taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to hear from the Minister of State

that  steps have been taken to increase the  number

of  licensed  taxis, but in taking these  necessary

steps to increase the number of licensed taxis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



I  would  like to draw the attention of this  House

that  once  the  issuance of  taxi  licences  takes

place,  the  Registrar of Vehicles must turn  every

stone to ensure that the new taxis do not fall into

the  hands  of the small-time capitalists  who  own

several  vehicles  and  who  make  their  money  by

renting  out  these cars. On the  other  hand,  the

Registrar  must ensure that the new taxis  go  into

the  hands  of  the vast number of registered  taxi

drivers  who, for want of a vehicle of  their  own,

are  forced  to  hire  taxis  from  the  small-time

capitalists,   in  which  case  they   suffer   the

exploitation of having to part with a heavy payment

from  their earnings as hire for the vehicles. This

is  important, Sir. If the Registrar fails to bring

about  a fair distribution and, on the other  hand,

indifferently allows the concentration of  vehicles

in the hands of a few, he will be going against the

tide of a socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect. Though taxis must be given

to  the hundreds of taxi drivers who are not  in  a

position to buy their own vehicles because of their

incapacity, are they to continue to be exploited by

the  vehicle owners? I have the intention to  raise

this  matter  with the Government with  a  view  to

appealing  to the Government to form a co-operative

society  with Government assistance to enable  them

to  possess  their own vehicles.  The  trade  union

movement  has  been especially interested  in  this

problem and anxious to end exploitation of the kind

mentioned  earlier, and we have been interested  in

bringing  about a situation where taxis are  manned

by  owner-operators. If the Government works  along

the  lines indicated by ensuring that taxis are  so

distributed  that  the situation is  brought  about

where  there is one owner to a taxi, it will  be  a

feather in the cap of our socialist Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fervently hope, Sir, that interest will be

taken  in  the formation of a co-operative  society

with  the  principal function of helping  the  taxi

drivers  to own their own vehicles and to bring  to

an  end their exploitation which is quite naked  in

this sector.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Bill  which  has

been introduced in Parliament today is a Bill which

really affects the public of our country. I believe

that it certainly has good intentions, that is,  to

safeguard our country from being a country  without

laws or without procedure. However, in a matter  of

this nature, we must consider all aspects. Firstly,

the  taxi  drivers;  secondly, the  bus  companies;

thirdly,  members of the public, including  adults,

office   workers,  women  going  marketing,  school

children; and fourthly, the unemployed. I  am  sure

unemployed persons will find ways and means to earn

a  living  and, in their opinion, they can  earn  a

living by driving pirate taxis. To me, if a country

is  short of buses, bus routes, or taxis, or if the

taxis or buses are untidy and the roads are narrow,

we  can  say that that country has not got adequate

laws. We must have an open mind on how we can adopt

these  laws  so that the citizens may benefit  from

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in Paper Misc. 3 of 1966, the Report

of  the Committee to Review the Licensing of  Taxis

and  Taxi Drivers, the Committee only recommends  a

total  of  300  additional taxis.  Statistics  were

obtained   from  cities  like  Bangkok,   Hongkong,

Manila, London, Queensland Australia, and the Malay

States.  I  believe that, apart  from  Malaya,  the

standard of living of those countries mentioned  is

high  and that enables the people to own their  own

cars or to run adequate buses. Perhaps in countries

like  London,  we understand that  in  addition  to

taxis  and  buses, there are underground  rail  and

monorail services. Perhaps that is an effort on the

part  of  the  Government concerned to improve  the

transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in contrast, in the whole of Malaya

there  are  5,245  taxis with  a  population  of  7

million. We cannot compare Malaya with Singapore on

the  ground  that  Malaya, with a population  of  7

million,  has  hundreds of small  towns,  excepting

Kuala  Lumpur,  Penang,  Ipoh,  and  Seremban,  for

example, which do not have any use for taxis as  we

do  in  Singapore. Therefore, it is impossible  for

this Committee to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



consider  all these factors because, as  stated  by

the  Minister  of  State, with the  development  of

housing  estates  by  private  developers  and  the

Housing   and  Development  Board,  we  must   also

consider  that  the increase of 300 taxis  must  be

raised.  As  I said, we cannot compare  with  those

countries that I enumerated just now. Conditions in

Malaya differ from those obtaining in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, services by road, rail, and

aeroplane   all  differ.  Bus  services   and   the

operation of taxis and pirate taxis differ one from

the other. For instance, in the case of buses, they

run  along  fixed or determined routes  and  cannot

stop  anywhere other than at specified  bus  stops.

Pirate taxis ply according to their own routes  and

they  may  stop wherever they like. Sometimes  they

even  stop when the traffic lights are red in order

to  set down their passengers. There are two  types

of  taxis  in  Singapore. One  is  the  taxi  which

follows the rules of the Registrar of Vehicles, and

the other which follows the pirate taxi rules. This

means  that taxis following the rules of the R.O.V.

ply  their business along routes which differ  from

the bus routes and the routes of pirate taxis. They

pick up passengers at one place and go according to

the directions of the passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Committee's Report

referred  to,  there is reference  made  to  61,000

school children using pirate taxis. Because of  the

great  number of children, the Committee recommends

that  licences be issued to what are termed by  the

Committee  as  "school  taxis"  or  "private  motor

vehicles  licensed to carry school  children".  Why

cannot  this  Committee make a  recommendation  for

separate licences as, for instance, office workers'

taxis,  taxis for people going to market, or  taxis

for people living in areas without buses? This is a

complicated matter. In issuing special licences  to

taxis to carry the 61,000 school children alone, we

must  also  consider the views of  other  transport

operators  because the Committee is of the  opinion

that  buses  are  insufficient. I also  think  that

office  workers  in  town  are  not  supplied  with

adequate bus services and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



they feel that they should come to office by pirate

taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we allow taxis to run according to pirate taxi

rules, I am sure that, for the purpose of enforcing

the   law  with  good  intentions,  we  should  not

implement  it, and that to regularise the  position

in  our  country  we  must be open-minded  and  not

restrict or confine ourselves to one sector of  the

population alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention is also made in the Report that most of

the  drivers  have a little knowledge of  Singapore

for  the benefit of tourism. I am sure that because

of  the  rapid  developments taking  place  in  our

country, that has nothing to do with the Bill under

discussion today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should also find out the

reason  why,  in  addition to the  matters  I  have

mentioned   earlier  on,  the  bus   companies   as

mentioned  in  the Report do not  wish  to  provide

special   bus   services  because  of  uneconomical

grounds.  What is surprising to me is that  if  the

Bill is passed without an open mind considering it,

I am afraid that the attitude of bus companies will

be  this, "If I do not make a profit, then I do not

care  what happens to you." If this is the attitude

of  bus  companies,  we should not  adopt  a  civil

attitude. We cannot support that attitude. We  must

find  ways  and  means to enable bus  companies  to

operate  for the benefit of the public, for  school

children,  and so on. The reason why parents  allow

their   children  to  use  pirate  taxis  is  this.

Firstly,  the  safety of their children;  secondly,

the distance from their homes to the bus stand; and

thirdly,  they  have  to change  buses  frequently,

which takes time and also cost more in fares.  This

must  be considered as widely as possible. That  is

all, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>4.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to support this Bill and

also   to   congratulate  the   Minister   on   his

initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister for an

assurance  that  just  passing  this  Bill  is  not

enough,  but  to  see  that  the  Bill  is   really

enforced.  Secondly, just curbing the pirate  taxis

will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



really  solve this problem. With the expansion  of

the   Republic  and  especially  of  the   housing

estates,  more licensed taxis should be introduced

to cater for the needs of the public, particularly

school  children living in housing  estates  where

buses  are not available. I should like to suggest

that  Government  introduce a  type  of  transport

where it will cater only for school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While appreciating the Bill to curb these pirate

taxis,  the  Government should also  consider  the

problem  of  school-going children. At the  moment

these children depend for their transport on these

pirate taxis. When I say transport, Mr Speaker, I

mean  cheap transport. There should be a  form  of

cheap,   legalised   transport  for   school-going

children.  To ease their difficulties  during  the

transition   period,  I  would  suggest   to   the

Government  to  introduce  a  co-operative  scheme

whereby  these taxi-drivers would be able  to  own

their  own vehicles one day and, at the same time,

provide  cheaper  transport  for  children.  These

taxis  carrying school-going children, on the  co-operative scheme introduced by Government,  should

carry  a  plate  openly  on display,  "For  school

children only" and levy charges at a very  special

rate.  If the Government is prepared to float  the

capital  for  this co-operative scheme,  a  driver

would  be  able to save about 50 per cent  of  the

rent of the vehicle in a month, which will come to

about  $280. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, you may not  be

aware  of  what I really mean when I say a  driver

would save about $280 a month. Take, for instance,

a  driver  who  rents a vehicle  from  the  blood-sucking vampire at about $17 per day or about $500

per  month.  The driver gets his own vehicle  from

the co-operative society on an instalment basis of

about  $220  per month. This enables him  to  save

about  $280 per month. He should then be  able  to

say  that he robs from the rich and gives  to  the

poor and that he is a Robin Hood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand why the Taxi Owners Association

is  against  the  increase of  more  taxis.  These

owners are not used to a socialist society, or any

society other than a capitalist society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



I  should like the Government here to introduce  a

Bill whereby there will be a maximum of about  $10

a  day  rent  on  any  taxi for  taxi  drivers  in

Singapore.  By this, Mr Speaker, I am,  in  fact,

doing a favour to the fat capitalists who will  be

able to join our society, a socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, while appreciating the unemployment

market,  I would appeal to the Minister really  to

look  into  the  difficulties of the  pirate  taxi

drivers  so  as  to be able to fit them  into  our

society.  I would also ask him whether or  not  he

has  any intention to introduce taxi stops similar

to bus stops.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to me as if several

Members  are interested in debating this  Bill.  I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I feel that the introduction of this

Bill  today by the Government can be put  in  this

way  -  that  it is introduced under circumstances

that  cannot  be  helped.  Singapore  is  now   an

independent  sovereign country and,  as  such,  we

should  have  discipline and ordered life  in  the

country. Therefore, we cannot allow certain people

to  come out of the purviews of the existing  law.

The  problem of pirate taxis is a good example  to

illustrate  my  point.  But  in  order  to   adopt

measures  to  achieve the purpose, we should  also

consider  carefully  how to go  about  it  and  to

consider its causes. The existence of pirate taxis

is  also  something that we should consider.  Just

now  the  Minister of State has said  that  it  is

recommended by the Milton Tan Committee that it is

necessary to have 4,000 more taxis to carry school

children  and he has also said that the number  of

pirate taxis is about 7,000. It is really alarming

that pirate taxis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



have  increased  to  such an extent.  It  has  been

partly  due to Indonesian confrontation,  resulting

in  some people having to resort to other means  of

livelihood. Some people have to resort  to  running

pirate taxis for their livelihood, and others  have

to  resort  to other means of livelihood,  such  as

hawking.  Now  that Indonesia has awakened  to  the

realities  of  the situation, and  as  she  is  now

proceeding to resume trade relationships  with  us,

the   situation  will  improve;  nevertheless,  the

question  of  pirate  taxis  needs  some  time   to

resolve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the law in this respect has been passed,

what  will happen to the livelihood of these  7,000

pirate taxi drivers? Of course, on the one hand, we

have  to maintain law and order in the country but,

on  the  other, we cannot overlook or neglect  this

practical  question of their livelihood. Therefore,

I  would like to propose three suggestions  to  the

Government  which are as follows.  The  Government,

while  implementing  this  law,  should  also  warn

proprietors of public transport companies that they

should not neglect their duty to help in running  a

transport service for the people, and not just  for

the  sake  of  their  own  profits.  In  the  past,

sometimes  because  of their own selfishness,  they

had   caused  difficulties  in  regard  to   public

transportation and, because of these  difficulties,

pirate taxis came into being. Therefore, this is  a

point  that the Government should pay attention  to

while implementing the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is, I think, that during the

time  when  the  law  is being  implemented,  there

should  be a spirit of compromise so that when  the

law  is  passed, pirate taxis will not try  to  run

away  from  the law and cause a shortage of  public

transport in some areas and cause inconvenience  to

the public. Whether under the present law there  is

room  for such compromise or not is a matter to  be

considered.  There  should also be  a  governmental

solution  to this problem which will be  acceptable

to all concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the law should not be

implemented  hastily in regard  to  the  number  of

pirate taxis to be legalised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



I understand that in my area there are a  lot

of  poor  people. They have difficulty  in  getting

transport.   Pirate   taxi  operators   also   have

difficulties in meeting the hire purchase  payments

for  their  cars. As they are poor, sometimes  they

cannot  pay up the instalments and their  cars  are

then confiscated, thus threatening their livelihood

which would involve not just a matter of their  own

livelihood but also their dependants, because  they

have  to  look after their family whilst  they  are

continuing to pay for the cars they are running  as

pirate  taxis.  Therefore,  there  should  be  some

flexibility in the law, such as allowing them, say,

six  months'  grace  to pay up  their  instalments,

after  which the Government can take steps to  deal

with  them, or perhaps the period can be up to  one

year.  At least there should be some room for  them

to  manoeuvre  or  to enable them  to  pay  up  the

instalments for their cars so that they  would  not

have  any burden on their livelihood. These are  my

personal views.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> I would also like to

congratulate  the Minister of State for  the  Prime

Minister's  Department on this  amendment  Bill.  I

think this Chamber will agree with me that law  and

order  must be kept, as the Minister of  State  has

stated  just  now. I must also very highly  commend

him  on  taking into consideration the question  of

regularising   pirate  taxis  which  carry   school

children   to  school.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   this

regularisation will give confidence to parents  who

are  concerned  with the safety of  their  children

while  going  to and from school. This  is  a  good

effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Minister to enlighten me on

whether  the  regularisation of these pirate  taxis

carrying   school   children   will   include,   as

passengers, members of the public, such as  clerks,

manual workers and odd job workers. As you know, it

is  a  recognised fact in the whole world that  our

housing estates are expanding, whether it is by the

Housing   and  Development  Board  or  by   private

developers and we have to consider that the  number

of  buses running on the road is not enough for our

increasing population. Sir, my suggestion  is  that

we must include in this licence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



workers  like  teachers and others. I  fully  agree

that curbing these pirate taxis will naturally ease

our  traffic problem. Sir, as I have said just now,

with  the  increase in population, the shortage  of

transport  and  so  on, only  300  additional  taxi

licences  will  be given. Sir, we think  there  are

about  7,000 pirate taxis running in Singapore.  As

the  Member for Delta has said just now, if we take

away  something, we must substitute  something  for

it.  Therefore,  I sincerely urge the  Minister  to

consider this point. At the same time, I must  warn

that  amending the Ordinance does not mean that  we

are protecting the bosses of bus companies and taxi

owners.  The  workers and their  bosses  must  give

first-class  service to the public.  I  think  this

House  will agree with me that many of these  buses

are  driven  along  the roads in  a  very  careless

manner  and they endanger the lives of the  people.

Therefore,  it  does not mean that this  Bill  will

protect the bosses of bus companies and taxi owners

and  they can do whatever they like. They must  co-operate and give efficient and satisfactory service

to our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  gone  through  the Road  Traffic  (Amendment)

Bill.  It  appears to me that there is  not  enough

provision  in  the  Bill for  the  benefit  of  the

people,  but  it  seems to me to  impose  an  extra

burden  on  the  people. In  this  connection,  the

Government must seek an alternative solution. There

should  be  no  ill-effects on  the  people.  There

should  be  other constructive means.  That  is  my

desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore is increasing and if

the  transport system is not efficient, there  will

be  difficulties.  The  Government  must  take  the

necessary steps to see that the people are not over-burdened  and  that  they are  well  looked  after.

Therefore,    they   should   increase    transport

facilities.  Only then will there be a solution.  I

urge them to take the necessary steps to solve this

problem.  The  changing of laws, the imposition  of

$1,000  fines  or  three  years'  imprisonment  and

heavier  penalties will not lead us to  any  proper

solution. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



it  is  the Government's bounden duty to look after

the  welfare of the people. We must find  ways  and

means which will benefit the people in future.  The

Government  should  make  appropriate   laws.   The

increase    in   population   will   bring    about

difficulties in the transport situation. Therefore,

we  should  see  that proper remedies  are  brought

about  if we want our country to progress. We  have

introduced  this  Bill today, but  I  have  certain

doubts  as  to  whether it will  bring  about  good

results. Therefore, if there are difficulties,  the

law  may  be  changed.  I  feel  that  there  is  a

necessity  for  the  Government to  reconsider  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to see this Bill which

has  been introduced to amend the Ordinance. I also

hope  to  see  more legal taxis  on  the  roads  of

Singapore.  If  there are more licences  issued  to

taxis,  it  will be easier to solve  the  transport

difficulties. The question of pirate taxis  is  not

only  a legal problem but also an economic problem.

I do not oppose the idea that Singapore should be a

country  where there is law and order, but in  view

of   the   question  of  pirate   taxis   and   the

multifarious questions which affect the  livelihood

of  thousands  of  people, practical  consideration

should  be given to the solution of these problems.

Our  law  may  solve some problems  but  if,  as  a

result,  the economic situation relating  to  these

problems  is  not solved, then it may  lead  to  an

undesirable  situation. I hope that this  law  will

not  cause more economic problems. I also hope that

when  this law is passed, the Government will adopt

more  practical  measures to resolve  the  economic

problems of pirate taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I hope to be able to get some

explanation from the Minister concerned with regard

to the time when more legal licences are issued. We

should  not  expect  the issuance  of  licences  to

create  more people in the bourgeois class  and  to

make the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is a

problem to which we have to pay attention. In other

words,  the  issuance of such licences  should  not

bring  about  such a situation. In our  socialistic

country, we should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



have  measures which will lead to a situation where

the rich will become richer and the poor poorer. On

this  point,  I  would  like to  ask  the  Minister

whether  it  is not necessary to set up  a  special

Committee to study this matter. I do not mean  that

the  Registrar of Vehicles is incompetent or always

perfect   or  infallible.  Therefore,  a  Committee

should  be  appointed  to  help  him  resolve  this

problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to  get some clarification from the  Minister

concerned.   In  the  Report  of  the  Milton   Tan

Committee  - the section on the proposed  licensing

of  private motor vehicles to carry school children

only  for profit -- from the wording, I assume that

only school children will be carried. I know for  a

fact that at the moment there are some teachers  or

school  clerks  who go with children  in  the  same

motor  vehicles.  But if only school  children  are

allowed to be carried as passengers in this type of

vehicle,  did the Committee go into the details  of

the  economic factors involved? Now how many school

children can a motor vehicle carry? At the  moment,

10,  12  or 15 children are squeezed into one  car,

but  I  suppose  when the taxis are licensed,  they

will  not be able to do that. So probably each  car

will  be able to carry six or seven school children

for  one session. So for two sessions, one car will

be  able  to  carry an average of 12 or  14  school

children. But if each school child were to  pay  an

average of $12 per month, then the owner-driver  of

such  a  type of vehicle would be able to  have  an

income  of  about $150 a month. Now  these  drivers

have  to pay $2 a month for the licence fee  and  I

wonder how much they are going to pay for insurance

cover  for passengers! If they are allowed to carry

only  school children, as I said earlier, they  can

only  carry  about 14 school children a  day  seven

boys  or girls in the morning session and seven  in

the  afternoon  session.  So  that  means  that  14

children  will  be  paying to  the  owner  of  that

vehicle.  He has to pay $2 a month for the  licence

fee. Now how much he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



has  to pay for insurance cover, I do not know.  So

if  such  a type of vehicle is limited to  carrying

only  school  children, would it be profitable,  or

would the operator earn enough for a living?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  very much impressed today because the Bill  has

created interest among hon. Members. This is  right

and proper, because transport is our major problem,

as has been pointed out by several hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered this problem from all angles

for  the benefit of our country. However, we  admit

that  in the implementation of the Bill we may face

trials  and  tribulations, but in the  interest  of

peace  and for the benefit of the majority  of  our

people,  we  are  obliged to take somewhat  drastic

measures because it was during the period when  the

R.O.V. was under Malaysia that the number of pirate

taxis was on the increase. We consider it essential

that an amendment be made to curb the activities of

pirate taxi operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to certain Members of the House who

have  put forward constructive suggestions. One  of

the  suggestions  coming from the Member  for  Bras

Basah  is  a request that the issuance of  licences

does  not fall into the hands of small capitalists.

It  is  the responsibility of my Ministry  to  give

serious  consideration to this matter. I feel  that

certain  Members are anxious that  when  action  is

taken against these pirate taxi operators, it  will

mean a step backwards in the transport system.  But

I  think  that in the interim period we are obliged

to  take this measure because, in the past, when we

asked  for  extension of a bus service  in  certain

areas,  the bus company concerned turned  down  the

request  on uneconomical grounds. With the  curbing

of pirate taxi activities, the bus companies should

have no reason not to extend their services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the suggestion of the Member for Delta

that the enforcement of this Bill should be held in

abeyance  for  six months or a year,  I  think  the

question of eliminating pirate taxi activities  was

first  talked about long ago, and the response  was

that more pirate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



taxis came on to the road, and ample time was given

to these operators to find alternative means of

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the request from the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Health, the  Members

for  Kampong  Kapor, Changi, and so  on,  was  that

pirate taxis be allowed to carry office workers and

adults.  It is difficult to distinguish between  an

office  worker  and  an ordinary  person  hiring  a

pirate  taxi.  I  think  this  request  cannot   be

considered at this stage. Likewise, the question of

teachers being included in the definition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of how many children can be carried

in  a licensed pirate taxi will be announced later,

but  at the moment, what I can propose is the ratio

of  two  adults  to  three children,  so  that  the

maximum  a  car  can carry is seven passengers.  We

must ensure the safety of school children should an

1966  until  such fees as prescribed in  the  Motor

Vehicles  Registration and Licensing  Rules,  1948,

have  been paid. However, before 30th May,  1966  a

vehicle which was registered in the Federation  was

expressly exempted under the Rules from payment  of

additional registration fees on re-registration  in

Singapore.  The  Motor  Vehicles  Registration  and

Licensing  (Amendment) Rules,  1966,  removed  this

exemption   in   respect  of  Federation-registered

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Departmental Titles (Alteration)

Ordinance  provides  for the  substitution  of  new

titles  or names of offices where there has been  a

change of departmental titles, and section 3 of the

Ordinance   provides   that  Parliament   may,   by

resolution,  add  to or amend the Schedule  to  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the Schedule to the Ordinance

has  been updated so that powers and duties of  the

authorities named in legislation will be statutorily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



vested  in authorities which have  replaced

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Malaysia, under the Modification of Laws

(Customs)  Order  (L.N. 306) dated  8th  September,

1964, certain changes were made to the departmental

titles  of  officers of the Customs  Department  in

Malaya.  As the Customs Department in Singapore  is

closely associated with its counterpart across  the

Causeway,  it  was  considered  desirable  for  the

Department  to  adopt  similar  titles   to   avoid

confusion in nomenclature that might arise  in  the

course  of  liaison  between officers  of  the  two

Departments. The Singapore titles were  accordingly

revised  in the Singapore Customs (Amendment)  Act,

1966, and this motion, which is consequential, will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PROPOSAL FOR INTEGRATED TAMIL SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to raise this matter in this House for

integrated Tamil schools for the improvement and

safe-guard of the Tamil language in the Republic of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's present educational policy of

equal treatment for the four language streams of

education in Malay, Chinese, English and Tamil is

most praiseworthy. It is in the best interest of

moulding our multi-racial and multi-lingual society

into a common group of patriotic citizens. This

system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



will  give an opportunity to the various  races  to

preserve  and safeguard their own cultural heritage

handed through generations by learning their mother

tongue,  and  help  develop  a  common  ground   of

understanding  between  one  another  through   the

common and national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamil language has a long history of the past

and is considered to be one of the oldest languages

in  the world. It has an unbroken length of history

of 5,000 years old. The Tamil community, although a

minority  group in this country, are very  grateful

for  the  Government's initiative and encouragement

by making Tamil as one of the official languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 14 Tamil primary schools and one

secondary  school  in Singapore.  Out  of  14,  two

primary schools are run by Government and the other

12  are aided schools. However, there is a tendency

among the public and the community that the present

curriculum  in  Tamil schools falls  short  of  the

required  need. The same could be said about  Tamil

as a second language in English schools. It is felt

that  improvements could be achieved by  increasing

the number of teaching hours and periods to include

language, literature and grammar classes which  are

the fundamentals for a better and improved study of

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, English as a second language in Tamil

schools is a vital necessity at the present moment.

Perhaps  a few politicians may say that English  is

the  leftover  of  the past colonial  masters.  But

ungrudgingly, it has become the language of  living

in this part of the world at the present day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am quoting correctly, the standard of

English in the only Tamil secondary school  is  not

up  to the required need, so much so that a student

who  passed  a Tamil secondary education  from  the

Umar  Pulawar Secondary School is only fit to be  a

Tamil  teacher  in any of the Tamil schools.  Thus,

the  scope  of their employment in other fields  is

remote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedy could be by improving English

education in the Tamil schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



in  general and raising the standard of English in

the  Tamil  secondary school  to  Secondary  IV  or

Cambridge Certificate level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the main theme of our Government's

educational policy is to infuse national unity  and

understanding among the various races of this  tiny

Republic, the bold step taken by the Government  in

introducing the integrated schools system  is  very

much  appreciated. By this system it is  understood

that  pupils of two different language streams  mix

together  and  share the same school building,  the

same playground and the same language teachers.  In

this system there is more inducement for pupils  to

speak each other's language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, felt that an integrated

English/Tamil school will help improve the standard

of  the  English language and the knowledge of  the

children considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that there are 42 integrated

schools  in  Singapore, of  which  28  are  primary

schools,  eight  are  academic  secondary  schools,

three  are technical secondary and the other  three

are  vocational secondary schools. These integrated

schools  are  understood to be either  English  and

Chinese  streams  or English and Malay  streams  -

none in the English and Tamil streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason it is suggested that the

Government  should  look into  the  possibility  of

establishing  integrated English/Tamil  schools  in

areas  where  Tamils  are residing  in  significant

numbers  such as Farrer Park, Pasir Panjang,  Anson

and Sembawang, or at such strategic places where it

will serve the general need of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is suggested that the

Government  should make an attempt to integrate  at

least  the  two primary Tamil schools  run  by  the

Government, namely, Aravinder Tamil School and  St.

George's  Road  Tamil School with the  neighbouring

English  schools. In the case of St. George's  Road

school,  as  the  Kallang Basin and  Toa  Payoh  is

becoming  a  fast developing area, a new integrated

school may be built in this area for this purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that in the integrated schools the

teachers  could be interchangeable. Therefore,  the

teachers are expected to be well equipped with  the

languages  they  teach. It is understood  that  in-service courses are arranged for teachers who  wish

to  specialise  in  certain subjects.  It  is  also

understood  that there are specialist teachers  who

have  undergone training in the United Kingdom  for

teaching  English  as a second language.  Such  in-service courses or specialist training courses  are

not  available to Tamil language teachers  in  both

English and Tamil schools. For this reason,  it  is

suggested  that  selected Tamil  language  teachers

from   both  the  English  and  Tamil  streams   of

education  may  be sent to Indian universities  for

specialised  training.  Eventually  they   may   be

employed  as  lecturers for in-service courses  for

the Tamil language in the T.T.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the learning of a second language has

been made compulsory since 1966, many Tamil parents

in  Mission schools have complained that they would

like  their  children to study Tamil  as  a  second

language.   But  such  facilities  are  not   being

provided  in  the Mission schools.  In  the  spirit

language classes where some students attend Chinese

and Malay language classes, Tamil-speaking children

either  waste  their  period  or  go  without   any

language lessons at all. It is suggested that where

there is an adequate number of children and a Tamil

language  teacher  could be employed  economically,

the Education Minister should look into such issues

and  could direct the Mission schools to follow the

Government system of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy of implementing integrated Tamil

schools,  the  status and future  of  the  existing

Tamil  schools should not be affected. Any possible

integration   of  these  schools   should   be   in

consultation with the School Management  Committees

beforehand.  On  the  other hand,  Government  help

should  be  forthcoming to improve the teaching  of

English in these schools in order that a student in

a  Tamil secondary school may be placed in an equal

position  and opportunity with his counterparts  in

the  other language streams, such as Chinese, Malay

and English.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to say that the implementation of

integrated  English/Tamil schools will be  in  line

with the Government's oft-declared policy of giving

equality  to  all  streams of  education,  such  as

English,  Chinese, Malay and Tamil, and will  be  a

hallmark  of  authority and safety  for  the  Tamil

language in the Republic of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak? I

will call on the Minister to reply.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I refer to the

statement  just made by the Member for Farrer  Park

on  the  curriculum of our Tamil  schools.  I  must

point  out  that the curriculum in all our  schools

has been standardised since 1959. Tamil schools are

following  the  same curriculum  as  that  for  the

Malay,  Chinese and English schools.  It  was  only

during  the  last  two years that English  language

instruction   in  Government-aided  Tamil   primary

schools  has  been put on a firm basis,  when  even

classes  as small as 15 in enrolment were  eligible

for second language teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be remembered that the second language

was  made compulsory at Secondary I level only with

effect  from  January 1966. In order to  make  this

effective,  it was decided that every pupil  should

offer  a  second  language in  the  primary  school

leaving  examination with effect from  1966.  Since

last  year,  therefore, all the Tamil schools  have

been  provided with English language teachers,  and

the  standard  of  English  in  Tamil  schools  has

already shown considerable improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, an intensive training programme for

second language teachers commenced at the Teachers'

Training College in 1965. And this step is aimed at

imparting   a   more  effective   second   language

instruction in English in all non-English schools.

One of the ways to raise the standard of English in

Tamil  schools  would be to teach certain  subjects

such  as  Mathematics and Science  in  English.  By

constantly  following lessons  in  English,  pupils

will, over a period, having listened to, taken part

in  discussions, reading and talking in the English

language, become familiar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



with the English language. The pupils in Government-aided   English  secondary  schools   are   already

attending  Tamil classes organised by the  Ministry

of   Education,   together   with   students   from

Government  English  secondary schools  at  various

centres  in  Singapore. The teaching  of  Tamil  in

primary schools is undertaken during school  hours

in  the  schools  which  have  asked  for  language

instruction in Tamil. So far, only one request  has

been   received  from  a  Government-aided  English

school  and  it  has been provided  with  full-time

Tamil  language teachers. If the Ministry,  in  the

course  of  time,  receives  requests  from   other

Government-aided   schools  for   second   language

instruction  in Tamil, teachers will  certainly  be

provided.  Though  we do not have integrated  Tamil

schools  as such, there are two Tamil schools,  the

Aravinder and Pasir Panjang Tamil School which  are

functioning in Silat Integrated Primary School  and

Labrador Primary School respectively. The pupils of

these two Tamil schools mix freely with pupils from

the  other  language streams in the same  building,

although  they retain their identity  by  having  a

separate  name for their school and are  headed  by

their  own Principal. In respect of mixing together

outside  of  classrooms, in the  canteens,  on  the

playing  field  and  in  the other  extra-curricula

activities, although they retain their  own  names,

integration  between the schools I  have  mentioned

is,  in  effect,  very much like integration  among

other streams in other parts of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has been contemplating

integrated  Tamil schools in the  area  where  many

Tamils live, and I certainly welcome the support of

the   Member  for  Farrer  Park  in  what  he   has

suggested. The integration of St.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



George's  Tamil School will be considered when  the

redevelopment of the Kallang Basin takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to raise the standard of teaching in

Tamil  schools, plans are being drawn  up  for  the

following  in-service courses for  Tamil  teachers:

teaching   of   Mathematics  in  primary   schools;

teaching  of  Arts  and Crafts in primary  schools;

teaching of Science in primary schools; teaching of

Tamil  in  Tamil schools, and, lastly, teaching  of

Tamil  in English schools. The syllabuses  are  now

being worked out and it is expected to make a start

at  the Teachers' Training College in the following

term. The question of offering scholarships to  the

best  students  from  both the  English  and  Tamil

streams  of  education  to study  Tamil  in  Indian

Universities will be given due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the hon. Member for Farrer Park will now

agree  with me that my Ministry has been doing  all

it  can to improve the standard of English in Tamil

schools  and  the  standard  of  Tamil  in  English

schools  and  the standard of Tamil  in  any  other

schools  where there are pupils who wish  to  study

the  Tamil language. Our aim is to make every pupil

proficient in at least two languages in our  multi-racial  society.  We  have not  ignored  the  Tamil

schools or the Tamil students in English schools or

elsewhere  in attempting to achieve this objective,

and I can assure the Member for Farrer Park that we

shall not ignore them in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)	To eliminate the varying levels of surface postage rates in the States of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)	To despatch letters by air whenever earlier delivery is possible by that means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is no longer a constituent state of Malaysia, it is still necessary to maintain the current inland postage rates as since 1949 when the previous inland postage rates were fixed, staff and operating costs have increased considerably.

<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY SCHOOL AT KAKI BUKIT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister for Education whether and when another primary school will be built at Kaki Bukit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The demand for primary education in the Jalan Eunos/Kaki Bukit area does not justify the building of another primary school. However, under the Rebuilding of Schools Programme in the 2nd Development Plan, the Kampong Melayu Boy�s School will be demolished and a new 24-classroom standard school will be built in its place. With the construction of this school additional accommodation will be available to cater for the increase in population in this area. It is hoped to schedule this school for rebuilding in 1968.

<div align="center"><b>FREE EDUCATION AND BURSARIES FOR NON-MALAY CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister for Education whether non-Malay children born in Singapore and adopted by Singapore-citizen Malays, are entitled to (i) free education from Primary to University level, and (ii) special Malay bursaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Non-Malay children who have been legally adopted by Malay Singapore citizens are eligible for free education from primary school to university level. They may also apply for special Malay bursaries if they are studying in post-secondary educational institutions. Those in secondary schools are eligible to apply for bursaries and the rules governing the award of such bursaries will be applied liberally in their cases as in the case of other Malay applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, those who have not been legally adopted are eligible to apply for the following concessions provided they are Singapore born or have parents at least one of whom is a Singapore Citizen: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 6 years of free primary education between the ages of 6 and 14;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Waiver of payment of Terminal Fees, such as Sports, Library and Science fees,

free spectacles and loan of free textbooks in primary and secondary schools;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Remission of school fees in secondary schools:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Bursaries in secondary schools and post-secondary education institutions.

<div align="center"><b>CLEANING OF DRAINS AND REMOVAL OF REFUSE BIN CENTRE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) whether he is aware

that the drains in Moonstone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



Lane, Opal Crescent, Ruby Lane, Topaz Road,

Woodsville Road, Meyappa Chettiar Road and the surroundings are not cleaned

properly and that the residents of those areas have complained about the breeding

of mosquitoes, and whether the necessary action will be taken in the matter; and

(b) whether he will cause the existing refuse bin centre at Meyappa Chettiar

Road which is about ten feet away from the nearest houses to be removed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> (a) The drains of this area are subject to weekly or

more frequent cleansing by the newly established Emergency Cleansing Corps.

House-to-house collection of refuse is being done daily or on alternate days,

at present. A fair number of the drains in this area are �dry� , namely without

flow of water during dry weather, and as such should not give rise to any mosquito

breeding. There is, however, evidence of indiscriminate dumping of refuse by householders

or other persons into drains and on vacant land in this area.  Action has, in

fact, been taken by the Public Cleansing Department on these contraventions

of the Cleansing Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special mosquito survey was conducted on 14th June, 1966 of houses

in the area bounded by Moonstone Lane, Opal Crescent, Ruby Lane, Topaz

Road, Woodsville Road, Meyappa Chettiar Road and the surroundings. This

survey showed that of the 167 premises inspected, 22 (14 per cent) were

found to have places which bred mosquitoes.  The places where mosquitoes

had been found to breed include articles ranging from disused motor truck

tires, fish tanks, tin-pails, disused W.C. pans, earth drains and sullage drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general situation of this area also favours the breeding of mosquitoes,

which is only 200 yards from Sungei Kallang.  Sungei Kallang has been a

frequent source of mosquito breeding because of changes in water level and

other problems of drainage and water flow.  There are also the problems of

extensive earth movements and silting at the mouth of this river.  Owing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



multiple problems in connection with this river, only palliative measures by

oiling against mosquito breeding can be taken and although of limited value,

this is being done. The proper solution to the problem of Sungei Kallang is

improvement to the banks of the river.  The attention of the Public Works

Department and Housing and Development Board, who are carrying out this work,

has been drawn to this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Refuse bin-centre referred to is a pre-war bin centre situated on Crown

land, and situated at least 25 feet (not 10 feet as stated) from the nearest house

and is built on a concrete platform.  It is also sited conveniently for the cleansing

beat labourers to dispose of the refuse from adjacent kampongs.  The centre is also

situated away from the main Serangoon Road and adjacent to the kampong area. It

appears from a survey of the area that present site is the most convenient and

practicable one. Any new site will equally bring objections from adjacent householders.

<div align="center"><b>NEW CITIZENSHIP IDENTITY CARDS FOR NON-MALAY CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether

a non-Malay child, born in Singapore and adopted by Malays, will be

issued with his Malay name and Malay as his race appearing on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker (Acting Minister for Labour):</b> Children born in

Singapore who are Singapore Citizens by birth will be issued with

the new citizenship identity card, irrespective of whether the child

has been adopted by a citizen or a non-citizen of another race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-Malay child who has been adopted by Malays will have his

Malay name written on the new identity card. In addition, however,

his name on the birth certificate will also be written within brackets

on the identity card.  This is to relate the identity card to his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



birth certificate. If, however, an adopted Order of Court is produced, the

non-Malay name of the adopted child will not be entered on his new identity

card; only the assumed Malay name will appear thereon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child cannot change his race by adoption but in order to avoid

embarrassment it is the practice of the National Registration Office

to enter the race of the adopting parents, if so desired, on the

identity card of the child.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL THEATRE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Raising of funds)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.	 <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs why, even

after the completion of the National Theatre, request programmes over Radio

Singapura are being broadcast to raise funds for the Theatre.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok :</b> It is true that the National Theatre has been

structurally completed to enable it to be used for various types of stage

performances for a capacity audience of up to 3,400 people. However,

the National Theatre as it is now is more elaborate than first envisaged.

As a consequence many conveniences and facilities originally planned had

to be deferred in order to finance a larger and better theatre.  Funds

are still required which a theatre of its kind should possess.  For this

reason public contribution through the purchase of request cards for the

playing of favourite numbers over Radio Singapura still continues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There are many rooms in the National Theatre which remain

ill-equipped with furniture and other fittings.  With the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



funds collected from the sale of request programme cards, suitable furniture

will be bought and a number of rooms for performances and rehearsals

air-conditioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Profits from hire of the Theatre as well as Trust organized

shows are beginning to off-set the heavy expenditure of maintenance

and annually recurrent expenditure.  When greater profits are possible

in the future, the funds thus earned would be used to promote further

cultural activity by the Trust in the Republic by way of increasing

training classes on a variety of art forms and the provisions of

scholarships to suitable candidates in furtherance of the Republic�s

cultural policies.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Law and National Development

whether he will consider arranging for the proper parking of vehicles in the car parks

provided by the Housing and Development Board in the Macpherson Housing Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The Housing and Development Board has already provided

space for car parking in the Macpherson Housing Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the delay in the provision of a proper market, hawkers have been

plying in the car parks.  In order to overcome this problem, the Housing and

Development Board has erected covered cooked food stalls and open hawkers�

pitches, and these are now ready for occupation.  The hawkers will be moved into the

pitches, and the car parks will then become clear for proper use for the parking of the

vehicles.
