<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>STRIKE BY EMPLOYEES OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S ASSOCIATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of proceedings stood over from 16th

November, 1961.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. At the Movement of

Interruption  yesterday, we were on Question  18*,

which  is now Question 1* on today's Order Paper,

and  the  Prime  Minister was in  the  process  of

answering  a supplementary question by the  Member

for Mountbatten, which is as follows:



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The question, standing in the name of Mrs Seow Peck Leng, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister if consideration will be given to appointing a Commission

of Inquiry to investigate into the causes of the strike by employees of the People's Association.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Prime

Minister  could tell the House whether he  did  or

did not give an interview to the seven members  of

this  Action  Committee  on  the  20th  September,

1961?"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> As I was

saying  yesterday,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  cannot

remember  the exact date. But I did see the  seven

members   of   the  self-styled  ex-staff   Action

Committee  for  some two hours,  and  I  took  the

precaution of having the proceedings recorded.  As

a  result  of  the fact that the proceedings  were

faithfully recorded, there has been no argument as

to what took place at that meeting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> r Speaker,

Sir, I wonder if the Prime Minister could tell us

whether he said words to the effect that, without

the P.A.P., there would be no People's Association

and that if the employees of the People's

Association valued their jobs, they must support

the P.A.P. and act as political workers for the

P.A.P. in community centres. Did the Prime

Minister at that meeting ask the seven members to

convey this to the other workers, and also ask

them to state their political stand?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The answer to the question

simply is that that is inaccurate. I have the tape

recordings. They are in the hands of the Secretary

of the People's Association. I think it will take

about two to two and a half hours for the Member

for Mountbatten to listen to the whole

proceedings. Most of them ere in Mandarin, but I

am quite prepared to lend her an interpreter in

order to follow the proceedings. The point that I

emphasised to the workers of the People's

Association was that they had to be loyal to the

P.A.P. Government, because that was the Government

which created the People's Association and had the

majority of the members of the Board, which took

over the functions of the Social Welfare

Department with respect to community centres. It

is on the record, Sir, so the facilities are open

to the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Yesterday  the  Prime  Minister  said   that   the

People's  Association 110W has 400-odd members.  I

want   to   know   whether   these   include   the

instructors.  If they are paid, whether  they  are

paid  according  to time: this also  includes  the

staff of the Social Welfare Department. Apart from

this,  how many are actually in employment in  the

People's Association?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot allow the question because

it  is an entirely different question and does not

arise  out  of  the original question.  Mr  David

Marshall.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Yesterday, the Prime

Minister said that there was no strike. I would remind

him  that  certain employees went on strike there  and

they  were dismissed. In view of the very considerable

unhappiness  about this issue, would he  not  consider

appointing a Commission of Inquiry to investigate  the

whole aspect as suggested by the original questioner?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to go into an

argument as to the definition of a strike. But if  the

Member   for  Anson  would  refer  to  the  Industrial

Disputes  Ordinance, a strike there is a  stoppage  of

work  by  the concerted action of a group of employees

who are organised in a lawfully constituted union. You

can  have  all kinds of strikes. You can call stoppage

of work by any name. But when you are talking about  a

strike  in this Assembly which makes the law,  we  are

talking about a strike in accordance with the law. The

strike at the People's Association is not a strike  in

accordance  with the law, for the simple  reason  that

there  is no union. There was no strike notice because

there is no union. 138 members decided to stop work in

support  of  17 members who were sacked. And  although

you  have ruled that this does not arise, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I might just touch on this point. 450 are  full-time   and   part-time   workers   of   the   People's

Association.  138 decided to stop work in  support  of

17.  What can we do, Mr Speaker, Sir? As I have said,

if we are going to have this Commission of Inquiry,  I

do  not  think the Commission should be set up on  the

reasons  for  the  stoppage, because the  stoppage  is

obvious.  They said the reason why they  stopped  work

was  that they wanted the 17 workers reinstated.  They

wanted  the  Action Committee of seven  who  called  a

meeting   in   defiance  of  authority  also   to   be

reinstated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain this to those who have not been

following the Press reports? it is a bit tedious,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. I met the seven people. They represented

themselves and 138 others. I cannot remember the exact

date.  We  recorded the proceedings. I said  to  them,

"Convey to the members of the Association whom you say

you represent that they have to be loyal to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government and not take sides with the Barisan

Sosialis,  and  in particular my former  Parliamentary

Secretary, the Member for Upper Serangoon, the  former

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Health,

the  Member  for Nee Soon, who were the  Chairman  and

member  respectively of the Selection Board whilst  in

actual  charge of recruiting. I said, "I do  not  care

what your personal relationships were, but we have the

right  to  expect  loyalty to the  Board  and  to  the

Government  that has to supervise the  expenditure  of

funds."  All this is fortunately on the record.  As  I

said to them at the time of the interview - and this was

also  recorded -   if  they gave  a  version  after  the

meeting  which  was different from what was  recorded,

then  I would play this over Radio Singapore to  prove

who  spoke  the truth. And as I have said,  they  kept

quiet  on what transpired at the meeting. They replied

to  me  and  said,  "Well, tell  the  workers  of  the

People's  Association yourself." I said,  "Cannot  you

tell  it  to them, that they have to be loyal  to  the

Board  and the Government, and not to individuals  who

may,   for  divers  reasons,  have  selected  you   or

recruited  you?" They said, "Call a meeting,  and  you

should  be  present  as Chairman to  tell  it  to  the

workers." And I did. I called a meeting, I think,  for

the  following  day. I am not sure. But the  following

day was a Saturday. Notices went out to all workers to

be  present.  Now  these 7 workers,  in  defiance  and

contrary  to what they had suggested to me,  called  a

meeting  of their own at the same time. We called  the

meeting for 1.00 p.m. at the City Hall Chamber of  all

the  450 workers for me to tell them that they  should

disengage themselves from political intriguing and in-fighting.  Otherwise they would be involved  and  they

would  get smacked down. These seven chaps, using  the

People's   Association's  channels  of  communication,

official  channels, said that there was a  meeting  at

the  People's Association H.Q. at 12.00 o'clock, using

my  name,  using the name of Mr Tan Chok Kian,  Chief

Executive  Officer, and said that they were  going  to

address  this meeting, and drew a crowd away from  the

City Chamber to their meeting. Sir, people who do that

sort



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



of thing, when I had given them the

courtesy  of an interview, had met them and  discussed

the  matter  with them, and had called  a  meeting  at

their  suggestion - it is on the record, on  the  tape - I

called  a  meeting and they called a contrary meeting.

And  they  said,  "Look at the  number  of  chaps  who

support us, who come to our meeting, and how few go to

your  meeting." Sir, 138 out of 450. We then  went  to

each  and every one and said, "Please explain why  you

did  not attend the meeting as officially called." And

many of them did. But they were tricked into attending

the contrary meeting. The matter was considered by the

Board of Management who decided to dismiss these seven

who  organised this meeting, to which they had  called

the  17  who  were already dismissed to  harangue  the

crowd  and  whip up feelings. I say this.  If  we  are

going  to  have  a Commission of Inquiry,  it  is  not

necessary  to  go  into the causes  of  the  so-called

strike,  because the reason is obvious. We sacked  the

17  because  of  their association  with  the  Barisan

Sosalis, because they actively used community  centres

and  instigated people against the Government. But  if

they go on with these acts of hooliganism and violence

and break windows, tables, chairs and telephones in my

own constituency and the Yan Kit Community Centre - they

took delight in dismantling the telephone and broke it

into pieces - then I say, let us have an inquiry to  see

who really moves these little pawns on the chessboard.

Is it -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Set up a Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Prime Minister, have you

completed your statement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am happy to receive any

suggestion  from any quarter. And I say,  if  that  is

what  they really want and if they persist in it, that

is  what will be done. I might add also that right  at

this moment the Board of Management will be meeting to

consider asking the Supreme Court for an injunction to

prevent  these  people whom we  know,  the  138,  from

entering   any  community  centre  or  besetting   any

community centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



They  are,  not  members of the People's  Association.

They  are  not  workers of it. They  have  broken  and

damaged  property.  We have been forbearing.  If  they

persist,  and  if they say they want to fight  it  out

constitutionally, then by all means let us go  through

the processes of law.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, the Prime Minister

has said quite a lot of things in his short blast. But

I  wonder if he will clarify whether, in fact, he  was

suggesting that withdrawal of labour by any  group  of

workers  who  are  unionised is  something  that  this

Government considers illegal?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is not a question of what the

Government considers illegal. It is illegal because it

is  not  in  accordance with the  laws  made  by  this

Legislative Assembly. If the Member for Thomson  wants

to legalise a strike by a group of workers who are not

organised  into a union, who have not got a Committee,

who  have  not got registered members, then I  say  to

him,  ask for leave to introduce a Bill which  can  be

referred  to a Select Committee, where they can  argue

why  any  stoppage  of  work  should  be  made  legal,

including  stoppages by members of this Assembly,  and

so  on and so forth. By all means let us be democratic

to  the point where even if we were cows people  would

say  how forbearing and how patient we are in the face

of the uttermost provocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is here to be made and unmade. I am saying

it  is  illegal  because it is the law  made  by  this

Assembly.  If  I  am  not mistaken,  I  think  certain

sections  of  it were, in point of fact, made  by  the

Member  for  Anson when he was the Chief Minister  and

leading the Government. If they want to unmake it  and

remake it, I say it is up to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, this has not occurred to

me. I just remember, Sir, that in view of our Standing

Orders, I should inform the House, having participated

in  these questions, that some members of the People's

Association  have consulted my office. I do  not  know

whether they have paid any fees, Sir, and I would like

the  House to know that, I have no instructions either

way on the subject of a Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  just  now the Prime Minister said  that  the

first  time  he  had a meeting with  the  seven-member

Committee he had a tape recording. Can I ask him  when

he  can let us have this tape recording and have  this

published in the newspapers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I said just now

that whenever Members of this House want to listen  to

this tape recording, I will let them have it. That  is

the true version of the recording. If it is necessary,

we  will set up a Commission of Inquiry and members of

the Commission can ascertain what we had discussed and

said as recorded on the tape.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, a good

deal  of light could be thrown on this problem if  the

Prime  Minister would supply the House with a list  of

employees of the People's Association, those on strike

and  those  not  on strike, and also  a  list  of  the

persons,  Assemblymen or otherwise, and  organisations

which introduced these employees.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question being, will the Prime

Minister do that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I will do whatever is in

the  best interests of everyone and whatever the House

wishes. As I want to point out, the people who  really

know  best  what  these matters  were  about  are  the

Chairman  of the Selection Committee, the  Member  for

Upper  Serangoon,  and  a  Committee  member  on  that

Selection Committee, the Member for Nee Soon. I  think

with their help I could compile that list.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I have been very lenient on

this question. If any Member wishes to pursue -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If any Member wishes to pursue

this  matter,  he should file a motion  or  crave  the

right  to speak on the Adjournment. Question  No.  2,

Mr David Marshall.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amending legislation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether  he  will consider introducing legislation  to

amend the Central Provident Fund Ordinance to enable a

contributor  to  withdraw the amount standing  to  his

credit  in the Fund, or part thereof, if he  has  been

unemployed for a period of 12 months or more.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the sole object  of  the  Central

Provident Fund Ordinance was to set up a fund to  make

provision for employees in their old age. The fund was

not   meant  to  assist  employees  who  have   become

unemployed. The contingency of unemployment  therefore

cannot  be  covered  by  a  savings  scheme  as   that

envisaged by the Central Provident Fund, and if it  is

used  to ameliorate the condition of members who  have

become  unemployed, then it will result in the  entire

purpose of the fund being defeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could we not assist

these  people?  Because if we do not,  they  will  not

reach old age to reap it. They will die of starvation.

Let  a  little humanity be introduced. These are their

complete  savings. I am sure, Sir, and I am personally

conscious that the Board has been sympathetic. But  it

has  to  work  within these very hard limits.  In  the

light  of  the  economic situation and the  employment

market, I do ask the Minister to consider that  it  is

appropriate  today to give the Board  the  discretion.

Would he consider that?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  anybody  is  going to  die  of  starvation,  as

claimed  by  the Member for Anson. In my opinion,  the

proper  way  to help the unemployed is not  to  fiddle

about with the Central Provident Fund, but to set up a

scheme of unemployment insurance. In order to do that,

however,  the support of the trade union  movement  is

necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You will have it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Since the Member for

Thomson is very keen on this thing, let me inform  him

and  other  Members of the Assembly that my colleague,

the  Minister  for Finance, has told  me  this.  At  a

number  of meetings held in December 1960, the  matter

was  brought  up  before certain trade union  leaders,

which  included the Member for Thomson, if I  may  say

so, and other big leaders of the trade union movement,

such  as  Mr  Lim Ching Siong, Mr Woodhull  and  Mr

Dominic  Puthucheary.  He proposed  to  them  that  an

unemployment insurance scheme be introduced  forthwith

on   a   tripartite  basis,  with  contributions  from

employers  and  employees,  and  with  the  Government

meeting all costs and liabilities of the fund for  the

first  year  of operation. The administration  of  the

Central    Provident    Fund   would    prepare    the

administrative and financial details of the operation.

These  trade  union  leaders,  however,  rejected  the

proposal. Under the proposed scheme, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  unemployed would be entitled to benefits of about

40 per cent of their working pay. The Finance Minister

brought up this proposal so that workers may feel less

anxiety   over  losing  jobs  through  redundancy   or

retrenchment.  One of the major causes  of  industrial

disputes has been the retrenchment of workers, and  an

unemployment  insurance scheme would help  to  improve

relations  between labour and management  by  removing

one of the major irritants.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, does the Minister

consider that the trade union leaders referred  to  by

him  truly  represent  the  trade  union  movement  of

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, the

trade  union  leaders referred to by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill will themselves have to answer this.  It  is

not for me to tell him.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the

information he has given, Sir. I am very happy  indeed

that there is such a scheme in mind. Having put it  to

the  trade union movement, would the Minister and  the

Government be good enough to put it to this House?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the Government, as the

Prime  Minister has said, is trying to  do  everything

possible and when the appropriate time comes, we  will

do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Minister has quite conveniently

disclosed only the part that is useful to him for  the

purposes  of whatever he has been doing. But I  wonder

if  the  Minister would be fair enough to  clarify  in

detail  why  these  trade union leaders  rejected  the

plan?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the question could be

worded in such a way as to ask the Minister whether he

will  table  a White Paper. I do not think this  House

can  be  detained  as long as that for  clarification.

Perhaps the Member for Thomson would like to ask for a

White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> All that I want to say is that if the

Government  wants it, we are prepared to disclose  the

facts to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, according to what the Minister  for

Labour has said, he is trying to put the blame on  the

trade  union leaders for the non-establishment of  the

unemployment  insurance scheme.  I  want  to  ask  him

whether,  when  this  policy was brought  up,  it  was

discussed  with the Parliamentary Secretaries  of  the

People's Action Party Government?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The Member for

Upper  Serangoon  asks  whether  the  blame  could  be

squarely  put at the feet of the trade union  leaders.

He  wants to know whether the allegations are true  or

otherwise. What I said earlier, Mr Speaker, that  the

negotiation conducted between the trade union  leaders -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably it is the fault

of   the  translation,  or  perhaps  it  is  not.  The

translator probably is not quick enough. But  I  think

the  question  was  whether or not  the  Parliamentary

Secretaries were consulted. Is that right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> And Assemblymen.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Whether the Parliamentary Secretaries

over  here - we hope we shall be in a year's time -  but

it  so happens that one of our ear-pieces has gone out

of  order. Can we get it repaired before the  Minister

pursues the matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Leader of the House may

adjourn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In reply to the

inform  him  that he is not yet versed  in  the  Malay

language.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The question really is: were the

Parliamentary  Secretaries and Government  Assemblymen

consulted in this matter? That is all.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The scheme

originated from the trade union movement. It concerned

trade  unions  and it was discussed with  trade  union

leaders  who were in the Party and who were  Political

Secretaries. So my answer is obvious and clear.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There appears to be some confusion

over  the answers. Earlier the Minister said  that  it

was  the Minister for Finance who initiated the  talks

with the trade union leaders. Now it would appear that

the  trade  union leaders in the P.A.P. started  them.

Who started them?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister is taking off his

coat. I hope it is because he is feeling hot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I explain, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is Question Time and if a

Minister  feels  that an explanation is  due,  then  I

think the proper time is when the Minister has an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



opportunity of making a Ministerial statement. At  the

end  of  Question Time, I will allow the Minister  for

Finance  or the Prime Minister to make a statement  on

the  matter. This is Question Time and I think we must

stop this question at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I want

to explain that I have given instructions to the Water

Engineer  to  allow water to run to  the  Assembly  in

order   that  the  air-conditioning  plant   can   run

properly.  That was the reason for my  taking  off  my

coat and not out of any disrespect to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Chair finds that

disrespectful.  The  Chair was wondering  whether  the

Table  was wide enough to separate the Prime  Minister

from the Opposition.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether  it  is his intention to introduce legislation

for  the unification of the trade union movement,  and

when.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

answer  is  very  simple  and  brief.  Now  that   the

leadership of the trade union movement is openly split

into  two camps - the nationalist T.U.C. on the one hand

and the pro-Communist S.A.T.U. on the other - each group

pursuing   objectives   diametrically   opposed,   the

Government  feels  that it is  not  feasible  at  this

juncture to introduce the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the unification plan of the P.A.P. is

an election pledge. I wonder whether the Minister will

say that his Government seeks to nullify this pledge.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> The Member for Thomson was

with  us  at  that time and I think he is fully  aware

that  by  unification of the trade union  movement  we

mean  the  unification of a non-Communist trade  union

movement for a non-Communist State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the workers are non-political. Could we not have a Trade Union Ordinance

and   an   unemployment  insurance  scheme  to   apply

impartially to all our workers irrespective  of  their

political views?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> The problem is not as

simple  as  the  Member for Anson  thinks.  I  am  not

arguing   about  the  workers'  inclination   to   any

political  Party. As far as the workers are concerned,

the  policy of the Government is pro-labour. I am  not

disputing that. But what we are disputing now  is  the

leadership which is trying to make use of and  exploit

the workers for its own political ends. That is why we

have to be very careful before we do such a thing.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister for

which  Party's  political ends is the exploitation  of

the civil servants carried out by the A.U.P.E.?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a different question, hut the

Minister may answer it if he so wishes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> In fairness to me, I think

the  Member for Cairnhill has got to prove  when  this

thing  happened and on what occasion. Then I will  be

quite prepared to answer him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Will the Minister agree with me that the

fact that there is a split in the trade union movement

today is the making of the P.A.P. Government?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a matter of Opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have not had a reply to my question.

Could  I enquire yet once more? Laws apply impartially

to  all human beings. Could we not have a Bill for the

unification of the trade union movement or to apply to

trade unions - an improvement of the present one - and  a

Bill   for  unemployment  insurance  without  bringing

politics in?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I think the answer is yes,

but as I have said earlier, the time will come when  I

will do that.

Prime  Minister just now has made the position in  the

People's Association quite clear, but I just  want  to

repeat exactly what he has already stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the time when the Member for Upper Serangoon

and  the  Member  for Nee Soon were the  Chairman  and

Committee  member  of the Selection Committee  of  the

People's  Association in charge of selecting  recruits

for  community  centre workers, team  leaders,  centre

to  ask  whether the staff of the People's Association

can  take  part in political activities  and,  if  so,

whether  this  practice is limited to members  of  the

to revise the regulations of the People's Association,

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If hon. Members ask supplementary

quite clear on the point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the reply

participate in politics but that in the

some  diabolical connection has been made between  the

because when the Member for Upper Serangoon and myself

were  in  the  P.A.P. and the workers of the  People's

Association  were also loyal to the P.A.P. that  they

were  allowed  to  participate in politics,  and  that

because  now we are not in the P.A.P. and the  workers

of the People's Association are not in the P.A.P., the

Board   of  the  People's  Association  has  therefore

decided to reconsider the position of the workers vis-a-vis political Parties. Since I have been referred -

Ahmad.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> The problem would not have

members  themselves  who,  as  the  Member  for  Anson

claims, supported the P.A.P. in the past, but who have

now  left, and so on. It is because they have  created

this  problem  that I think the Board has  got  to  do

something about it before it goes a bit too far.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Are we to understand that this body,

of  which  our  Prime Minister is  the  Chairman,  had

employees  who were all P.A.P. members and whose  only

political  activity was P.A.P. during  the  time  they

were paid out of public funds?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

claimed  by the strikers that the first 25 workers  of

the  People's  Association  were  originally  employed

through  the  recommendation of P.A.P.  Ministers  and

P.A.P. Assemblymen. Could the Minister concerned  tell

us

whether this is true?

If  the Member for Mountbatten cares to ask either the

they will be able to give her the answer.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

to  me,  I see that I still have to be heavily  relied

upon to answer his questions in this House although  I

am  now no more a Parliamentary Secretary. I would say

that  we  should call for a Commission of  Inquiry  to

look  into  these things, because if I were to  answer

the  question  for him, it would be far too  long  and

complicated.

that   he  should  take  over  my  responsibility   of

answering questions in this House from Members of  the

Assembly.  But if he is so keen about this  Commission

of  inquiry, I would suggest that he write in  stating

the  terms  of reference and so on, and  we  would  be

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> asked the Minister for Labour

(a) how many people were employed by the Government to

man the Community Centres where the

the  procedure adopted for the selection of these  new

employees  of  the People's Association;  (c)  whether

these  new  employees are employed on a  permanent  or

temporary  basis;  and (d) what is the  total  sum  of

money  spent  per  day  by  the  Government  for   the

employment of these new employees.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Havelock  wants  to  know  how  many  people  are

employed  by  the  Government  to  man  the  community

centres. The answer is none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community centres are not run by the Government,

as  everybody  knows,  but are  run  by  the  People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also refers to a strike of employees. The

real position is that there is no strike because these

persons are not members of any trade union. They  have

failed  to  report  for  duty and  have  thereby  been

considered to have vacated their posts. The  Board  of

the  People's  Association gave them every  chance  to

return  to work. Some of the former employees  refused

to do so, and their services with the Association have

thereby  been  terminated. There is no  difficulty  in

obtaining  replacements.  The  community  centres  are

manned mainly by voluntary workers: more than 1,000 in

all.  These  are  people living around  the  community

centres who want to see that the services provided  by

the  community  centres  are  made  available  to  the

public. Some of the voluntary workers have offered  to

do  full-time duty, and for this an honorarium  of  $4

per day is being paid. There are approximately 200  of

them,  and the total amount paid in honoraria  so  far

comes to $15,758. Recruitment of new workers will soon

be  started  and  the vacancies to the  posts  in  the

community    centres   will   be    filled    shortly.

Advertisements  in  the Press  will  be  inserted  and

invitations will be called for.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> From the replies we have had, it is

important  to ascertain what proportion of  these  new

employees  or  those  persons who have  received  this

$15,000 are P.A.P. members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

according  to what the Minister for Labour  has  said,

none  of  them is a member of the P.A.P. I ask whether

the  Minister knows that there is one community centre

in  Banda Street, the centre leader of which is on the

Committee of a P.A.P. branch.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

stated just now that it is not to my knowledge whether

they  are  members of the P.A.P. or not. It is  purely

the  voluntary  workers who have offered  to  do  this

service,   and  they  are  welcome,  and  the   normal

exercises have been gone through.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I thought when the Minister

stood  up  to  answer the previous question,  he  said

categorically "No". Now, it would appear that what  he

meant  by "No" is, "not to my knowledge". There  seems

to  me  to be quite a big difference in such different

answers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

given an appropriate answer whether he is a member  of

the  P.A.P. To my knowledge, I do not know whether the

man  is  a member of the P.A.P. or not, so the  answer

is: it is not to my knowledge.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there seems to be,

quite  obviously, a considerable amount of unhappiness

about  this organisation. Would the Minister  consider

appointing a Commission which would then give him  the

knowledge   lie  now  lacks  as  to  the   policy   of

employment,  the political aspects of the  employment,

and activities and dismissal of employees?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, only now do I

understand from the Minister for Finance that the very

person  referred to by the Member for Havelock is  the

person  that he himself, the Member for Havelock,  had

introduced, and he is not a voluntary worker.

things  to  be done, I suggest he puts in  a  term  of

reference also.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer, I think, is similar to the

previous  answer - that  the  Minister  is  willing   to

consider the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry if

cancelled for one or more of the following reasons for

1961:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) That the trade union has ceased to exist:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In the interests of the workmen in the

industry, trade or occupation with which the trade

union was connected:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) For wilful contravention after notice from the

Registrar  of  the provisions of the  Trade  Unions

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The likelihood of a trade union being used

against  the interests of workmen in the  industry,

trade or occupation with which the trade union  was

connected;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) That the constitution of the trade union or its

executive was unlawful; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) That the trade union was being used for

purposes  inconsistent with its registered  objects

and rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to (2) , no certificate of registration of

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin is really begging

the question. He takes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



for  granted that the truth has been ascertained, that

there  has been a decline in employment over the  past

four  years. This I would dispute. Perhaps the  Member

for  Tanglin would state on what basis he  arrived  at

his  conclusion.  Otherwise  this  question  must   be

treated  in the same manner as the familiar  question:

why did you beat your wife? Or even, did you beat your

wife with a big stick or a small stick?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  a  point  of explanation, since the  Minister  has

asked for verification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if the Minister has studied his own

Labour   Reports - the  Annual  Report  of  the   Labour

Department  for  1960,  page 4,  where  the  following

figures were given:



<pre>



 Workmen in Employment -

 In September



    1957                    123,000

    1958(8,000 less)        115,800

    1959(9,000 less)        106,800

    1960(1,000 less)        105,600



</pre>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for

Tanglin  says  that the official labour statistics  of

total  employment showed a decline, and he  refers  to

this  Report. If he does this, the answer could be  as

follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rather expected the Member for Tanglin to say that. If this is the evidence

on which he bases his conclusion, then it merely shows that one must be very careful in handling

statistics. Variations in employment figures collected by the Labour Department are often due

to the completeness which employers make in respect of returns. Sometimes the percentage of

employers making the returns is higher than at other times. So variations in figures collected

only indicate the thoroughness with which the returns have been collected. Also, there are

differences in definitions. The Labour Department statistics gives figures of employment of workmen

as defined in the Labour Code. Some time in the past, people such as trishaw riders and taxi-drivers had

been included in the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 174</b></font><br><br>



Labour statistics. Subsequently they were excluded; hence the decline in total employment figures  resulted.

This decline is, of course, quite illusory. Some Members may think it strange that the Minister for Labour

should publicly disparage the statistics collected by his Ministry. I done as properly as it should be. This

is because we inherited a defective system from the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Exchange it!



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> My colleague, the Finance Minister, who is a statistician by profession,

has repeatedly asked my Ministry to improve its system of collection of Statistics. Unfortunately,

Mr Speaker, there are many pressing and immediate matters which demand the attention of the staff

of the Department and it will be some time before we can effect improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, may I point out that if we were to use another set of data, we

might come to the conclusion that there has been an increase in total employment. For instance,

the Central Provident Fund provides figures of employment not only of labourers but all employees

liable to contribution. Their figures show a steady increase. But here again I am not going  to claim

that they prove an increase in total employment. The increase in the total number of contributors may

be due to improved coverage. Once again, I repeat, you have to be very careful in handling statistics.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I take it that the statistics the Minister gave to this House

but a few moments  ago are reliable - that there are 8,000 additional unemployed registered this year

and that the total is 53,000. I would ask the Minister whether this figure is in fact, the highest for

the last four years.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> The answer is that it is the highest number of people registered for jobs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the Minister has expressed utmost

contempt for the statistics in the document published by his Ministry, would he not consider scrapping

that Report?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member ought not to misinterpret what has

been  said  by  the Minister. I think the Minister said he disparaged.  He

did not express contempt.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir. I do not want

to debate with the Chair. But if you will just bear with me, Sir, from the

way  he expressed himself, it would appear that the statistics as provided

by  the  Report  were totally inaccurate, and in view of the  inaccuracy,.

would  he  not  consider scrapping altogether the  Report  of  the  Labour

Department henceforth so that the public and Members on this side  of  the

House would not be further misled?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a different question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of what the Minister has

said,  are  we on this side of the House henceforth no longer  to  regard

statistics published in official reports by the Department as reliable?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Nee Soon has suggested that it should be

scrapped. I do not know whether the Minister would like to make a comment

on that?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the statistics are reli

able, as far as the data are available.

<div align="center"><b>STRIKES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Minister for Labour what are the reasons

for the recent crop of strikes in Singapore, and what measures he proposes

to  take to promote harmonious relations between labour and management  to

ensure industrial peace.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards the first part of

the  question, during the last three months - August, September and October -

there were 37 strikes. The reasons for these strikes were as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 14 were over wage increases, overtime wages and conditions of

service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 8 were over retrenchment and dismissal of employees;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 3 were over collective agreements;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) 2 were over payment of higher commission rates;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) 2 were over recruitment of new workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) 1 was over the replacement of an existing worker;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) 1 was over an alleged anti-union attitude by the management;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) 1 was over alleged removal of the union's notice board;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) I was over the recognition of a trade union to represent daily-rated

(Number of registration certificates

cancelled and number of applications for

registration rejected)

workers in Government departments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) 1 was over an allegation by the union that the employer had compelled

workers  to sign a statement that they had started work on a  certain

date;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) 1 was over an allegation by the union that a member of the management

had used abusive words on an employee who is a member of the union;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) 1 was over the refusal of the management to grant 6 months no-pay

leave to a worker;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m) 1 was over allotment of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, the measures taken by the

Government in introducing the Industrial Relations Ordinance, under  which

the  Industrial  Arbitration Court was set up,  have  brought  about  some

measure  of  law  and order in the sphere of industrial relations  and  in

effecting Government's policy of ensuring industrial peace with justice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that the

Industrial Arbitration Court is not able to cope with the number of  cases

for  settlement  before  them?  Would he consider  establishing  a  second

Industrial Arbitration Court in order to expedite the settlement of  these

outstanding unsettled cases?



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I hope to do so, if the occasion arises, Mr Speaker.

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will

make  a  statement on the subject of the negotiations for a  Common  Market

with  the  Federation  of Malaya and whether the Government  will  table  a

Report dealing with the said negotiations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, .Sir, I do not

think it would be appropriate for me to make a statement on the details  of

the  course  along which negotiations between the Federation and  Singapore

Governments took place on the common market proposals. The reason  is  that

negotiations, while they have been suspended temporarily, are  expected  to

continue  at  the  appropriate time in future.  The  two  Governments  have

agreed  to  apply  to  the United Nations for a team  of  experts  to  make

recommendations both on the specific proposals of a common market  as  well

as on the general problem of co-ordination of economic policy and effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson is entitled to, and perhaps would be

satisfied  with, an analysis of the basic problems underlying  the  setting

up  of  a  pan-Malayan common market. I have informed  the  Assembly  on  a

previous occasion the nature of the general proposals which we made to  the

Federation  Government. To put the matter simply, we proposed that  a  list

of  goods  be agreed upon between the two Governments which will have  duty

free  movement  between the two territories but will be  liable  to  import

duties  if  they come from abroad. This list of goods would  include  those

which  are  produced in the two territories or which can be  advantageously

produced   in  them  in  the  future.  This  will  enable  us  to  preserve

substantially the free port status of Singapore while affording an  impetus

to  industrial expansion through having for our manufacturers and potential

manufacturers a large protected market in respect of a range of products.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the Federation, the proposals do not offer any

compensating advantages -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It appears that the statement is of some length. Am I

correct?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is of some length.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that event, two courses are open. If there is any state

ment  that  is  to  be made which is of inordinate length,  there  are  two

courses open to the Minister. Either he can say that he would publish  the

statement  in  Hansard, our Official Report, or say that he  would  make  a

ministerial statement at the end of Question Time. The idea, of course,  is

to  enable other questions to be dealt with as rapidly as possible. Perhaps

the  Minister  would like to make a ministerial statement  at  the  end  of

Question Time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the Member for Anson is agreeable, Mr Speaker,

Sir, perhaps I could give a written reply in Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged to the Finance Minister. A statement of

that character should be quietly and carefully studied. I am grateful  for

the  suggestion  of  the  publication. But could  I  ask  a  supplementary

question, Sir, on certain matters raised by the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member for Anson could have

it  both  ways. I stopped the Minister for Finance - he said a  few  things.

Once  it  has been decided that the whole statement - not only the part  not

delivered, but the whole statement - is to be published, that is the end  of

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the statement by the Minister for Finance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it would be appropriate for me to make a statement on the

details of the course along which negotiations between the

Federation  and  Singapore Governments took place  on  the  common  market

proposals. The reason is that negotiations, while they have been suspended

temporarily, are expected to continue at the appropriate time  in  future.

The  two Governments have agreed to apply to the United Nations for a team

of experts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>

to make recommendations both on the specific proposals of a common market

as well as on the general problem of co-ordination of economic policy and

effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson is entitled to, and perhaps would be

satisfied with, an analysis of the basic problems underlying the  setting

up  of  a  common  market.  I have informed the Assembly  on  a  previous

occasion   the  general  proposals  which  we  made  to  the   Federation Government. To put the matter simply, we proposed that a list of goods be

agreed  upon  between  the  two Governments which  will  have  duty  free

movement between the two territories but will be liable to import  duties

if  they  come from abroad. This list of goods would include those  which

are  produced  in  the  two territories or which  can  be  advantageously

produced in them. This will enable us to preserve substantially the  free

port  status  of  Singapore  while affording  an  impetus  to  industrial

expansion  through  a large protected market in respect  of  a  range  of

products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Federation's point of view, the proposal does not offer any

compensating  advantages  to  the  Federation  for  the  advantages   that

Singapore  would derive from it. Goods produced in the Federation,  except

for  hard soap, already enjoy duty free entry into Singapore. The proposed

common  market  would  confer  upon their manufacturers  little  advantage

beyond what they are already enjoying except perhaps that they would  then

in  Singapore  enjoy  a  protected market as well in  the  Federation.  Of

course,  this argument holds true only if Singapore refrains from imposing

import  duties  on goods we manufacture. There is also a  loss  of  import

duty  to  the  Federation Government on Singapore produced goods  entering

the  Federation. The Federation also feels that Singapore  with  its  free

port  status, with its excellent harbour and its strategic position across

ocean  world's shipping lines, would obtain a preponderant advantage  over

the  Federation.  Further in the Federation import duties  are  levied  on

some  materials entering manufacturing processes. The industries  affected

may  be  at a disadvantage in competing with similar industries  based  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because the Federation desired that some safeguards against the

competitive  power  of  Singapore industries should  be  introduced  that

difficult  problems arose which could not be settled so far  between  the

teams of officials discussing the problem. The Federation Government  for

itself would be happy to see a common market established which is  based

on  a  complete customs union. This would equalise once and for  all  the

comparative  production  of goods between the  two  territories  but  for

Singapore  to accept the solution would mean the abandonment  of  a  free

port  status,  a measure which cannot be contemplated now. The  foregoing

gives  the general background to the reasons why discussions between  the

officials of the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



Governments  have  reached  a  state  of  temporary  deadlock  and  the

appointment of a team of international experts is a measure which the  two

Governments have agreed upon to break this deadlock. It is my belief  that

it  is  not beyond the ingenuity of that of men to resolve these difficult

and  complex problems. My belief also is that these problems can be solved

if we regard the common market proposal from the broader perspective of  a

pan-Malayan outlook which can over-ride sectional interests. The long-term

advantages  are  real  and substantial to both territories  and  they  far

outweigh any trouble both territories may have to put up with in

making the immediate adjustments.



<br><br>Later -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I perhaps make a further comment on what was said in

regard  to the statement on the common market? I think hon. Members  would

like to see that statement as soon as possible. Therefore, if the Minister

will  table that statement, it can be gestetnered, and copies can be  made

available for the use of Members as soon as possible.

has  applied,  or  intends to apply, for membership in  any  form  of  the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to the first part of the

question is no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, I should like to say that at

this  stage  it  would  be  premature to indicate whether  the  Government

intends  to  apply  for  membership in any form of the  European  Economic

Community.  This is because the British Government had only on 9th  August

applied  formally  to  the  E.E.C. to open negotiations  with  a  view  to

acceding  to  the Treaty of Rome. I understand that such negotiations  are

complex and are likely to take some considerable time. Meanwhile the issue

is  still in doubt and there is no certainty that the United Kingdom  will

accede at the end of the negotiations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only if Britain becomes a member of the E.E.C. that the question of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's associate membership can be properly considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister indicate whether he is, in fact,

liaising with the Federation Government on this aspect of Singapore's

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister concede that the unofficial trade delega

tion of the Federation and Singapore in 1956 to Japan and China did

contribute materially to our economic welfare?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

think that is a matter for the particular

trade mission to establish. But I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



sure  whether I have not misunderstood the Member for Anson. My understand

ing  of his question is that he is asking for some form of permanent trade

representation  in these two countries. In my view, there is  very  little

that we would gain. Perhaps I could elaborate on this issue. In fact,  the

most  important  duty of any trade representation abroad is  to  help  the

country he is representing to increase its export trade, to make it easier

for  domestic industrialists and traders to sell to that country. That  is

basic.  All  foreign trade missions are there to advance and  promote  the

interests of their

domestic producers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are to inquire into the nature of our trade with the two

countries, namely, China and India, we will find that the goods  that  we

are  exporting to them are what you might call tropical raw materials  in

one  form  or the other. For instance, we exported to China in  1960  $73

million of crude rubber, $6 million worth of mineral fuels, and nearly $4

million  worth  of  animal and vegetable oils. They are not  manufactured

goods; they are not branded articles; and a trade mission cannot help  in

any  way.  The trade representative will not be able either to induce  or

persuade China to increase her imports of these goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with India. We exported in 1960 to India $36 million worth of

crude rubber, $11 million worth of oil seeds,

$7�  million worth of vegetable and animal oils, and $4 million worth  of

petroleum.  On  the other hand, we import from these two  countries  very

substantial  amounts  of  consumer goods - textiles  principally - a  certain

amount of foodstuffs, fruits and vegetables and, by and large, it is  not

the responsibility of

trade representatives in either of these countries to promote the exports

of  other countries to ours. That is something which is the duty of  that

country to do. So, as I have said, going through the nature of our  trade

with  these  two  countries, very little is to be gained at  the  present

moment  by  stationing  permanent  trade  missions  there.  It  is  quite

different  with Indonesia for whom we are the supply base, so  to  speak,

for substantial parts of the Indonesian Archipelago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



Moreover, in some instances, our merchants and shippers are meeting with

considerable  difficulty. Therefore, the need for  a  trade  mission  in

Indonesia is a very urgent one.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I appreciate what the Minister indicates as regards the

reasons  for not establishing missions, Sir. But I have reason to believe

that  we  could,  with  little difficulty, induce at  least  one  of  the

governments  concerned to import from us at least as much  as  we  import

from  them.  Would  he not consider at least sending out  a  small  trade

delegation  for a short period to both these capitals to investigate  the

potential?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will bear that proposal in mind, Mr Speaker, Sir.

the question on the Order Paper to the best of his knowledge, I suppose.  I

do  not think we can pursue it further. If other names occur to any Members

as  having  been  left  out,  I  think  they  ought  to  write  in  to  the

is not satisfactory, then, of course, it can come back to the Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  not the intention to convert the community centre in Bouna Vista  Road

into  an outdoor dispensary, because there is already a Government outdoor

dispensary,  a  quarter of a mile away at the 5� m.s Pasir  Panjang  Road,

which is sufficient for the needs of the residents in the area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, has the Minister taken

notice that at the said place the clinic at Pasir Panjang Road is affected

by  a  strike?  Why  does  the Government not want  to  turn  it  into  a

dispensary?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member repeat the question slowly so that we

can get another interpretation of it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why is the community centre in Bouna

Vista  Road  not used now, whereas there is a clinic at the 5� m.s.  Pasir

Panjang Road? Why is it not made use of?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a maternity and child welfare

centre in the same compound of the Bouna Vista Road Community Centre. That

serves  a  very useful purpose. It is in that maternity and child  welfare

clinic  that the needs of mothers, babies, toddlers and so on who live  in

the area are attended to. Close by is this outdoor dispensary. It occupies

a  shophouse  and serves the medical needs of the people who live  in  the

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Bouna Vista Road Community Centre

has  never  been successful as a community centre. I think it is  situated

too far away from the main road and the centre of population in that area,

and  consideration is being given to turn this community  centre  into  an

approved  school.  In fact, we have an international expert  here  looking

into the whole question and in time I think we should get his report.

<div align="center"><b>SUMMONSES FOR OVERLOADING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs how many summonses

for overloading with passengers were issued to taxi drivers and to

Singapore Traction Company bus conductors respectively between 1st January

and 31st August, 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 428 summonses for overloading pas

sengers  were  issued to taxi drivers between the period 1st  January  and

31st  August, 1961. No summonses were issued to Singapore Traction Company

bus conductors during the same period, or, for that matter, conductors  of

Chinese bus companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action was taken against taxi drivers because, in their case, they tout

for  extra passengers, whereas buses do not. Circumstances regarding buses

are  quite  different. However, Government is considering the  regulations

governing the overloading of passenger buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions were held with the various Chinese bus companies and the

S.T.C. as well as the drivers and conductors some time back with a view  to

seeking  their co-operation and safety-first measures. At the  talks  given

to  the conductors and drivers, one of their complaints was that they  were

unable  to  prevent the overloading of passengers single-handed,  and  that

more  often than not they were sandwiched inside the bus and unable to  get

to  the  door to control would-be bus passengers surging in and hanging  on

to the rails of the door. The conductors also complained of being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



threatened by hooligans whenever they tried to prevent or turn them  away.

The  only  solution  to  this would be for the  buses  to  have  hydraulic

controlled  doors which are operated by the drivers. This would  not  only

prevent overcrowding but fatal accidents of people who either try to board

or alight from a moving bus.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why is it that taxi drivers cannot enjoy

the  same  privilege  as  that accorded to bus  conductors  of  not  being

prosecuted for overloading?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, evidently the last speaker did not

understand  my  answer. I have already given my answer to his  question.  I

have  explained the circumstances of the taxis and the buses. In  the  case

of  the  taxis, the driver touts for passengers. He is in full control  not

to  overload  his  taxi.  But  in the case of  bus  conductors,  they  are,

according to them, not in a position to control.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> The Minister for Home Affairs said that

the   bus  conductors  could  not  control  passengers  because  they  were

threatened  by  hooligans.  Would that not  similarly  apply  to  the  taxi

drivers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I have not yet heard from any of the taxi drivers that

that was the reason why they carried extra passengers.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Would the Minister for Home Affairs inform

this  House that should the taxi drivers so inform him, he would reconsider

the position?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, great pressure of work and

the  length  of  time required to do it do not make it  possible  to  start

compiling  the  records  in  respect of  the  qualification  of  Singapore-citizenship  under  country of origin and under the different  sections  of

the  Ordinance.  However, during the initial period of  registration,  that

is,  between  1st November, 1957, and 28th February, 1958, 325,020  persons

were registered as Singapore citizens under

section  8  (2), (3), (9), and (13) of the Singapore Citizenship Ordinance.

Between  the  period  1st  March, 1958, and 31st  December,  1959,  another

13,650  persons were registered under the same section. Between the  period

were  born  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  those  who  have  the  8-year

residential  qualification, wives and children of Singapore citizens.  From

5th  April,  1960,  Commonwealth citizens and those who were  born  in  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to what I

know, in 1959 the grant-in-aid was estimated at $3 million. The budget  for

this  year and for 1960 is only $1 million each. Can the Minister tell this

House  the  reasons  for  the  reduction  in  grant-in-aid,  and  has   the

Government any intention of increasing the grant-in-aid?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I have to take a bit of time

to  try  and  trace  the  relevant page in the Four-Year  Development  Plan

regarding the amount of capital grant-in-aid allotted for Government  aided

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 112 of our Four-Year Development Plan 1961-64 shows Table 9.4,

Education  Development  Programme Projects 11, Capital  Grants-in-Aid  1961

shows  a total of $3,073,230. But thereafter 1962-63-64 is $1 million  per

annum.  The  figure for 1961 actually includes previous grants  which  have been accumulated together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the 1961 Estimates, I think I made an answer to the

Member  for  Tanglin  on this point, which is that this Government,  unlike

previous  governments, is assuming full responsibility to  provide  schools

for all the language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



streams  and not, as in the past, for the English stream alone. Therefore,

in  this  building programme, we would have to build 19  new  schools  per

annum.  We  cannot, at the same time, afford to assist  aided  schools  by

giving dollar for dollar for an unlimited sum. We cannot spend money  both

ways to build Government schools for all language streams and, at the next

moment,  assist  aided  schools dollar for dollar  to  the  tune  of  many

millions. That is why it is very necessary just to limit it to $1  million

per annum so long as we are building 19 new schools per year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister is aware that

many  schools  cannot  get capital grants, because  these  schools  cannot

fulfil  the  requirements laid down by the Grant-in-Aid Regulations,  i.e.

dollar  for  dollar. So could the Minister inform this House  whether  the

Government  is  prepared to give unconditionally grant-in-aid  or  capital

grants to schools, provided the schools really need them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Changi, who used to

assist  me  in  the  Ministry of Education, is fortunately  aware  of  the

difficulties which the Ministry of Education has to contend  with  in  the

matter  of  grant-in-aid.  It is true that the  Grant-in-Aid  Regulations,

1957,  do  state that no grant-in-aid shall be approved in  respect  of  a

school building unless the manager or trustees of the school hold a  legal

and  unencumbered  title  to the land on which  the  school  premises  are

situated,  for  a period to be approved by the Director of  Education.  So

most  of the difficulties have arisen in that aided schools do not have  a

legal unencumbered title to the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the moment - in fact, we have for some time now been trying to

amend the Grant-in-Aid Regulations by making them less stringent. But I do

not  think  it will be possible to agree to the suggestion put forward  by

the  Member  for Changi that the grant-in-aid should be given without  any

conditions. I hope to be able to state in the near future that the present

regulations would be somewhat relaxed so that we can get on with assisting

the smaller rural schools which I have in mind.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): With regard to the reply of the Minister

for  Education,  does  the Minister pay attention to  the  fact  that  this

development has disregarded the aided schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  is  just  labouring the question. I have explained that  the  present

Government wants to shoulder full responsibility in regard to education for

all language streams. Therefore, it has decided to build 19 schools a year.

This  will  mean  that as time goes on, everyone can  find  a  place  in  a

Government school. But unfortunately if in the past aided schools have been

going  on without any assistance, we cannot solve their problem within  one

or  two years. We can only do so when schools are available for everyone to

move in. Therefore, since we have already indicated that we shall set aside

$1 million to assist aided schools, mainly the rural aided schools, then  I

think  we have done exceedingly well, provided we revise the present Grant-in-Aid Regulations and relax them somewhat, as suggested by the Member  for

Changi. The intention of the Government is clear.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> Mr Speaker,

could  the  Minister  confirm  that the  Sekolah  Ra'ayat  is  totally  not

entitled to grant-in-aid to build school buildings?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is another question. Perhaps the Minister is prepared to

answer now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There is a form of aid for Sekolah Ra'ayat, which are

really  religious  schools. Since Singapore is  a  secular  State,  we  are

concentrating  on aid for non-religious schools, but giving  also  a  small

form  of  aid  to religious schools. That I believe has been  found  to  be

adequate for the time being, so that the question of an increase in capital

aid  for  religious schools is not at the moment receiving serious consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Does the Minister not think that the

aided  schools are helping the Ministry in solving the problem of vacancies

for students?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> If I may assist, Sir, I think the Member for Choa Chu

Kang is more or less hinting that perhaps the Ministry of Education is  not

prepared  to  assist aided schools, because aided schools do not  help  the

education policy of the State. He is certainly going far from the  subject,

Sir.  But  I  would just say that the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  is  simply

probably justifying his existence in the Assembly by putting questions when

they  are really unnecessary. I have, in fact, explained to the Member  for

Tanglin  the place of aided schools in our educational system,  because  he

has always been a great protagonist of the part which aided schools

have  played in the educational system of Singapore. I have already  acknow

ledged  their importance in our educational system during the  period  when

Government  was not prepared to shoulder full responsibility for education.

But when the Government has decided that it would take on the education  of

all  its  children  and  give them more and more education  in  fact,  then

naturally  the  role of aided schools will be less and less  as  Government

schools get more and more. Therefore, we cannot build more and more schools

and  bring  them into the Government stream and at the same  time  keep  on

pumping money into the aided schools. You cannot have it both

ways.  Therefore, if we build 19 schools a year to house all  streams,  we

can only afford $1 million as capital aid for aided schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister

tell  this  House the reasons in respect of those whose applications  were

rejected on political grounds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer is yes. When a security objection is re

ceived by the Ministry of Education from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the

matter  is  reviewed. Sometimes the security objections are over-ruled  by

the  Ministry, and sometimes we accept the objections and therefore reject

the applications of these teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Does the Minister for Education know

<div align="center"><b>(Four-Year system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b> asked the Minister for Education what consideration was given to Government's proposal to introduce the 4-year system for

Chinese secondary education by the Education Advisory Council before June, 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is necessary, first of all to

state that there is no such thing as a"4-year system for Chinese secondary

education". It is either a 3-3 or 4-2 system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After publication of the 1955 All-Party Report on Chinese Education

whereby  the  principle of equal treatment for four language  streams  was

first announced, the officials of the Ministry of Education started  work

on  syllabuses together with the assistance of some Chinese principals and

teachers  to  introduce the 4-2 system in. place  of  the  3-3  system  to

achieve  the  desired  basis  of equal treatment.  These  syllabuses  were

published  in  1958  and 1959. On 1st November, 1958, all  principals  of

Chinese  secondary  schools were consulted regarding the  proposed  change

over.  Subsequently,  on  28th February, 1959, schools  were  advised  by

circular  No. Ed. 2195/58/18 announcing a gradual phasing of  the  change-over  so  that those admitted to secondary schools in 1958 would take  the

first  Government Secondary 4 examination in 1961 (this year),  but  those

admitted  in  1956 and 1957 on the 3-3 system would take  the  Government

Senior  Middle 3 examination in 1961 (this year) and failures  would  take

the last examination in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4-2 system was already in progress four months before the P.A.P.

Government  took  office  and  nine months before  the  first  Educational

Advisory Council was appointed in November 1959. As this Government  fully

supports the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



principle of equal treatment underlying the 4-2 system and as there  was

no  public  demand for a review of the system until June this year,  the

fateful  month  with  the  "parting of  ways"  mentioned  by  the  Prime

Minister,  there was no occasion to refer the matter to the  Educational

Advisory Council prior to this date. But arising out of the controversy,

reference  to the Educational Advisory Council was made on 24th  August, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be added that on 5th October, 1961, the 4-2 system for the

Chinese  secondary  stream  was amicably  resolved  with  the  Singapore

Chinese Schools Committee-Teacher Association, which is regarded as  the

highest  educational  body  on  Chinese  education  in  Singapore.  This

agreement was announced in a joint statement and published in the  local

newspapers the following day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am greatly surprised to hear

the  Minister  say  here today that there is no such thing  as  a  4-year

system  in Chinese education and that the system, in actual fact, is  the

4-2  system.  Perhaps the Minister would like to look up his  own  speech

made  in  this House in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister

last  year  when he mentioned that, as from the beginning of  this  year,

the  Chinese  school  system would be changed  into  a  4-year  secondary

system.  I would like him to refresh his own memory. Or if his memory  is

that bad, he might look up the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members must realise that this is Question Time. I

have  allowed  the  Member to carry on up till  now.  He  can  only  ask

supplementary

questions and not enter into a debate. What is the question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir. The question

is  whether  there is or there is not such a thing as the 4-year  system

which the Minister mentioned, and whether he would confirm that when  he

said  so  last year in this House, it was a policy statement? Which  one

are we to believe? The previous one or this one?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Member for Nee Soon

will  quote  the  relevant passage in Hansard that he is talking  about.

Another  thing  is  that if he will only refer to  the  joint  statement

issued  by  the  Committee/  Teachers' Association  and  myself  on  5th

October,  1961, he will find that it was stated very clearly there  that

the  Government accepted 6 years of secondary education, 4 years  lower,

and  2 years upper secondary. The 2 years is not something very high  up

in  the  clouds.  The  2  years is secondary education.  So  unless  his

mathematics is wrong, perhaps the public would like to know how he finds

that four and two is still four?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I crave the indulgence of

this House for me to go to the Library and produce the relevant Hansard?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That illustrates my point. Things like that cannot

be  done during Question Time. This point apparently will excite a great

deal  of  debate and I would suggest that the hon. Member for  Nee  Soon

files a motion on the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, according to the figures

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



it  is 30,650, and for the Chinese stream 20,174. May I ask him whether he

has  taken notice of the fact that the number of Primary I pupils  in  1962

in  respect  of the English stream has increased by 5,000 as compared  with

the  number of Primary I pupils in 1961; whereas in respect of the  Chinese

stream,  there has been a reduction of 349 pupils? What is the reason  for

this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 think there is a general answer

coming  from  my  friends in reply to the question put by  the  Member  for

Havelock. What is the reason for the increased number of registrations  for

English  schools compared with Chinese schools? In my reply I  stated  that

it  was  the  choice of parents. If the Member for Havelock would  like  to

have  an  answer, perhaps he would contact the 55,000 parents in  Singapore

and ask them why they did this. Surely it is their choice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask the Minister whether

he  has taken notice of the fact that many parents of pupils wanted to  get

enrolment  for  their children in Chinese schools, but that there  were  no

vacancies. They had been forced to go to English schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The question put forward by 'the Member for Choa Chu

Kang,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is a vicious one. It is not true that parents  did

not go to register their children in Chinese schools because there were  no

places,  because  every  primary school, whatever  the  language  media  of

instruction,  was more or less a registration centre. It was  left  to  the

parents  themselves  to choose which language media  they  wished  to  have

their children registered for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I have heard

the  reply given by the Minister just now to the effect that because there

were fewer number of Chinese schools, therefore the choice depended on the

parents  where  they wished to send their children. I  want  to  quote  an

example. In my constituency there is a Chinese Primary School by the  name

of  Hang  Siang School. The number of new pupils enrolled there  was  117.

Because there was no vacancy there, the parents turned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



to  other schools. Many joined English schools instead. But according  to

my  understanding, that school has already applied for an extension of the

school   building,  but  it  has  not  received  any  approval  from   the

authorities concerned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister aware of that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I could explain, Sir, that the inference started by

the Member for Choa Chu Kang and carried on by the Member for Toa Payoh is

that, because there was no place in the Chinese schools, the parents  were

therefore seduced to go to the English schools. Every school is allowed to

register pupils. It is true that there is a limitation in every school  to

the number it can take. I mean a school does not just open and take in all

Primary I pupils. Each school would indicate whether it could take in  40,

400  or 4,000 pupils. As far as possible, every primary school should have

a number of different standards to give it some balance, but it is left to

parents to register. If, for example, the school could take in 100 pupils,

it  might  register  150 pupils, but the remaining  50  pupils  would  be

offered  places in a Chinese school if that is what the parents want.  But

if  parents choose to have their children registered in an English school,

well,  it is only fair that they are offered places in an English  school.

So  the  determinant factor lies with the parents. Members on the opposite

Benches,  including the Front Bench, are aware that many Chinese  families

do send their children one-half to English schools and one-half to Chinese

schools. Let us face it. That is the composition in which the schools  are

at present.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Would the Minister kindly tell us, in view of his

policy of equal treatment for the four streams of education, why he  just

picks  out  one example? There is not a single Chinese Primary School  in

Queenstown,  in which there is a huge population and in which  there  are

round about 9 or 10 English schools?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a different question. The Member for Queenstown will

have  to give notice of that question if he wishes to pursue it. Mr  Ong

But  unfortunately  no agreement was reached. However, the  Government  is

always  ready to negotiate and discuss this matter. It is hoped that  this

problem will be solved in the coming year.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Before I invite supplementary questions, perhaps I

had  better  indicate to hon. Members that it is my intention now  to  cut

down  supplementaries  as much as possible. We have  58  questions  to  go

through  today, and I might remind hon. Members that questions are  merely

meant to obtain information or to press for action. I have been lenient up

to  now with supplementary questions, but I intend to try to and at  least

progress much faster than we have been doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are on questions 28 and 29. Any supplementary questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We understand from the Minister that there were two

sittings of this Committee on negotiation with the Nanyang University  last

year.  This  is an unhappy position and an unhealthy one. I would  ask  the

Minister  whether he would consider making an earnest and urgent effort  to

reopen these negotiations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was indicated in the speech of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara on 31st October, 1961, that the Government  is

always  ready  to negotiate and discuss the matter and that we  have  hopes

that  this problem will be solved in the coming year. I think with that  as

an  expression  of  hope, something will eventuate to the satisfaction  not

only  of  the Member for Anson but also of the taxpayers and the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the conditions laid down by

the  Government  is  that  it  will only give financial  aid  to  Singapore

citizens  plus  15  per  cent of the Federation citizens.  But  during  the

election, the P.A.P. promised to give financial aid -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is now entering into a debate and I intend being

very strict about these matters. If the hon. Member wishes to enter into  a

debate as to what actual grant ought to





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



be  made,  then  let him file notice of motion. What is the  supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, what I want to know is this : where is

the financial aid which the Government promised to give in 1959 during the

election?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer to the question of the Member for Changi

is this. We will give aid subject to reorganisation according to the recom

mendations of the Nanyang University Review Committee's Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the former Parliament

ary  Secretary to the Minister for Culture and the Political Secretary  to

the  Prime  Minister disclosed in a Singapore newspaper that  the  Liaison

Committee  of  the  University and the Government  would  soon  convene  a

meeting.  May I ask the Minister when this meeting will be convened?  What

steps  will the Government take to have this meeting convened? The earlier

the  meeting is convened, the better. May I also ask whether the  Minister

will accept the recommendations of Nanyang University Old Boys Association

as a basis for negotiation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It looks as if my reply to the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  will  have  to be again to say that the Government is  prepared  to

negotiate  this  matter and that we have hopes it can be  solved  in  the

coming year.

<div align="center"><b>RECOGNITION OF NANYANG UNIVERSITY DEGREES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. <b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b> asked the Minister for Education when the Government

intends to recognise the degrees of Nanyang University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, the Government has already given con

ditional  recognition to the graduates of Nanyang University, subject  to

interview  and approval by the Public Service Commission. Such graduates,

whether  in  Government service or Government aided  schools,  are  given

salaries at par with Pass graduates of the University of Malaya and other

recognised universities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conditional recognition of Nanyang University degrees pending re

organisation in accordance with the general principles of the  Nanyang  University Review Committee's Report was announced in my policy statement on 10th February, 1960, vide Hansard Vol.

12, No. 3, column 143.





<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is willing to recognise the degrees of Nanyang University. Is it because its academic standard

is lower than that of the University of Malaya?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Government gave conditional recognition to Nanyang

University  degrees despite the fact that its academic standards  were  not

considered  satisfactory. That is why the Government feels that  before  it

is   prepared  to  give  financial  aid,  Nanyang  University   should   be

reorganised  in  accordance with the principles enunciated in  the  Nanyang

University Review Committee's Report.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. <b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how many

graduates of Nanyang University who graduated in the second batch  in  1960

are  now employed as teachers in Government schools and in Government-aided

schools;  and (b) of these, how many are still being paid the salary  of  a

teacher with middle-school qualification, and why?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Of the second batch of Nanyang University graduates, 99 are in

teaching service of whom



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 24 are employed in Government schools, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 75 in Government-aided schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Of these, four are still being paid the salary of a teacher with

Government Senior Middle III



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



qualification for the following reasons:-





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) As only those who teach in secondary schools can qualify for

graduate  pay, three out of the four do not qualify for  graduate

pay  because  they  are teaching in primary schools.  All  three,

however, have applied to the Public Service Commission for  consi

deration as graduate teachers, but only one has since been  found

suitable  for appointment. This person will be paid a  graduate's

salary - she happens to be a woman - if she can find a vacancy  in  a

secondary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Although the fourth person happens to be teaching in a

secondary  school, she is not paid a graduate's  salary,  because

she  has not submitted her application for consideration  by  the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these Nanyang University graduates

draw  the  same  salary as that drawn by teachers with only Middle  School

qualification. Does that mean equal treatment to all streams of education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Evidently, Mr Speaker, my answer to the previous

question  was not listened to. Or if it was listened to, it is a  question

which he has put forward rather automatically.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister then refer to the previous answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes. The previous answer given to the Member for

Changi -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am trying to save the time of the Assembly. Perhaps

the  Member for Changi will read the answer when it is printed. Any  other

supplementary question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask the Minister how many Uni

teachers' pay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the Member for Havelock asks whether the

Minister  for Education could give the number of graduates who are teaching

in primary schools but receiving the salary of a teacher with Senior Middle

III qualification. I would answer that question by saying that I would like

notice  of  the question because it has no bearing with Nanyang  University

graduates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask the Minister whether he is

aware  that  the second batch of University graduates have been interviewed

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of department with Mandarin as medium of instruction)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. <b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> asked the Minister for Education whether consi

deration will be given to the setting up

of  a department in the Singapore Polytechnic using Mandarin as a medium of

instruction to cater for students from the Chinese stream of education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, after the Polytechnic was reorganised in

August  1959, it decided to modify its entry qualifications to the  various

courses  so  that the Polytechnic would be open to graduates  from  Chinese

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are no less than 345 students from the Chinese stream

in the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the Member for Havelock that there are altogether

31  courses being taught in the Polytechnic, requiring a total of 71  full-time  staff  and  96  part-time staff. In view  of  the  magnitude  of  the

organisation involved and the fact that the Polytechnic has barely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



settled  down,  setting  up a Chinese Department in  the  Polytechnic  is

difficult and impracticable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask the Minister, if there are

some  people who are keen on educational matters and who want  to  donate

freely towards this course, whether he will permit such action?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> If according to the Member for Havelock there are

people who want to come forward with money to set up a Polytechnic, I  am

sure the Government will be prepared to consider the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to my personal understanding,

there  are people who are devoted to educational matters and who want  to

donate towards this public educational course. They have presented  their

case  to  the Minister but it has been refused. Will the Minister confirm

whether this is true?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the Member for Havelock is probably thinking

of  a  proposal which was put forward by certain individuals to  start  a

Singapore  College, and I do not think it was purely a  Polytechnic.  The

sponsors  did see me quite some time ago and I indicated to them  that  I

would  prefer that the matter be deferred until such time as the  Nanyang

University  reorganisation  was put into effect.  So  since  the  Nanyang

University  has not yet been reorganised, it may be said that the  matter

is just postponed sine die.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, may I put the question to the Minister

for Education clearly? I am not referring to the Singapore College. I  am

referring  to a group of educationists who want 'to convert  the  Chinese

High School into a Chinese stream polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Evidently, Mr Speaker, I gave the Member for Have

lock  more credit than he deserves. There has been no official application

put  to this Ministry. Perhaps individuals have made Press statements  and

so on and so forth. I do not suppose the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



should  take cognizance of what he reads in the newspapers. If people  are

really  interested, they should put forward the matter in writing together

with  all relevant facts and figures. So if the Member for Havelock refers

to certain newspaper reports, statements and so on, then I am afraid that,

officially, I am not aware of it.

<div align="center"><b>COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EFFECTS OF SIX-DAY WEEK</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will

appoint  an  independent  Committee of Inquiry  to  investigate  into  the

effects, both direct and indirect, of the compulsory full six-day week  in

Singapore's primary schools, especially in regard to the welfare of  these

school  children,  and  to make recommendations  for  its  continuance  or

discontinuance with effect from January, 1962.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Ministry of Education is at present in the midst

of  discussions with the Malay Teachers' Union, the Chinese Middle  School

Teachers'  Association, and the Singapore Teachers' Union  for  a  revised

version  of  the six-day week for 1962. Arising out of these  discussions,

the  question  whether  or  not to appoint a Committee  of  Inquiry  or  a

Commission of Inquiry will be decided.





<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> This matter does not affect teachers only. Would the

Minister  take cognizance of the widespread unhappiness indicated  on  the

part of parents on behalf of their children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Do I take it, Mr Speaker, that the Member for Anson

speaks on behalf of parents in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He will be a parent!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Fortunately, Sir, we do not always have to have the

qualifications of those whose brief we seek to press. May I have  a  reply,

Sir? I know many parents are very unhappy, and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



is  only fair that they should receive some assurance which would assuage

their  anxiety - that  their representations would  be  given  earnest  and

honest considerations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I do feel that in a matter like this, discussions

which  have  taken  place  between the Ministry  and  representatives  of

Teachers'  unions  way  back  to April 1961 would  be  a  more  effective

machinery,  and  if  necessary even refer the matter to  the  Educational

Advisory  Council. So I do think that it is quite possible  to  say  that

some parents are unhappy, just as some teachers are unhappy about the six-day  week.  But it would be quite a sweeping statement to say  that  many

parents are unhappy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -





<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I hope she is a parent!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister

would  give  his  consideration to this: that as there are Parent-Teacher

Associations  existing,  they provide a good channel  through  which  the

Minister could find out the feelings of parents. And probably the Parent-Teacher Associations could elect a representative to make representations

to this Committee that the Minister is going to appoint, and therefore he

would, in effect, be having parents' opinions too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As an elected Assemblyman and a Minister, I receive

lots  of  letter from various sources and, of course, I shall  always  be

available  to  receive memoranda, be they from some of the Parent-Teacher

Associations   in   Singapore.  But  there  are  so  few   Parent-Teacher

Associations in schools. They are found in a few English schools. But  if

they  care  to get down to submitting a memorandum putting forward  their

views,  I shall be very pleased to read it and absorb anything worthwhile

for consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Minister looks very .tired and I do not want to tax

him  any more than is necessary. But I wonder whether he is in a position

to confirm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



that  it is, in fact, the Government's intention to make the six-day  week

into something like a 5�-day week.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It may be a top secret!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I wish to say that I

am  far  from  being tired because I do not have nocturnal meetings  like

the Member for Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated that whether or not we shall form a Committee

of  inquiry  or  a  Commission of Inquiry as proposed by  the  Member  for

Tanglin  is a matter which we will take up after discussion with teachers'

unions.  It will be a revised version of the six-day week in that teaching

load  of  teachers  would  be somewhat reduced.  Therefore,  it  means  an

increase  in the number of teachers per school, by improving the  staffing

quota, and it will, of course, mean an increase in the Budget.

<div align="center"><b>TOA PAYOH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Resettlement of squatters)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. <b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b> asked the Minister for National Development what

is the policy of the Government towards the memoranda submitted by the Mem

ber for Toa Payoh and by the Rural People's Association on the question of

resettlement of the 25,000 squatters in the Toa Payoh Area affected by the

Housing  Scheme,  and  whether  he  will  meet  representatives  of  these

squatters and the Assemblyman concerned to settle the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the present scheme for resettlement provides for four alternatives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Housing Board accommodation will be given to those who are sub-tenants;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Monetary compensation to those who make their own arrangements;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A basic house in the suburban area with about 10,000 square feet of

land  for  those  who  do not depend entirely on  agriculture  for  a

livelihood;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Full compensation for all improvements on the land plus an

agricultural  plot  of  about 2 acres with a basic  house  for  those

farmers who depend on agriculture for their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rates of compensation have been kept in constant review and amend

ed  from  time to time. They have been applied to more than 10,000 persons

affected by the resettlement in the past five years. The Government  fully

appreciates  that  no  one  who is affected by resettlement  likes  to  be

shifted  out of his house or home. Neither is it possible for  any  scheme

for compensation to be absolutely satisfactory to all concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present rates are considered to be reasonable, and will be applied

to  all  cases  of resettlement. However, in specific cases  of  hardship,

other forms of assistance may be granted. But it is not intended that  the

whole  framework of the present resettlement scheme should be  changed  to

suit a few such cases. It must be pointed out that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



compensation  is a ex-gratia payment made to settlers who  have  no  legal

right  to  the land they occupy. The Government has given every  assistance

to  those  affected  by resettlement in order to avoid hardship.  For  this

reason,  development of the Toa Payoh area is planned  in  stages  so  that

only  a  limited number of families are moved at one time, and resettlement

of  people affected will be a gradual process extending over five to  seven

years.  It  is  not anticipated that all the people of that  area  will  be

affected,  and  hence  the  figure of 25,000 quoted  is  misleading.  Every

measure  will  be taken to ensure that as little hardship  as  possible  is

caused  to the settlers. If the occasion arises, my Parliamentary Secretary

and  I  will  meet these squatters on any individual problems that  may  be

better settled by discussion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to my information, the

Government  has  the  habit  of throwing any memorandum  submitted  by  the

people into the wastepaper basket. Is that true, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the

reply given by the Minister, in five years' time there are 100 families who

have-got  compensation at this rate. May I know whether  these  regulations

regarding  compensation are those laid down by the Lim Yew Hock  Government

in  1957,  and whether these include the amount given by the Lim  Yew  Hock

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my answer just now stated that the com

pensation schemes have been reviewed and amended from time to time, and  I

said  that  it includes the time when this Government took office.  To  my

knowledge,  I  have personally settled some of the difficult  problems  of

resettlement.  When there were appeals made by cases for  resettlement,  I

personally  looked into them. I have also said that in specific  cases  of

hardship,  other forms of assistance may be granted. The figure of  10,000

includes obviously the period of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post of Secretary, City Electricity Department, was formerly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am very doubtful whether any change in the

rates  of  entertainment  tax  would  have  the  effect  of  resuscitating

professional boxing. For instance, in the Federation the rates are  rather

less  than half of those in Singapore, and there is no evidence whatsoever

that they have any effect on reviving the sport of professional boxing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that this is very much a matter of taste. Fashions come

and  go.  Years  ago it was professional boxing; now it is running  around

with  go-karts or what-have-you. I think it is rather independent of rates

of tax on entertainment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir. My question seems to be misunderstood.

Perhaps  I  have not been clear. We are getting no revenue  and  have  been

getting  no  revenue,  so the reduction of the tax  could  not  affect  our

revenue  in  any  fashion, and it could reasonably be anticipated  that  it

might  assist.  In  the  circumstances, would  the  Minister  not  give  it

sympathetic consideration? Since we cannot lose, we might win.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for Anson has a point there,

their  scale salaries, the appointment allowances applicable to these posts

at  the  rates prescribed. There is no such thing as "Personal Allowances".

But  an  Appointment Allowance, being pensionable, may become "personal  to

the  holder" if he or she is transferred to another post which  carries  no

"Appointment allowance".



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that married

physically  impossible for thousands of teachers to use the one  copy  that

all  the multifarious duties of those posts. But I would have thought  that

such  simple  duties  as  the teachers may be called  upon  to  perform  in

schools  could  well have been explained to them by the principals  of  the

revised  and  divided into four separate manuals, namely, the Establishment

radioactivity  from  stratospheric dust  produced  by  the  recent  Russian

has  been  repeatedly warned and has been penalised by a cut  in  the  fee

paid  to him by the Public Works Department, but his work is still not  up

to  standard:  The  contractor's charges for the work are  low,  with  the

result that the standard of the work has been poor. Steps are being  taken

to  review  the whole procedure of contract work for these outlet  drains,

and  discussions are now taking place with the Public Works Department  on

how to improve the standard of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On several occasions in the past, City Council labourers have been on

the  job of de-silting and cleansing these outlet drains. As soon as  the

strike  situation improves and labour is available, work on the cleansing

of these outlet drains will be undertaken.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister whether

he  would consider doing this immediately, because only yesterday  I  had

some people from Haig Road complaining that the, situation is so bad that

water is flowing into the compounds of the houses now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, all this will be attended to. One has to be patient. One

has  to get the cleansing squads organised. It all depends on the outcome

of  the  negotiations  that are going on now for  the  solution  of  this

strike.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mrs Seow Peck Leng, question No. 49.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the answer to question

<div align="center"><b>VACANT LAND IN HAIG ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>USED AS REFUSE DUMP</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for Health and Law whether he

is  aware  that the vacant land adjacent to houses Nos. 24 to  38  in  Haig

Road  is being used as a refuse dump and that the backlane of these  houses

is  in a filthy condition, and what steps are proposed to be taken in these

matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an inspection was carried out immediately on

receipt  of a letter of complaint signed by the residents on 28th  October,

and  it  was  found that some people had been dumping refuse on the  vacant

land  at  the  side of No. 24, Haig Road, and at the rear of No.  40,  Haig

Road. Two labourers were detailed to clean the place immediately, and  this

was done before the strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backlane referred to has a beat labourer responsible for its

cleansing and it has been cleaned and restored to a satisfactory condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general cleaning-up operations in this area will have to be deferred

until  after  the  strike.  Dumping  of  refuse  on  private  land   is   a

contravention  of the Local Government Ordinance, for which those  who  are

responsible can be punished.

Mr Kong Soon Seng of Sibu, Sarawak.

Singapore  by  Malayan Airways, Flight 401, at 1300 hours on  19th  August,

1961.  On  examination by the Immigration Officer at the  Airport,  it  was

found  that  his  British  passport No. 3719  issued  in  Kuching  on  10th

January, 1956, had expired and had not been renewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in all cases of passengers who arrive without valid travel documents,

Mr  Kong  Soon Seng was refused leave to land and was returned to  Kuching

aware  that  there were well-known businessmen in Singapore  that  day  who

were  prepared to stand security and guarantee for Mr Kong, who is a well-known  businessman  from Sarawak doing business with  Singapore.  I  wonder

whether  the  Minister  can allow officers on duty to  relax  the  rules  a

little when it is for the benefit of Singapore, especially in respect of  a

consideration will be given to the setting up of a Chinese primary  school

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There are 14 classrooms in Ama Keng Primary School,

of  which  12  classrooms are being used in the morning  session  for  the

English medium. Consideration will always be given to any language  stream

wishing  to use unoccupied classrooms in Government schools if the request

is  made.  At present, the need for a Chinese primary school in this  area

School itself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are matters of detail which

the  school  puts up to the Ministry and the Ministry does  its  best.  If

there  are no teachers, I suppose there will be the usual delay in  trying

to  get  the correct persons to be appointed. If it is a request to extend

classrooms to take in more students, then that has, I think, been  met  by

the Ministry of Education in next year's provision.

steps  does the Government propose to take with regard to people who  have

lived in unauthorised huts for more than two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, unauthorised houses are dealt with

according  to the law. Even though they may have been lived  in  for  more

than  two  years,  it is provided by the Local Government  Ordinance  that

court action is instituted if an unauthorised building comes to the notice

of  the authority. Initially a notice is served on the person responsible,

requiring him to demolish the structure within 14 days. It is only when he

fails  to  do  so  that court action is taken. A mandatory  order  may  be

obtained either to demolish or to require that the structure should comply

with  the law. In the latter case, no further action is taken as  soon  as

the requirements are complied with.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as this affects over 2,000 families in Singapore, I wonder whether or not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

the  Government would consider formulating some scheme to assist the  occu

pants of houses that do not meet the requirements of the law. After all, I

do not think Government will turn 2,000 families on to the streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is aware that hundreds

of  families  are  living  in unauthorised houses,  and  for  humanitarian

reasons,   the  Government  has  not  evicted  these  people   from   such

unauthorised buildings. However, the Government has been looking into  the

possibility  of  legislation to control the building of such  unauthorised

huts.  In considering such legislation, we have also thought of a possible

scheme  that will meet the processes of law as well as the welfare of  the

people.

of lights in the common corridors of these flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development Board has

given  consideration to the matter of lighting in the common corridors  of

flats  since the Member for Mountbatten questioned it sometime last  year. They  are  satisfied that the standard of lighting in the common corridors

is  adequate  and comparable with the standards maintained in the  Board's

other estates.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister or

his officers have actually visited the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



Kallang  Flats to investigate the justification of the complaints. I  admit

that  the flats are all differently built, and in some areas it can be said

that the lighting is sufficient. But there are blocks where the lighting is

so  bad  that it is very easy to fall over unexpected steps which exist  in

some  of  the flats. I myself have experienced it. So I wonder whether  the

Minister or his officers have visited such flats, and, if not, whether  the

Minister  would send officers to investigate the different types of  blocks

before deciding not to reconsider the complaints.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very odd for the Member to say

such  things, because on the last occasion when she brought up this  matter

of  lighting,  I asked her to indicate to me which of the different  blocks

had  such a difficult problem. In fact, she said she would indicate  to  me

where these buildings were. I am not saying that the Housing Board has  not

done  its  duty as far as investigating the lighting of such  buildings  in

Kallang is concerned, but I have already indicated to them that the  Member

for  Mountbatten was concerned about this problem. They have reported  that

they  are  satisfied.  At  any rate, if the Member  for  Mountbatten  could

communicate with me about specific cases, I will definitely look into them.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are typed copies of the

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk and distributed to

hon. Members.



<br><br>7.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, when it becomes law, will replace the existing Legislative

Assembly  (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, 1955. It seeks to  declare

and  define  the  privileges, immunities and powers of the  Legislative

Assembly and of its Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 59 of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958,

provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be lawful, by law enacted under this Order, to determine

and regulate the privileges, immunities and powers of the Assembly and

its Members, but no such privileges, immunities or powers shall exceed

those of the Commons' House of Parliament

in the United Kingdom or of the Members thereof.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, therefore, states the general principle upon

which  it  has been drafted. The House of Commons has the right  to  be

the sole judge of the lawfulness of its own proceedings. This right  is

provided  for in section 48, subsection (1) of the Singapore  (Constitu

tion)  Order  in  Council, 1958, which gives power to the  Assembly  to

make,  amend and revoke Standing Orders for the regulation and  conduct

of its own proceedings and the despatch of business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, sub-clause (2) of the Bill takes the matter further,

providing  as  it .does for exemption of any person from liability  for

any act done under the authority of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill also, inter alia, provides that the proceedings

in  the Assembly shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned  in

any  court,  commission  of  inquiry,  tribunal  or  any  other  place

whatsoever out of the Assembly. The privilege of freedom of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



speech in the House of Commons is absolute, and any attempt to obstruct  or

impede  any  Member  in the exercise of this privilege,  for  example,  any

intimidation  of  Members or molestation of Members  on  account  of  their

conduct  in  Parliament  is  a  breach  of  privilege.  This  privilege  is

specifically provided for in clause 4 and clause 5, sub-clause (1)  of  the

Bill.  At the same time, it is the duty of each Member to refrain from  any

course  of  action  prejudicial  to the  privilege  which  he  enjoys.  The

privilege  of  freedom of speech does not confer on any Member unrestrained

licence of speech in the House. He remains accountable to the House  itself

for words spoken in debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20 and 21 of the Bill, therefore, seek to give power to the Assembly to proceed with cases of contempt and punish where contempt,

dishonourable conduct and abuse of privilege have been proved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons has the right to punish its own Members for contempt

(including a breach of privilege), abuse of privilege (especially an  abuse

of  the  privilege of freedom of speech) and dishonourable conduct, as  for

example,  the  corrupt acceptance of payment for disclosure of  information

about  matters to be proceeded within the House obtained from other Members

under  the  obligation of secrecy. In the House of Commons, the  punishment

which  may  be  meted  out  for  breaches  of  privilege  or  contempt   is

commitment,  that  is,  imprisonment, expulsion of Members,  suspension  of

Members,  fines and reprimands. However, it is not proposed  in  this  Bill

that  the  power  of  commitment should be given to  the  Assembly.  If  an

offender  is  to be deprived of his liberty, it should be  by  order  of  a

court  of law. Similarly, it is not proposed to give the Assembly power  to

expel its Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill, therefore, provides that the Assembly shall have

no  power  to commit any person to prison or to expel any Member  from  the

Assembly. However, Part V of the Bill





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



lists  out  the  offences  under  which  the  State  Advocate-General  can

institute criminal proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to suspend a Member is provided for in clause 20 of the Bill.

Power is also given in clause 22 of the Bill for punishment in one session

or  in one Assembly of offences which have been committed in another. This

clause  also  provides that where the Assembly considers that an  offender

has not been punished or not been sufficiently punished in one session  or

in  the Assembly by reason of the early ending of a session, he may  again

be  dealt  with  in  the  next  session or Assembly  until  the  House  is

satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to impose fines is provided for in clause 20 of the Bill. It is

proposed that the fine imposed be treated as a debt due to the Government,

and power is given in clause 23 of the Bill for the State Advocate-General

to  sue  for and recover the fine. The power to reprimand and admonish  is

provided for in clause 20 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons has the power to require the attendance of wit

nesses. This is specifically provided for in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15  of

the  Bill.  Power  to  secure the attendance  of  persons  on  matters  of

privilege is specifically provided for in clauses 12, 13, 24 and 25 of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the power to order and issue a warrant for the arrest of persons

guilty of contempt and breach of privilege is specifically provided for in

clauses 26 and 27 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Members of the House that it was the intention of

the  Government to introduce this Bill in the last session of the Assembly.

However,  it was to give time to Mr Speaker to study precedents  elsewhere

and to discuss with the Fourth Clerk of the House of Commons when he was in

London for the C.P.A. Conference during the months of September and October

that the introduction of this Bill was deferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a non-political Bill, and that was why you, Mr Speaker, was

consulted on this Bill. The provisions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

this  Bill  apply to all Members of the Assembly. It has been  drafted  not

from  the  view-point of party politics, but from the necessity  to  define

clearly  the  rights and privileges of Members and of  the  Assembly  as  a

whole,  and  to ensure that the proceedings in the House be conducted  with

orderliness  and  with dignity. When proceedings in Parliament  or  in  the

Assembly  are reduced to mud-slinging and a free-for-all affair,  then  the

practice of parliamentary democracy will be in danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to you, Mr Speaker, for

your considerable assistance in the drafting of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having heard that you have already

cast your vigilant eye over this Bill, we feel more satisfied that somebody

has  checked the possible twists and turns of the P.A.P. We know  that  the

P.A.P.  is  quite capable of such things, and we are very happy, Sir,  that

you have discharged your duty in the interests of all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realised that this Bill is not a political Bill; that the provisions

apply to each and every one of us. But on principle, we do not agree to the

haste  with which the P.A.P. is trying to rush this Bill through.  Anything

done  in haste cannot possibly have the best thinking given to the subject.

And  we remember, Sir, how the rushing through of Bills during the 1959 and

1960 sessions had led to innumerable amendments which had to be introduced

in this Chamber later on. Just on that alone I am sure we would not like to

rush  this Bill through. Despite this we would not mind allowing this  Bill

to  go through quickly, but for the fact that the P.A.P. has not been doing

things in the proper way all these months. Just for instance, Sir, even the

Order Paper of this sitting was sent to us only on the last day.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member for Queenstown perhaps

appreciates who prepares the Order Paper and under what Standing Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



The responsibility for issuing an Order Paper lies with the Clerk, and he

tries his very best to try and get it out as fast as possible. The delay, I

think - I did inquire about the delay in regard to this particular Order

Paper - was really in the printing, mainly because 58 questions are being

asked. I do not think it is proper to say that it is the P.A.P. or the

Government benches that are responsible for the Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I apologise. But there are still

other  things. For example, on the day before the sitting, the Government

suddenly pounced two new motions on us.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must stop this line on the Second Reading

of  this  Bill. All that the hon. Member is entitled to do is to  protest

that this Bill is being taken through all its stages today. But I do  not

think  he is in order if he tries to introduce into his statement alleged

breaches by the Government benches on other occasions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the Government is sincere in asking for

constructive  criticism from the opposition, and if  the  Leader  of  the

House  is sincere when talking about parliamentary democracy, as  he  has

just  mentioned,  then surely, Sir, proper time should be  given  to  the

Opposition to study the Bill. As it is, I do not think any of  us  really

had  sufficient  time  to  go  through the  Bill  properly.  Under  those

circumstances,  do you not think, Sir, it would be much  better  for  the

Government  to send the Bill to Select Committee and make sure  that  all

the  possible mistakes are corrected 'and all the best thinking is  given

to the Bill? In addition, in the Bill itself, there are quite a number of

points  as  regards  definitions  which are  all  very  vague - words  like

dishonourable conduct, insult and menace. Why cannot some effort be  made

at  definition? At least we would then know where we would transgress and

where  we  would go wrong. As it is, none of us can be very  sure.  Under

those  circumstances, Sir, just on principle alone,  we  would  recommend

that the Bill be sent to Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legislative Assembly

(Privileges,  Immunities  and  Powers)  Bill  is  a  grand  collection  of

punitive  -provisions against Assemblymen who are charged by the  Assembly

or  the  Committee  of  Privileges for having committed  certain  offences

against  the Assembly. Sir, the Bill, as it stands now, is a  great  blow

to  our democratic system and will henceforth hamper freedom of speech and

debate  in this Assembly. There are many objectionable provisions  in  the

Bill  despite  the  short  time  we have  been  given  to  study  it.  The

Government  has refused the request of many Members of the  Opposition  to

refer the Bill to a Select Committee for careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past one year, since the suspension moved a year ago, the

Government  has  had  a year to draft and study all the  implications  and

ramifications of such a Bill. But the Opposition Members were only given a

few days to study such an important Bill.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our request, the Government is determined to steamroller

such  a  Bill which will affect all Members of this Assembly. Sir,  it  is

important that in such a Bill where Assemblymen, members of the public and

the Press are involved, time should be given for the parties concerned  to

make  representations to a Select Committee. I cannot  see  where  is  the

urgency  of  such a Bill. In my view, there are more pressing problems  in

the  country which require the urgent attention of Government than passing

such a Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Leader of the House just now that such a Bill should

not  be a political Bill. Such a Bill, Sir, should not be a controversial

Bill. Such a Bill should get the unanimous assent of all Members of  this

Assembly. Such a Bill will lose the effect of upholding its avowed policy

which  is,  as has been said, to uphold the dignity and prestige  of  the

House.  Sir,  the Government should give up all attempts  to  steamroller

such a Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very well for the Leader of the House to say that we are

following  the  House of Commons, but we know very well  that  there  are

certain  rules  and conventions which bind the conduct of the.  House  of

Commons.  If I may say so, we are just like an infant, whereas the  House

of  Commons is like our great-grandfather. The Bill before us has certain

provisions  which look attractive. For instance, Part IV  starts  with  a

very beautiful clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Assembly shall have no power to commit any person to prison, nor

shall the Assembly have power to expel any member

from the Assembly.'



<br><br>But  one should read clause 20 - the punitive provisions - where it has  been

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'20.-(1) For any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt,

on the part of a member, the Assembly may -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) impose upon him a fine not exceeding the sum of five thousand

dollars;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suspend him from the service of the Assembly for the remainder of

the current session of the Assembly or

for any part thereof; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) direct that he be reprimanded or admonished in his place by the

Speaker.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am an offending Member, I would honestly say

that  I would prefer to be expelled from the Assembly rather than  pay  a

fine  of  $5,000  and be suspended during the remainder  of  the  current

session.  So I feel that the punitive provisions under clause  20  negate

all the beautiful phrases in clause 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, likewise the other punitive provisions in the Bill which negate

this beautiful clause, i.e. clause 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'4. There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in the

Assembly, and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not

be  liable  to  be impeached or questioned in any court,  commission  of

inquiry, tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would honestly say that if I were an offending

Member, having been found guilty of any abuse of privilege or of  any  of

fence laid down in this Bill, then I would prefer to defend myself in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



court  of  law rather than before a Committee of Privileges which comprises

Assemblymen  trying their fellow Assemblymen; not to say that at  least  in

the  courts of law I can have the opportunity to be represented by  counsel

and where the proceedings are open to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the punitive provisions of the Bill are very severe. For an offence,

a  Member can be fined up to a maximum of $5,000. For argument's sake, if a

Member  happens to commit 10 offences during two days of Question Time,  he

can  be  fined  up  to a maximum. of $50,000. I wish to  know  whether  our

insurance  companies  in  Singapore could take insurance  policies  on  the

occupational  hazards  of  Assemblymen! Sir, an  Assemblyman  can  also  be

suspended  and  at  the same time his pay can be stopped.  There  are  many

Assemblymen  who  depend on their allowance to carryon  their  constituency

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most important, Sir, is that what is spoken in one Session or in

one  Assembly can be brought up for trial in another Session or in another

Assembly.  In other words, any Member who is on the Government  bench  now

and  happens to be in the Opposition 10 years hence - his speeches  will  be

recorded  in  Hansard - can  be brought up and be  tried  for  any  of  the

offences laid down in the Bill.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under clause 35 a person may be fined the maximum fine of $5,000 to $10,000 for an offence, and he may be imprisoned at the same time for periods between 2 years and 7 years. I think, Sir, these are harsh sentences

normally  reserved for kidnappers, bandits and murderers. I am  sure  they

are not for offending Assemblymen.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these punitive provisions will be like a sword hanging over our

necks. Sir, it has been stressed during my speech that the Opposition have

not  had  much  time  to  study this Bill. In the  name  of  parliamentary

democracy, this Bill should be referred to a Select Committee for  careful

and detailed consideration. I am sure all Members of this Assembly are  as

anxious as we are to uphold the dignity and prestige



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



of  the  House.  I  am sure that all will agree that  only  a  Bill  which

receives  the  unanimous assent of the House will be able to achieve  that

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Government again to consider carefully whether this

Bill should be referred to a Select Committee?



<br><br>7.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we must express our

angry  and  strong  feelings and protest against the Legislative  Assembly

(Privileges,  Immunities  and Powers) Bill  tabled  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying this Bill, we have come to know that it is not the motive

and  intention  of this Bill to let Members of the House enjoy  freedom  of

speech. On the contrary, it is the leadership of the P.A.P. that is  making

use  of  their  power  to deprive Opposition Members of  their  freedom  of

speech in the Assembly. Therefore, this Bill does not aim at upholding  the

dignity  of  parliamentary  democracy. On  the  contrary,  it  is  a  great

departure  from  the spirit of democracy. We all know that  the  system  of

parliamentary democracy has come from England. Therefore, in  England  this

system  of  parliamentary  democracy has a long  standing.  The  people  of

England  have  full  confidence in the system of parliamentary  democracy,

because  no  matter  which Party is in power, the spirit  of  parliamentary

democracy  is always maintained and upheld. Whether inside or  outside  the

Parliament,  the people have the right to enjoy freedom of speech,  freedom

of  publication, and freedom of assembly. If the people are  now  satisfied

with  the  policies of the Government, then no matter who they  are - whether

they  are individuals or political parties or organisations of the  people - the  Party in power invariably allows them to hold mass rallies where  they

can  attack and criticise the policies of the Government and publish  their

views  against  the Government in the papers. They have  the  privilege  to

enjoy  the  fruits  of  the  basic principle of democracy.  Therefore,  the

people's representatives in Parliament have greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



freedom  and they have no restriction whatsoever or run the risk of  being

prosecuted  or  suspended. They can freely - and very freely indeed - express

the  opinions  of the people. Therefore,parliamentary democracy  has  gone

through so many years in England. This only goes to prove that the  people

have the full right to enjoy the fruits of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the organisation of the Legislative Assembly which is constituted in

accordance    with   the   spirit   of   parliamentary   democracy,    the

representatives  of the people should have the right to  enjoy  democracy. The  contents and the meaning of democracy are that the people should have

the  right  to  organise  themselves, to freedom  of  speech,  freedom  of

publication, and freedom of assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the people of Singapore have no right to such freedom, such as

freedom  of  speech  and  freedom of assembly. For  example,  the  Barisan

Sosialis'  application for a mass rally had been turned down. A Branch  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis  held a meeting and they had been  restricted.  Our

comrades,  Dr  Lee and Ong Chang Sam, have been charged  in  court  as  a

result of -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could the hon. Member let me know how that is relevant to the Bill? We are talking about privileges in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, this is relevant to the

Bill  because  I  am  just quoting an example which  is  relevant  to  the

contents of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot understand how comrades of the Barisan

Sosialis being prosecuted in court has anything to do with this Bill.  Let

us be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Where is the freedom of speech? Fur

thermore,  if  the  people of Singapore were to go  strongly  against  the

Government,  then  they  would  be confronted  with  detention  under  the

P.P.S.O.; but we are not afraid of the P.P.S.O. when we struggle  for  the

interests of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to know how the P.P.S.O. comes into the

Privileges Bill. I cannot find any reference there to the P.P.S.O.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But we know that the Party in power want

to  make  use of this Bill in order to prevent us from disclosing the  ins

and outs of the P.A.P. Government and expressing the views of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to hide their own ugly facts, the P.A.P. Government have to

amend this Bill in order to restrict us in our freedom of speech. There is

a provision in the Bill - clause 20 - which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) For any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt, on

the part of a member, the Assembly may -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) impose upon him a fine not exceeding the sum of five thousand

dollars;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suspend him from the service of the Assembly for the remainder of

the current session of the Assembly or

for any part thereof;'.



<br><br>But  I  am not clear as regards the meaning of this clause. I do not  know

what is the explanation or the definition of "dishonourable conduct". I do

not understand what is meant by "dishonourable conduct" and "contempt"  in

this Bill. 'May I point out two examples to this House? Firstly, if I  say

in  this House that the Prime Minister has sold out the interests  of  the

people of Singapore, and, secondly, if I say that the Prime Minister is  a

dictator, does it mean that the two examples I have quoted will amount  to

dishonourable conduct on the part of the Assembly Member? If  so,  then  I

will  be  running  the  risk of being fined $5,000  by  the  Assembly  and

suspended  from  the  service of the Assembly.  Therefore,  where  is  the

freedom  of  speech  for  the  Members of the  Assembly  in  parliamentary

democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all representatives elected by the people. Certainly we have the

right  to express different views in this House. If our views are  against

the opinion and desire of the people, then at the end of the term our fate

will  be  decided  by  the  people themselves. Therefore,  this  provision

regarding "dishonourable conduct" is too wide and there is no clear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



definition  for  it. The Party in power in this House may abuse  this  Bill

and  take  advantage of it against the interests of the Opposition Members.

It  seems  there  was  such a case in this House last year.  But  in  other

countries  where  parliamentary democracy is practised, there  is  no  such

serious  provision for the punishment of the representatives of the people.

It  is only in Africa where the countries are under colonial rule that  you

can  find  such  provisions being made against the representatives  of  the

people.  In  this  way,  the representatives of the  people  appear  to  be

representatives when, in fact, they are just figure heads in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a tool which the colonial rulers can make use of to suppress

the  freedom of speech of the people's representatives. The representatives

of  this House are all elected by the people and they have equal rights and

equal  privileges. It is not up to the Party in power to make use of  their

extra  vote  to repress the freedom of speech of the Opposition Members  so

that  they cannot express the views of the people. If that is the intention

of  the Party in power and it is attempted, then I will call them dictators

and enemies of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker, we are debating the

principles  of  this  Bill. I do not see how what has  been  .said  by  the

Member for Pasir Panjang is relevant to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I was busy doing something else when the Member

for  Pasir  Panjang was speaking his last two sentences. I  really  do  not

know  what  the  point of order is. Perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister  will

let me know what was said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Pasir Panjang has been rambling about

Africa.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think what the Member for Pasir Panjang said was that

there  was similar legislation in Africa. I may be wrong. But that  is  the

impression  I  got:  that  there was similar  legislation  in  Africa  and,

therefore, because of that, this is a colonial Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, you have already given

the  answer to his question. Therefore, in order to uphold the system  of

one  man  one vote, we had better not pass this Bill in a hurry.  In  the

meantime,  for  the sake of maintaining parliamentary democracy  and  the

spirit  thereof, and to uphold the dignity of the Assembly, I agree  with

the  Member  for  Queenstown when he suggested that this Bill  should  be

referred to a Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the survival of democracy as

represented in this Chamber depended upon the speakers opposite, I  would

have given up the ghost a long time ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Go ahead!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, to hear from them, and in particular the last

speaker  who  rattled out a speech from script, talk about democracy,  the

Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance,  the  rights  of  man,  the

tyrannical  powers  of  colonial government which  no  doubt  we  in  this

Assembly are aiding and abetting, leaves me with a sour taste. If  we  are

to   fight  this  according  to  Queensberry  rules,  according   to   the

quintessence  of the rules of debate as you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  have  been

able to refine after your sojourn at the C.P.A. Conference in London, your

many  consultations and your no doubt delightful hours spent pouring  over

the  definitions  of  words and phrases, is all a mockery  because  it  is

colonial,  having  come from Africa, then I say let us go  back  to  first

principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has been introduced on a Certificate of

Urgency as a result of an albeit casual conversation between you and me on

the  occasion of the ceremonial opening of this Assembly. When I mentioned

to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that your task in this Session would be somewhat

more  hectic  than in the last, since the warriors of the  various  Indian

tribes have foregathered, the drums are beating and the smoke is -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yoo-hoo-hoo -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for Anson must realise that

behaviour  of that nature is grossly disorderly, and I emphasise  the  word

"grossly".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, my apologies to you, but we were referred to

as Indian tribes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I will have no levity in this matter. I have ruled

that  making unseemly noises of that nature is grossly disorderly, and  the

hon. Member should just apologise and say nothing more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I want an apology.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> With apologies, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it was really as a result of this conversation

in  which  you  felt  that you should have the powers in  order  fairly  to

maintain  discipline and conduct in this Assembly before the fun and  games

begin,  particularly  with more charges of nepotism coming  in  the  future

motion to be debated, that we have tabled this Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on behalf of my colleagues and myself, let me say that having grown

up  in the somewhat rough and sometimes rugged school of politics, we  are

quite prepared either for boxing under Queensberry rules or boxing Siamese

style.  But  as  I have said to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, being non-Communist

does  not  mean one gets kicked in one's abdomen and succumbs.  One  often

retaliates if for no other reason than sheer self-defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have made my intentions quite clear with my opening remark and

that  of  my colleague, namely, that we have no desire to rush  this  Bill

through  at  all.  It  was really in order to allow the  referee  to  have

sufficient  protection for himself, as otherwise in  an  all-in  wrestling

out  of the ring. I would say, therefore, that since the three Members  of

the  Opposition  who have spoken have chosen to make it a party  political

issue - that, in fact, we are trying to shield ourselves and our fair  name,

unjustly acquired because we have done wicked deeds, by the provisions  of

this  Bill  which we intend to steamroller through, I say: let  it  go  to

Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Let us hear the Member for Queenstown. Let him spend

as  many  hours, Sir, as you have. Let the poor Member for  Pasir  Panjang

start translating the provisions of the

Bill. Let his ghost writer translate some 15 pages of legal erudition for

his  delectation and suggest improvements. I say: let us be done with  all

this  mock defence of parliamentary democracy by people who would  be  the

first  to  destroy it. It is as if they are going to spend time trying  to

understand the mechanics of it. They are out to wreck it. Let us not  make

any  bones about it. You, Mr Speaker, are left with the professional task

of  trying to make this machine work. We have volunteered to try and  help

you  make  it work. I say to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I say it publicly:

if  you feel you are inadequately equipped as a result of inadequacies  in

the  last  Ordinance and the present Bill, we will, if you  suggest,  make

these provisions retrospective and include a clause on it, because it  can

go to Select Committee for three months.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, I have the warm support of the Member for Anson

who no doubt sees the legal point, and often - although I differ from him on

so  many things - we see legal points together quite easily. So be it.  But

in  the  process  of  refining,  I say to  them,  particularly  my  former

Parliamentary Secretary, when it comes to debating motion  No.  9  on  the

Order  Paper  about  nepotism, understand that any  charge  made  in  this

Chamber, notwithstanding the Legislative Assembly Privileges Bill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



can  be repeated on oath in a Commission of Inquiry and in court. We  will

face up to any allegation of any kind from anybody. We fear no -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Prime Minister has made his

point there, and I do not think that is quite relevant to the Bill itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Strictly, Mr Speaker, Sir, no. But as you know, as

a  result of our conversation, this is what perhaps you fear might lead to

a  recrudescence of the unseemly conduct in this Chamber. It  was  in  the

hope  - now  it  turns out to be purely pious - of not having  charges  wildly

thrown  and unsubstantiated that we had put forward this Bill. But I  say:

if  it  is to be Siamese boxing, then so be it. Let this Bill go to Select

Committee,  and let it be retrospective if you will, Mr Speaker.  Let  us

play Queensberry rules if they wish, Siamese rules if they must.





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do I understand then that the Government are willing to

agree to the Bill going to Select Committee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, that is quite so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Thank you. In that case, that might affect the number of

speakers. We have only five minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very happy indeed

to  receive that assurance from the Prime Minister, and to scrap  a  speech

that  I have prepared which was directed specifically to that issue. I  can

assure  the Prime Minister, being an Opposition Party of only one, that  in

so  far  as I can assess the feelings of hon. Members on this side  of  the

House, there is no real objection in any shape or form to the principle  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us feel somewhat strongly, I with them, Sir, that we are seeking

far  too big a stake. But that is a matter, Sir, which we can well iron out

in  Select Committee. What has not been noticed, Sir, and perhaps we should

recognise it, is this - we have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



speaking about the privileges of Members - that there are the public,  there

is the Press. They are not aware that in this Bill they could be sentenced

to  two  years'  imprisonment and a $5,000 fine for any misdemeanour,  for

example,  disobeying the Speaker's ruling. It is only fair, Sir, that  the

Press  and the public and the people of Singapore who have returned us  to

this Assembly to discharge our responsibilities should have an opportunity

to  study  this  Bill. And I am very glad indeed that the  Prime  Minister

recognises that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has spoken of your difficulties. I seem to be the one in a very

short period to have called your wrath upon my head, Sir, and I would  say

this: that in so far as I am concerned,

despite  my ebullience which has met with your displeasure, I  trust  you

can  always  count  on  my  very  sincere  co-operation  and  support  for

maintaining the dignity of this House. I am very happy indeed, Sir, to  be

able  to  say that I shall vote without question on the Second Reading  of

this Bill, reserving my criticisms on detail for the Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The time is now two minutes to eight and I do not

know whether hon. Members will assent to this item being disposed of after

eight.  If that is so, then I need a motion from the Leader of the  House - with the assent, of course, of hon. Members - that, notwithstanding Standing

Orders,  the  proceedings of this item of business be  exempted  from  the

provisions  of  Standing Order No. 1. Is it the pleasure of  hon.  Members

that  that motion be made? Any dissenting voice? No dissenting voice.  Dr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Deputy

Prime  Minister  has  said that this Bill was originally  intended  to  be

brought  up at the last Session, the Prime Minister has admitted,  without

being  asked, that this Bill has been brought up and intended to be passed

in  a hurry because the Member for Anson and I desire to move a motion  in

this House regarding political nepotism of the Government. This shows that

the tabling of this Bill aims neither at giving more freedom of speech  to

Members, nor a greater sense of security. It is actually meant to  protect

the Party in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should point out at this juncture that the whole aim

of  this  Bill is to maintain the dignity of the House. I think  that  any

steps  taken to protect and maintain the interests of the Members  of  the

Assembly will not be objected to by Members of the Op. position.  But  the

question  is  whether  this Bill, if passed in a  hurry,  will  give  some

Members the feeling that, instead of protecting their interests, it  gives

rise to a sense of insecurity. If that is the case, then the Bill will not

achieve  its  object. I feel that such a Bill to protect  Members  of  the

House must satisfy every Member so that everyone of us will agree to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to say that this artificial method to uphold the

dignity  of  parliamentary democracy is unnecessary, because the  original

Bill,  which was passed in 1955, already provides adequate protection  for

the  interests  and  dignity of this House. Now,  in  the  spirit  of  the

present  Bill,  the  Assembly is asked to judge Members  of  the  Assembly

itself as to whether the speeches



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



they  make are restrained or just delivered anyhow and at random.  I  think

that  to judge a Member of the House is definitely not in the interests  of

the  dignity of the Member himself. If we think further that the Member has

been  elected by the people to the Assembly where he can make his speeches,

then  will  he tell lies in this House to smear other people?  If  he  does

this, then what will be the impression of the people of his constituency? I

say that the electorate themselves will suitably be the judges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that as our Prime Minister is a legal expert,

surely  he  knows all points of law. And if members of his Government  make

mistakes.,  then he will try to look for loopholes in the law in  order  to

cover  them  up. But Members on the Opposition are quite lacking  in  legal

knowledge, because there were no opportunities for them to study  law.  And

so  they  will not be able to bring evidence, as could the Prime  Minister.

Therefore, they will not be able to disclose abnormal things. If Members of

the House, especially those in the Opposition, can bring up some legitimate

doubts, although they cannot find legal evidence, then they should be given

the  right  of freedom of speech to express them, because we  are  just  be

ginning  to practise parliamentary democracy. We must let Members  of  this

House  have  more freedom to express their views. If I say,  "I  have  some

doubts  regarding  a  Minister and Members of the Government,  and  I  have

grounds for these doubts, and I will bring them up in this House", then  is

it  not  right  that, with the passing of this Bill, everything  must  have

legal standing and be supported by evidence, without which it will be taken

as  a  smear and mud-slinging? And in this case I will be penalised for  my

doubts  and  they  will  be taken as an insult to  Members  of  the  House.

Therefore,  I feel that in the present circumstances when we are practising

parliamentary  democracy, Members of this House, especially  those  in  the

Opposition, should be given more freedom of speech. Apart from this,  there

is one point which is more important.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is not so much freedom of speech outside this Assembly, Members

of this House should be given more freedom of speech in the House in order

to  make  up for such a lack of freedom of speech. In short, to depend  on

this Bill to uphold the dignity of this House is not an ideal way of doing

things.  The  main  thing  is  that the  maintenance  of  dignity  of  the

Parliament  should depend on the Government itself, which  should  find  a

brighter  future  for its people. If the Government, on greater  policies,

sell out the interests of the people and the country itself -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want this debate to go round wandering into

the  policies  of the Government. We are now debating the Privileges  Bill

which  affects Assemblymen. What happens outside, I think, does  not  come

into this Bill at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not intend, and did

not mean, to discuss in detail the policies of the Government. What I mean

to  say is that if the policies of the Government do not get on well  with

the  people,  then  this Bill will not bring dignity to the  Assembly.  By

passing  this  Bill, the Government hopes to uphold the  dignity  of  this

House.  But  if the people do. not understand the dignity of a  nation  or

country, or uphold such dignity, then the Government should not depend  on

this Bill alone to uphold the dignity of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the statement of the Prime Minister that this Bill will be

referred to a Select Committee for its consideration. I feel that that  is

a  plausible way of doing things on the part of the Prime Minister. I hope

that  in future the Government will not pass such a Bill right through  at

one sitting.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister

in  moving  the  Second Reading of the Bill did not give reasons  why  the

Bill  should  be carried through all its stages at this sitting.  But  the

Hon.  the  Prime Minister was stirred into rising on his feet and replying

to  the  attacks that have been made by his ex-comrades. He said that  the

Government was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



prepared  to  refer the Bill to a Select Committee. But  when  he  conceded

that, I must point out to him the fact that he had said he was prepared  to

fight  according to Queensberry rules or Siamese rules shows that there  is

already a tension on that side of the House and this side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember last year, the time when the Member for Hong Lim was

indulging  in his attacks against the Government. Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis were on that side of the House.

They  were  then so roused that each and every one of them  stood  up  and

attacked  the  hon.  Member for Hong Lim for such conduct  which  they  de

scribed  then as dishonourable. Sir, all I can say is that people who  are

on  this  side  and who came from that side might adopt the same  kind  of

training  when they now know that the gloves are off - fight to  the  death.

Queensberry rules or Siamese rules - and both sides are waiting to have that

fight.  But  we,  Sir, who happen to be on the Front  Bench - and  you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, for whom I have every sympathy because in the days  to  come

these  sittings  may be very protracted - we are going to be  treated  to  a

number  of exchanges between ex-comrades on what they did, what  they  did

not  do. and for all we know, there might even be pertain confessions from

those  who  left the P.A.P. in reply to the ugly confessions of the  Prime

Minister  in his radio broadcasts. I hope we will not be treated  to  that

kind of confessions which, in a way, are not helpful and beneficial to the

interests of the people and do not uphold the dignity of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the principle of the Bill. We say that the dignity of the

House  must  be  upheld at any price. And we who are proud  to  be  called

honourable  men  and women of this Assembly must impose upon  ourselves  a

certain code of conduct -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Discipline!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And that code of conduct and discipline is in this

Bill.  The  Member for Queenstown said he supported the Bill in principle.

But the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



other speakers in the Barisan Sosialis seem to think that this Bill is  all

wrong,  that it is an imposition on the freedom of speech. I do  not  know,

but  perhaps  they do not have the time to consult among themselves  as  to

what  they  should do and what they should not do. That is all  beside  the

point, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were treated to a sad display of conduct that did not bring credit to

this  House  and  to each and every one of us who were here  last  Session.

Some  of us felt very, very unhappy that hon. Members of the Assembly could

forget  themselves, particularly those who belong to the  same  Party,  and

could go at one another's throats, calling one another names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Prime Minister has said that the Government will

agree to referring the Bill to a Select Committee. That, I hope, will  take

away the sting of unjust criticism that there was an intention to rush  the

Bill  through all its stages. I can understand why it is necessary  that  this  Bill  should be carried through all its stages because  of  what  may

happen and what is going to happen in the next few days.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I trust the Member is not intimidating the Speaker!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, since the Prime Minister has said that the Govern

ment  is  referring the Bill to a Select Committee, I hope this House  will

not be treated to a display of rhetoric from ex-comrades who find that this

is  the time to go to town and hit at the 26 Members who now remain in  the

P.A.P. camp.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order that other Members on this

side  of  the  Assembly do not get confused over the stand of  the  Barisan

Sosialis on this Bill, perhaps it would be in order for me here to say that

we  support the principle of this Bill. But, Sir, it does not mean that  if

one  supports  the  principle of a certain principle, then  all  the  finer

details of that principle must necessarily be agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Bill, Sir. A very nice Bill. It confers upon all of

us  here privileges and immunities. Beautiful words in clause 4. But, Sir,

let us turn to clause 20 of the Bill, "Punitive powers of Assembly" -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt, on the

part of a member ...' -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Sir, I thought we have already

agreed  that  the  Bill should go to Select Committee.  If  it  is  not  a

question of major principle, because the hon. Member has already  said  he

agrees  to  the  principle, but it is a matter of detail he is  squabbling

about,  then  by  all means let him raise it in Select  Committee.  It  is

twenty past eight, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just waiting to hear what the Member for Nee Soon was

going  to  say.  I  would suggest that these matters of  detail  could  be

touched  upon  in  Select  Committee. In  fact,  they  have  already  been

mentioned  by  previous  speakers  and  there  is  a  danger  of   tedious

repetition. It is not the speaker being tedious, but the repetition  might

be  tedious.  If  there are any details which the hon.  Member  wishes  to

raise,  I  take it there will be a Member of the Barisan Sosialis  in  the

Select  Committee, and that Member in Select Committee would, I  am  sure,

urge those details.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I bow to your decision. I would

like  to say that it is not a small detail. It is something which  I  feel

concerns the principle of the Bill itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You oppose the principle?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> No, we do not oppose the principle but certain parts

of it. Mr Speaker, Sir, could I have uninterrupted time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dishonourable conduct", Sir, is not defined, and that is very

dangerous. If we were to cast our memory back to the days not so long ago,

one  of  the Members over this side of the House was guilty, according  to

the  consensus  of  opinion of the House then, of  dishonourable  conduct.

Since "dishonourable conduct" had not been defined, it would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



defined  by  the  House. And since the Government has a  majority  in  the

House,  I  leave  it  to you, Sir, to say whether  this  is  a  matter  of

principle or detail. I think it is quite important.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has invited the Speaker to say whe

ther  it  is  a matter of principle or detail. I say it is a matter  of

detail.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Sir, for your legal advice. Not being a

lawyer,  it  is  not possible for me to understand the niceties  of  legal

interpretation.  There  are certain parts of the Bill  which  provide  for

legal  action  to  be taken. For instance, if a Member  tables  an  untrue

document or says something untrue in this Assembly, it might very well  be

that  he  might  have meant well when he said such things,  but  it  might

consequently be found that they were not very true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will bear with me, Sir, the practice of parliamentary democracy,

especially  with benches on different sides, implies that  the  Opposition

Members must always keep an alert eye on the Government. If at any time  a

Member of the Opposition should smell a rat in the Government it is up to

him  to  use  his very long nose to smell out and to smoke out  that  rat.

Sometimes  hints given to him may be true and well-founded  but  sometimes

not  necessarily so, because we on this side of the Assembly do  not  have

access  to information that is available to Members of the Government.  It

is,  therefore,  on this principle that the Bill should be very  carefully

studied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I sympathise with the Member

for  Cairnhill for being in the position where he is now -facing the  Opposition,  and  therefore,  knowing very well what  is  going  on.  But  he  is

sandwiched  in  between  Members who claim  that  they  do  not  know  what

honourable or dishonourable conduct is. The impression is given  that  this

Privileges Bill is designed to curtail freedom of speech. It is  only  fair

that  I  should at least give an indication of what it really seeks to  do.

For example - among offences - it says that it will be an offence to threaten



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



or send a threatening letter to the Speaker, or publish any statement,

whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames,

which reflects on the character of the Speaker or any Member touching on

his conduct in the Assembly, and so on. The general impression given in

some of the speeches made by Members of the Barisan Sosialis is that this

Bill seeks to curtail freedom of speech. In fact, as far as I know, since

we have been here for a couple of days, not one of the Members in this

Assembly has felt constrained to limit what he has to say because of fear

that the Government with its powers might curb him or otherwise deal with

him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Bill is not passed yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon has suggested that he

does  not know what honourable or dishonourable conduct is, or what  truth

or  falsehood  is.  But I think most of us in this Assembly  can,  by  and

large,  determine  what  is  truth and what is  falsehood.  Therefore,  in

passing  this  Bill,  we are only ensuring that the  normal  standards  of

honourable  conduct, the normal standards of what is  true  or  false  are

observed  in  this Assembly. If certain Members feel that  they  would  be

somehow  curbed or restrained in this respect, I think that  is  a  matter

which they can bring up before the Select Committee, where they can define

what their standards of honour, truth and falsehood are.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is an irony that sometime early this

year,  13 Members from the Barisan Sosialis were sitting on this  side  of

the House.  At that time they knew what was the meaning of dishonourable

conduct.  In  fact,  they  did agree that the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  had

committed a breach of privilege. Now, the Member for Queenstown has led 12

of  his other colleagues to a snake dance, twisting and turning round over

to the other side -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think all this is relevant to the Bill

itself. Let us get down to brass tacks, shall we?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Let me proceed then, Mr Speaker. Members of the House

will  remember  that the Member for Hong Lim had to face  a  Commission  of

Inquiry sometime in June of this year, if my memory is correct. He faced  a

Judge  from  the  High Court, and the verdict of the  Judge  was  that  the

Member for Hong Lim had told lies.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering whether this is all relevant to the

Bill.  I  cannot see any relevance at all. This refers to what has happened

in the past. We are now legislating, I hope, for the future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Actually, Mr Speaker, it is because we are

legislating for the future that we have to look up precedents in the  past.

There  was  one particular point which the Member for Hong Lim  brought  up

and  which  the Member for Pasir Panjang has also brought up, namely,  that

one  of  the  punishments for breach of privilege, a  fine  of  $5,000,  as

stated  in  this Bill, was too heavy. But I would like to refer Members  of

the House a case where the former -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister has

drawn  attention to the fact that on this side of the House,  Members  were

speaking in detail. May I take the liberty, Sir, of asking you whether  the

matter  in  respect of which the Deputy Premier is now speaking is  not  in

detail? Could we go home at half-past eight?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would suggest to the Deputy Prime Minister that the line

he  is taking is completely unnecessary and perhaps irrelevant to the Bill

itself,  and  that  he  should proceed on a reply which  is  as  short  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if you will permit me, I was just going

to  wind up my argument in answer to the points raised by the other  side.

It  was  not a question of detail, but rather a question of principle,  as

stated  by  the  Member for Nee Soon. And that was  the  question  of  the

punitive powers which the Assembly has. I was going to refer to a case  in

which a former Assemblyman, Mr Lim Cher Kheng, was a plaintiff in a libel

suit,  and  he  was  awarded damages to the extent of  $13,000  against  a

newspaper.  That, I think, should answer the doubts raised by  Members  on

the  opposite side. However, all I would like to say now, Mr Speaker,  is

that  since we have agreed to refer this Bill for discussion in detail  in

Select  Committee, I would add that, in doing so, it is on  the  provision

that this Bill will be made retrospective from the day it was introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and

seven other Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].
