  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence how many National Servicemen have been killed in the course of doing their national service since national service was first made compulsory for young male Singapore citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Second Minister for Defence (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No figures are available for 1967 and 1968. From 1969 to the present, out of 250,000 national servicemen who have served in the SAF, 54 have died during training, an average of three per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Does the Minister have equivalent statistics of NS trainees who have been killed in Germany and Switzerland? If so, could he please let us know the comparable figures?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures with me.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What effort is Mindef taking to reduce the number of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> deaths to perhaps zero defect, as they say in the industry. We want to have no deaths at all. Is the Ministry taking steps to achieve that target?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the zero defect philosophy is very much the approach of the SAF. The fact that we have had 54 deaths out of a quarter million trainees shows how effective we have been in making sure our national servicemen get effective, valuable, safe training. To make sure that nobody is exposed to unnecessary risks during his national service, we have training safety directives. We have instructions on how training should be conducted, what precautions must be taken, what preparations the soldiers must go through before they are allowed to undergo training. All the Members here who have been national servicemen would have heard of the book called "TSR", Training Safety Regulations. It is a thick blue book, specifying all the precautions which must be taken before any training can be carried out, be it watermanship training, be it helicopter drills, be it parachuting, be it live firing exercises. In every case there are comprehensive precautions laid down and stringent inspections to make sure that training is properly carried out. Despite that, from time to time accidents happen. And when they do, it is Mindef's responsibility to make sure that the accident is thoroughly investigated. If anybody is at fault, this will be uncovered and the culprit
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will be punished. And if there are any lessons to be learnt so that similar accidents can be in future avoided, they will be noted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaths of national servicemen are not treated lightly. Each time one happens, we conduct a Committee of Inquiry. This is not an internal investigation, not even a Board of Inquiry, but a Committee of Inquiry comprising people from outside Mindef. The Chairman must be from another Ministry and there is always a doctor on the Committee. They will investigate not just the immediate cause of the accident, but also the training which the serviceman was involved in and whether any remedial action is called for. All these reports go to the Armed Forces Council chaired by the Minister, and we discuss them personally. So everything possible to make training safe is done. If the Member for Potong Pasir has any further ideas on how to make training even safer, we will be happy to consider them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If the Minister has any figures of very serious injuries, perhaps he could let the House know, and also whether any national service boys have been put into our mental hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member would like to frame his questions in writing, he would get answers to them.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence how many Malay officers holding the rank of Second Lieutenant and above were in the Singapore Armed Forces on 31st December, 1986.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef does not release such figures for different categories of servicemen in the SAF, for obvious reasons of security. However, as I have previously told the House, selection of candidates for Officer Cadet training, like promotion and advancement
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of individuals of all ranks throughout the SAF, is strictly by merit.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is it strictly by merit for Malay Muslim NS boys to be selected for Officer courses?

  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the HDB's housing estates are planned and built on a comprehensive basis with supporting facilities such as shophouses to cater to the needs of residents. This approach was combined with the need to provide accommodation for resettlement cases. HDB found it simpler to build all the shophouses. HDB is presently studying the feasibility of selling land in its estates for private developers to build shops. It is also considering selling its shophouses to allow greater private sector ownership. A decision will be announced by the end of the year.

  <b>Dr Ho Tat Kin</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information how many of the Mass Rapid Transit stations will be easily accessible to the handicapped and disabled, particularly those on wheel chairs; and what measures will be taken to ensure that the public transport system will be more user-friendly to the disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Sir, the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation has, wherever practicable, provided facilities in the MRT system to make it safe and easily accessible to all passengers including the ambulant disabled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facilities include heavy-duty public service-type escalators which have been designed with longer steps. Such escalators allow slightly longer reaction times and hence make it easier for passengers to get on or off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, inside every train car, eight seats will be reserved for senior citizens and the disabled. These seats will have a sticker over them to request passengers to give priority to the elderly and the disabled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public education programme planned by the MRTC to introduce the MRT system to Singaporeans will also include information on how the public can help the disabled to get around, especially within the stations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the Mass Rapid Transit system, as its name conveys, is to transport rapidly large masses of people. Therefore the service will only be in areas with heavy traffic density. The average stopping times at stations will be approximately 30 to 45 seconds. As such, it is not a safe and practical means of transport for the wheelchair-bound. They are better served by point to point transportation, such as mini buses, taxis, or cars. A Committee in the Ministry of Community Development has been looking into the transportation needs of the disabled and making the public transport system more convenient for the disabled. Members of

   <b>(Situation report)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Dr Ho Tat Kin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the current situation in Singapore as regards drug addiction; has the number of cases been on the increase; and what measures will be taken to improve the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Boon Yang)(for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, I am replying on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the drug addiction problem in Singapore is under control. Over the last 10 years, we have brought the addict population down from 13,000 in 1977 to about 7,000. They are mainly heroin addicts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infection rate has also been checked. In 1986, out of seven addicts arrested, only one was a new addict. The infection rate has been cut by more than half of the rate in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of young drug offenders (below 20 years old) has also declined. In 1986, 185 or 5% of drug offenders were below 20 years of age whereas in the first year of Operation Ferret in 1977, 31.4% or 2,427 drug offenders arrested were below 20 years of age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have been effective in tackling the drug addiction problem as a whole, we are now faced with the residue problem of a growing number of hardcore addicts who have undergone repeated treatment and rehabilitation only to relapse after release from the DRC. At the end of 1986, there were 3,909 addicts in our DRCs. Of this number, 1,124 or 28.8% were hardcore addicts who were undergoing treatment and rehabilitation for the 4th time or more. A solution must be found for this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> growing number of hardcore addicts. They are a source of contamination and many of them are incorrigible. They also create disciplinary problems within the DRCs and, when released, peddle drugs to maintain their addiction. To overcome this, new approaches including a more strict regime may have to be provided under the Misuse of Drugs Act to deal with the hardcore addicts; those among them who pose serious disciplinary problems in the DRCs will have to be punished severely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overall strategy against the drug menace is to suppress both supply and demand. Tough legislation has enabled us to effectively tackle both drug trafficking and consumption. Sustained enforcement measures of CNB and the other authorities, such as Police and Customs, coupled with the treatment and rehabilitation programme, have enabled us to contain the drug problem. The network of major drug trafficking syndicates has been disrupted. The drug scene is now characterized by ant traffickers who smuggle small quantities of drugs into Singapore. Enforcement at our Immigration checkpoints is stringent. They include spot checks of suspected addicts and traffickers. Narcotics detector dogs are also deployed to combat drug trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One decade has passed since Operation Ferret. While we have contained the drug problem, we cannot be complacent so long as international drug trafficking continues unabated. My Ministry has a working group to review our drug enforcement and rehabilitation programme and to recommend measures, if necessary, to further enhance the effectiveness of the programme. In addition, a senior police officer with experience in drug matters will soon be assigned to the Prisons Department to plan and implement measures to improve the relapse rate of both drug addicts and prisoners.

   <b>LEVY ON FOREIGN WORKERS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) whether the introduction of the $140 levy on foreign workers has increased the cost of labour in Singapore; (b) if his Ministry will conduct a survey to find out the number of companies that maintained the same basic starting wages on switching from the Central Provident Fund scheme to the levy scheme; and (c) whether it will be easier for companies to engage foreign workers under the levy scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are no indications that the extension of the levy scheme has increased the cost of labour in Singapore. Foreign workers constitute only a small part of the workforce for the majority of companies in Singapore. With the help of the Singapore National Employers' Federation, companies which are more dependent on foreign workers have worked out new wage arrangements for their new foreign workers taking into account the levy scheme and the need to maintain cost competitiveness. Existing Malaysian workers in the manufacturing and hotel sectors will remain on the CPF scheme so long as their work permits are renewed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been in close touch with the Singapore National Employers' Federation as well as some affected companies to monitor the implementation of the levy scheme. The feedback so far indicates that companies are able to recruit workers on the new wage regime worked out by the Federation. We will continue to monitor the situation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy scheme is not intended to make it easier for companies to engage foreign workers. It is a mechanism to regulate the demand for foreign workers in order that a revolving pool of foreign workers can be allowed beyond 1992 without creating over-dependence on foreign workers.

   <b>FINANCING OF BANK LOANS ON MORTGAGED PROPERTY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Labour when the Central Provident Fund Board will permit a CPF member to use his CPF balance and/or contribution to finance an existing bank loan predicated on the mortgage of a property acceptable to the Board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at present a CPF member can use his CPF savings to service a mortgage loan which is obtained for the purpose of financing the purchase of a property. He is not allowed to use CPF savings to service mortgage loans obtained for other purposes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides providing for retirement needs, the CPF Scheme also encourages home-ownership. Where loans are for the purchase of homes, both objectives are met. In other cases the loans are for purposes other than home-ownership. Allowing CPF funds to be used to service such loans would tantamount to releasing CPF funds for other uses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases property-owners have mortgaged their properties to raise funds for other purposes. A few may be facing difficulty in servicing their loans and would like to have access to their CPF savings to pay their debt. If the Government allows refinancing in such cases on grounds of hardship, the question is what constitutes hardship. In genuine cases of hardship, the property owners may, in any case, have to downgrade their properties. They could sell their existing properties and buy smaller ones instead, using their CPF savings. This option is open to them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore trustee shares and gold, it is not practical to disallow the refinancing of such investments with CPF funds. Such investments are easily traded. Somewhat different considerations apply to properties. The sums involved are much larger and the assets are relatively more difficult to buy and sell.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, the Government has not decided to allow CPF savings for refinancing of properties. However, if necessary, this issue could be reviewed at a later date.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple trip exit permits valid up to a year are issued to those who need to return to Singapore frequently during the validity period of their exit permits.

  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government supports Singapore fishermen and the fishing industry by providing the necessary infrastructure and technical assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two fishing ports at Jurong and Punggol to serve as operational bases for the local fishing fleet. The wharves are backed-up with auction markets for local fishermen to sell off their catch.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also constructing a live fish market at Punggol Fishing Port at a cost of $0.8 million. When completed in mid-1987, it will enable local fish farmers to market their produce more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board recently led a trade mission to Indonesia to explore further cooperation in fisheries and agriculture. The Indonesian government has now agreed to issue permits to our fishermen to fish in their waters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also actively promoting the development of marine fish farming and intensive high-tech marine aquaculture farms in Singapore. 100 hectares of sea area in our coastal waters have been designated for marine fish farming. So far, 66 marine fish farms occupying about 35 hectares have been established. 32 hectares of coastal land at Loyang have also been set aside for intensive high- tech marine aquaculture farms.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department (PPD) continues to provide technical assistance to fish farms to upgrade their farming technology. It regularly conducts training courses for fish farmers and their employees. PPD also undertakes research and development works on fish farming technology and fish disease control which are of direct benefit to local fish farms.

   <b>REPORT OF THE INQUIRY INTO THE COLLAPSE OF HOTEL NEW WORLD</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for National Development)</b>
  </div>
  <br>11.28 am
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Report of the Inquiry into the Collapse of Hotel New World was presented to the President on 16th February 1987. The Report has also been circulated to all Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission attributes the collapse of the building to its grossly inadequate structural design, its very unsatisfactory construction, the imposition of large loads not allowed for in the design during the building's life-span, and the absence of proper maintenance. After reviewing the present system of building control, the Commission has made ten recommendations on preventive measures. The recommendations relate to the various aspects in the development of a building, namely, design, choice of contractors, construction and maintenance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the design stage, the Commission recommends that all structural plans and calculations of a building submitted to the Development and Building Control
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Division (DBCD) should be independently checked either by DBCD or by PWD's structural engineers or, if the workload is too heavy, by a panel of professional engineers in private practice on a rotation basis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the construction stage, five recommendations have been made. These concern (i) the enforcement by DBCD of construction supervision by full-time resident engineers, or clerks-of-works, (ii) the conducting and reporting of various tests during construction, (iii) notification before main structural elements in a building are covered up, (iv) spot checks by DBCD, and (v) changes to plans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the maintenance aspect, the Commission recommends a mandatory 5-yearly inspection for all buildings except residential houses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable DBCD to undertake the several new roles identified, the Commission also recommends that its professional staff strength be increased.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the choice of contractors, the Commission suggests that the system of registration of contractors administered by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) be expanded and that the register of contractors be periodically reviewed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is grateful to the Commissioners for their effort in establishing the causes of the collapse and in coming up with the recommendations on preventive measures. The recommendations are sound, well-argued and comprehensive, covering as they do all the critical aspects from design to maintenance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse of Lian Yak Building, which is the name of the building, caused a loss of 33 lives and resulted in much grief and pain. We cannot afford another such disaster. There is, therefore, no doubt in my mind that we have to do all we can to help ensure that professionals and other people involved in the design, construction and maintenance of buildings carry out their duties honestly, properly and responsibly. Additional control measures may be necessary and existing preventive measures in crucial areas may need to be tightened. There must be no compromise on safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations in the Inquiry Report mean administrative time, legal and other implications, and costs. Before we take any steps to change our system, these implications must be carefully studied so as to determine the extent to which the recommendations can and should be implemented, and the actual forms the necessary controls should take. Some countries are practising one or more of the measures recommended, for example, Japan and Hong Kong. It is desirable and prudent that we also obtain an insight into their practices and learn from their experience before embarking to change our own system. What we want and should have is a system that provides an acceptable level of safety at reasonable cost. The system should not cause unnecessary and costly delays in the processing of plans and in construction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has formed a Working Committee to study the recommendations in detail and to put up specific proposals for implementation. The Working Committee is chaired by the Director-General of Public Works, Dr Tan Swan Beng, who is also the President of the Professional Engineers Board. Mr Lim Soo Ping, who was Secretary to the Commission of Inquiry, has been appointed Secretary to the Working Committee. His knowledge and understanding of the issues gained from the Commission's hearings will provide a continuity of effort. The Committee also comprises the Deputy Director of the Development &amp; Building Control Division, a Senior State Counsel of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and representatives from eight professional groups whose views and inputs are also essential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask the Clerk of Parliament to circulate the list (Cols. 1315 - 1316) which gives the full composition of the Committee. [Copies of document circulated to hon. Members.]

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he has mentioned just now that the Working Committee will take five to six months to complete its work, may we know what plans does the Government have on safety or preventive measures to be taken in the interim period? Second, since the safety of lives is of utmost importance, would the Government be prepared to absorb any additional cost to private developers arising from whatever measures that may be implemented as a result of the Working Committee's report?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> No.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> You are not the Minister. How can you say the answer is no?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, could the Hon. Minister enlighten the House as to why structural plans are not checked as it is done, I am told, in some other countries like Hong Kong and Japan? And fourthly, since Chapter 11 of the Report questions the practice of not checking structural plans, may I ask why DBCD only checks architectural plans and not structural plans?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Punggol wants to know what interim measures will be taken while the Committee is considering what recommendations should be implemented. Between now and the time when the Working Committee make its recommendations and the recommendations are implemented, owners of existing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> buildings should satisfy themselves by engaging professional engineers to check on their buildings to ensure that they are structurally sound if they have any reason to believe that their buildings are not structurally sound. Buildings do not just collapse overnight. There are many signs if they are structurally unsound. Even in the case of the Hotel New World, there were many many signs that the building was not sound but these signs were ignored. So if owners have reason to believe that something is wrong with their building, they should not hesitate to engage professional engineers to carry out thorough structural checks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For buildings that were designed by the engineer and architect involved in the Hotel New World building or, as I said, the Lian Yak Building, which is the real name of the building, DBCD has already advised these owners to have their buildings checked by professional engineers. For new buildings and those that are at design stage, DBCD will continue to hold the professionals responsible for the structural drawings and calculations that they submit to the Government. If owners of existing buildings and those who are planning new buildings follow these procedures, I think there should be no cause for alarm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that the Member raised was the question of who would pay for all these additional costs of checking and ensuring that the buildings are sound, and whether the Government will bear such additional costs. The Government is concerned with the impact of new procedures and measures that may be introduced on the cost of buildings. But safety of a building is not just the concern of the Government; it is in the interests of everybody. Measures which are introduced are not measures intended to safeguard the Government. They are intended to safeguard owners and occupiers of buildings. The burden of such costs, therefore, should not be borne by Government and cannot be attributed to Government. Government will implement whatever measures that are needed as efficiently as possible in order to keep costs to the minimum. However, private developers
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> must be prepared to shoulder any additional costs necessary. It is their responsibility to build buildings which are safe and sound for sale or for occupation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised two other points about the checking of structural plans and architectural plans. He asked why structural plans are not checked. The checking of structural plans by building authorities is not, in fact, a universal practice. It varies from country to country, from city to city, and from municipality to municipality. In the United States, for example, some States check, others do not. In the City of New York which has some of the tallest buildings in the world, I understand that structural plans are not checked by the government authority. The building authority relies on the professional engineers for safe structural designs. So, as I said, conditions vary. In some cases, the local conditions determine the practice of the authority. For example, in Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, because of their geological conditions and because they are also subject to typhoons, they follow a different practice and they do check the structural plans and drawings. But even in the case of Japan and Taiwan, I am told that checking is only for buildings above a certain height. So it is not for all buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own system in Singapore has evolved over a period of time to suit local needs. In fact, we have made changes over the years to our own laws that govern structural plans and the submission of structural plans to the Government. In 1970, for example, the Professional Engineers Act came into effect to regulate professional practice. And in 1973, the Building Control Act was legislated which laid down the details and procedures for the submission of plans and how they should be drawn up. In 1979, the Building Control Regulations were updated and new sets of regulations came into effect to provide better control over the design and over the construction practices in the industry and also to ensure structural stability. These Regulations are constantly under review.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot and do not claim to have a foolproof system. No country can. Structural failures do happen even under the best system. There have been cases of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> major structural failures involving the loss of many lives in other countries which have also very stringent procedures, for example, the United States and the United Kingdom. I am sure Members must be aware of some of these disasters. No system can completely eliminate failures which are due to human acts or omissions. The case of the Hotel New World is the only major disaster that we have had in peace-time in our history. The incident is an extreme one where failure resulted from a combination of grossly unprofessional practice, poor construction, poor maintenance, complete disregard for the signs of poor structural condition in the building and everything that could go wrong due to human failings went wrong in the Hotel New World.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have started checking the plans earlier just because other countries check their plans? I think we have to be careful. If we had done so, where should we draw the line on the level of scrutiny that we should have? Should we now plunge in and implement all the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry? Here again, I think we should be prudent, careful, before we implement all the recommendations. The recommendations, of course, provide a valuable basis but we must take into account the views and opinions of those practitioners, those who are actually involved in the building industry, before we implement or introduce new measures. Developers and other Singaporeans will have to bear an unnecessarily high cost if we just blindly implement all the recommendations of the Commission. Therefore, we have set up this Working Committee in order to identify and establish which recommendations can be implemented and how they should be implemented. As I said in my statement, we want to try and ensure maximum safety at a reasonable cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member drew attention to Chapter 11 of the Commission's Report where the Commission made some comments on the present practice of not checking the structural plans which are submitted to DBCD. He wanted to know why only architectural plans are checked but not structural plans. Whether structural plans should have been checked or not is subject
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to legal interpretation. As I said, it is not a universal practice. Why does DBCD check only architectural plans and not the structural plans? First of all, the standards and specifications for structural plans are clearly spelt out in detail in the regulations under the Building Control (Construction) Regulations. All structural submissions must comply very strictly with these regulations. There is no question of any waiver or modification. If a load has to be carried, it must have a sufficient number of columns to carry that load and there is no question of saying something less will do. So the DBCD, in fact, does not have to check the plans because the regulations are clear and the structural engineers are expected to follow these regulations. The DBCD will not entertain any request for waiver or amendment or relaxation of these regulations, as there can be no compromise on structural safety. It is for these reasons that the practice so far has been not to check the structural plans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of architectural plans, the regulations cannot be so clear as to cover every possible event or every possible variation of use and the conditions of the site. Building regulations for architectural plans touch merely on space, lighting and ventilation, and they do not cover all aspects of the building. Many architectural aspects of a building are determined by use as well as by the site conditions. For example, if a building is in a particular site, near a major drain, then the Drainage Department may have a say in what the setback should be. Or the Fire Department may want to have a special say, and the Ministry of the Environment similarly. So these special requirements cannot be laid down in detail, and therefore the architectural plans are checked against the specifics of the use as well as of the site.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, unlike structural plans, in the case of architectural plans, DBCD will allow a waiver or relaxation of certain building regulations. These may be determined by, as I said, the nature of the site or for some other technical grounds. For example, although for architectural plans the rules or regulations require certain setback from the boundary, a particular site may be such that to insist rigidly on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> such a setback will be not equitable or reasonable. Therefore, a certain relaxation is allowed. So a waiver is granted for such cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example would be ventilation. If a factory is involved in the production of goods which have to be completely kept free from dust, then of course the architectural plans will not provide for windows. And these normal ventilation requirements or light requirements may have to be waived. So these waivers are given depending upon the particular circumstances of the case. And that is why architectural plans are checked but structural plans, as I mentioned just now, are not subject to such waivers and relaxation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I have just stated, the Working Committee will study very closely the reservations of the Commission of Inquiry with regard to the non-checking of structural plans and, if necessary, the present practice will be changed and the laws required for the changes will be presented to Parliament.

I cannot give you leave to make such a statement. It would be highly improper for you to make such a statement in this House and I rule that it is out of order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order No. 23 says clearly that "no controversial matter may be brought forward nor may debate arise upon the explanation." From what I see in your statement, what you want to raise is bound to be controversial and will

  <br> certainly give rise to debate. The Commission of Inquiry was appointed by the President of the Republic and not by Parliament. Its establishment and its powers are derived from an instrument signed by the President on 25th March 1987. It is a quasi-judicial body whose proceedings are not subject to the control of Parliament. The Commission has since announced that it will have its first public sitting on 25th May. Anything you wish to say or any application you wish to make concerning the Commission must therefore be made to the Commission when it meets.

   <b>ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>11.57 am
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Environmental Public Health Act was passed in 1969 when Government realized the importance of having a clean environment and saw an urgent need to protect the environment from further deterioration. A large part of our population was then living in slums, streets were filthy and drains choked with rubbish. There were no effective anti-littering laws. Water pollution control was non-existent and aquatic life was dying in our polluted rivers. That was Singapore in the 60s, Sir, and many have forgotten how it looked, or realized at the time, the damage that was being done to our environment and to the ecology. Many accepted the way it was, the filth and all. Hawkers were all over the place, blocking roads and dirtying the drains and surroundings. We had frequent outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, malaria, to name but a few of the infectious diseases around us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come a long way since then. Today, our air is clean, our rivers are much cleaner and even the water in drains is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cleaner. The Act has served us well. However, many changes have taken place since the Act was enacted 18 years ago. Singapore's skyline has changed. A whole new generation of citizens has come to the front. Society has become more educated and affluent and thus people are now less and less tolerant to pollution and expect an even cleaner and healthier environment. Today, most of the basic public health problems have been resolved. We can now concentrate on other areas and set new directions to attain a higher quality of life. To do this, amendments and new provisions to the existing Environmental Public Health Act are desirable and necessary. However, Sir, as the amendments to be made to the existing Act would be extensive, it was decided to rewrite the whole Act. In the process the weaknesses of the present legislation have been tightened and recent advances and trends in public health incorporated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now highlight the more important features of the Bill under five broad categories.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal dumping of refuse. Sir, more stringent measures to deter dumping of refuse are necessary. It is important to eliminate such inconsiderate acts as illegal dumps can give rise to health hazards, for example, the breeding of mosquitoes and rodents. It also incurs needless public money to clear away such dumps. In 1986, for instance, 167 cases of illegal dumping were detected and a total of 220 tonnes of refuse were removed from these sites by the Ministry of the Environment at a cost of $40,000. Apart from this, there is also a possibility that industrial wastes containing hazardous substances which may pollute our water courses may be dumped illegally. So in the proposed amendment, Sir, vehicles which are used for illegal dumping of refuse may be confiscated. Under clause 20(3) of the Bill where any vehicle is used in disposing or dumping of refuse, waste or any other article in any public place such vehicle may be seized by any police officer or authorized public health officer. Under clause 20(4) the Court on convicting any person of the offence shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23, Sir, provides that no person shall construct, establish, maintain or operate any disposal facility without the permission of the Commissioner of Public Health. This is to prevent the use of vacant lands as private dumping grounds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tighter control of industrial wastes. Sir, in recent years, many new industrial chemicals which are hazardous have been introduced. There are no provisions in the present Act to control the disposal of industrial and toxic wastes. And as you know, Sir, the improper disposal of such wastes can give rise to serious health hazards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 27 and 28 of the Bill empower the Commissioner of Public Health to request the owner or occupier of any workplace to furnish him with any information on the amount, type and nature of any industrial waste produced in such place and to recycle or treat any industrial waste from these premises before it is brought to any public disposal facility for disposal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 prohibits any person from taking any toxic waste to any public disposal facility or treatment without the permission of the Commissioner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Clause 30 of the Bill, Sir, the Commissioner may serve a notice on the occupier of any work premises requiring him to execute certain work or do certain things if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the quality of toxic industrial waste produced in such premises is likely to be excessive or unduly toxic.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensing of private waste removal and disposal contractors. Sir, the business of collecting refuse or waste by private waste contractors may need to be controlled in the future to safeguard public health and the interest of customers against malpractice by such contractors. This is done through obtaining the permission of the Commissioner of Public Health, under Clause 31.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food establishments, markets and hawkers. In the present Act, Sir, the provisions dealing with food establishments, hawkers and markets are contained in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> three separate parts. These provisions are, however, similar and repetition is therefore unnecessary. To eliminate needless duplications, the three parts are brought together into one single part in the Bill. However, new powers are proposed for the Commissioner of Public Health in dealing with unlicensed food establishments. The Commissioner may close an unlicensed food establishment upon failure of the offender to comply with an order of closure under Clause 32 of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control of noise nuisance at construction sites. This is a new provision and it covers Clauses 47 to 49 of the Bill. Under this provision, the Commissioner of Public Health may specify the type of plant or machinery to be used, the hours of operation and the noise level that is permitted. This is necessary as Singapore becomes urbanized and construction work is carried out closer to the population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are, as I have said, some of the more important features of the Environmental Public Health Bill (1987).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to stress that the Bill will make a major contribution towards improved environmental health in Singapore and its enactment is essential for a cleaner and healthier Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the GPC on Health and Environment, I would like to comment on the Bill before this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Minister, the purpose of the Bill is to bring about a more effective control of the environment and to incorporate some of the new advances in the field of environmental public health so that all of us will continue to enjoy a safe and clean environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself, as the Minister has outlined, covers so many areas that it is not possible to summarize many of the points that the GPC have discussed. But here let me just go over one common area of concern, while other Members may want to talk about other aspects of the Bill. This common area of concern pertains to the stiff penalties imposed on illegal hawking, spitting, littering and illegal dumping.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal hawking. According to a recent profile done by the Ministry's officials on illegal hawkers, it was shown that about 82% of them are under 50 years of age. In fact about 50% are between 20 and 40 years. In other words, these are able-bodied men and women who could be working in factories, in the services or in the construction sector where for certain types of jobs there is still a labour shortage. So why do they go into illegal hawking? Is it because they are too choosy, preferring flexible hours and possibly sizeable earnings to manual work, shift work, or say work as beauty saloon assistants? Or is it because people want to strike out on their own and be their own bosses? Or is it because, as some officials believe, that the present fines for illegal hawking are too low and therefore the hawkers dare to flout the law? By this Bill, under clause 42(1), hawkers who infringe on public health requirements and hawkers who operate without a licence would now be liable upon conviction to a fine of $1,000 for a first offence and $4,000 or three months of imprisonment or both for subsequent offences. As such, these fines are very stiff, although they are meant to be maximum penalties and therefore are meant to be deterrents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the present fine of $500 to us is already quite stiff. It is stiff because up to 1981 to 1982 the median gross monthly income of employed persons in Singapore was around $500, according to the Annual Labour Force survey. Beginning in 1982, this median gross monthly income started to rise above $500 to $511 in 1983 to $667 in 1986. Is that the reason then for the Ministry to raise the fine to $1,000 in order to keep up with the rise in income? If it is a matter of inflation, it cannot be because we have had very low rates of inflation in the past few years. In fact, for a couple of years we have had negative inflation. If we take a look at the number of illegal hawkers prosecuted over the past five years (these figures were given to us by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary on March 4 at the last sitting) we note that the number has gone up from 4,915 in 1982 to 6,441 in 1984, and then 8,032 in 1985 and 8,670 in 1986. There was a sharp rise in the number of cases prosecuted for 1985 and 1986. No doubt this could have been due to the fact that those two years were
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> recession years and therefore there could be many more people who were engaged in illegal hawking because of unemployment or because of reduction in incomes. However, we also believe that the rise in the number of prosecutions had to do with the fact that the Ministry's officials actually stepped up enforcement action during those two years as was reported in the press.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is the Ministry cannot rely simply on stiffer fines. It has to maintain vigorous enforcement if the problem of illegal hawking is to be contained effectively. Of course it is very difficult to catch the illegal hawkers. They literally run. And public sympathy always goes towards those illegal hawkers who are particularly in financial hardship. But the point I want to make is, again, that the problem cannot be contained based on stiffer fines alone. There could be other measures in addition to these.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to offences in respect of uncleanliness in public places, clause 21 of the Bill would appear to lump together illegal dumping, spitting and littering, with the penalty for all three types of offences being uniformly set at $1,000 for the first conviction and $2,000 for subsequent convictions. But the seriousness of the three types of offences is actually quite different.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, spitting and littering are anti-social habits which must be curtailed if our efforts to keep Singapore clean are not to be obliterated. But let us recognize that social habits take a long time to correct and a lot of public education is called for. Again, if we look at the number of prosecution for spitting and littering in the past five years, we would see that public education and campaigns do indeed play an important part in containing such anti-social habits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For spitting, the number of cases prosecuted by the Ministry in 1982 was only two cases, 1983 one. Then in 1984 there was a public campaign against spitting and the number of cases prosecuted rose sharply to 128 that year followed by 139 in 1985, after which it dropped to 81 in 1986. Now, it is, of course, inconceivable that in 1982 to 1983 there were so few people who actually committed this offence. But it is highly probable that in 1986, two

  <br> years after the campaign, the number of offenders effectively dropped. Thus with anti-social habits such as spitting, both public education and the level of enforcement will help to keep down the number of offences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same with littering. In 1984 the number of cases of littering prosecuted saw a steep rise from 11,560 of the previous year to 28,026. The greatest majority of these cases were apprehended in HDB estates. There was a massive campaign against littering in general and against killer litter, in particular. After 1984 the number of cases declined again. Would this new law, would a doubling of the fines produce a doubling of the deterrent effect? Interestingly, the raising of the fine for spitting and littering, although it has already been publicized in the press, has not aroused much public uproar so far. Is it because Singaporeans are now well-off that they can afford to pay such stiff fines for indulging in careless anti-social acts? Or is it because Singaporeans have now grown accustomed to stiff fines and to shake them out of their complacency one needs to shock them? One standing joke among foreigners and locals alike about our clean city, Sir, is that Singapore is a "fine" city. Such comments are not complimentary to us at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult for me to produce statistics or hard evidence to show that a certain kind of psychological impact has been produced by stiff penalties such as this that can cost to the public. We do not know for sure whether as a result directly attributable to stiff laws, rules and regulations that Singaporeans may harbour a certain sense of resentment against the strong arm of the law that covers so many aspects of their lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared, as members of the GPC, to accept the new fines for spitting and littering, accept them as they are meant as strong deterrents only. Still, I think it will do us good to reflect upon the possible impact on popular sentiments and psychology associated with the raising of these stiff fines.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to the question of illegal dumping. At first, it does not seem right to treat a person who has unloaded a whole truck-load of refuse in a public place equally with a person who spits or drops a piece of paper on a pavement. The only similarity between the two types of offences is that they are both difficult to catch. But the cost to the Government and therefore cost to the tax-paying public in clearing up one truck-load of refuse is many more times than in cleaning up litter or spittle in the streets and for all you know, as the Minister also mentioned, some loads that may have been dumped on vacant lands and deserted areas may contain materials harmful to human health. Therefore, as compared to spitting and littering, stiffer penalties should be considered for illegal dumping. We see that this is actually provided for in the Bill in clause 20(3) of the Bill which allows for the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles involved in illegal dumping. This is one way. Another way is to fine the driver of the vehicle as well, as in clause 20(10). Also, those people who have hitherto allowed their vacant lands to be used as illegal dumping grounds would now be brought under the law, as per clauses 20 and 23.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, illegal dumping grounds exist. Some are pieces of private land left vacant. Others are lands acquired already by public authorities but are awaiting clearance and development. As such, these illegal dumps shift from one clearance site to another. But private contractors engaged in the removal of refuse know where to go. I was brought by some friends recently to some of these places. It was a Sunday. What I saw did not amuse me. Not only was there a steady stream of trucks carrying refuse into such grounds and coming out empty but there were also suspicious characters hanging around the dump sites watching and, I was told, profiting from the activities. In some cases, these individuals are watchmen of the vacant lands and their activities are not known to the employers or the owners of the land. In other cases, these individuals are shifty hooligans who just pounce on every chance to make illegal money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the above forms are the predominant forms of illegal
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> dumping. I would suspect that in the majority of cases it is the isolated individuals who dump in all sorts of places, even along expressways, when nobody is watching, especially in the dark of night. This brings me to wonder why people choose to run the risk and dump illegally in spite of the risks and in spite of the fact that there are two Government dumping grounds, and in spite of the fact that for small loads of rubbish under one ton the Government does not charge any dumping fees at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary to make the penalties stiff for illegal dumping. On the other hand, we believe that the Ministry needs to re-examine its own schedule of charges for the dumping grounds or incineration plants. It is not just a matter of convenience that people dump illegally. In fact, in a couple of the places I visited, they were no more than 3-4 km away from the Government dumping ground. While distance and time are money, the direct costs of having to pay dumping fees are very important in the consideration of private contractors engaged in refuse disposal. If the dumping fees are seen to be too high, it is so much more tempting to just unload when no one is watching. Just imagine the savings to the contractors or to the individual operator when with one big lorry-load of 10-12 tons of refuse, he pays between $150 and $180 to the Ministry at $15 per ton, whereas if he succeeds in dumping illegally he pays very little or none at all. And trucks make several trips a day. So the temptation is that much bigger for him to dump illegally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is savings to these private contractors is cost to the Government. In fact, the Minister himself also pointed this out, because the Government later has to clear up the refuse from such places. My friends told me an even more serious story. I believe it is somewhat exaggerated. They said that actually when the Government clears up one illegal dump for development of the land, it engages private contractors to remove the refuse. But what some of these private contractors do is to remove the refuse to other illegal dumps which later have to be cleared by the Government again when development comes along. So the costs of illegal dump-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ing are hidden and because of these hidden costs we may not be totally aware of the seriousness of the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, as far as the Ministry is concerned, we think that the problem of illegal dumping calls for a three-prong approach - enforcement, stiffer fines or penalties, and lower dumping fees. It is timely to examine the schedule of fees again. Of course, the Government has to recover the cost of the land, at least its opportunity cost, but at the same time its fees actually include the element of scarcity rent as well as monopoly rent. But how to arrive at the schedule of fees which make it possible for the Government to maintain its operations, recover some of its development and operational costs but at the same time be affordable to the operators? My GPC proposes to discuss this point further with the Ministry. It may take some time. We may need the help of economists. But we would like really to look into this matter together with the Ministry further and we would assure the public that whatever changes that may be required or may be recommended will be fair to both the big and the small operators engaged in refuse removal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC, in general, also supports the provision of clause 31 which requires the licensing of the refuse removal businesses. We feel that this will help the Ministry to exercise better control, ensuring proper environmental health standards in a situation where up to one-third of the total amount annually of refuse collected is done by the private contractors. To be exact, in 1985, it was 34.3%. In 1986, it was 34.9%. Since licences are a means of livelihood, they can act as effective methods of making sure that refuse disposal is done properly by private contractors. At the same time, perhaps the Ministry could look at helping the private contractors to upgrade both the equipment, vehicles, raise productivity and to ensure the adherence to environmental public health standards. However, we feel that the upgrading process should be given some time to complete so that the private contractors, especially the smaller ones, could find reasonable ways to comply and to adjust.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this, I would leave the debate to other members of the GPC and my other colleagues to continue on other aspects of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Sir, I would like to seek some clarification from the Minister. Clause 34 which replaces section 42 of the Environmental Public Health Act being repealed provides for the licensing of itinerant hawkers. Today, apart from the ice-cream vendors who are mobile, all hawkers are now operating from stationary stalls. In connection with the retention of this provision, may I ask the Minister whether it is now the intention of his Ministry to re-introduce itinerant hawkers into the Singapore scene.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill deals specifically with noise control and clause 47, in particular, deals with the control of noise on construction sites. As we all know, Sir, many construction companies in Singapore are still using the noisy diesel piling hammers in their piling works. With the enactment of this Bill, will the Minister or his Ministry take immediate action against those using noisy diesel piling hammers or allow them a reasonable grace period?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Bill is a step forward in our fight to preserve a higher standard of environmental public health. The proposed amendments serve to tighten the weaknesses in the system as well as incorporate changes in line with trends in public health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch briefly on clause 21 pertaining to the limits on fine for persons prosecuted in court for littering and clause 54 on the provision and the conditions of our public toilets. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment Ministry disclosed earlier this year in this House that some 8,449 persons were prosecuted in court for littering last year. This works out to a ratio of 1 in 300 Singaporeans caught and prosecuted in court for littering last year. This figure is not low if we were to include all those who littered and were not caught. A majority of these people prosecuted were caught littering in HDB estates. The amendment to double the upper limit on the fine from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> $500 to $1,000 will serve as a psychological deterrent to would-be litter-bugs. At best, it is a temporary solution to improving the cleanliness of our environment. I am not sure that if we were to continue to increase the limit on the fine, it will be a viable long- term solution towards a litter-free environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, littering is more common in HDB estates than in other public places for the chances of being caught throwing litter from a highrise flat are indeed very slim compared to a similar act in a public place, be it at a market, at the hawker centre, at the cinema or at the bus stop. Stepping up enforcement by Ministry officials may be a solution but this can be a very labour-intensive and costly affair for the State. Ultimately, the solution lies in education. Cleanliness begins in the school and at home but this is an on-going and indeed a longer-term solution. There could be in the not too distant future a more effective solution to our problem of littering in housing estates and this could be found if we introduce the Town Council concept of running HDB estates. Under this scheme, the amount of conservancy charges could be pegged to the amount of litter to be cleared. The lesser the amount, the lower the charges. The more litter to be cleared, the higher the charges. This scheme has the advantage of not just promoting greater neighbourliness among residents but also to get residents to cooperate with each other to keep their flats, their void decks clean and tidy . Therein may lie the solution to our littering problem in HDB estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to cover very briefly clause 54 which states that the Commissioner for Public Health "may provide and maintain in proper and convenient situations toilets for public use". Sir, we discussed this subject among the GPC and its Resource Panel and it was felt that there is generally a lack of public toilets today in popular public places like the East Coast Parkway, the West Coast Park and fitness parks or barbecue parks. Very often, we see picnickers having to walk distances to wash and change themselves. And at the beach, many are lazy, many choose to change themselves in public. Some choose to wrap themselves in towel
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and change. To us Singaporeans, this may be a common sight. But to the foreigners, to the tourists, this is something quite unusual an act in public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> No.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I think the Ministry should seriously review the adequacy of public toilets and provide more public toilets in popular public places used by Singaporeans over the week-end. Sir, the lack of public toilets may have some correlation with the condition of public toilets today. The insanitary condition of some of our public toilets has been raised many a time in this House. I do not wish to debate it at great length today. It suffice me to mention that the problem of dirty toilets is still with us. I am aware that the Ministry of the Environment has been conscientiously tackling this problem through education and through enforcement action. It bears repeating that we cannot rely on the Ministry alone to solve this problem. We, the users, have a part to play too. In my experience as an MP for my constituency, I have made many a house visit and upon requests by residents inspected complaints of leaking toilets. Not surprisingly, I found most of these toilets in the home were neat, clean and tidy. Sir, we must be civic-minded. We should use and treat public toilets in the same manner as we use and treat our own toilets in the home. I hope the Ministry of the Environment could help convey this message through users of public toilets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lam Son -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lam Son (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say a few words on this Bill. First, I would like to reinforce the point brought up by the Member for Kaki Bukit on the increase in the maximum penalty for littering from $500 to $1,000. I think this is very stiff - $1,000 for littering one piece of paper on the road. But I was told by the officers at the Ministry during our meeting with them that this is only to act as a deterrent. The maximum penalty has never been implemented. The $500 has never been implemented too. But if you do not implement the maximum fine, how is it going to act as a deterrent? If people come to know that you do not, in fact, punish
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> them with the $1,000 penalty, they will not respond to your heavier penalty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why is there a need for greater deterrent? I feel that perhaps we are a bit over-concerned with the littering problem in Singapore. I do not think our problem is that serious. In fact, on my way to Parliament from Katong, I could not detect a piece of litter on the road. I think that shows how clean we are in Singapore. In fact, Singapore is cleaner than most other cities in the world and, as we all know, we have the reputation of being a Clean and a Green City. Our present anti-litter law is very tough and with the strict enforcement operations and public education, we have been able over the years to achieve a very high standard of public cleanliness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, littering is confined to only certain locations, certain spots along the East Coast Parkway. Even our HDB estates are very clean. It is only in isolated vacant turfed areas that we find litter. But on the whole, our estates are clean. But to tackle today's problem, we do not need to increase the maximum penalty. We need to step up enforcement and to give publicity to the present anti-litter laws and general education of the public on the need for good habits in public places. Increasing the maximum penalty to $1,000 may have the initial psychological threat. But in the long run, it will have no greater effect than the $500 penalty. The truth is that litter-bugs get away. They do it because they know they will be able to get away with it. How often does one get fined for throwing litter? Perhaps once in a lifetime, and I think that is a very small risk for them to take.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as our society is now more mature, the educational approach of solving this littering problem is more acceptable to the people. Public signs should carry friendly advice rather than threat of punishment. So instead of "No Littering. Fine $500", I think we should say, "Thank you for keeping our parks clean" or "Thank you for not littering". It is just like the No Smoking Campaign. Before we used to say, "No Smoking", now we say, "Thank you for not smoking". So although littering is still a problem, it is not as serious, in my view, as the problem of spitting and urination in public places and the stench
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that is associated with our public toilets, which was hinted by the Member for Kaki Bukit. I think it is time for our Ministry to step up enforcement to further wipe out all these anti-social habits that belong to the colonial past of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 47 and 48 refer to the control of the problem of noise pollution on construction sites. Singapore is small and densely populated. Any major construction will give rise to noise pollution. Over the years with major housing development, noise pollution was at its highest level and the people had no choice but to live with the noise. Today, with the decline in housing construction, noise pollution is not so much of a problem. This new provision has come a little late. But, nonetheless, it is still appropriate for the Ministry to act now to control noise pollution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has not stated the criteria for noise tolerance level. I believe this would be followed up in the regulations. But I believe the criteria for noise tolerance level at construction sites should vary from location to location, depending on the type of buildings nearby, whether the building nearby is a school, a hospital or a residential estate. I would like to suggest that perhaps the Ministry should not be too strict on the criteria for noise emitted from construction sites, as such noise is usually of a short duration and also because it is very costly to employ anti-noise pollution equipment. For example, using the bore piling is very much more expensive than the traditional diesel piling. The Ministry has already set up rules restricting the time for noise-emitting activities from construction sites. This is one way of controlling noise. The Ministry should perhaps look further into restricting the time even more if noise pollution is still a problem, for example, during the period of school examinations when students are studying. The Ministry should perhaps also set up a consultancy service to advise contractors and other Ministries in planning their development projects. This will be much better than taking remedial action against offenders as remedial measures are likely to be more costly and less effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt the Environmental Public Health Bill is a tough piece of legislation to protect our environment. But Government regulations, no matter how strict, will not serve any useful purpose if they are not followed by vigorous implementation and enforcement. In this respect, I would like to say that it is my impression that the officers in the Ministry of Environment are committed and energetic in enforcing the regulations of the Ministry, and it is through their commitment and their dedication that we have a good, clean environment. However, nobody can deny that there is still room for improvement, evident by the many offenders that have been warned or prosecuted and many more who have got away time and again. I would like to suggest that the Minister consider introducing an incentive scheme to further motivate the officers. I would leave it to the Minister to consider the type of scheme that is more suitable for these officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must also point out that I have not so infrequently received complaints from stallholders and constituents that some officers in their eagerness to discharge their duties have appeared to be unreasonable and have been accused of abusing or misusing their power. As we are encouraging courtesy, we should not allow our civil servants to show discourtesy in discharging their duties, no matter how difficult they may be. Thank you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I support the Bill standing in the name of the Minister for the Environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has vast improvements over the existing one, particularly in two areas - the control of the disposal of industrial waste and the control of noise pollution. The disposal and removal of industrial waste has been an important issue ever since our country started to industrialize. Industrial waste can be toxic, ignitable, corrosive and even dangerously reactive. These wastes are generated as paint slugs from appliance factories, as dregs of chrome and nickel from metal plating shops, as spent raw materials for varnish and detergents at chemical plants. Industrial waste from semi-conductors and micro-chip fabrication operations are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> highly toxic. It is, therefore, of extreme importance to our environment that industrial waste be properly treated, recycled and disposed of. In developed countries, industry is required by law to keep a record of the industrial waste they generate in terms of type and weight, how they dispose of it and to whom they give it to for disposal. The person receiving the industrial waste for disposal is also required to keep a record of the industrial waste he receives and his method of disposal. Up to the present, there is no comprehensive way to compel industry to conform to this practice. At present the Ministry of the Environment has no regulations to allow them to monitor the disposal of industrial waste. If an organization chooses to dispose of the industrial waste illegally, they can only be punished after it has caused damage to the environment. For example, if an organization disposes of industrial waste by illegal dumping, they can only be fined. If the organization happens to dump the toxic waste near water catchment areas, thus causing pollution to water resources, they have to be prosecuted under the Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act. If they dispose of industrial waste by illegal incineration, they have to be prosecuted under the Clean Air Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these deterrents do not solve the problem at its roots. Nothing could be done by the Ministry until the offender has caused pollution. Sections 24 to 31 of the Bill now require the industry to keep records of the industrial waste right through the disposal chain which therefore allow the Ministry of Environment to monitor very closely the disposal system of industrial waste.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1976, the US Government has passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act which directed their environment protection agency to regulate hazardous waste requiring them to be tracked and handled from creation to disposal a licensed and inspected facility. In 1978, the ECC also published a document which spelt similar guidelines. It seems only now that we have finally caught up with these regulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill is passed, I hope the Ministry of the Environment officers could
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> play both an advisory role as well as a policing role when enforcing clauses 24 to 31 of this Bill. The industry will need some help as to how to comply with the new regulations. I urge the Ministry to set up an advisory committee on the handling and disposal of industrial waste to provide assistance to the industry, particularly to tell them where to go for help if they do not know how to treat and dispose the industrial waste.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other clauses that are welcome additions are, of course, clauses 47 to 49 which deal with noise control. But these clauses concentrate only on noise pollution caused by construction work. Does construction work here include renovation work of apartments? As this Bill now includes a section on noise control, I would have thought the amendment would cover areas of noise pollution caused by public performance or noise caused by people playing games late into the night near residential areas, also on aspects of noise caused by aeroplanes taking off and landing at airports as well as noise nuisance caused by heavy traffic movement near housing residential apartments. Will the Ministry please clarify why clauses 47 to 49 are restricted to construction noise only?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Members of the GPC on Health and the Environment for their interest in the Bill. I shall now deal with the points raised by them. But before I begin, perhaps a better slogan to the one proposed by the Member for Telok Blangah is: Please try to save your $500 by not littering!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changkat and concurrently the Chairman of the GPC on Health and the Environment and also the other Members of the GPC have expressed concern on the need for stiffer penalties as recommended in the Bill. They want to know the rationale for the increase in the maximum fines for offences like littering, spitting, illegal hawking and illegal dumping despite the fact, they say, that the number of such offences has decreased over the years. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the increase in fines for the offences mentioned is really intended to impress upon the recalcitrants of the seriousness
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the offences they are committing. The majority of Singaporeans I believe like to live in a clean and green city and they are proud of our reputation for being such. The Government has done short of a miracle or near miracle in cleaning up Singapore and this is something which we should all be proud of. No other government, I think, has done or has been able to accomplish an exercise of the magnitude we have undertaken. Therefore it is in our interest not to allow all these years of effort to be eclipsed by some of the easier approaches that have been suggested in the course of the debate on this Bill this morning.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a long-term goal, we hope that every citizen of Singapore will have enough pride and civic consciousness to not only refrain from polluting the environment but also to exert peer pressure on those who do so that we can eliminate their bad practices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether Town Councils will be more effective in controlling littering, as suggested by the Member for Kaki Bukit, it is not easy for me to say at this point of time. But where Town Councils are successful in communicating closely with the residents of the estates under their charge, there is every confidence that they may succeed. But on the Member for Kaki Bukit's suggestion that the lesser the litter they produce, the lesser the conservancy charge they pay, my question is: where will they throw away the litter in order to pay the lesser conservancy charge as proposed? This will only increase more illegal dumping, I think.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of illegal dumping, I am glad that many Members agree that there is need for stringent measures to be taken in order to deter this act. Illegal dumps, apart from being potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes and rodents, may also contain, as I had mentioned in my Second Reading speech just now, toxic chemicals which may pollute our watercourses and hence give rise to health hazards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on the subject of illegal dumping, the Member for Changkat has suggested
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that apart from enforcement and stiffer penalties, perhaps the Ministry should look into other ways which would encourage people to bring their refuse to the incineration plants and dumping grounds. I certainly welcome her suggestion and perhaps my Ministry together with the GPC should look into this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Buona Vista has touched on Clause 34. Let me explain. The retention of Clause 34 in the Bill is to allow the present itinerant hawkers who are selling bread and ice-cream to continue with their trade. As to whether the retention of this clause may lead to the introduction of itinerant hawkers in Singapore is a subject, I believe, being discussed between the Ministry and the Members of the GPC arising from the GPC Chairman's proposal that the Ministry should allow handicraft-type street hawking to be introduced in Singapore. And I think the discussions are still going on now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Buona Vista also wants to know whether the Ministry would take action not to allow any more diesel piling hammers to be used at construction sites. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member may be pleased to know that a Technical Committee under the chairmanship of the Environment Ministry with membership from the HDB, URA, JTC, PWD and also the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) was formed in 1984 to look into the problem of noise at construction sites. Views of the Singapore Contractors' Association Limited (SCAL) and the views of Prof. Broms, an expert in piling at the NTI, were also sought. And these views were incorporated by the Committee in arriving at their decisions. The Committee has recommended that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Diesel piling hammers be phased out gradually and, in the first instance, use of diesel piling hammers should be banned in the Central Business District and within 200 metres from schools, hospitals and other such sensitive areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A grace period of one year be given so that the contractors will have sufficient response time. In fact, the contractors have only asked for a 9-month grace period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Restriction on the use of piling hammers be applied gradually to all
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> densely built-up areas in Singapore at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say, Sir, that in this regard our local contractors have been most cooperative and they have been voluntarily phasing out the old diesel machines which are noisy and pollutive and replacing them with less pollutive machines like the hydraulic hammers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Buona Vista also wants to know whether the replacement of diesel piling hammers with something else will cost more in terms of the cost of the project. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, among all the methods of piling, bored piling is about the best alternative. But as the Member for Telok Blangah has mentioned, it could be very costly. But if for some reason driven piles are preferred, then a suitable alternative to diesel piling hammers is the hydraulic hammers. They are less noisy and less pollutive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piling cost using hydraulic hammers is about 10% more than that using diesel piling hammers. And since the piling cost is usually about 5% of the total building cost, then the increase in piling cost would amount to only about half a per cent of the total building cost if hydraulic hammers are used instead of diesel piling hammers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kaki Bukit has touched on the cleanliness of public toilets and I am glad that he says that the measures taken by the Ministry are not sufficient to bring about clean public toilets and that the users themselves have a role to play. And as I mentioned in this House before, the users must play a role in observing good personal hygiene and enough civic consciousness to make sure that the public toilets are clean for the other users.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the lack or not enough public toilets at popular public places, I will certainly ask my Ministry to look into it. For the information of this House, Sir, my Ministry plans to launch another campaign sometime this year to reinforce the message to keep our public toilets clean. The target groups of this campaign will be the managements of public toilets and, of course, the users of public toilets, and also the maintenance and cleansing contractors. This campaign will be run on a nation-wide basis and will involve other
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government Ministries and departments, private organizations as well as cleansing contractors. During this campaign, my Ministry will impress upon the public that it is a basic courtesy and a social responsibility that users of public toilets do not y.use or misuse the facilities provided. And with the cooperation of everyone concerned, I think we can hope to see marked improvements in the state of our public toilets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck has suggested that perhaps the Ministry should set up an advisory committee on the handling and disposal of industrial waste and that it is for this committee to render assistance to industries which may require assistance with regard to the handling as well as the disposal of toxic wastes. I welcome this suggestion and I will certainly ask my Ministry to look into it.
  <br>

   <b>COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(THIRD REPORT)</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Paper Parl. 6 of 1987)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, it is my most unpleasant duty as well as a necessary one to bring before this House three Motions reporting on the Committee of Privileges' Reports for the consideration of the House. Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their Third Report contained in Paper Parl. 6 of 1987 and resolves -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam is guilty of abuse of the privileges of Parliament; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that a fine of $1,000 be imposed upon him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never in the history of this House that in less than a year the Committee of Privileges have been summoned five times to consider complaints against a Member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will recapitulate the event, Sir. On 18th March 1986, in the course of a supplementary question the former Member for Anson, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, asked the Minister for Home Affairs, Prof. Jayakumar, whether he knew that someone was arrested by the Police in the early hours of 1st March 1986 and was not released until 3.00 pm that afternoon. He also alleged that the detention was unlawful and unjustified.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 27th March 1986 at the Committee of Supply debate, Mr Jeyaretnam raised the same subject of the alleged detention of that person.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both occasions, Mr Jeyaretnam was asked by the Minister and his Minister of State, Dr Lee Boon Yang, to furnish the details. Whereupon on 22nd April 1986, Mr Jeyaretnam repeated the allegation in a letter to Prof. Jayakumar and gave the name of the person as one Lim Poh Huat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being concerned about the seriousness of the allegation and having assumed that Mr Jeyaretnam would not have made the allegation without first satisfying himself that there was credence to the claim, Prof. Jayakumar ordered a thorough investigation into the allegation but found that there was no truth whatsoever in it. No person by the name of Lim Poh Huat was arrested or detained at any police station on the date and time as alleged by Mr Jeyaretnam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 27th March and 29th July 1986 when the matter was again brought up in Parliament, there was a series of eight letters between Mr Jeyaretnam and Dr Lee Boon Yang. Up till 23rd July 1986, Mr Jeyaretnam refused to cooperate with the Ministry of Home Affairs by giving them information on Lim Poh Huat or producing Lim Poh Huat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, at the Parliament sitting on 27th March 1986, Mr Jeyaretnam also claimed that he had made a report on the matter at the Joo Chiat Police Station. But in a subsequent letter and on examination by the Committee of Privileges he denied that he had made a report to the Joo Chiat Police Station. He claimed that his statement on 27th March was a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently at a Parliament sitting on 29th July 1986, after a lengthy debate it became clear that Mr Jeyaretnam's allegation had no basis and that he had misled the House. He was given several opportunities to apologize but he refused. Whereupon Prof. Jayakumar had no choice but to complain to the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deliberations of the Committee are in this Third Report of the Committee. Several witnesses including Mr Lim Poh Huat and Mr Jeyaretnam were called before the Committee. The Committee considered two issues arising from the Lim Poh Huat saga, namely, (1) whether Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam took any steps to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> verify the bona fide of the complaint; and (2) the failure of Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam to inform the House of the fabricated report.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first issue, the Committee of Privileges found that Mr Jeyaretnam failed to check the facts with Mr Lim Poh Huat, though he had every opportunity to do so, and that he had made serious charges in Parliament based entirely on what a third party, Mr Seneviratne, told him. This is reckless and irresponsible behaviour. Mr Jeyaretnam failed to take even the minimal step to contact or speak to Mr Lim Poh Huat to ascertain directly from him his account of the facts. Instead he proceeded to raise the specific allegation of wrongdoing entirely on the hearsay of Mr Seneviratne.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's defence was that he had no duty to investigate and he maintained that he was entitled to raise any matter that came to his notice. The Committee rejected this contention. This privilege and immunity enjoyed by Members carries with it a responsibility and duty to the House to refrain from making grave and serious allegations or accusations against persons or bodies based entirely on hearsay or third party reports without first taking steps to verify the accuracy of the accusations, especially when the so-called aggrieved party can easily be contacted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee felt that Mr Jeyaretnam should have taken the minimal step to check with Mr Lim Poh Huat. The Committee did not expect Mr Jeyaretnam to make his own investigation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue, the Committee found that Mr Jeyaretnam had suppressed important information from the House, when he rose on 30th July 1986 on his own volition to offer Mr Lim Poh Huat's address. He failed to inform the House that Mr Lim Poh Huat had given a signed statement that he had made up the story of his arrest and the detention was fabricated. This is a further abuse of privilege and the Committee accordingly found him guilty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee considered Mr Jeyaretnam had acted irresponsibly in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> raising a serious and grave accusation without substantiation and in not informing the House of the fabrication of the complaint when he learnt of it. Mr Jeyaretnam also refused to apologize to the House when offered many opportunities to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I urge this House to accept the findings and the recommendations of the Committee and that Parliament impose on Mr Jeyaretnam a fine of $1,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Clementi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Committee of Privileges in considering the complaint of unsubstantiated allegations of wrongful arrest and detention of Mr Lim Poh Huat has made two conclusions: (1) that the former Member for Anson was guilty of abuse of privilege when he made serious charges without verifying basic facts even though he has ample opportunities to do so, and (2) that he deliberately suppressed important information already in his possession although this information would have thrown light on the whole issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that this sounds rather familiar. Since his entry to Parliament in 1980, the former MP for Anson has been in the habit of bringing to this House rumours of all sorts. Very often, based on such rumours, he has levied grave and serious charges against persons and ministries. Yet when he was challenged to produce facts to substantiate his allegations he has been unable to do so. When pressed, he would resort to his often-repeated defence that he is entitled to ask any question on any matter under the sun and that it is the Government's duty to provide answers. His position is tantamount to saying that he should be given the right to purvey rumours of all kinds in this House without having to be responsible for the consequences that it may have on the people who may be adversely affected by such rumours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former MP for Anson has categorically stated during the Committee's hearing on this case that he can ask questions based on, and I quote here:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hearsay evidence on information that is given to me and which I considered to be not inherently improbable.'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Any Member, be he in their position or on the Government side, can speak freely in this House. Indeed the former MP for Anson has been accorded not only the opportunity but the time for him to speak his mind. One only needs to refer to the Hansard to see that the time given to the former MP for Anson has been rather disproportionate, considering that he is only one Member out of a total of 79. However, we would expect that a Member of this House would at least do his homework before making serious allegations. The former MP for Anson was not faulted for not having investigated, in his words, the details of the case. As he said it quite rightly, it was not his job to do so. He was asked why he did not at least verify with the person who claimed that he was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incredible that for some four months he did not even bother to contact the man. It is odd that he ascribes such importance to the seriousness of his allegations but did not even bother to verify this simple fact with the victim. As I said earlier, we should not be too surprised with the former MP for Anson, as he has done this before. However, there is a more serious aspect to the current issue. When Mr Lim's arrest was discussed in the House on 30th July last year, at the MP's own volition, he merely offered the address of Mr Lim. He failed to inform the House that he had in fact been given the information that Mr Lim had fabricated the whole story. Herein lies the much more serious suppression of information. The former MP for Anson, far from having the grace of admitting that he was misled, has opted to hide the truth from this House for reasons best known to himself. It is an act of dishonesty that cannot be condoned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament of Singapore should never be reduced to an open House of rumours and unfounded allegations brought by its own Members. We must jealously safeguard the integrity and dignity of this House through our own action. Members of Parliament are expected to conduct themselves with great propriety. They enjoy a freedom of speech that is not extended to the general public. They must however subject themselves to the code of conduct expected of Members
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of Parliament and behave properly so as not to betray the trust of those who have elected them. There cannot be a free licence to unsubstantiated allegations and rumour-mongering in this House. It is a measure of the former MP for Anson that in today's sitting there are three matters of abuse of privilege, all referring to the Member. It may be added that all these three issues have come from the Member's reckless action. There was no question of the Government going after the Member. We should all put a stop to this flagrant abuse of privilege if we were to maintain the highest standards that our Parliament has enjoyed all these years. I would therefore support the Committee of Privileges' findings and recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am a Member of the Committee of Privileges but I would like to put my dissenting views.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat what I said in the last Parliament sitting concerning the former Member for Anson, that is, we are talking of a person who is not present here in Parliament. It is only proper that he should be present and it has been brought to the Committee's attention that under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, this Parliament has the power, under section 12, to order him to be present here. He might have a last-minute information which he would want to communicate to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> It's over.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I beg to differ. It is not over. The Committee has made its findings and it is for this House whether or not to approve the findings of the Committee, in particular, on the sentence of $1,000 fine.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to the issues at hand. It has been said that he did not verify the bona fide of the complaint and did not bother to call this man Lim Poh Huat. But in his mind it was not his duty to do investigative work. At that particular point of time, nobody really knows what a Member of Parliament can do and cannot do or what needs to be done. I think in the present circumstances, due to the amendments to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, it is high time that a separate committee be set up to list out what Members can do and cannot do, what they can say and they cannot say. We are supposed to have freedom of speech in this House, but do we? Do we really have freedom of speech? There are all kinds of pitfalls in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind of a Member, he comes here, he gets, according to him, a credible information from a credible person. This is in his evidence. He was questioned more than once whether or not he believed in the credibility of this man called Seneviratne and he said, "Yes. I am prepared to accept his credibility." So he believed him. What more does he need to do? So he comes to Parliament and he reports to Parliament what he thought was a truthful story. And this House demands an apology from him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is: has he misled the House? According to him, he has not deliberately misled the House because he believed the information that was handed to him and that was the reason given by him for not seeing the necessity of apologizing. [Interruption]. Please. I think somebody must put his point of view. This incident of 30th July which has just been mentioned that he failed to reveal that he had a statement or he knew that Lim Poh Huat had lied to Seneviratne. But again he had given a good reason. He did not bother to tell this House because, according to him, there were already open Police investigations. If the Police had investigated the matter, the Minister would have known of it. So he would not see the necessity of informing this House. At every one step, he has got a genuinely good explanation. It is only that this House and the Committee refuse to see his point of view. It is so easy just to shut out your minds to the reasons given by other people and just look at one point of view. I think it is important in this House that Members should be given the real freedom to speak so that they could represent the interests not only of their constituents but also the public at large, especially in Singapore today. What other forum is there can a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> person bring up his grievances? I have known personally of many cases in which all avenues seem to be closed to them except coming to an Opposition Member. And I am the last surviving Opposition Member. Hopefully, there will be more coming after me. It is not only a question of freedom but a question of democracy and the task of building up what we want of Singapore. Thank you.

  <!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Tang Guan Seng)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for Potong Pasir pleaded for a last opportunity for the former Member for Anson to say a few words in Parliament as though it will be his last words. But the former MP had ample time and opportunity to give his reasons and arguments which were recorded clearly in the Committee's Report which shows that whatever he had said was nothing new. He said that he had lodged a report at Joo Chiat Police Station, but later denied his own words. Could an MP do this? Within five months from March to July, the former Member persisted in alleging that a Mr Lim Poh Huat had been wrongfully detained by the Police. However, Lim Poh Huat subsequently said that all that was a fabrication. The former Member was trying to blow up a balloon until the balloon burst on the 30th July last year. Today, we have seen the Member for Potong Pasir trying to blow up that burst balloon. Could he do that? He can't. On the other hand, we have seen that when the Member for Anson raised this matter, the Minister for Home Affairs said, "Well, you give us all the details." He did not give the details. And then on 27th March, the Minister of State for Home Affairs also requested him to provide all the details. However, after a delay of five months, nothing came out of it. During that time, the Government carried out an investigation to get to the truth of the matter. Here, we have two different approaches. The public can then compare these two different approaches - one on the part of the Government who was determined to get to the truth, and one other on the part of the former Member for Anson who perfunctorily made allegations in the House. As the Parliament is the highest law-making body, any allegation made in the House
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> must be investigated. Therefore Members must be fully responsible for what they say in the House. They cannot base their speeches or allegations on rumours or hearsay. Just now the Member for Potong Pasir questioned why the former Member was not allowed the last chance to come here to speak his mind. In fact, during the course of the investigations carried out by the Committee of Privileges, he had been given the opportunity to speak. It was not so that he had gone to the Joo Chiat Police Station to make a report. As a Member for Parliament, how could he belie on his own words? This is just a simple example.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, can I clarify a certain point? Just one point of clarification. I hope the Member will give way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, are you giving way?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang Guan Seng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to continue with my speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You are not a courageous person, are you?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, he is not giving way. Mr Tang, please carry on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tang Guan Seng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): He said that he went to the Police Station to lodge a report. Actually he did not. It shows that his words do not count. Finally, the investigations showed that the story given by Lim Poh Huat was a fabrication. And even after this, he refused to apologize to the House although he withdrew the allegation. What is wrong with saying, "I am sorry for the mistake"? I don't understand the great difference between withdrawing an allegation and giving an apology. Had he apologized, then it would have shown that he could be a responsible Member, but he did not do that. I think it is a question of attitude. If he was sincere, he should not put on tinted eye-glasses to look at things. To him, it seemed that everything was wrong. He even asked the question of whether Singapore was a police state when he made that allegation. If he had such premises, he must have looked at things from a very wrong perspective, and therefore everything would be wrong to him. How could he then arrive at any correct answer or judgment?

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee of Privileges has done a correct thing and is justified in handing out the punishment to him which is not done for the sake of punishing him, but was intended to safeguard the dignity and lofty image of the House. This was also to ensure that all Members would speak with reason and truth so that whatever they say in the House would be based on facts and not on baseless ramblings. I support the motion proposed by the Minister, and I would like to put forward four suggestions, two don'ts and two dos: Hearsay stories should not be broadcast in the House. Unfounded allegations should also not be brought into the House. If one is going to make any serious allegation in this House, then one must be responsible for it to the very end. When there is something amiss or wrong with what has been said then, an apology should be given and the matter closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I must certainly congratulate the Member for Potong Pasir for his courage which, he said, that the Member for Khe Bong does not have. But I have no doubt at all that the Member for Khe Bong has the courage of his own conviction. But I am also bemused by the Member for Potong Pasir's sense of self-importance when he said he is the only surviving Opposition Member in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is a fact. Admit that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> And I would also say that the less he speaks, the less he would reveal his ignorance of parliamentary practices, rules and laws. Perhaps he wants an induction course on what MPs can and cannot do. I am sure that the remaining 76 or 77 Members here do not need that. But I do not know who can provide him with that kind of induction course. Earlier on he quoted section 12 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. He said that Parliament has the power to call upon or compel a person to attend Parliament. Let me just read to him section 12 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. It says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Parliament and any committee which is duly authorised by the Standing Orders or by a resolution of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Parliament to send for persons, papers and records may order any person to attend before Parliament or before the committee, and to produce any paper, book, record or document in the possession or under the control of that person.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clearly says that Parliament or the Committee can call for the person. If we were to look at the Report, the Third Report, we would have seen that Mr Jeyaretnam was indeed called by the Committee and was examined in detail and he was given every opportunity to present his case.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, Mr Wong?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am talking about getting him here, not to the Committee, please.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> You quoted section 12. Section 12 says this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Not a Committee, please.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> So the Committee actually summoned him and he appeared, and he said all that he wanted to say and still Parliament found him guilty. Parliament also gave the opportunity to Lim Poh Huat to appear, and he said what he wanted to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I was talking of appearing in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The Member for Potong Pasir certainly has got his section wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. Please. Have I got my section wrong?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Read me the section.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course. "... by a resolution ... to attend before Parliament ..."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> To do what?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> What does the Member propose that we call Mr Jeyaretnam here for? What does he propose us to do? Tell us.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am sorry that the Leader of the House is not a lawyer. The procedure in court is always to have the defendant present when sentence is being passed. That has been in practice for hundreds of years in England and we have adopted their court procedure here, and it is clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> This is not a court.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is a wise move and I think it is only proper even if there is no precedent. [Interruption.] There is a precedent. What I am saying is that even if there is no precedent, it is proper to have the person here. It is not just right talking about somebody who is not present. You may disagree with me but I think I am still right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> You are not right. It is your opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The Member brought the same point up at the last sitting when we were debating the First and Second Reports. He was asked to produce precedents. Well, what did we have? We had not a shred of evidence or a single case that could support his contention. So section 12 does not require Parliament to compel him to come here to say anymore. What Mr Jeyaretnam wants to say has already been said by him at the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I ask the Minister one question? Is it proper to speak of somebody in his absence? Is it proper?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> He was heard already.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Of course. Because the particular person, Mr Jeyaretnam, has already been given the opportunity to be heard, then Parliament or the Committee must make a decision. After having made a decision, then he will be informed accordingly. It is definitely proper.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, but the sentence has not been passed yet. Until this House approves the recommendations of the Committee, then the sum of $1,000 cannot be obtained from him. Do you not agree with me on that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That's right, yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Parliament gives the Committee of Privileges the task of making a finding. The Committee of Privileges has made a finding with Jeyaretnam present. Now it is before the House whether or not to accept these findings. Before you make the finding, in other words before you sentence him, in other words until that finding is made, he is not liable to pay this $1,000. Until you make the finding, then he need not pay the $1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> So it is equivalent to a sentence not being passed yet at this stage, until this House approves this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes. What is your point?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My point is that before you pass the sentence, before you approve, he must be heard here. That is the point.

  <b>An hon. Member:</b> What is the Committee for?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <b>An hon. Member:</b> He is a lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> He is a lawyer. Yes, of course. If you were to look at section 24 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, it is quite clear that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Parliament may order any person guilty of an offence to attend before Parliament to be informed of or to receive any punishment which Parliament has decided [has decided] to inflict upon him.'
  <br>
  <br>Is it not clear? [Interruptions]. Yes. But Parliament may do that, which means Parliament has the discretion to do that. Now, Parliament need not do that.

   <b>(Paper Parl. 7 of 1987)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I rise again and I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their Fourth Report contained in Paper Parl. 7 of 1987 and resolves -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam is guilty of breach of privilege of Parliament; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that a fine of $1,000 be imposed upon him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Parliamentary sitting on 26th March 1986, the former Member for Anson, Mr Jeyaretnam, raised a question for oral answer whether constables from the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO) could be compelled to work on their rest days. In reply, Prof. Jayakumar, the Minister for Home Affairs, said that a CISCO constable is not compelled to work on his rest day unless exigencies of the service so required.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of further supplementary questions and answers, it was revealed that Mr Jeyaretnam failed to declare his pecuniary interest when raising the question concerning CISCO constables working on rest days. He also denied that he had any pecuniary interest in the question when he was asked by the Speaker. He then challenged Prof. Jayakumar to file a complaint against him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Prof. Jayakumar filed a complaint against Mr Jeyaretnam for failing to disclose the fact that the issue raised in question was the same issue which Mr Jeyaretnam had raised in a case taken up by him in early 1985 in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor. That case
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> concerned the dismissal of a CISCO constable named Cik Norlizah binte Long. Cik Norlizah appealed against the dismissal and Mr Jeyaretnam acted for her in his professional capacity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam should have declared his pecuniary interest in the matter as required of him under Section 31 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. Under section 31 of the Act:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member shall not in or before Parliament or any committee take part in the discussion of any matter in which he has a direct personal pecuniary interest without disclosing the extent of that interest and shall not in any circumstances vote upon any such matter.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a written reply to the complaint and on subsequent examination by the Committee of Privileges, Mr Jeyaretnam did not deny taking up the case of Cik Norlizah, the CISCO constable who was asked to work on a rest day. Mr Jeyaretnam also admitted to receiving payment from her. His argument was that the matter was concluded in March 1985, and since he raised the question in March 1986, the question of declaring his pecuniary interest did not arise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also claimed that in the UK House of Commons, a matter raised in a notice or supplementary question did not require a Member raising it to declare his pecuniary interest in it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee of Privileges rejected Mr Jeyaretnam's arguments. The Committee are not denying that Mr Jeyaretnam had a right to raise the question even though he had represented a CISCO constable previously in his professional capacity. The Committee are of the view that Mr Jeyaretnam was wrong in failing to declare his pecuniary interest. He had taken up a CISCO constable's case with the authorities and was paid for his services. The Committee ruled that there were good reasons why a Member should, as a minimum, declare his pecuniary interest. In the words of the Committee, in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Report:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'12. There are very good reasons why a Member should, as a minimum, declare his interest in such cases. The House must know whether a Member, in taking up a matter, has any connection with the case in his personal or professional capacity which involves a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pecuniary interest. The House will then be in a position to assess the intentions of the Member and to decide the extent to which the Member might have had his position influenced by his involvement in the case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. If a Member did not declare his interest, this could result in abuses of the proceedings of the House. The House will then be used for ventilation of dissatisfaction over failure to obtain redress in the Courts or other forums. Such failure to disclose interest can also lay open to abuse of a Member's position for profit and mischief.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also rejected Mr Jeyaretnam's argument that a Member need not disclose his pecuniary interest in questions raised in Parliament because this is the practice of the UK House of Commons. It is quite clear from Section 31 of our Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act that a Member must disclose his pecuniary interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time that the former Member for Anson breached this rule on disclosure of pecuniary interest. He did it on two occasions, first on 17th and the next on 19th March 1982. On both occasions, he was let off lightly. He was allowed to apologize for the first occasion and he was reprimanded for dishonourable conduct and contempt of Parliament for the second breach of Parliamentary Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-declaration of pecuniary interest is a serious breach of Parliamentary Privileges. It is much more serious when the person is a repeat offender. After considering Mr Jeyaretnam's arguments, the Committee found Mr Jeyaretnam guilty of the offence of breach of privileges and accordingly recommended that Parliament impose upon him a fine of $1,000 which was the maximum fine under the Act prior to its amendment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move that this House accepts the recommendation of the Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development has given the facts of the case and I will not repeat them. Sir, it is no joy when any Member of our House is disciplined by this House for misconduct. Parliament is the supreme law-making body of our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> nation, and Members of Parliament are expected in this House to discuss and debate issues so that the best interests of our nation are served. However, if the personal interests or pecuniary interests of a Member are mixed up with his duties as a Member of Parliament, then objectivity is lost in parliamentary debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Member declares his pecuniary interest, the other Members are alerted, and we can decide whether the view that is being presented is an objective view or one that is biased. We can then debate with the best interests of our nation as the central focus, and not the pecuniary interests of one Member. In short, the House will not be misled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, when a subject is debated in Parliament, the public has the right to know whether the person speaking has a personal pecuniary interest in the subject. The public then can decide for itself (i) whether the facts presented are biased; or (ii) whether the case being brought up is of any national importance. The onus is on the Member to declare so that Members of the House and the public can then look at the issue objectively, bearing in mind that the issue under discussion has been brought up by a Member with a pecuniary interest in the subject.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that it is no joy when any Member of this House is disciplined, even if he is an Opposition Member, because we are all in the same ship of Parliament. In the public eye, the image of the Parliamentarian will be tainted each time there is a misconduct by one. Thus, it is important that this House treats seriously the case before us, as Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam has breached parliamentary privilege not once but on five separate occasions, and on three occasions for non-disclosure of pecuniary interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What constitutes parliamentary privilege? I quote from Erskine May:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the United Kingdom, parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions, and which exceed those possessed by the other bodies or individuals. Thus privilege, though part of the law of the land, is to a certain extent an exemption from the ordinary law.'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Thus we can see that privilege is indeed a serious responsibility conferred on MPs to enable them to discharge their duties effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Direct Pecuniary Interest</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the British House, a Select Committee on Members' Interests (Declaration) in June 1975 identified nine classes of pecuniary interest or other benefit which were to be disclosed. Here, I would ask the Member for Potong Pasir to take note that guidelines are firmly mentioned. They are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) remunerated directorships of companies, public or private;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) remunerated employments or offices;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) remunerated trades, professions or vocations;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the names of clients when the interests referred to above include personal services by the Member which arise out of or are related in any manner to his membership of the House;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) financial sponsorships, (a) as a parliamentary candidate where to the knowledge of the Member the sponsorship in any case exceeds 25% of the candidate's election expenses, or (b) as a Member of Parliament, by any person or organization, stating whether any such sponsorship includes any payment to the Member or any material benefit or advantage direct or indirect;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) overseas visits relating to or arising out of membership of the House where the cost of any such visit has not been wholly borne by the Member or by public funds;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) any payments or any material benefits or advantages received from or on behalf of foreign governments, organizations or persons;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) land and property of substantial value or from which a substantial income is derived;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) the name of companies or other bodies in which the Member has to his knowledge, either himself or with or on behalf of his spouse or infant children, a beneficial interest in shareholdings of a nominal value greater than one-hundredth of the issued share capital.'
  <br>
  <br>From this list we can see that Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam should have disclosed pecuniary interest with respect to at least two items, items (3) and (4).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 31 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act of Singapore, it is obvious, as has been mentioned by the Minister, that Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam should have made a declaration of direct personal pecuniary interest. I do not think that here there is any doubt as to what we can do and what we cannot do as Members of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Backbench Members of Parliament, all of us are part-time politicians. We each have another career or profession to pursue. We receive an allowance as Parliamentarians. In the course of pursuing our career or profession or social contacts, issues of public or national interest are brought to our attention. What are the issues that we know best? Of course, the issues concerning our career or profession! If they are of national importance, can we bring them up in Parliament? The answer is, "Yes". But the onus will be on us to declare personal pecuniary interest. It is then up to the House and the public to decide whether we have acted honourably or whether we have abused our parliamentary status to further our individual careers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the facts of this case are clear. A Member, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, failed to disclose direct personal pecuniary interest in a matter he raised in Parliament on 26th March 1986.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I close, may I just take up a point on the question of courage raised by the Member for Potong Pasir. He has accused my hon. colleague, the Member for Khe Bong, of lack of courage. May I bring to your attention, Sir, that in the proceedings of both Committees in which the hon. Member for Potong Pasir is a Member, at the final meeting when decisions were taken to accept or reject the Report, he was absent. Is that courage? Had he not the courage to be present? Why was he absent?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Fengshan has made a long rambling speech but failed to come to the crux of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to show whether or not Mr Jeyaretnam has brought up some matter in Parliament in which he has a direct pecuniary interest. There is an admission that he was paid by this Cisco employee but this was in March 1985. The appeal in which Mr Jeyaretnam represented this Cisco guard was held on the 9th March 1985. That matter was brought up in Parliament on the 26th March 1986, slightly more than one year. So we have to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> convince ourselves or we must have evidence to the fact that Mr Jeyaretnam at the time of his bringing this matter, ie up after one year, had direct pecuniary interest. The word is "direct", not just "pecuniary interest". Nowhere in this Report is it shown that he had a direct pecuniary interest at that point of time, one year later. As far as he was concerned the matter of this Cisco guard had been dealt with, gone and forgotten. If we can show that, in fact, by bringing up the matter in Parliament and, having successfully got a favourable reply from the Minister, he could use that reply and get this girl reinstated, I would say that that would be direct pecuniary interest. But nowhere in the Committee's findings there was evidence from Norlizah that he was still pursuing this matter to be reinstated. So there was no direct pecuniary interest at that point of time. So how can we find him guilty? Because the point has not been proven. Somebody has dealt with something a year ago and one year later he must have forgotten about it completely. And even if there is a favourable reply he is not interested anymore unless we can prove that at that point of time on the 26th March 1986 he still had an interest in it. But nowhere in this Report has such a finding been made. So the only thing for this House to do is, if Members really want to come to the truth of the matter, they should stand this down and get Norlizah up and say, "Look, on the 26th, if there was a reply in your favour and you could be reinstated, would you want to be reinstated?" She said, "No, I am not interested anymore." Where is the pecuniary interest? Mr Jeyaretnam would not get paid anything.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would suggest to this House that either you find Mr Jeyaretnam not guilty on this charge or the matter has to be stood down, Committee reconvened and call Norlizah up and get this information. Then we can determine whether or not he had a direct pecuniary interest.

  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Geylang Serai):</b> Sir, I support the motion moved by the Leader of the House.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Do you agree with my arguments?

  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Let me continue. Do not interrupt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a member of the Committee of Privileges. This issue was discussed at the Committee of Privileges. Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam was given every opportunity to present his case. We have to take into account that this is not the first time. I think the Leader of the House has mentioned that Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam has on several occasions abused his privilege. On 31st August 1982 he was reprimanded in this House for dishonourable conduct and contempt of the House. He was warned against committing a similar breach of privilege in the future. However, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam chose once again to act in contempt of the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was given the opportunity to present his case, he brought up two spurious arguments. The first argument was the question of direct personal pecuniary interest and this was dealt with in the earlier case. The Committee of Privileges had in that proceeding rejected his argument. Now he was trying to confuse by saying that he has no interest in this case. But he has admitted at the Committee's hearing that he had acted for Cik Norlizah in a professional manner and that he had been paid for taking up Cik Norlizah's case. The fact of the matter is that for this particular case he had a pecuniary interest and this was dealt with and how he had an interest explained to him in the earlier proceeding.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second argument was that a Member need not disclose his pecuniary interest in a question raised in our Parliament because this is the practice in the UK House of Commons. The Leader of the House has dealt with this question and our law expressly provides that a Member must disclose his pecuniary interest when participating in a discussion in this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think as a senior lawyer, Mr Jeyaretnam should have known better that his interpretation of our law, ie, to hold that a Member must declare his interest in debates and not in a discussion arising from a question or supplementary question, is an absurd one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must have the highest standards in this House. We are not prohibiting Mr
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> J.B. Jeyaretnam from raising the case. What he simply needs to do is to merely declare that he has an interest and then he can go on if the House allows him to carry on. We are not stopping him from speaking. He merely has to declare his interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in view of this, Sir, I support the motion and I urge the House to endorse the recommendations of the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai has adequately and aptly answered the point made by the Member for Potong Pasir regarding the interpretation of direct pecuniary interest. In fact, it is the same point that was made by the previous Committee of Privileges. But assuming that what Mr Chiam said is correct ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> --- it is only an assumption. Do not be too presumptuous. A lawyer MP can take up court cases, and if the cases were subsequently lost, thereafter bring up the same cases in Parliament, the same issues. If he does that, then he is, in fact, finding another avenue for bringing up cases that he could not find recourse or could not get satisfaction in the court. So this Parliament cannot be the last forum for such Members who have in their professional capacity acted for their clients' interests or individuals' interests. Surely, this is direct pecuniary interest if the Member does so. If Mr Jeyaretnam had forgotten the case, like what the Member for Potong Pasir has said, then he would not have raised the question in 1986. So obviously the Member for Potong Pasir does not know Mr Jeyaretnam very well. And even if he does, he cannot read Mr Jeyaretnam's mind. Nobody can. Tell me that you can read my mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I be allowed to just say a few words because the Minister ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Are you clarifying?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. Because the Minister has not answered my point. The point I brought up is that on 26th March 1986 when Mr Jeyaretnam brought the question up in this House, did he or did he not have a direct personal pecuniary interest on the matter?
  <br>
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You said, "yes". But nowhere in this Report does it verify what you have said. Where is the evidence? If you can point out to the evidence that on the 26th March 1986 he had a direct pecuniary interest, then I would agree with you. Pecuniary interest in this instance would mean that there is still a subsisting matter in which he will benefit in monetary terms by asking that question. In our particular case, I repeat myself, that if he was successful in getting a favourable reply from the Minister, then he would bring this reply and put it forward to the authority at CISCO and say, "You have to reinstate this CISCO guard. Here is the authority from the Minister himself." But there is no such evidence before us. That is what I am saying. If you can show me the evidence that he still has a subsisting pecuniary interest on 26th March 1986, I will agree with you. But there is no such evidence.

  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Member for Potong Pasir one simple question? He is a lawyer and he deals with clients and he comes to this Chamber sometime after dealing with his clients and brings up their cases here because he has failed to obtain satisfaction for them in the usual way. If he does, would he not be benefitting from this procedure so that clients in future would see him as a useful lawyer to go to because he can bring their cases all the way up to Parliament?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think the Member for Whampoa is going off in a tangent. He is bringing up a hypothetical case which does not exist. We are talking of a serious matter today, of an actual case. Assuming you bought a car one year ago and this car caught fire and was already burnt. One year later, can you talk of this car anymore? It has already gone up in ashes. There is no more interest in this car. Similarly, in this 1985 case, it is over and gone. There is no more. There is no evidence before us that it still subsists, that Mr Jeyaretnam could benefit from the information given by the Minister. That is my point. It is true what the Member for Whampoa has said if we are talking about
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a hypothetical case now. If we are talking about a hypothetical case, assuming if members of the public know that I can bring this to the highest authority on the land, naturally I would be a very popular lawyer. But that is not an issue at the moment, it must be stressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> That is an issue. That is precisely the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is not.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The issue before the House is whether or not there is evidential proof. You must assume a man innocent until proven guilty, please. I think this is the standard of proof. And we have got no evidence to the effect that he had a pecuniary interest on the 26th March 1986. That is my point. If all you intelligent people cannot understand this, I am very sorry for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I do not know about used cars, but I know about used lawyers. Sir, I was honourable enough to apologize when the case warranted it. But why does he not give the same advice to Mr Jeyaretnam? He could have saved himself a lot of bother and not be fined in this way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is very simple. The Act exists to prevent Members of Parliament from benefitting from their positions here in this Chamber. It is as simple as that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But you have to prove that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Yes, there would be profit to a lawyer if he is seen to be so effective that he could drag every case that he has dragged through the courts right here into this Chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir has a curious way of arguing his case.

But the same point that the Member canvassed here in this House, I believe, although I was not a member of the Committee at that time, was also the same point canvassed by the former Member for Anson. And this argument of direct pecuniary interest was already commented upon and decided upon and ruled by the Committee way back in the previous Report. And the Committee also made reference to this in this Report. But if the Member does not read this Report, there is nothing else we can do.

  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their Fifth Report contained in Paper Parl. 9 of 1987 and resolves -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that Parliament impose on the Editor of "The Hammer", Mr J B Jeyaretnam, a fine of $10,000;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that Parliament impose on the Publisher of "The Hammer", the Workers' Party Executive Council, a fine of $5,000; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) that the Printer of "The Hammer", Mr Teo Sing Lim, be reprimanded and warned by the Speaker in writing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House was informed by Mr Speaker on 18th March 1987 that he had received a letter from Mr Dhanabalan complaining about an article appearing in "The Hammer" of January/February 1987 with the heading "Committee of Privilege Hearing/Jeya denied fair hearing". Having been satisfied that the complaint prima facie affected the privileges of Parliament, the matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges. The Committee have now submitted their report to this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article in question was written by Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam who is also the Editor of "The Hammer". The Publisher of "The Hammer" is the Central Executive Council of the Workers' Party and the publication is printed by G.T. Printing and Trading (Pte) Ltd whose managing director is Mr Teo Sing Lim.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee found that the article and its headline is a gross distortion of the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges. The headline of the article, "Jeya denied fair hearing", clearly conveyed a biased and perverted impression of the Committee's proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that Mr Jeyaretnam had been given more than ample opportunity to question the witnesses. His failure to derive satisfaction from the proceedings was due to his own inability to produce evidence that there was executive interference in the transfer of Mr Michael Khoo.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Despite repeated goading by Mr Barker and the Chairman to ask three specific questions of the Prime Minister, Mr Jeyaretnam failed to do so. There is no doubt that when the Committee closed on 12th September 1986 the Chairman had ruled that that part of the proceedings was concluded which meant that the cross-examination of the Prime Minister had ended.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee, in its Second Report, had already expressed the view that false reporting of proceedings of Parliament and its Committees will be regarded as contempt of Parliament. The principles laid down in that report are equally applicable in this instance. While any reports of the proceedings of the Committee or of Parliament may not be verbatim reports, any published accounts of the Committee's proceedings must not be false, perverted or biased.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee found that the article did not present a fair, truthful and balanced reporting of the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges. The article in question also contained serious omissions and distortions calculated to give readers a false impression of what really took place. It is irresponsible reporting and without regard for the dignity and decorum of the Committee of Privileges. Parliament cannot allow unjustified and inaccurate accounts of its proceedings or of its Committees. The Committee therefore found the Editor, Mr Jeyaretnam, and the Publisher, the Workers' Party Executive Council, and the Printer guilty of contempt of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time that Mr Jeyaretnam had written articles in contempt of Parliament and of its Committees. Just barely a few months ago, he was fined by this Parliament $5,000 each for writing and publishing five newsletters which distorted the proceedings of the Privileges Committee. For this second contempt for a similar offence, the Committee recommend that he be fined $10,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party Executive Council should also be severely punished as they know or ought to know that the Committee take a serious view of contempt of their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> proceedings. As Publisher, the Workers' Party Executive Council members are jointly and severally liable for the action of its Editor. The Committee recommend that the Publisher be fined $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Printer, Mr Teo Sing Lim, the Committee are of the view that he can print anything for anybody, including opposition parties. However, he is liable for what he prints. He should ensure that his action does not violate any law, including the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. The Committee are satisfied, however, that he did not intend to commit contempt of Parliament and that he had deeply apologized for his error. Taking into account his unreserved apologies and the fact that this is his first offence, the Committee recommend that he be reprimanded and warned by the Speaker in writing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge this House to accept the recommendations of the Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we read a piece of news or an article, the most important thing that catches our eye is its caption or heading. About this article, the heading is "Committee of Privilege hearing/Jeya denied fair hearing". I am of the opinion that any reader when reading this kind of big character caption would not have mistaken the real meaning the caption intended to convey as the meaning of the caption is very clear and direct. Any reader after reading this caption would have a clear impression that the Committee of Privileges had not given Mr Jeyaretnam a fair hearing. This kind of heading, to Parliament and to the Privileges Committee, is a kind of attack. If this attack were based on facts or through evidence, then we could say that the Privileges Committee and even the Parliament itself would then lose its honour, image and credibility because it had not been able to deal with the matters like this fairly. Then it would lose the confidence of the people. If Parliament lost the confidence of the people then the foundation of democracy would be shaken. Therefore, any attack or allegation against Parliament or its Committees should be regarded as a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> serious matter to be dealt with with all seriousness in order to find out the facts and truth of the matter so as to ensure the confidence of the people on the Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no truth or factual ground to the attack or allegation or if it is a distortion of facts then it would become a malicious attack or slander causing harm and damages. Then the matter should be pursued and dealt with with all seriousness. When a person has attacked or inflicted such harm to another person he can say that it was done unintentionally. Mr Jeyaretnam was trying to make use of this argument as defence to justify himself and his party organ. His reason given was that the heading to this article should be in inverted commas, namely, it was quoted from him but in the printing process the quotation marks were omitted; so that was a mistake unintentionally done and not on any purpose. This argument is hard to accept, just as the Fifth Report of the Privileges Committee has pointed out that the typesetting, laying out and headlining, etc were done by the Editor and the publishers concerned, and not by the Printer. So people could not believe that it was done inadvertently or unintentionally by a lawyer who is also the leader of a political party. In fact, whether there was quotation or no quotation, the heading or caption would give a wrong image or message to the readers that Parliament or the Privileges Committee has been unfair. Other than the heading of this article, there are also other imbalanced and untruthful reports in the article. The Report has clearly enumerated them in detail. Therefore, I would not like to repeat here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Editor and Publisher argued in their defence about the omission of the inverted commas, they still did not admit the intention to express contempt of Parliament or the Privileges Committee. In other words they did not express remorse. Mr J B Jeyaretnam himself even insisted by his argument that he had not been given a fair hearing by the Committee, against all evidence to the contrary. Mr Jeyaretnam himself was not only given ample opportunity to question the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General and other witnesses but also had
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ample time to give his concluding arguments. Therefore, to sum up, Mr Jeyaretnam's claim and allegation that he was not given a fair hearing is entirely without factual foundation. Therefore, this constitutes an act of smirching and contempt of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should stress that the dignity, integrity and the credibility of Parliament should not be allowed to be smirched and tarnished. If anybody should commit the act of contempt or smearing the image and credibility of Parliament, then such a person should be punished. It would be an inexcusable action, if it is done knowingly and deliberately. What should be pointed out is that it is not the first time that Mr Jeyaretnam had committed this kind of contempt or smirching of Parliament. It is a second time and repeated action. He repeatedly committed contempt of Parliament. What is his motive? Some people could say that his intention has been too obvious to mention. He has repeated records of contempt of Parliament. Therefore, on this occasion, the punishment on him should be re-doubled. So I agree to the recommendation of the Privileges Committee to impose on him a sum of $10,000; in other words double the sum of $5,000 last imposed on him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that this year on 27th January when we were debating on the Second Report of the Privileges Committee, the Member for Potong Pasir had argued that the fine imposed on the former MP by the Privileges Committee was too high. On every count, the fine was $5,000. Added together, it would be $25,000, a very heavy fine; too punitive a deterrent. And at that time he also argued that Mr Jeyaretnam was no longer in Parliament so he could not imagine that Mr Jeyaretnam could commit the same act again. But, unfortunately, his judgment has now been proved to be wrong. Anyway, the question now is, on this occasion, would the Member for Potong Pasir again think the $10,000 fine recommended by the Privileges Committee too heavy, or would he give a comparison that is the same as the one used by him at one of the last Parliament sittings, that is, using a big hammer to kill a fly?

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am obliged to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Most of the speakers on these matters concerning the Committee of Privileges do not seem to go into the issues. They go on a rambling speech, talking about smearing. I wonder where does the Member for Braddell Heights get his evidence from in regard to the former Member for Anson about smearing Parliament. We are here to see whether or not he is guilty of gross distortion and of false and perverted reporting. They do not seem to go to the main issues but go off the tangent and hit at a person who is not present and is unable to defend himself. If we are here setting this kind of a standard, I think it is not going to speak very well for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was shown copies of these letters received from several of these members of the Executive Committee of the Workers' Party. I notice that three of them - Mr Chiang Seok Keong, Seow Yong Chew and Madam Wee Kia Eng - have tendered their apologies unreservedly. So they are on par with the printer, Mr Teo. Their status as regards this particular item that was printed in The Hammer is exactly the same as that of the printer. So if this House agrees with the Report of the Select Committee which I am dissenting (and I am sure they will), then these three members of the Council should suffer the same penalty as Mr Teo, just a reprimand, because they have no knowledge whatsoever of the contents of that article. They do not read English. Probably they did not even know it was published, and they are completely innocent. The reason why they were put in together with the other members of the Central Committee as publishers was, as it is given in the Report, that they have not tendered their apology unreservedly. They have done that now. There is a new situation, a new circumstance has arisen. Therefore, I would urge this House that they should be treated on the same standing as the printer, Mr Teo. If you treat them otherwise, I think it would be very unfair to them. There will be an injustice perpetrated because they have done exactly what Mr Teo has done - apologize unreservedly, in print. We have got it here in the House and also they are completely innocent parties. They had no knowledge
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the article. They had not been informed. It was done very quickly and I think they are even in a better position than the printer because the printer knew that that article had been printed but these three Central Executive Committee members did not even know that that article was printed at that point of time. Therefore, I think this House should treat them on the same standing as the printer, Mr Teo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in this House convicted Mr Jeyaretnam of making allegedly false reports and found him guilty. Probably he will be found guilty again. Now, we are going to set a precedent for all newspapers - I would say they have to publish almost verbatim reports. Because you will note that, in the second charge, he was guilty mainly of omissions. It will have omissions because if you look at the article - and I roughly estimate the number of words in that article is about 550 - I think newspaper publishers and editors in this House would know that for a whole day's hearing comprising probably a few thousand words, you cannot have everything in one article alone. There will be omissions, and he has said so. Mr Jeyaretnam has said so. It is not a verbatim report.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is this: has he committed a gross distortion? The definition of "gross", according to Mr Jeyaretnam, is a completely wrong picture of the proceedings on that day. It is the same. "Gross" means the whole. The whole thing is wrong. The whole report is wrong. Can you find that of this article in the January/February issue of this Hammer? Can you say that - that it was completely wrong? If this House can say that, then he is guilty. If you cannot say that, he should not be found guilty. He should be let off. So you are going after him just because of one headline. That is all. Just because he published one headline, "Jeya denied fair hearing", all right, he is guilty. But what about the other contents in the article? Nothing was mentioned. It should be brought and read together with the headline. You cannot just see the headline alone. I think any reasonable person would want to read what is in that article and not just read the headline alone. You cannot convict a person just because he has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> published a headline that was misleading. You have to look at the article as a whole. And there will be omissions. He was being hauled up to the Committee of Privileges because he had left out certain things. And Mr Jeyaretnam has said so - this report of his comprised only of one day's proceedings, 18th December. It does not include the whole proceedings, the other four days of the proceedings were not included in that report. And he has said so. So how can you find him guilty?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge Members not just to vote blindly but know exactly what they are voting. I am afraid under the PAP-type of voting, everybody just votes according to what he has been told to do. If we can have a show of hands, how many of you have read all this and know exactly what the issues are, before you commit this man to pay huge sums of money. I think you must have conscience because this is something which a man will suffer and I do not know how the Committee arrived at such a big sum of money.

  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> But you know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What can I do? Whenever I agree, they say, "Let's take a vote." And I will be outvoted, one to seven, every time, without fail. Almost it is a mechanical thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> You do not agree. But it does not mean you do not know.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But I did say that there should be reasoning, the facts should be brought out and properly argued before a decision is made. We should not just vote and see who has got more votes and get the thing or whatever is required passed for the day. We are dealing with a serious matter and I think it should be dwelled on at length before we make a decision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would urge this House to look at it rationally and see whether or not it is a gross distortion, to see whether or not it is a false and perverted reporting of the Committee's proceedings, which again is misleading
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> because this report is only for one day and it is not for the whole of the Committee's proceedings. I think this should be explained to all of you. So for an article which is about 500-odd words, you are saying that he has committed gross distortion. Can he really do that with a small article just like that? I think if you look at it, probably all of you should vote that he is not guilty and he should not pay any of the fine at all.

  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe the hon. Member for Potong Pasir in his opening remarks accused me of smearing. Can he repeat the exact words?

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, would you like to respond?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I believe the Member for Braddell Heights did use the word "smear" - I have got it in my notes here - of Mr Jeyaretnam's article. That is what he is saying. But there is no such thing in the report. What we are asked to find is not a question of smear. What we are asked to find is whether or not there is gross distortion, whether or not there is false, perverted or even a biased report. That is what we are in this House for. So I hope the Member for Braddell Heights will be more exact in his words.
  <br>

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the article in question read in its entirety, paying attention to the headline, is indeed a gross distortion of the proceedings of Parliament. But before I go on to say a few words to support the findings of the Committee of Privileges, can I just take a few minutes to demolish the points raised by the Member for Potong Pasir, although I do not enjoy doing it because ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> By all means go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> --- he is not a very strong debater. You cannot compare Mr Teo Sing Lim, the printer of the Hammer, with three miserable members of the Workers' Party Council for a start. The point is that the Workers' Party
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Council is guilty of contempt and the Workers' Party Council is represented by Mr Jeyaretnam who holds the permit. And his co-editor, if the Member for Potong Pasir can remember in the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges, is Mr Wong Hong Toy. We are holding all these members jointly, severally responsible for that misleading article in the Hammer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir says you cannot represent everything in 500 words. We are not saying that at all. What we are saying is that whether it is one word, one sentence or a voluminous book, the point is that there was a distortion of the truth. In fact, I would say Mr Jeyaretnam very concisely distorted the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges. "And can you say", he asked, "that Mr Jeyaretnam is completely wrong in that little short article in the Hammer?" As I said, read in its entirety, the whole article is distorted. And if distortion is not wrong, then what is wrong?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't know", says the Member for Potong Pasir, "how the Committee arrived at that huge sum of money." And claimed that he was there but they all did it by vote. We did it by vote because the Member for Potong Pasir agreed that the Workers' Party Council together with Mr Jeyaretnam were guilty. He said, "They are liable", if I can remember his words. "They are liable. There is no doubt about the fact that they are liable." That is what he said. And then he went on, to use what the Chinese would say, tau chia huan chia. We are not there to bargain on fines. We already knew that earlier on in the 2nd Report if I can remember that a fine of $5,000 was already approved by Parliament for each letter that Mr Jeyaretnam issued to his constituents. Here is a second offence. So it is very easy to set the quantum of fine.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we not do it by vote? Because if we do not do it by vote, we will be sitting in the Committee meeting just talking about $1, $2, a huge sum, whether it is deterrent enough and so on and so forth. I will establish later on that there must be some deterrence in the fines for such offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now just take a few minutes to persuade my fellow Members of Parliament to support the Report of the Committee of Privileges. First, I think we have to accept that Mr Jeyaretnam, the ex-MP for Anson, many times in this House maintained that Parliament is the highest court of the land. And I think the Member for Potong Pasir also has in this House maintained that Parliament is the highest court of the land. If Parliament is the highest court of the land, then surely it does not need a senior lawyer to also accept that there must be honour, there must be respect, there must be decorum, accorded to such a supreme institution such as this Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is very surprising though but may be not to Mr Jeyaretnam, but Mr Jeyaretnam should realize that it is downright despicable to represent the proceedings of Parliament through devious writings and speeches. Yet he goes on dishonouring Parliament, he goes on disrespecting Parliament, that very institution that he refers to as the highest court of the land, for whatever reason I do not know.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is appallingly unbelievable is the fact that only last year he attempted to discredit Parliament and only at the beginning of this year he was fined. He was fined $5,000 for every letter that he issued to his constituents. Yet he was not deterred. He and his Workers' Party Council published the January/February '87 issue of the Hammer and in one of the articles he designed again to mislead Singaporeans on the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges. If that is not shocking, I do not know what is shocking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I really cannot understand Mr Jeyaretnam. The Government has given him ample opportunities. In fact, the Government has in a way gone through all the trouble, even moving heaven and earth, so to say, simply to give him those opportunities, the time, to justify his accusations against the Government. Various witnesses were called to the inquiry. The Attorney-General attended. As regards the Chief Justice, I was told by my friends that no country in the world, in fact, if there ever were countries it must be very few, where the Chief Justice could be produced for an ordinary Member of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Parliament to quiz. He graciously appeared. The Prime Minister and I am sure we all can recall that Mr Jeyaretnam did not have the Prime Minister in his list of people he wanted to call up. It was the Prime Minister who magnanimously volunteered to go into the witness box for Mr Jeyaretnam to quiz. Ample time was given to him, ample opportunities were given to him. What did Mr Jeyaretnam achieve? Just one result. He wasted everybody's time. What he did not achieve is that he did not make out a case. He did not prove his accusations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite all the opportunities given to him, all the time given to him, despite the fact that he had only been punished recently, he persisted to mislead Singaporeans. Sir, the Fifth Report of the Committee of Privileges has made it patently clear that Mr Jeyaretname is non-repentant and will not be repentant at all. And for this reason, I would urge Members of this House to disregard what the Member for Potong Pasir has said and to support the Fifth Report of the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to clarify what the Member for Mountbatten has said? If we get his speech and publish outside, I think a complaint will be made against him. Because he has omitted many of the things that I said. He only quoted what I said, "They are liable. There is no doubt about that." This is at page 8 of the verbatim report. But if you go down the line, I did also say things which he failed to quote and it should be a subject of complaint. He has left out many of the things which I said and he did not quote. I think he should also be the subject of a complaint by the standards that we are setting today. [Interruption] Of course, I said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you look at his defence, he has a complete defence. We haven't gone into the law. He has discussed about the law.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But the law is that there can never be any contempt if it is an open hearing.'
  <br>
  <br>This is what Mr Jeyaretnam said. He said, "If it is an open hearing, there can never be a contempt."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We have to find him guilty in the terms referred to us by Parliament.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He is not guilty. He has got a good defence, in my opinion.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote:
  <br>
  <br>'
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We have agreed to $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I disagree with that.'
  <br>
  <br>Do you want me to go any further? I said a lot of things which are recorded in the verbatim report. Why do you not bother to quote all these other things that I said?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b>Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not normally like to waste time but because I have now been accused, then of course I have to defend myself. Yes, I am looking at page 8 of the verbatim report. Mr Chiam See Tong said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They are liable. There is no doubt about that. I think on that point we all agree.'
  <br>
  <br>I cannot read it and understand it in any other way. If Mr Chiam says that he has got a case, let us go back again. They all agreed. We went on to the stage where we were talking about how much fine to impose. It is a different thing altogether. The Committee proceeded. We went on to talk about ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Turn to page 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> We went on to talk about the quantum of fine to impose. And, of course, he would try to tau chia huan chia, trying to reduce the fine. So he said Mr Jeyaretnam had a good case. And he forgot now to quote or at least refer to Mr Barker who said that the quotation from Erskine May which Mr Jeyaretnam submitted was irrelevant. And that is why I did not bother to quote it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Turn to page 9, page 10 and the rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think one point I would like to make quite clear to the Members here as well as to those who are going to sit in future Committee of Privileges is that when we sit as Members of the Committee of Privileges, we are there to do a job. There is a duty for us to make sure that the standards
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of parliamentary conduct are not abused. That is why we are there in the Committee of Privileges. We are not there to represent a particular party, PAP, SDP or whatever. We are there to ensure that Parliament must have the highest standard of conduct. Then we can make the parliamentary system work, then we can be proud representatives of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on I referred to the curious arguments of Mr Chiam. I do not want to belabour the point, but I cannot avoid saying that when he tried to plead for the three so-called ignorant, illiterate and innocent members of the Executive Council of the Workers' Party, he was actually saying that the Workers' Party Executive Council comprised a group of stupid people. I hope they are not. I hope they are, like the People's Action Party Executive Council, Executive Committee, comprised people who know what they are doing. Similarly with the SDP. But it is not my job to warn these people or to tell them what they should do. When they applied for the permit to print "The Hammer" they signed the application which clearly states that they are "jointly and severally liable together with the principal applicant". That is what they have committed to do. Therefore, they cannot subsequently say, "Oh, I am sorry, I do not know all these things. I am not responsible." But at least they have the courage to say they accept the decision collectively. They accept collective responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say that it is with the Speaker's indulgence and his kindness that the Clerk of Parliament wrote to the remaining members of the Executive Council. There is no need for Mr Speaker to do that because earlier on on 10th April Mr Jeyaretnam on behalf of the Executive Council stated very clearly that he together with his Chairman, Mr Wong Hong Toy, would appear on behalf of the Executive Council. In other words, they, Mr Wong Hong Toy and Mr Jeyaretnam, represented that group. Whether they internally discussed what was to be brought up at the Committee of Privileges or not, that is the internal workings of the Workers' Party which I have no business to interfere. But I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> would assume that they would have done so. If they did not and they just went on and represented the whole Executive Council without consulting them, then of course they would form their own conclusions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely Mr Jeyaretnam is not the last word in the law when he defined what is "gross" misrepresentation. Because if he were ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> How do you define it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam has made a definition. We disagreed with that. The whole Committee together with the Chairman disagreed with that. It is only you who disagreed with our view.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir also said that we should treat the three members on the same footing as the printer. Surely not. Surely as a lawyer he knows the difference between those with collective responsibility as a publisher and the responsibility of a printer. Besides the printer categorically right from the beginning said that he was very sorry for what he did and even when he was called upon before the Committee he also tendered his apologies unreservedly. And for his contrition the Committee decided that he be given a warning and a reprimand, instead of fining him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have argued about this point. But since the Member for Potong Pasir raised this, I would just bring it up again. When we were voting on the reprimand for the printer, Mr Teo Sing Lim, the Member for Potong Pasir abstained and yet he voted against the first two punishments for the Editor and the Workers' Party Executive Council. That is indeed curious.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament doth agree with the Committee of Privileges in their Fifth Report contained in Paper Parl. 9 of 1987 and resolves -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that Parliament impose on the Editor of "The Hammer", Mr J B Jeyaretnam, a fine of $10,000;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that Parliament impose on the Publisher of "The Hammer", the Workers' Party Executive Council, a fine of $5,000; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) that the Printer of "The Hammer", Mr Teo Sing Lim, be reprimanded and warned by the Speaker in writing.

   <b>HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANT BILL</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.
  <br>4.36 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on the Human Organ Transplant Bill received seven written submissions. The Committee heard oral representations from nine persons in respect of four of the written submissions. The Committee's Report has been circulated to Members of the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the points raised in the submissions are already catered for within the Bill as it stands. These include safeguards for the proper certification of death and arrangements for the participation of Muslims in kidney donation through the existing Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representation proposed the removal of lower priority for transplant for those who have registered their objection to the donation of their kidneys. The main concern was that the priority consideration will over-ride all medical considerations. This might result in a kidney being transplanted into a recipient whose tissues are not compatible with the donor's. In such a case, the end result would be subsequent organ rejection and a wasted kidney. I must therefore clarify that medical criteria are the most important criteria in the selection of a kidney recipient. The tissues of potential recipients are first matched with the donor kidneys. The recipient must also not be suffering from any other medical complications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only then that priority is given to the non-objectors from the identified pool of potential recipients. The priority system is fair and will remain unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the right of a person to decide on the disposal of his own body was addressed in one submission to the Select Committee. I must reiterate that this right is in no way abolished by the legislation. Every Singaporean retains his right to decide whether he wishes to donate his
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> kidneys or not. No objector need fear that he will be counselled and coerced into changing his mind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue in its efforts to educate the public on the continuing needs and problems of kidney failure patients. These health and public education efforts will, however, be directed to Singaporeans in general and not at specific individuals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, members of my GPC are in full support of the Bill. We are very gratified indeed to see that the Ministry has taken so much trouble, proceeded with so much care and given full consideration to the feelings, values and beliefs of the different sectors of the population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also agree with the views of the Select Committee that the representations made actually have already been taken care of within the Bill. So we look forward to the implementation of the law which indeed represents a ray of hope for the unfortunate victims of chronic renal failure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I just wish to reiterate a few points which are worth repeating as they have been repeatedly put to us by members of the public. In implementing the law, the Ministry needs to bear in mind that it has to keep up with the publicity, educating the public on the purposes of the law, and also as to the provisions for the freedom of choice of individuals who might wish to object to donate their kidneys. If the publicity on this law is not kept up, I am afraid that in due course, with the passage of time, the public may forget about the intents and purposes of the law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also imperative for the Ministry to make special efforts each year to inform those who will be reaching 21 years of age of their right to choose to donate their kidney or to opt out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Ministry must still try to find all kinds of methods to help the victims of chronic renal failure. Even though now many more kidneys may be available for transplants, people still hope that the Ministry will spare no effort in providing dialysis treatment on as wide a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> scale as possible. Even though this is expensive and only a temporary treatment, yet to those who suffer from the illness and are awaiting donors, the availability of dialysis treatment is still and is very importantly a life saving provision. So it is our opinion that the Ministry should still spare no effort in finding ways and means to help victims of kidney disease including, apart from dialysis treatment, looking at the possibility of allowing them to use Medisave for their regular treatment and their payments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, this Bill can be looked at as a Bill protecting the rights of those who object to kidney donation for personal, religious or other reasons. It is therefore crucial that every possible means must be taken to make it easy and convenient for the objectors to register their objection.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration forms should be made widely available through community centres, RC centres and other public places and proper acknowledgment must be made. We must not repeat the mistake made in the past where some people who pledged to donate their kidneys failed to receive the donor cards. I can speak from personal experience.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years back the computer was not used for registering the donors and some administrative slip-ups might have occurred. Now we must take great care with the list of objectors because the principle of the law is based on presumed consent. And even though we are now using the computer, the computer may still fail us occasionally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Register of Objectors must also be kept strictly confidential so that those who object need not fear stigmatization which should not occur at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very happy that the Bill has gained the general support of the Muslim community and the individual Muslims can donate their kidneys under section 3 of the Medical (Therapy Education and Research) Act. The Ministry officials should now assure the Muslim donors that the conditions as mentioned by the representatives of MUIS to the Select Committee will be scrupulously adhered to.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister has repeatedly given his assurance before in this House and outside that this Bill is meant for kidney donation to save lives only. Unfortunately, there is still a lingering fear among some people that this Bill is only the beginning of more types of organ donation to come. In this respect, the GPC members note that the word "organ" is defined as the kidney of a human body except for the purposes of Part IV of this Bill. In Part IV which prohibits the trading in organs and blood, the term "organ" means any organ of a human body. So to those people who fear that the Bill is only the beginning of some more things to come, Part IV does seem to confirm or support their suspicion. This is very unfortunate. It is not feasible of course to change the title of the Bill to that of, say, the Human Kidney Transplant Bill because of the presence of Part IV. But we wish to emphasize that in future if the Bill is to be extended to cover other kinds of organ transplant, every single bit of extension must be fully scrutinized and debated, just as in the case of kidney transplants. Otherwise we would be betraying the trust of the public in the verbal assurances given by the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final word on the role of the relatives. Although the Bill is based on the principle of individual consent and hence the consent of relatives need not be obtained for the removal of the kidney. Yet the sentiment of the relatives must be handled with the greatest care. Death from accidents is sudden, violent death. The trauma suffered by relatives cannot be over-stated. So at the moment of grief and shock, we must extend every emotional and psychological support to the relatives. It has been suggested that some form of public appreciation should be extended to both the donor and his relatives. This idea is worth pursuing. It would help to spread the message that kidney donation is a magnanimous gift of life. Public recognition which brings psychological rewards is perhaps a better form of appreciation than a scheme of medical benefits extended to members of the immediate family of the donor. Whatever it is, Singaporeans will learn that kidney donation is one great form of giving and caring for other fellow human being.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support the Bill and let us get on with it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lam Son -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lam Son (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I welcome the Third Reading of the Human Organ Transplant Bill after the Report on the Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill must be regarded as a gift of life to Singaporeans who are dying from end stage renal failure. I am sure these Singaporeans will rejoice and I rejoice with them. In fact, all Singaporeans who do not opt out, and I believe they are the majority, should rejoice because this Bill gives them the assurance that should they be struck down by kidney disease they will have a much better chance of obtaining a donor's kidney than people living in other countries where such a legislation does not exist.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compassion to save lives is the motivation behind the Bill and I believe this far outweighs any protestation that the Bill to own one's body after death is now not automatic. You have to fill in a form to say that. With the opting-out system, we are in fact recognizing the feelings of more Singaporeans in supporting the Bill and we also end this costly and futile task of the National Kidney Foundation in recruiting people under the present system of opting-in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said just now that people who have opted out will not be coerced or counselled into opting in. Does that mean that the Ministry or the National Kidney Foundation will not persuade people who have opted out to withdraw? As this is a sensitive issue, I would also advise very cautious implementation of the Bill. First, there must be the widest possible publicity of the opt-out system. The benefits to relatives of donors must be highlighted and the joy of those whose lives have been saved be shown, in particular, the relatives of the deceased must be handled with tact and sensitivity. The Bill must not be seen to be forced down upon them at the moment of grief. Perhaps a trained person or trained persons should be present to explain the rules of the opt-out system and to stress on the opportunity that in their moment of grief there is also a gift of life to a dying person.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek clarification on clause 3(1) which empowers the Minister to prescribe the criteria for determining the irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain of a person. Does this mean that in case of doubt, the Minister will have the final say? I think this may not be wise because to put a decision on life and death upon the Minister will put a tremendous burden on him. This should be made by a team of medical experts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to clause 12(1)(a) which gives priority to a person who has not opted out over one who has opted out in the selection of a proposed recipient. The Minister has said that, apart from medical criteria, the opt-out system will have priority on other criteria. But what about criteria such as the recipient's age, occupation, recipient's role in the family, role in the community? Will all this now not take precedence? As an example, will you select, say, a criminal who has not opted out or a social worker who has opted out?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo:</b> Sir, the Bill will give a new lease of hope to kidney disease sufferers. I am confident that Singaporeans will respond favourably to help their fellow Singaporeans who are suffering from kidney diseases and this will provide a new dawn of hope to those who are suffering from the disease.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to get one clarification from the Acting Minister. It is whether appropriate procedures and rules will be worked out as to who will get the priority for kidney transplant. There are likely to be contentions and other related problems as to who would get this priority. I am wondering whether these procedures will be made known to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the three Members for their comments and the various suggestions that they have made.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Changkat and Telok Blangah have suggested that the publicity drive for the Bill be kept up. I would like to assure the Members of the House that there will be an intense publicity campaign for the six months that the grace period is in force. Subsequently, every year, all Singaporeans upon reaching the age of 20 years will receive a reminder and we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will also, on an annual basis, be carrying out mass-media campaigns to ensure that Singaporeans are aware of the implications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of having dialysis facilities made available, the Ministry is working with the National Kidney Foundation to assist the NKF in making dialysis facilities available in various parts of Singapore. We will also assist the NKF to purchase the consummables in bulk so that the cost of dialysis can be further reduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of using Medisave for payment for dialysis, at the present moment the dialysis facilities that are available in the private sector are rather expensive. It costs between $2,000 and $3,000 a month. Most Medisave account holders will therefore have inadequate Medisave balances to enable them to undertake the dialysis for long. What we are looking into is having a catastrophic illness insurance system which would help bear the bulk of the dialysis cost. When this catastrophic illness insurance system comes into force, then the Medisave requirements will not be a problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the easy availability of forms and to ensure that the administrative mechanism for acknowledging and processing the forms is efficiently implemented, I would like to assure the Member that forms will be available in all parts of Singapore through our Ministry of Health's facilities - the OPDs, the polyclinics, hospitals - and that we have worked out a system where all the objector forms will be processed within 24 hours and that an acknowledgment form will be sent out. There will be intricate safeguards built in to ensure that there is cross-checking that the forms that are sent in have been processed. In cases where the forms may be misplaced in the mail or have gone astray in the mail, the forms will carry an advice to objectors that if they do not receive an acknowledgment form within three weeks they should telephone the Ministry so that we can look into the reasons why.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the fear that the Human Organ Transplant Bill will be broadened to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> include other organs, that point was brought up also in the Second Reading of the Bill. In fact, there were two schools of thought. One school of thought, as expressed by, I think, two Members, was that because of the improving medical technology regarding transplant of organs, the Ministry should also look into broadening the ambit of the Bill. The other school of thought was that we should be very cautious. I would like to remind the Member that my answer was that yes, in due course, there may be a need for other organs. But the Ministry would prefer to persuade Singaporeans on the desirability of donating those organs on their own rather than through the use of legislation. Over time as Singaporeans become more familiar and comfortable with the concept of kidney donation and when the need arises for the other organs, I am sure the level of objection will have reduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also be strengthening the crisis counselling capability of our staff. We will be training a team of counsellors whose job will be to counsel and assist the relatives in their moment of grief. This will help them overcome the intense emotions that they will be feeling and that will be the main role of the crisis counsellors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has also asked for assurances that the Ministry and the National Kidney Foundation will not persuade objectors to withdraw their objections. As I stated in my address earlier on, the Ministry will not be counselling individual objectors and the list of objectors will be kept confidential. That means nobody else will have access to information as to which person has objected. So the NKF will be in no position to counsel individuals who have objected. I would like to reassure the Member that this list is totally confidential.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lam Son -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lam Son:</b> May I seek a point of clarification? My point was that it would be best if you could counsel and persuade those who have opted out to withdraw their objection and to opt in.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> If we are going to do that, then we should publicize the list of objectors. I think we will rely on the mass media campaign that we will be carrying
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> out, that those people who feel that it is desirable, in the interest of saving lives, not to opt out would not opt out. We hope that those people who have opted out will over a period of time be persuaded by our arguments to change their decision. In which case, we would welcome their withdrawal of their objection.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has also asked about the criteria of brain death and in case of doubt will the Minister have the final say. A set of criteria will be drawn up and the actual certification of death will be carried out by a team of doctors or specialists whose job is to determine the time of death and the state of death. So it will not have to come to me at all. It will be settled at the hospital level by the specialists who are the best persons to be involved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the priority system, the key criterion is medical suitability. Based on that we will then find out which are the potential recipients who would form the pool of potential recipients. From there, the priority system will be worked out and the final group of recipients will be identified and the other criteria will then be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> applied. So the other socio-economic criteria will apply at that stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bo Wen has asked whether in that case the criteria for selection would be publicized. In terms of the broad criteria, ie, the broad socio-economic criteria, yes, we can make them known. But in terms of the actual details, I think those tend to be rather emotional. It is best that they be left to the team of committee members who will be charged with ensuring that the selection of the recipients is carried out equitably.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

   <b>SWEDISH BAN ON ARMS EXPORTS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (a) why the Swedish Government has again imposed a ban on the export of defence materials to Singapore; (b) whether this will have any impact on our defence requirements; and (c) whether his Ministry and its defence related companies have alternative sources for similar defence materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Nobel Industrier, the Swedish company which owns Bofors, the arms manufacturer, issued a communique on 30th March, 1987 which stated that several countries - Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom - had been involved in the illegal shipment of Bofors products to countries embargoed by Sweden. The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 1st April, 1987, through a press release, that the Swedish Government would no longer consider any matters concerning export of defence materials to Singapore. Since then, the Swedish Government has clarified that export licences which had already been issued remained valid even though shipments might not have taken place. However, new applications for export licences would not be processed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is MINDEF's policy to have alternative sources for defence materials to the maximum extent possible. Nevertheless, sudden restrictions in supply of defence materials, particularly when there are already standing contracts, must necessarily affect the equipping of the SAF in the short run. The ability of suppliers to effect delivery on time is always a critical consideration. Besides equipment performance and cost-effectiveness, MINDEF's procurement policy must now take greater account of how unpredictable the governments of the suppliers are likely to be in their policy on arms exports.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the Swedish Government on 1st April, 1987 was sudden and unexpected. Only on 30th March, 1987 the Swedish Ambassador had informed our Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Swedish Government was not making allegations against the Singapore Government and was not blaming the Singapore Government for any non-compliance over End-User Certificates. He also expressed his government's desire for a dialogue between the two Governments to jointly clarify the matter. The Singapore Government agreed to consider any specific proposals from the Swedish Government. Since then, the two Governments have been in consultation to resolve the matter.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Out of the 44 trainees who graduated 37 have joined the Education Service, 14 are in the junior colleges, 5 in secondary schools with pre-university centres and 18 in other secondary schools. Those posted to junior colleges are teaching PE full time. Those in pre-university centres and secondary schools teach PE as their main subject but they also teach an academic subject for which they have also been trained.
