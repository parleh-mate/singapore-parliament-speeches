<div align="center"><b>INQUIRY COMMISSION'S REPORT ON MR ONG ENG GUAN'S</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ALLEGATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion of condemnation)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

question [1st March, 1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly takes note of the Report of

the  Inquiry  Commission into  certain  allegations

made  by  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan  in  the  Legislative

Assembly  on the 10th and 12th December,  1960,  as

contained in Paper Cmd. 7 of 1961, and condemns Mr

Ong   Eng   Guan  for  his  dishonourable   conduct

unbecoming  of  an  elected representative  of  the

people in that he repeatedly used his privilege  in

this  Assembly  as a cloak for spreading  malicious

falsehoods to unjustly injure innocent persons both

inside  and  outside  this  Assembly."-(The  Deputy

Prime Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the findings of Mr Justice Chua

in  the  Commission of Inquiry into the allegations

made  by Ong Eng Guan in this Assembly against  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and  Law

in  December  1960 show conclusively that  Ong  Eng

Guan is an inveterate liar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the one year that Ong Eng Guan served as a

Minister  in our Government, his low intrigues  and

cult   of   individualism  as  against   collective

leadership  and  responsibility  resulted  in   his

expulsion  from the People's Action Party  and  the

Government   Bench.  Even  as  a  Member   of   the

Opposition,  Ong Eng Guan had a role to  play,  but

again  within  short  space  of  five  months,   he

revealed  his  true  nature  of  unprincipled   and

irresponsible  conduct  unbecoming  of  an  elected

representative  of  the  people  of  Singapore   by

persisting   in  spreading  malicious   falsehoods,

knowing them to be false.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been alleged by Ong Eng Guan and his

cronies  that  his  freedom  of  speech  had   been

curtailed  even  before  his  expulsion  from   the

People's

statement of fact and it is important to  refer  to

page  5,  paragraph 13 of the Report  of  the  Chua

Commission of Inquiry which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan stated that whatever he had to

say  had  been  said  in  his examination-in-chief.

Towards the end of his evidence, Mr Ong Eng  Guan,

in   answer  to  my  questions,  expressed  himself

satisfied  that he had been given every opportunity

to  say  what  he  wanted to say and  to  call  all

relevant  witnesses, and that  there  had  been  no

attempt to silence him in this Commission.'



<br><br>And what was the end result? The last two sentences

of paragraph 14 of the Report are clear:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan, however, had nothing to

disclose. He did not even have any facts  on  which

he based his allegations.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted too, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

the  subject  of inquiry under the Commission  were

the  same three allegations which Ong Eng Guan said

he   would  substantiate  in  this  House  on  23rd

December,  1960,  but he decided  to  run  away  by

resigning  his  seat  in  this  Assembly  on   29th

December, 1960. Instead of substantiating his three

allegations in the Commission of Inquiry,  Ong  Eng

Guan  offered  the  childish explanation  that  his

solicitors had advised him that he had not made any

allegations  at  all  but  only  merely  making  an

inquiry.  As is well known, ignorance is no  excuse

in  the eyes of the law and Ong Eng Guan is not  an

illiterate  man.  He  is  a graduate  of  Melbourne

University  and  a practising accountant.  However,

even  assuming the fact that Ong Eng Guan  and  his

solicitors  did not know the meaning  of  the  word

"allegation", then what did Ong Eng Guan mean  when

he  said  these brave but foolish words in Hansard,

Volume  14, No. 10, dated 23rd December,  1960,  at

column 871:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

substantiate all the things I have said.'



<br><br>The  substantiation  never came,  neither  in  this

Assembly when he chose the coward's way of  running

away  by  resigning,  nor  in  the  Commission   of

Inquiry. To have failed in substantiating his three

allegations was bad enough, but in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



Commission  of Inquiry, Ong Eng Guan  made  further

allegations  against the Prime  Minister.  See  the

first sentence of paragraph 11 of the Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan in the course of his

examination-in-chief   made   further   allegations

against the Prime Minister.'



<br><br>These were just as reckless and groundless. I shall

only  refer  to  one - unfortunately in  which  I  am

indirectly  affected  - in which  he  claimed,  with

regard  to the question of my nomination, or rather

the  rumour  that I had resigned from my  insurance

company to become a candidate for the P.A.P., which

was  untrue  at  that time, that he  then  got  the

Party's  Chairman  (Dr Toh  Chin  Chye),  now  the

Deputy Prime Minister, to see the Secretary-General

and   that  the  question  was  resolved  with  the

Secretary-General  of  the  P.A.P. threatening  to

resign  unless  certain people were nominated.  But

when  Ong  Eng  Guan was asked whether  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister and Chairman of the People's Action

Party  was  to be called as a witness to  this

so-called episode, Ong Eng Guan saw no point in  doing

so, and it was left to the Commissioner to call Dr

Toh  Chin  Chye;  and it has been proved  that  Dr

Toh's evidence did not support the story of Ong Eng

Guan. I quote paragraph 11 of the Report, 7th  line

from the bottom of page 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dr Toh Chin Chye further said that Mr Lee Kuan

Yew  never  mentioned  that  he  would  resign   or

threatened  to  resign  from  the  Party   or   its

leadership  if Mr Yong Nyuk Lin was not nominated.

I  accept the evidence given by Dr Toh Chin  Chye.

In  fact,  Dr  Toh  Chin Chye's evidence  was  not

challenged by Mr Ong Eng Guan.'



<br><br>This proves that he who lies must have more lies to

support  his  case and all that  is  needed  is  to

disprove one lie and the full pack of lies  crumble

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition has tried to allege that the

People's   Action  Party  won  the   1959   general

elections  because  of Ong Eng Guan.  This  is  not

true.  It  was the P.A.P. which built  up  Ong  Eng

Guan. It was the good work of the Party and its  13

City  Councillors  which delivered  the  goods.  Of

course,  Ong Eng Guan wants to take the credit  for

everything.  Unfortunately, Ong  Eng  Guan  was  an

ambitious and a power-crazed man, and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



proved his undoing and he won the disrespect of his

colleagues. He is a mentally sick man who would lie

in  order to gain a point. He speaks on the spur of

the  moment  and, being an opportunist and  without

principles,   has  degenerated  into   becoming   a

habitual liar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Aljunied mentioned that

his  colleague  would stand for the Hong  Lim,

by-election. It is quite clear, Sir, that the attitude

in  which the Member for Aljunied spoke was like  a

master and servant attitude. Perhaps, since Ong Eng

Guan  is no longer a Member of this House, it would

have  been  more  appropriate  if  the  Member  for

Aljunied  had  used  the  terminology  not  of  his

"colleague" but his "master".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that at election time all sorts of

charlatans,   cranks   and  quacks   also   present

themselves  as candidates before the  voters.  Only

unprincipled  politicians think they can  fool  the

people. There is a saying that you can fool some of

the  people  part of the time, but you cannot  fool

all  the people all the time. Let us therefore  not

under-rate the intelligence and the commonsense  of

the   electorate  and  that  they  are  unable   to

distinguish  between right from wrong,  truth  from

lies  and  integrity from corruption. In  the  long

run, truth will always prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Report is clear and concise. Ong Eng Guan is

to  be emphatically condemned by this House for his

dishonourable  conduct  in  being  a  purveyor   of

malicious  falsehoods and bringing the  dignity  of

this House into disrepute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Deputy Prime Minister is to be

supported in no uncertain terms and Members of  the

Opposition  who  choose either  to  abstain  or  to

reject   the   motion  plainly  show   where   they

stand - that is, they stand for untruths and lies.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to support the motion moved  by  the

Deputy  Prime Minister. Sir, before I go  into  the

findings  of  the Commission, may I  touch  on  the

statements made by the Member for Aljunied?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said yesterday, was that he disagreed

with and rejected the Commission's findings. But on

what  grounds  has  he  or his  colleagues  got  to

disagree  with  and  reject  the  findings  of  the

Commission's Report? If he and his colleagues  have

any  reasonable grounds whatsoever to disagree with

the  findings of the Commission, then  they  should

have  come  out with reasons, so that at least  the

people  of  Singapore  or in the  near  future  the

electorate of Hong Lim will know why the Member for

Aljunied  and  his  colleagues disagreed  with  the

Commission's findings. But the Member for  Aljunied

preferred   not  to  come  out  with  any   reasons

whatsoever  to  say  that  he  and  his  colleagues

disagreed  with  the  Report. Instead  he  made  an

announcement  that  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan   will   be

contesting the by-election in Hong Lim. But we  the

P.A.P., since the formation of the P.A.P., have  met

these challenges. This sort of challenge is not new

to  the P.A.P. In 1957 the P.A.P. met the challenge

in  a  by-election on a constitutional  issue.  The

P.A.P.  Secretary-General accepted that  challenge.

But   what  happened?  The  person  who  challenged

absconded.  He never faced the P.A.P. in  that

by-election.  In 1958, it was the Kallang by-election.

Even  though  much had been said about  the  P.A.P.

City Councillors and the P.A.P. Mayor and what they

did  in the City Council since 1957, all the

Right-wing  groups  in  Singapore ganged up  together  to

smash  the  P.A.P. in the Kallang by-election.  But

the  P.A.P.,  with determination and mass  support,

faced it. What was the result? The P.A.P. won. That

in  itself shows that the P.A.P. can still face any

sort  of  challenge from Left-wing opportunists  or

the  Right-wing  reactionary  groups  of  political

parties in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to inform my friend the hon. Member for

Aljunied, to make sure that on Nomination  Day  his

colleague will not betray him but will be  in  Hong

Lim  to submit his Nomination paper. Before he made

the announcement, he should have made it clear that

his  master or his colleague, Mr O.E.G.,  will  be

there on Nomination Day to sign his paper. The  man

who brought up the P.A.P., as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



Opposition  has said; Mr Ong Eng Guan  brought  up

the  P.A.P.? Nonsense! The P.A.P. brought  Ong  Eng

Guan  up.  And since the P.A.P. brought him  up  to

this  position, and he could betray the Party, then

my  advice  to  my  friend,  the  hon.  Member  for

Aljunied,  is  to see that Ong Eng  Guan  will  not

betray him even on Nomination Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to the lengthy

speech  of the hon. Member for Cairnhill.  In  this

Assembly, the Member for Cairnhill has often  given

the  impression that if there is no  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government,  then there will be no  internal

self-government in Singapore. I will say this: if  there

is  no P.A.P., if there is no mass support for  the

P.A.P., and if there is no trade union backing  for

the P.A.P., then I should say that the past Lim Yew

Hock Government was even prepared to work under the

Rendel  Constitution  as stooges  of  the  colonial

government.  Because the P.A.P. put  up  a  strong

fight, and the masses were behind the P.A.P.,  that

is why the Lim Yew Hock Government had to go to the

United Kingdom for a new constitution. That was  no

credit  for the S.P.A. or the Labour Front, because

the  P.A.P. agitated for it,  and  the  people  of

Singapore  know  that  the  P.A.P. took  the  risk

courageously,  and the S.P.A. or the  Labour  Front

would  not  risk it. They know it, and the  British

Government  knows it too well, that the only  Party

with  mass  backing, the only Party with full  mass

support,  is  the P.A.P.; and they  have  no  other

alternative, but to agree to a new constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Member

for  Cairnhill was saying yesterday that he started

his  political  career  in 1948.  He  started  from

Keppel,  shifted to Havelock, and  then  to

Cairnhill. Now I say, he started from the Western Ocean,

now  he  is going to land in the Eastern  sea,  and

that would be his end! He toppled over the vessel's

side  and  started from the sea! So he shifted  and

shifted his way and is going to the Eastern sea!  I

hope that will be his end, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody is looking anxiously

at  the forthcoming by-election and its issue.  But

we, the P.A.P., are prepared and ready to face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



the  electorate of Hong Lim. But one thing - and  the

P.A.P. would  like to make this clear - even  though

the Opposition have made it clear that they are not

in  any way connected with Mr Ong Eng Guan,  still

the  line  they are taking now and Ong  Eng  Guan's

line  are the same. A party which, up to 1960,  was

saying  that Singapore could get independence  only

through  merger. But in 1961 they suddenly  changed

and   they   say   Singapore  must  have   complete

independence  of  its own and  we  must  fight  the

colonial  government. Eng Guan's line is the  same.

It  was the P.A.P.'s stand from the beginning after

1957,  when the Constitution was agreed upon,  that

the  P.A.P. would like to have independence  after

merger  with the Federation of Malaya.  And  today,

the  Right-wing  party which  opposes  a  Left-wing

government fighting against colonialism  comes  out

openly  and  says, "The P.A.P. is a stooge  of  the

colonial  government.  The  P.A.P. does  not  like

independence."  I  think that is exactly  the  same

line as Eng Guan took in the Assembly. That is  why

I  say,  even  though they declare in the  Assembly

that  they  are in no way connected with Eng  Guan,

but  in  underground they are backing Ong Eng  Guan

for  their self-interest. And in the Hong  Lim

by-election,  we will have to expose these  Right-wing

politicians and the Left-wing opportunists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a smear going around

that   the  trade  union  movement  is  no   longer

supporting the P.A.P. nor are they going to support

the  by-election.  This is another  trick  just  to

split the P.A.P. and the trade union movement.  But

we are sure that in this issue which is immediately

facing the Party, the Government and the country as

a  whole, the trade union movement will go  all-out

in  force  to  see  that the people  of  Singapore,

especially the electorate of Hong Lim, support  the

P.A.P. stand on this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if Mr Ong Eng Guan suddenly

changes his mind on Nomination Day and decides  not

to  contest in Hong Lim, then I hope his colleague,

the Member for Aljunied, will be there at least  to

see the P.A.P. candidate there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   Members   will   recollect    the

extraordinary  conduct of the Member for  Cairnhill

when  he  rose  to  speak on the  motion  yesterday

afternoon. The Member for Cairnhill worked  himself

up  to  a  frenzy  and spoke with great  vehemence,

quite  naturally  drawing  return  fire  from   the

Government  Benches.  On several  occasions  during

these exchanges, you, Mr Speaker, had to intervene

in the interest of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at first puzzled at the strange conduct of

the  Member for Cairnhill. So after his  speech,  I

met the Prime Minister in the C.P.A. Room and asked

him,  "Why was Lim Yew Hock raving like a  madman?"

The   Prime  Minister  replied,  "Don't  take   him

seriously. He was merely play-acting." Now, I  want

to  explain to the House the reasons which,  to  my

mind,  led  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  into  this

exhibition of play-acting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the leader of the S.P.A.,

the  Member  for Cairnhill, has suddenly discovered

that  he  had  led the S.P.A. into an  ambush.  The

S.P.A. wanted to destroy the P.A.P. at all  costs,

and,  being  the Opposition Party,  it  was  within

their  right  to try to achieve this  object.  They

thought  they  found  in  Ong  Eng  Guan  a  useful

instrument for discrediting the P.A.P. So when  Ong

Eng  Guan made his reckless allegations, the S.P.A.

calculated  that  even if a large number  of  these

allegations  were  discounted,  there  must  be   a

residue  of half-truths still there. Ong Eng  Guan,

as a former member of the Party who held high posts

in  the  past, according to the Opposition, was  in

possession   of   damaging  Party  and   Government

secrets. So therefore it was in their interest,  or

so they thought, to encourage Ong Eng Guan to press

on. That was the reason for giving Ong Eng Guan not

only  their  secret support but open encouragement.

When  Ong  Eng  Guan  resigned  his  seat  in  this

Assembly,  there was a risk that he  might  scuttle

not  only  from  this Assembly  but  from  the

by-election as well. So while the S.P.A. announced  in

advance that they would not contest the Hong Lim

by-election,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



they hoped to have other conditions obtaining -that

some  people could be deluded into voting for  this

P.A.P. renegade.  But to their discomfiture,  they

discovered  that the Commission of Inquiry  cleared

the  P.A.P.  Ministers concerned of any vestige  of

suspicion.  Furthermore, the Commission  found  Ong

Eng  Guan  to be a liar, a perjurer and a bigamist.

The S.P.A., therefore, suddenly found themselves in

a  position  of open support for a perjurer  and  a

bigamist. They had walked straight into a  trap  of

their  own making. There was no escape. The  Member

for  Cairnhill, therefore, decided to hit out

all-round  so that, in the frenzy of his words,  people

would lose sight of the predicament in which he had

placed  himself and his party. That is why  we  had

the  extraordinary  spectacle  of  the  Member  for

Cairnhill yesterday fulminating and gesticulating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of his speech, he made a

number  of allegations which can hardly be expected

to  go unchallenged. I will deal with some of them,

and  no  doubt  my colleagues will dispose  of  the

rest.  Some of these charges have no direct bearing

on  the  motion. But nevertheless, as these  issues

have  been raised, you will no doubt permit  me  to

reply to them. I myself am directly concerned  with

one  of  the  wild  swipes  which  the  Member  for

Cairnhill let fly. He says that I, as Minister  for

Finance,  went  to London begging for  money.  Sir,

that  is  a gross and malicious distortion  of  the

truth. Everybody is fully aware of the reasons  for

the  London  talks held between the  Singapore  and

British  Governments  last  August.  We  told   the

British  Government that since  defence  was  their

constitutional responsibility, it was their duty to

make  adequate  contribution to the upkeep  of  our

local  defence forces. If no adequate  contribution

was  forthcoming,  then we  would  be  prepared  to

abolish the defence forces. And indeed a number  of

ancillary services have been so disbanded. But  the

British   Government  agreed  to   make   financial

contribution for the maintenance of some of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



more  essential  units. But by no  stretch  of  the

imagination  can  our  request  that  the   British

Government  should  meet its moral  obligations  in

respect of defence be considered as begging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the contribution for the expansion

of the airport facilities. The authority to license

routes  of  airlines making use  of  the  Singapore

Airport vests in the British Government and not  in

the  Singapore  Government. As such,  it  was  only

right  and proper that the British Government  made

an  adequate contribution for the expansion of  the

airport  services. Nothing could  be  more  foolish

than  to  suggest that this stand of the  Singapore

Government amounts to begging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item was over Exchequer loans. Here

again  we  were  not asking for free  money.  These

loans  are  to  be  made on normal terms  governing

British Exchequer loans, which are made between one

Government  and  another. These loans  have  to  be

repaid, and the borrower has to pay interest at the

current  market  rate.  Loan  negotiations  between

Governments  are  a normal part  of  the  financial

activity  of any government. All governments,  even

the   wealthiest,  have  at  one  time  or  another

occasion   to  resort  to  borrowing   from   other

governments. When the Member for Cairnhill calls it

begging,  obviously this is a case of sour  grapes,

for  when his Party formed the Government they were

unaware  of the external financial resources  which

were   available  to  Singapore  to   finance   its

development programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comment of the Member for Cairnhill which

deserves special attention is this. He deplored the

proceedings of the Commission of Inquiry because it

had    led    to    what   he   termed   "character

assassination".  Now  what  does   this   so-called

"character assassination" consist of? It is no more

than  that the Commission found that Ong  Eng  Guan

was  legally married to another woman when he  took

his second wife to Hong Kong to be married. Now who

is  to  blame for raising this bigamy issue in  the

proceedings of the Commission?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



May  I  - read an extract from paragraph 12 of  the

Report? The Commissioner says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although the Prime Minister did not bring this

question   of   multiplicity  of  wives   in   this

Commission, Mr Ong Eng Guan insisted (his  counsel

supporting him) that he should be allowed to  clear

his name. I, very reluctantly, allowed him to do so

lest it be said that I wanted to silence him.'



<br><br>I  was  present during this part of the proceedings

of  the  Commission. According to my  recollection,

the  Commissioner on no less than  three  occasions

refused  to allow this issue to be brought up.  But

finally  he was prevailed upon by Ong Eng Guan  and

his counsel. That, of course, took the lid off, and

Ong Eng Guan had only himself to blame for widening

the  scope of the Inquiry to cover his own  private

life.  There was no character assassination; first,

because  Ong  Eng  Guan  has  no  character  to  be

assassinated; he was simply a liar and a scoundrel.

Secondly,  assassination means the  murder  by  one

party  of  another.  In  the  proceedings  of   the

Commission, what took place cannot be described  as

assassination. It was a simple case of suicide. Ong

Eng Guan himself brought up the subject, and he has

to take the consequences of his own stupidity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another foolish accusation levelled by the Member

for  Cairnhill was that my colleague, the  Minister

for  Culture, had fired the first shot in the  Hong

Lim  by-election.  He regarded the  speech  of  the

Minister  for Culture as a piece of electioneering.

I  myself  consider  the  clear  and  dispassionate

analysis  of  the  Minister for Culture  to  be  an

attempt  to bring together the complicated  threads

of  this  episode to show a pattern  of  underlying

political forces attempting to make use of Ong  Eng

Guan  to  advance their own interests. This  was  a

piece   of   political  analysis,   not   political

electioneering. But I cannot say the same  for  the

speech   of  the  Member  for  Cairnhill.  He   was

electioneering,  nakedly and  unashamedly.  Let  me

recall some of the statements made by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stated - echoing Mr Ong Eng Guan - that it was

Ong  Eng  Guan who, as Mayor of Singapore,  created

the mass support which carried the P.A.P. into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



power at the last general elections. The S.P.A. and

other  Right-wing opportunists can never,  or  will

never,  see that the P.A.P. has built up  its  mass

support  on the basis of its own programme and  its

consistent and determined fight against  all  forms

of  oppression. But to ascribe the success  of  the

P.A.P. to  other forces is an old game  played  by

bankrupt political forces on the Right. Before  Ong

Eng  Guan was ever heard of, the Labour Front,  the

Liberal     Socialists    and    the     Democratic

Party - ancestors  of  the  S.P.A. - had  in  the  past

vehemently  and consistently stated that  the  mass

support which the P.A.P. enjoyed was engineered  by

the  under-cover  Communist organisation.  Now,  if

that was so, when the former Labour Front broke  up

the Communist under-cover organisation, why did the

P.A.P. not collapse? If their analysis was correct,

then  this was the inevitable consequence. But  far

from  collapsing as a result of the 1956/57 purges,

the  P.A.P. went on from strength to strength.  The

reasons  for the mass support enjoyed by our  Party

are  clearly  stated  in an article  in  the  Sixth

Anniversary Souvenir number of the Party.  This  is

being serialised in the Sunday Mail - and I can only

ask  Members who seek enlightenment to  follow  the

series with care and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to my main argument. The Member for

Cairnhill  now  tries to place the credit  for  the

mass support of the P.A.P. on Ong Eng Guan. If this

is  not open electioneering by the S.P.A. on behalf

of Ong Eng Guan in the Hong Lim by-election, then I

do  not  know what it is. But the statement of  the

Member for Cairnhill is utterly foolish. When  will

he  understand that a political movement  does  not

depend   on  individual  heroes?  The  P.A.P. has

repeatedly  stated that there is  no  room  in  the

movement  for heroic individualism which, far  from

doing  the  Party  any good, does  it  considerable

harm. If Ong Eng Guan was responsible for the  mass

support  of the Party, then his expulsion from  the

Party  would have seen the withdrawal of this  mass

support.  Only wishful thinkers would believe  that

this has happened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



Anybody present at the Lumumba protest meeting last

Sunday  could  easily have assessed the  degree  of

mass support enjoyed by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill referred to this

meeting. He said that the large attendance at  this

meeting  was entirely due to what he termed

"Left-wing  adventurers" - a phrase borrowed  from  current

P.A.P. terminology. By this term, he could  either

mean the under-cover Communist organisation, or the

more  militant trade unions. I will not attempt  to

divine his thoughts. But if he had been present, he

would  have  seen that the stadium  was  packed  to

capacity long before the organised arrival  of  the

trade union members. They marched in at about 10.30

a.m. onwards,  and only a part of  the  procession

organised by these unions could find space  in  the

stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the principal issue? It is the

contention  of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Culture, that in the Hong Lim by-election there  is

a  ganging-up against the P.A.P. This ganging-up is

between  Ong  Eng  Guan,  a  political  opportunist

without any principle whatsoever but pretending  to

have Left-wing and anti-colonial principles on  the

one  hand, and on the other hand a group of

Right-wing  opportunists who had been  by-passed  by  the

tide  of  events. These are the S.P.A. representing

pro-colonial   Right-wing  forces   and   political

mountebanks such as David Marshall and  Mrs

Leon-Soh.  All  these groups are smarting under  defeats

repeatedly administered to them in the past by  the

P.A.P.  They are hoping to experience sweet revenge

by  manipulating Ong Eng Guan. I do not think this

move  on their part is at all clever. But they have

decided  upon this crazy adventure without  knowing

its  full  and ghastly implications which only  now

are unfolding themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A. disclaim any support of Ong Eng Guan

now  that the man has been thoroughly exposed.  But

they  say  one  thing - their actions  point  to  the

opposite  direction. They now say,  when  they  are

cornered,  that they do not support Ong  Eng  Guan.

The same way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



when  Ong  Eng Guan was cornered in the Commission,

he  said  that  he  had  not made  any  allegations

against  the  Prime Minister and the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law. But this is merely  playing  with

words.  We judge a man not merely by his words  but

by  his  deeds.  If the S.P.A. and  other  sinister

Right-wing forces want to give their support to Ong

Eng  Guan, so be it. We will take them on  in  Hong

Lim  and  give  them the thrashing of their  lives.

This is not the first time there has been a

ganging-up  against  the P.A.P. Members will recollect  the

Kallang  by-election  when there  was  another  big

ganging-up.  But  the  collection  of  disreputable

political forces is no guarantee of victory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now pose the issue contained in the Deputy

Prime  Minister's motion clearly and  briefly?  We

are  here  to  condemn a man who, in effect,  had

been  found by a judicial tribunal to be a liar,  a

perjurer  and a bigamist. The issue is basically  a

moral  one.  This  Assembly must  voice  its  moral

indignation the dishonourable conduct of one of its

former  Members.  It is no use  trying  to  put  up

pretexts  for evading the issue - pretexts which  are

too  flimsy to deceive a child. If the man has been

guilty  of  dishonourable conduct, then it  is  the

duty  of  this Assembly to condemn him, so that  in

future rogues and scoundrels will be dissuaded from

besmirching  the  dignity  and  reputation  of  the

Assembly.  I repeat - this is our moral duty  and  I

look forward with interest to listening to what the

Member for Tanglin has to say, for he professes  to

be a very strong upholder of moral principles and a

disciple  of  moral rearmament.  Let  there  be  no

evasion  or  side-trackings,  and  let  no  one  be

influenced  by political expediency into abstention

from  voting on this issue. That is the  way  of  a

coward.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for Aljunied appeared to be picking up  the

tactics  of Mr Ong Eng Guan yesterday. He rejected

the  Chua  Report  as being outside  the  terms  of

reference, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



quoted  the P.A.P. comments on the Buttrose Report.

The  P.A.P. made those comments at a public meeting

without protection of privilege, because, if hauled

up,  they were prepared to justify their views. The

Member  for Aljunied made his observations  as  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan did inside the Assembly. He has  not

produced  one argument or fact to show in what  way

the  findings  of the Chua Report are incorrect  or

outside the terms of reference. Does he or Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan  claim that Mr Ong Eng Guan was  telling

the  truth? Will Mr Ong Eng Guan repeat  again  in

public  now that he has not the protection of  this

Assembly  that he had been telling the truth  when

he made the allegations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the S.P.A. who have an understandable

dislike for Inquiry Commissions? Do they or do they

not  accept the findings of the Report that Mr Ong

Eng  Guan  lied and that he is a person not  to  be

believed? The truth is that they know that Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan  is a liar, and that he lied.  They  know

that  the Report of the findings was true, but they

cannot admit it publicly, because Mr Ong Eng  Guan

is   their   candidate  fighting  the  Opposition's

battle.  The  S.P.A., like Mr Ong  Eng  Guan,  was

trapped  by  their opportunism. Hoping to  fish  in

troubled waters, they rushed to support Mr Ong Eng

Guan  by  saying  that they  would  not  put  up  a

candidate in Hong Lim and that he would be fighting

the  opposition's battle. The Member for  Cairnhill

said in the Assembly that the by-election is not  a

fight between Mr Ong Eng Guan and the P.A.P.,  but

a  battle  between the Opposition and the Party  in

power.  Mr Ong never repudiated the claim that  he

was  fighting the Opposition's battle and  has  not

done  so  up  to  now. These conferences  with  the

S.P.A. and  ex-Labour  Front  lawyers  since   the

censure   motion  further  proved   that   in   his

desperation he was willing to become a stool-pigeon

for  the Right. The spirited resistance put  up  by

the S.P.A. to censure the motion and the repetition

by  the S.P.A. of Mr Ong Eng Guan's argument  that

the  motion was an attempt to muzzle him, that  the

by-election  should be held before the findings  of

the Report were published,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



an  agreement not to weaken the chances of Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan by not putting up an S.P.A. candidate  so

that  Right-wing  votes would go to  him - all  these

indications  of a tie-up between Mr Ong  Eng  Guan

and the Right-wing are clear enough. Having hitched

their  wagon  to  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan,  it  is  now

difficult  for  the  S.P.A. openly  to  accept  the

findings that the allegations he made were  untrue,

because then they would have to admit that Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan  was guilty of dishonourable conduct;  so

they  studiously avoid pronouncing judgment on  the

Report's  findings because there can  only  be  one

judgment.  On  the  one hand, it  will  not  do  to

nominate him as the Opposition's candidate, and  on

the  other  hand, to proclaim that he is guilty  of

dishonourable conduct. We also feel  that  Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan and the S.P.A. realise that they have let

the  cat  out  of the bag by letting  the  Worker's

Party,   the  S.P.A. and  the  Singapore  Congress

publicly  espouse  his  cause.  It  must  be   very

embarrassing to Mr Ong Eng Guan to have only

Right-wing and opportunist elements publicly speaking  up

in  his  defence.  By his enthusiasm  and  lack  of

subtlety,  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan  and  his  Right-wing

backers  have revealed more than they intended;  so

now  the S.P.A., in order to retrieve the situation

for  their stooges, take a new line. The S.P.A. no

longer claim that Mr Ong Eng Guan is fighting  the

Opposition's battle; or as the Member for Cairnhill

claimed  on 11th January, that the by-election  was

not  a  fight  between Mr Ong  Eng  Guan  and  the

P.A.P., but a battle between the Opposition and the

P.A.P.  The  Member for Cairnhill took a  new  line

yesterday  and said that the fight was between  two

factions  of  the P.A.P., and may the  lesser  evil

win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition are not going to

be  involved in the Hong Lim fight. As far  as  the

motion  is concerned, they are now going to  remain

neutral,  though  they  have  opposed  the   motion

earlier.  They  will abstain. They  have  no  views

whether  or  not to condemn Mr Ong  Eng  Guan  for

deliberately  lying under the cover  of  privilege.

Our  view  is that this decision to abstain  is  an

attempt to cover up the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Ong Eng Guan is the tool of the S.P.A. Now Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan can claim that since the  S.P.A. is

abstaining  on the motion, it was clear proof  that

he  did  not  enjoy their patronage.  The  S.P.A.'s

claim  that he was fighting the Opposition's battle

was merely a joke and the S.P.A. pranksters are not

to be taken seriously. I shall not be surprised, in

view  of  this new line, that Mr Ong will join  in

the  make-believe  that he is no S.P.A. tool,  and

even issues statements denouncing the S.P.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Singapore and also in Hong Lim are

not   fools.   They  can  smell   out   liars   and

opportunists  and  Right-wing  stool-pigeons.  They

know  that not a single trade union, not  a  single

association outside the Right-wing, has come out in

their   support.  They  are  not  fooled   by   the

"Independence  Now" slogans, because Mr  Marshall,

Mr   Lim  Choon  Mong  and  even  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  have also echoed the same  slogans.  And

for  the  same reason to win support by  posing  as

anti-colonialists. Then why do the S.P.A. want  to

remain  neutral  and abstain? The  reason  is  very

simple.  Because they want to find out if  Mr  Ong

can   split   the   unity  of  the  Left-wing   and

progressive  forces in Hong Lim  - a  working  class

area.  They want to find out whether the people  of

Singapore are sufficiently politically conscious to

support  the principles and policies of the P.A.P.,

or  whether they can be deluded into supporting  an

individual  who  uses  lies  and  deceit  to  build

himself up as a revolutionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Ong can split the progressive forces in

Hong  Lim by posing as a revolutionary, by claiming

that  it was he personally and not the P.A.P. as  a

movement  which brought progress to  Singapore  and

championed the people, then that will be the signal

for   the   Right-wing  to  launch  their

counter-revolution. Mr Ong could then be built up  with  a

view  to  splitting the progressive  and  Left-wing

forces  and thus open the doors for a come-back  by

the Right. If they can help Mr Ong Eng Guan to win

in  Hong Lim, then the Right-wing would be able  to

boost the morale of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



their  Right-wing patrons who now see no other  way

of  making a come-back. That is why the Right-wing,

led  by  the S.P.A., are working so hard to enhance

the  reputation of Mr Ong. A victory for  Mr  Ong

would be a morale booster for the dispirited

Right-wing.  The S.P.A. no more than Ong Eng Guan believe

in  the so-called 16 resolutions, but if it  would

help  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan to split Left-wing  unity,

then   even  the  S.P.A. are  prepared  to   voice

revolutionary slogans. The S.P.A. are using Mr Ong

Eng  Guan  as a test of how useful he could  be  in

dividing  the Left and thus opening the way  for  a

resurgence of the Right. In a way, the Hong Lim

by-election is not unlike the Kallang by-election.  In

the  Kallang  by-election, the  then  Labour  Front

joined the Liberal-Socialists, who, in turn, were a

coalition of remnant Progressives and Democrats, to

see  if  the united front of the Right could defeat

the P.A.P. They failed then, and they will fail  in

Hong  Lim.  This  time they are  using  a  renegade

P.A.P. who  has not only turned informer  for  the

Right-wing by pretending to them that he had a  lot

of  secret information to reveal which could damage

the  P.A.P., but who, has in a desperate effort  to

stage  a  political  comeback agreed  to  play  the

dangerous game of stooging for the Right. So let it

be  clear to the people that the fight in Hong  Lim

is  not between two factions in the P.A.P. It is  a

fight between the P.A.P. and the Ong/Lim coalition.

What the Right is seeking is not a victory for  Mr

Ong, who they know is a liar and an opportunist and

by  no means a revolutionary, but a victory for the

Right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the S.P.A. know very well that

Mr  Ong Eng Guan is so desperate that he would not

hesitate  to  tell  any lies  to  further  his  own

interest  and  that he is prepared to  destroy  the

P.A.P with reckless lies and slanders. Such a  man,

the S.P.A. know, can be a useful tool in the

Right-wing's scheme to try and destroy the P.A.P. Mr Ong

was  publicly accused by 22 Assemblymen of  telling

lies. He was proved to have lied in the Assembly. A

Judge  found  him a man who would not  hesitate  to

tell   untruths.  If  he  has  lied  to  his  Party

colleagues and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



if  he  has lied before the Assembly and  before  a

Judge,  he is capable of lying in Hong Lim provided

he can do it safely. His favourite weapon is either

to  cast  smears or lie secretly to individuals  by

hole and corner methods where there would be no one

to challenge him. In the Party, his tactics were to

get  individual  members quietly to  a  corner  and

whisper falsehoods. Never had he dared to utter his

falsehoods openly and in the presence of  those  he

seduced.  When openly challenged he  did  the  bunk

under one pretext or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a favourite lie of his, and

also echoed by the S.P.A., is that this conflict is

a  personal conflict between Mr Lee Kuan  Yew  and

Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan. When pointed  out  that  every

P.A.P.   Assemblyman,  Party  members   and   trade

unionists  have attacked him as an opportunist  who

in  his  desperation is ready to betray and destroy

the  P.A.P. to  further the  cause  of  Right-wing

parties,  like  the S.P.A., he explained  that  all

these men had been intimidated into attacking him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill said

that   we  should  be  ashamed  of  ourselves   for

denouncing and condemning a party member who was

ex-Mayor, ex-Minister and also a very important man in

the  Party. The mistake usually made by leaders  of

ruling  parties in certain countries in  South-East

Asia  is  that  they have not the courage  to  take

action against their own colleagues when they  find

that  they are in the wrong; and that is the  usual

beginning of a corrupt government. We in the P.A.P.

will always have the courage and guts to do away on

our own accord with any member or any leader who is

found to be dishonest, corrupt or against the Party

principles. The S.P.A. did not have the courage  to

take  action  against Mr Chew Swee  Kee,  although

they  knew what he was doing. That was one  of  the

reasons for their downfall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It looks to me we should have a

I will put the Question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, can I just hold the fort for the Deputy

Prime Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not my original

intention  to speak at length on this  debate.  The

original   motion   was  firstly   connected   with

allegations  against  me  and  my  colleague,   the

Minister  for Labour and Law. On that occasion  the

Leader  of the House made it clear that  I  had  no

wish  to  be a judge of my own conduct and that  it

was  up  to other Members of the Assembly to decide

the rights or wrongs of the matter. Since then, the

matter has been investigated into and findings have

been  made  thereon by an independent  person.  But

what I have to say on this motion concerns not  Mr

Ong  Eng Guan, who has been proved a liar and  whom

we hope to have the opportunity of meeting again in

Hong  Lim, if he is so unwise as to appear.  But  I

would  like  to  take this opportunity  to  make  a

commentary  on what I think is one of  the  reasons

for  the  failure  of  the  parliamentary  type  of

democratic system in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On several occasions in the past, I have had to

underline  the  fact  that  the  Western  type   of

parliamentary democracy has to be adapted  to  suit

and  meet  the practical realities of our position.

The system of one man one vote, one adult one vote,

regardless    of   whether   he   has   educational

qualifications,  can ensure that the  interests  of

the  majority  prevail over the  minority,  without

having to crush and destroy all Opposition, only if

adjustments are made to preserve not the forms  and

frills  of  the system but its essence - the  essence

being  a relatively tolerant political system which

ensures  a change in the social and economic  order

of a society without having to resort to violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One curious fact which emerges from the

experiments in parliamentary democracy in  Asia  is

that  it works only when the governing party has  a

clear  majority, and is strong and decisive.  Where

an  elected government is weak and has  not  got  a

clear   majority,  or  is  composed  of   coalition

factions, then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



system  breaks  down,  as it  has  broken  down  in

Indonesia; as it has broken down in Burma when  the

governing party, the A.F.P.F.L., broke up into  two

sections  and  the  Army had to take  over;  as  it

threatened to break down in Ceylon under  the  late

Mr   Bandanaraike  who  did  not  have  a  working

majority  and  depended on coalition  support.  And

lest we forget, as it threatened to break down in a

semi-experiment between the years 1955 and 1959  in

Singapore   under  the  government  of  Mr   David

Marshall and later the government of the Member for

Cairnhill  who had to depend on unstable  alliances

and  coalitions, many or all of which  were  of  an

opportunistic  nature. It is only in  India,  where

the  Government (the Congress Party) has a decisive

majority  and  in the Federation of  Malaya,  where

U.M.N.O. has a clear majority, that the attempt  to

work  the  Western type of parliamentary  democracy

has not failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ceylon has been out of the news for some

time  as an area of strife and instability. I would

like  to  suggest that one of the reasons is  that,

unlike   her   late   husband's  Government,   Mrs

Bandanaraike  at least has a working  majority.  In

the  same way, one of the reasons why Singapore  is

out  of the international news columns of riots and

civil  commotion,  economic  unrest  and  political

instability, is that there is a government  with  a

clear  majority  and with a clear  mandate  on  its

policy.  From these facts and from these phenomena,

the conclusion one is forced to draw is that one of

the   problems   that   bedevil   experiments    in

parliamentary  democracy  in  Asia  is   that   the

opposition  often is unwilling, or perhaps  unable,

to  play  up  to its role within the constitutional

framework, and that when the Opposition is  strong,

it  can  and often does foul up the working of  the

system.     A    proper    Opposition - theoretically

speaking - opposes  the policy of the  Government  by

offering  an  alternative remedy  to  economic  and

social  problems, whilst at the same time upholding

the  institutions upon which the democratic  system

is  based. One of these institutions is, of course,

the elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



Legislature itself. Unfortunately, most, though not

all,  oppositions  over large  parts  of  Asia  are

negative in that they have no alternative policy of

their own to offer the electorate. They oppose  for

the  sake  of  opposing  not  just  the  Party   in

power - for that is the legitimate duty and  role  of

the  Opposition - but  very often  they  oppose  and

challenge the institutions of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Opposition is feeble, and

not  just  in  numbers.  We have  tried,  and  will

continue  to try, to make it possible for  them  to

play   their  proper  constitutional  role,  albeit

limited, to criticise Government policies, to offer

their own solutions to our problems, in order  that

at  the  appropriate  time the  people  can  decide

between  the  course  of  action  we  offer,  as  a

solution to our problems, and the course of  action

they offer. But if there is one thing this Ong  Eng

Guan  issue  has proved, it is that the opportunity

which  the Opposition has had to play its role  has

not  been utilised. It is wasted because,  from  my

own  observation, it is an Opposition with no fixed

beliefs  and  no  fixed  political  principles.  It

opposes  on  the  basis of opportunistic  political

manoeuvring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, this matter first arose

on  19th December last year when the Leader of  the

House   moved  his  motion  of  censure,   and   an

adjournment was sought to the 23rd when it came  up

for  debate.  On  that  occasion  the  Member  for

Cairnhill said that this issue - and I quote him from

col. 864:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... had made it difficult for the Opposition to

enter into this debate which, in the minds and  the

hearts  of  the people outside, has nothing  but  a

political motive'.



<br><br>Then  you reminded him, Mr Speaker, Sir,  of  your

view  of the matter, and he went on to say in  col.

865:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What I was going to say was that we on this side

of  the  House think that the right way to  discuss

this motion is as you have ruled and that we do not

give credence to what the people outside say,.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if we want to accept the literal,

straightforward  meaning  of  what  he   said,   he

honestly does not believe that that has a political

motive,  and one must assume that what  the  Member

said in this House is on the record.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the course of the debate, it

is quite clear that Members of the Opposition were

not  interested in seeing the dignity of the  House

upheld  and  the  standards of  honourable  conduct

maintained. They were intent on helping to  confuse

the  issue before the people, intent on whether  or

not to help Mr Ong Eng Guan confuse the issue. But

what was the issue, Sir? A Member had made a number

of  false and baseless accusations under the  cover

of  his  privilege  in  this  House  against  other

persons,  both  in this Assembly and  outside.  The

Opposition  was  not interested in  the  harm  that

would  be  done  to  this  House  if  parliamentary

privilege  was  wilfully abused in this  way.  From

what  they actually said, I think the truth is that

what they were interested in using Mr Ong Eng Guan

as  a  means to confuse the people in the hope that

it  would  weaken their confidence in the integrity

of  the  Government. But what I think they did  not

realise  was that both the legal arguments made  in

this  Chamber  and the statements made  outside  by

Opposition Party leaders were calculated to confuse

and cloud the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that on the

23rd  December last year, Mr Ong Eng Guan said  he

was  going to substantiate his allegations.  Nobody

was  more surprised and more disappointed than  the

Members  opposite. They showed it in  their  faces.

Here was a man who said he had the dope to kill the

Government - political corruption.  He  said  he  was

going  to  prove it. They were crestfallen  because

they  knew that Mr Ong had embarked on a  perilous

course which would lead to his exposure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they had wanted to play politics and to

play  it  within certain principles, I  would  have

thought that surely the least they could do was  to

insist on the grave charges being investigated  and

thoroughly  looked  into  and  placed  before   the

people. For if they were found to be true, or even

partly  true,  then it must mean the fall  of  this

Government and fresh general elections. And  it  is

the  duty, not only of the Government but  also  of

the  Opposition, to get at the truth,  and  to  see

that  when such accusations are made against people

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



high  office, they are met. Someone who had been  a

Minister  in the Government alleged that there  had

been  malpractices and political corruption in high

places.   But  the  Opposition  never  showed   any

interest in pursuing this charge. What they  wanted

to  do, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my submission, was  to

have  a  by-election  in  Hong  Lim,  whilst  these

charges were still in the air, left uninvestigated;

a  mist of doubt and suspicion cast over honest and

dishonest alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put this to the Member for Cairnhill. The

Secretary-General of the S.P.A. said in a statement

on 7th February - a Press release:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... is an attempt to rouse the S.P.A. into

precipitate  and  hasty action.  Much  dirt  hidden

hitherto  by P.A.P. leaders has now been  revealed.

Even   the   absence  of  the  Party's   Organising

Secretary from Singapore at this crucial moment  is

significant.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Much dirt,", Sir, hitherto hidden. Mr Lim Choon

Mong,   Secretary-General - not  a   very   important

person;  not  a very responsible officer.  But  for

this to come from the Member for Cairnhill who knew

that  he  would have to come before this House  and

face us - on the  11th February:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The shameful P.A.P. eruptions and events

following had sent up plenty of "dirt". More  would

be revealed during the by-election at Hong Lim.'



<br><br>"Dirt - more would be revealed". If there is any dirt

anywhere,  I say it is the duty of every Member  of

this Assembly to focus public attention upon it, in

order  that those on whom the dirt rests  shall  be

cleansed out of the body politic. Far from  wanting

to  have  the  dirt  put  under  a  microscope  and

properly  diagnosed, all they  were  interested  in

doing  was  to add more dirt and more smear.  These

are  statements just on the borderline,  Sir,  They

are not specific enough for us to take them up on a

challenge, but just enough to insinuate that  there

was  a  lot  of  corruption. But to  my  mind,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is not only unprincipled.  Let  me

assure them that it is a positively dangerous  line

to   take  with  this  Government,  being  of   the

character  and of the temperament that it  is.  One

thing we must be prepared to do - that each and every

allegation of malpractice must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



investigated, for the fundamental pre-condition for

the successful working of the democratic system  is

that  those who offer themselves as members of  the

political  leadership  to  implement  policies   on

behalf  of  the public must be men of some  honesty

and integrity, in order to make any election pledge

and  any  election  programme worth  looking  into.

However, that is only one aspect of the reaction of

the Opposition Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, I would like to say that

the  Minister for Culture has asked me to  mention,

since he already spoke yesterday, that when he  was

referring to the Opposition, he really intended the

S.P.A.,  Lib-Socs and so on. To our minds, U.M.N.O.

is in a slightly different category. They are, as I

have said at the very beginning,-



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Fairer Park):</b> Are you going

through it all over again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. There is a definite

distinction.  Let  us admit it - they  went  to  the

Southern  Islands and proved they do represent  the

Malays; and they are tied up with their parent body

in  the  Federation of Malaya. And it  is  not  our

business to pick a quarrel with them because of our

inheritance. But in any case they have not  entered

into  this  issue, not in the way  the  Member  for

Cairnhill and his colleagues have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these statements by the S.P.A.- by the

Member  for  Cairnhill in this House and  by  other

officials outside - show clearly the minds  and  the

intentions  of the Opposition. Accustomed  as  they

are to specific charges being made against them and

their  members, and having suffered the humiliation

of  having one charge of corruption proved  to  the

hilt  not  only against Mr Chew Swee Kee but  also

against  others closely related to the  members  of

their  regime, they have never thought fit to  meet

and  answer  allegations of  political  corruption.

Perhaps they have different standards of conduct in

these  matters. Sir, if one wants to be charitable,

one would say that perhaps they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



do  not  know  that  the  surest  way  to  a  quick

political  demise is to have a charge of corruption

stick against you unrebutted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two other aspects in this issue.

What  is  the  issue between us and the Opposition?

Namely,  that  we, as the Party in power,  have  to

implement  policies.  They, as  the  Party  in  the

Opposition,  have  the  right  to  criticise  those

policies  as  wrong and misconceived,  and  to  put

forward  their alternative remedies. But one  likes

to  believe that people play this opposition on the

basis of certain fixed principles, namely, that you

do  not  shoot the referee or cut the ropes of  the

boxing  ring. What I am suggesting to them in  this

issue  is  this. Whether wittingly or  unwittingly,

what  they have been doing and what the Member  for

Cairnhill did up till yesterday is tantamount to  a

reckless,  albeit ineffective and  feeble,  attempt

not  to bring the Government down and also to wreck

the system by misleading the people as to what this

Assembly was about, as to what the issues are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start off with the Member for Hong Lim on

the  27th.  It is as you have stated, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  On  the  31st December, he made a

statement

`Mr  Ong  resigns.' This is not  in  the  Assembly

records.  He issued a statement published in  full,

not in full in the Straits Tunes (He has complained

of it) - but in full in the Nanyang Siang Pau and the

Sin Chew Jit Poh, and I am reading from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ong Eng Guan has resigned his seat in the

Legislative Assembly. Whether it is because of  the

motion  moved by the Leader of the House to condemn

him  for  his dishonourable conduct and to  suspend

him from the service of the Assembly, or because he

wished  to  have his activities in the  Legislative

Assembly  strengthened by the  electorate  that  he

tendered his resignation, once he stands for the

by-election, he will have to tell the election.'



<br><br>Is  there  any  doubt in their minds what  was  the

cause of all this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have no sympathy for Ong Eng Guan.'



<br><br>So says the S.P.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although he started as a Minister before his

expulsion  through power struggle in the Party,  he

ended  as  a Member of the Opposition and  in  this

particular instance [namely, what Mr Ong Eng Guan

has been doing],



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



he  will, in the by-election, fight in the capacity

of the Opposition against the Party in power, which

with  its majority in the Legislative Assembly  can

in  many  respects unjustly silence the Opposition.

For this reason, we shall not field a candidate for

the by-election.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence the Opposition! Did we try to silence Mr

Ong?  Does anybody in his right mind believe  that?

But  what  we wanted him to do was to speak  up  so

that  we could expose him and pin him down  to  the

truth.  Official Leader of the Opposition,  Sir!  I

mean,  we recognise him as such. It is part of  the

democratic  framework  that  there  should  be   an

official  leader of the Opposition. He  appears  in

the  table  of precedence. We pay him the  courtesy

which  his position requires. We hope that he  will

be  able -  having held positions of

responsibility - and  he  says `silence him'. It may be  funny,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  But it is not funny  when  I  start

reading a few more passages which contradict  that.

Having  said that, he then discovered that  it  was

all  a  great mistake. Probably Mr Ong  must  have

rung  him up and said, `Don't be a silly ass.  That

is the surest way to kill me.' Because the Minister

for  Culture immediately went and took up the point

and   said,   `There  you  are.  This  proves   it.

Opposition versus Party in power.' That is what  it

is  all  about. It is a gang-up. So the lines  were

changed. It has nothing to do with this. It is  now

what he said yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Two factions in the P.A.P. fighting - pro-Ong Eng

Guan  versus  pro-P.A.P.' A new  line!  That  is  a

better one anyway. It will help Ong Eng Guan better

that  way.  But he forgot that it was on record  as

recently as the 11th January. It is on the  record,

the transcript, corrected undoubtedly by the Member

for  Cairnhill,  because it  already  went  to  the

Press - so I understand it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let me tell this House how that statement should

have  read  if  the  Press had  been  fair  to  the

Opposition.'



<br><br>Then he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But we did say this: "that because of the fact

that  the  by-election  is going  to  be  a  battle

between  the  Opposition and  the  Party  in  power

which,  by  reason of its majority, could  unjustly

use its power to silence the Opposition".'



<br><br>On  the  11th  of  January, it was the  `Opposition

versus  the  Party  in  power.'  On  the  22nd   of

February, it was no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



longer that. In fact, it is not even as long ago as

the  11th of January. He went on to say - on the same

day:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`that the Government has no right to think that

this  by-election is a fight between  Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan and the P.A.P.'



<br><br>Those were honest views; presumably they must  have

been, Mr Speaker, Sir, because we start off on the

assumption  that they are honourable  Members,  and

not  liars and rogues. Finally, of course,  it  may

well  be  that we corner the Member and he is  left

with nothing on him. That is what he said, "a fight

between  Mr Ong Eng Guan and the P.A.P." No  right

to  consider that. If the Opposition are interested

in  this  by-election - they want it.  Have  it  now.

Never mind the Commission of Inquiry. Let the truth

be hidden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most curious of all the propositions

that  have come out from the S.P.A. is this one  on

the   4th   of  February.  It  shows  how   rapidly

contamination   works  through   association   with

contaminated people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`S.P.A.'s stand towards the Hong Lim

by-election.'



<br><br>They say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is a struggle between the Government Party

and the Opposition Party.'



<br><br>That  is the 4th of February. Two and a half  weeks

before  yesterday,  when the Member  for  Cairnhill

decided to change his line. Then he went on to say,

of  course,  all  this  brother-in-law  and  bigamy

controversy. Mr Ong Eng Guan was trying  to  laugh

it off. He made no allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have said what the intention of the Government really is. Anybody who makes a

charge  is entitled to make it. Once he has made  a

charge, he gets an investigation, whether he  likes

it  or not. What I said about multiplicity of wives

was  directed  at throwing out Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan,

since he refused to give me a chance to sue him.  I

offered  him  a chance to sue me in order  that  he

might go into the witness box. I waited a long time

for  that privilege in order to confront him  with

the  truth. And the Member for Cairnhill  expressed

his regret that only one had been produced. Sir,  I

did  not  want to do more damage to a lot of  other

innocent young



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



ladies  who  might wish to live peaceful  lives.  I

only   bothered  to  bring  out  those   who   were

irrevocably  involved. In fact,  there  were  other

sorts of common law association which I could  have

brought  out, but we will let these things lie  for

the time being. And he jolly well knew all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for Finance, asked me

why that man was raving. I said, "Do not believe  a

word  of  it. It is all synthetic. He has been

at this game for such a long time that he can simulate

rage,  indignation, despair - best of all,  despair,

because  he  has  a lot of practice  in  simulating

despair; he has had many occasions genuinely to use

it.  See  what  he says: `No bearing  on  this

by-election.  That is how the thing cropped  up.  Hong

Lim 16 resolutions.' He never resigned." And indeed

he  kept  on.  He was going to be the fierce

anti-colonialist.  He  was going to shout  slogans  here

under cover of privilege and denounce everybody. He

did not ever want to resign over the brother-in-law

issue.  He  was going to justify it. He decided  to

resign  because,  I suggest, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  he

discovered  that what he was going to say  when  he

justified it, was not going to be said as a  Member

of  this Assembly on privilege, but it was going to

be  said  on oath and subject to cross-examination.

When  he  said, "Yes, I will justify  it."  perhaps

only  one other person on the Opposition Bench knew

what  it meant and his face fell. That man was  the

Member  for Farrer Park, because he could not  help

saying,  "Give the man a chance," when  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister was trying to pin him  down,  "What

are  your  allegations?" "For God's sake, give  the

man  a  chance." No, give the convict  or  crook  a

chance - to get away.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah:</b> The accused, not the crook!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He knew what justification

meant.  It meant substantiation. And when  Mr  Ong

discovered it, he absconded, but not because he was

going  to  fight  on behalf of the people.  He  ran

away. This is one of the foolish things he did.  If

he  keeps on doing it. If he runs away from the

by-election. He ran away from here; he landed up in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



the Commission of Inquiry. He thinks he can lightly

dismiss the Inquiry and go off to Hong Lim. Then he

lands into a bigger mess there, and he runs off  to

somewhere else. But that is another matter. What is

of  interest  is  this. This is an important  Party

statement - The  Opposition, under the oppression  of

the Party in power - The question is a question  of

principle, whether there is a chance to survive  or

to  speak. This is from the Nanyang Siang Pau. I do

not know why the Straits Times does not publish all

these  things. It does not do a world of  good.  It

does infinite harm and the Straits Times suppressed

these  things - I  do not know whether  wittingly  or

unwittingly - and saved them from their own folly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had this properly translated, Sir, in case

it  is disputed. I cannot imagine how anybody  can,

in  his  right  mind, say these things,  which  are

completely at variance with the facts and with  his

understanding of the facts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The 4th of February. Can I

just read this and get the official translation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I just want to know the date. That

is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The most

important concept is whether the Opposition,  under

the pressure of the-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): `The important point [This is not

my  translation; it is an official one] is  whether

or  not the Opposition, under the oppression of the

party  in  power, has the chance to survive  or  to

speak.'



<br><br>A  question  of  principle! They can  stand  up  to

principles on the basis of the lies, of a  perjurer

and a bigamist. Principles! Just in case the Member

for Farrer Park and the Member for Tanglin stand up

and  disavow all these things, let me cap them  all

by another quotation from the Member for Cairnhill.

The  Member for Cairnhill said in the Straits Times

of 11th February, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"We like to make it clear that news releases are

the  responsibility  of the  party  executive.  The

chairman  and  secretary general are  the  officers

authorised  to  sign such releases,  and  in  their

absence,  the  vice-chairman or  deputy

secretary-general." '.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



In case people do not take him seriously enough, he

shouts  his "independence" line. According  to  the

Member  for  Cairnhill,  a momentous  decision  was

reached  some months ago: to be anti-colonialist,

to fight for immediate independence. And he kept it

a closely guarded secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the Secretary-General, ex-Lib-soc,

ex-Progressive, ex-Member of this Assembly,  who  used

to  lighten the burden of our debates by his  comic

intervention about youth, said that we  have  been

in  office for 18 months and we have made slow but

nevertheless progress. The Tunku comes out  to  say

that  he  is satisfied. We never asked him  to  say

this. A German journalist asked him. He said,  yes,

we were Malayan-minded and he hoped others would be

like  us. And then progress that comes with a trade

revolution.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill   is   not

interested  in  merger. He wants independence  now,

with  the  most  curious explanation  that  I  have

heard.  Why  do  they  want independence  now?  The

Member  for Cairnhill said since we came in we  had

made  merger impossible. Therefore, we had to fight

for  independence. I do not know, Mr Speaker, Sir,

whether  this  is  seriously  put  forward  as   an

alternative policy. Sane, sensible men are supposed

to  put  forward this policy to an even  saner  and

sensible  electorate.  I say  to  them,  "Have  the

courage  to  stand  up  for your  beliefs.  Send  a

candidate down to Hong Lim. Shout these slogans and

let  the  people decide." But I have explained  the

reason why they do not do it is that they have  not

got the courage of their convictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said yesterday, Sir,

that this was really a fight between what he called

the pro-Lee Kuan Yew group and the pro-Ong Eng Guan

group. Sir, these are 39 stooges. Mr Ong Eng  Guan

also was once upon a time by inference a stooge  of

mine. What the Member did not go on to say was that

the  pro-Ong Eng Guan group now includes some  very

curious fish like Mr R. C. H. Lim, a former Labour

David Marshall, who called Mr Ong Eng Guan a hero.

Well,  a  man  is entitled to call a chap  what  he

likes. He called Mr Lim Cher Kheng Hero No. 1  . Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan  is  the second  man  to  wear  that

medallion. A hero for telling lies. What he did not

say also was the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to rebut the Member's foolish

statements made yesterday. But he did say yesterday

in  explanation  - rather  he  gave  an  explanation

yesterday. I want to be a little bit careful  about

this  since  you  were  an actor  in  the  dramatis

personae  of  this  particular event.  He  made  an

explanation yesterday of how Mr Ong Eng Guan  knew

of  the  move to condemn him. I had said openly  he

alerted   Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan.  He  said   in   his

explanation he denied that he alerted Ong Eng Guan.

He  said he saw Mr Ong Eng Guan and then he  said,

"You  had  better ask the Speaker. I do not  know."

And Mr Ong Eng Guan thereafter went to see you  at

his  suggestion. When Mr Ong Eng  Guan  came  back

from  seeing  you, he (Mr Ong Eng Guan)  told  the

Member   for  Cairnhill  that  Mr  Speaker   said,

"Surprise  move." But the Speaker is  a  gentleman.

What did he say? "Surprise move."?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> P.A.P. bad, man!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker was a gentleman,

but  he  was going to demand notice. The  inference

left in the air, Mr Speaker, Sir, was that perhaps

you  told  Mr Ong Eng Guan. Sir, you  cannot  take

part in this debate. For the purpose of the record,

I  think I should mention briefly that you had told

me  earlier,  and  you confirmed it  with  me  this

morning, that you were surprised when Mr  Ong  Bug

Guan  came to see you, that he already knew that  a

motion  was being considered against him, and  that

you told him you were looking into the procedure on

the  question  of  notice.  That  fairly  puts  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I have to choose between your

recollection  of  the matter  and  the  Member  for

Cairnhill's  version of what took  place,  I  think

Members  of the Assembly will forgive me if  I  say

that  I have a preference for your recollection  of

this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to dwell further on the other

disparaging remarks about the nature of my evidence

before  the Commission of Inquiry which the  Member

for  Cairnhill thought fit to make. All I need  say

is  that it was a public Inquiry Commission and the

Member   for  Cairnhill,  if  he  felt   that   the

Commission was being misled, was fully entitled  to

appear  before the Commission to give his  evidence

and  to  be  cross-examined. However, I  can  quite

understand why Ministers of the last regime have  a

psychological fear of appearing before  Commissions

of  Inquiry to be cross-examined. I myself remember

the tremendous resistance put up when we wanted  to

subpoena a Minister in the last Government before a

Commission of Inquiry. That was about City  Council

matters.  Finally,  they decided  to  pack  up  the

Commission of Inquiry rather than have the subpoena

issued against the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the Leader of the Opposition adversely

to  comment in this privileged Chamber on  evidence

which he did not see fit to comment upon before the

Commission was a sad reflection on his standards of

public morality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have a fight on, and that is with the

P.A.P.  That is fair enough. It is their  business.

In  this  particular issue, however,  you  were  at

great  pains, Sir, and I must say we never  thanked

you for it, Mr Speaker, Sir, because we thought it

was necessary, if we wanted this Chamber to survive

as  a place of some decorum, dignity and respect in

the  eyes of the people, that certain standards  of

behaviour were maintained. You were at great  pains

to emphasise and underline the fact that this was a

proper disciplinary proceeding and the case had  to

be decided on the truth and the merits of the case.

Sir,  regardless  of  all  this,  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  said, yes, he agreed with  the  Speaker.

That  was the right way. He promptly went  out  and

issued  a statement to the contrary, and helped  to

confuse  the  issue. What they wanted  to  do  was,

"Never mind if it brings the House down, so long as

it brings the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P down." And our attitude was, "For God's sake,

do what you like: but if you try to bring the House

down, then you cannot blame the Government if  they

cease  to  afford the Opposition the constitutional

niceties  which  often  a  government  affords   an

official Opposition."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I listened with great interest to the

peroration by the Member for Cairnhill in which the

most  astonishing argument he made was, "Since  the

Minister for Culture said, `I do not care  how  the

Opposition  votes,' therefore I  am  not  going  to

vote. So there you are." That was what I heard  him

say  yesterday. "Since you don't care, well,  I  am

not  voting. So there you are." Sir, I thought that

they were in quite a dilemma. They had opposed  the

Government from the very beginning. The  Leader  of

the  House and I took the trouble to acquaint  them

of  the position. This was not a party matter. This

was  a  constitutional matter concerning the  whole

Assembly.  The matter was discussed with  you.  You

said the Opposition had first of all to be kept  in

mind.  Let everybody, in so far as it was possible,

be  acquainted with the position. But they saw  fit

to  oppose.  All kinds of red herrings  were  drawn

across  the line. I must say I listened to some  of

the  most tortuous legal arguments that I have ever

heard  in my life in this Chamber. The plain  words

of   the  constitution,  the  plain  words  of  the

Standing  Orders, were tortured to  mean  something

else,  just  to  create a state  of  confusion  and

doubt.  Everybody from the other side of the  House

was  in doubt. However, we knew that they could not

vote  contrary to the way they voted the last time,

because  then  they would be kicking themselves  in

their own teeth. But we are glad that they did  not

have  the audacity the second time, in the face  of

this Report and the evidence that was placed before

the Commission, to say that they thought the former

Member  for  Hong  Lim was being  silenced  by  the

Government.  "Silenced by the Government" - a  charge

they  kept on repeating right up till the 11th  of

February.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what they intended to do, but

I will tell them what they have succeeded in doing.

They  have succeeded in forfeiting, in my  opinion,

their  own self-respect and in dispelling any  hope

anyone  may  have had that, weak though  they  are,

they  could  yet  fulfil the role  as  a  balancing

counterpoise within the framework of the democratic

system.  This  motion formally  condemns  a  proven

liar, and it is really not necessary other than for

the purposes of the record. The lies that have been

uttered  are  recorded  in  Hansard.  Part  of  the

proceedings and the fact that they have been proved

lies  as  a  result of this debate also go  on  the

record.  But more important, it condemns all  those

whether  in the Opposition inside the Assembly,  or

outside  who tried to cover up Mr Ong  Eng  Guan's

lying   tactics   by  confusing   the   issue,   by

insinuations  of  dirt and more dirt  to  come,  by

reckless,  unprincipled and cowardly  attacks  when

they  were not prepared to make them stick,  firmly

and formally, or even to back up their beliefs even

if they had no evidence. Just back up their beliefs

by  contesting the by-election. All they can do  is

to find a stooge to be their proxy for this fight.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, permit

me  to  congratulate the Prime Minister  on  having

made   such  a  thoroughly  good  prepared   speech

although   he  was  not  prepared  to  speak   this

afternoon! The one who immediately follows  in  the

wake  of the Prime Minister of course faces a  very

difficult proposition to match his eloquence,  his

logic and sometimes his wit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the gravamen of the Prime

Minister's  speech  this  afternoon  was  that  the

Opposition is unwilling or unable to play its  role

in   the   parliamentary   system   of   democratic

government. I am very glad that the Prime  Minister

has,  at  this  late  stage in  the  life  of  this

Assembly,  recognised  that the  Opposition  has  a

proper  parliamentary function to perform,  perhaps

as  important  as  the  Government  itself  has  to

perform, in a parliamentary system of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the time this House first

sat up till quite recently you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



will remember what the Prime Minister's views about

the  Opposition were - how scathing he was about  the

Opposition.  He  thought very little  about  it.  I

believe  he  even  once said  that  the  Opposition

reminded him of the days he went through during the

Japanese occupation when he used to see - I think  it

was -  empty gunny sacks being jabbed at  by  brave,

strong  Japanese soldiers. That is how  he  likened

the Opposition. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Opposition

has  not  come  up  to  his  expectations  in  this

particular   debate - and  the  Prime   Minister   is

entitled  to his own opinion just as everyone  else

is  entitled  to his - might I tell him  that,  to  a

large  extent,  he is responsible for  the  present

situation? For purposes and for reasons best  known

to  himself,  he has within this Assembly  and  his

Party has outside this Assembly made it quite clear

that  the Opposition was a despicable lot not worth

listening  to;  anything they said  was  not  worth

considering; they were politically bankrupt.  These

were   all   the  phrases  he  used.   The   phrase

"politically  bankrupt"  in  connection  with   the

Opposition  has  been used by  the  Prime  Minister

himself on a number of occasions. His sole and main

purpose was to discredit the Opposition in the eyes

of  the public and not to give it any status in the

parliamentary  system  of government.  Having  done

that, today when he needs-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not need-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - the Opposition more badly, he comes

along   and  says  that  the  Opposition  has   not

performed its parliamentary role in this democratic

system of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister is very good. He is even

better  when  he is at bay - and he was fairly  good

today.  I think it was a constitutional expert  who

said  that the main function of a government  in  a

parliamentary system of democracy is  to  encourage

the  Opposition and to build up a strong Opposition

[Laughter].  The  Prime  Minister  laughs  and  his

Deputy  laughs, and yet they hold up  the  lack  of

support of this motion as a basis for saying-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Lack of principles, not lack

of support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - that we have failed the institution

of  parliamentary democracy. If I may put it to the

Prime  Minister - he  has  a  lot  to  take  on   his

shoulders in all these matters - the business of  Ong

Eng  Guan  need not have come to this head  had  he

taken  action  very  much earlier.  On  a  previous

occasion  in this Assembly I had told him  that  we

could have been spared all these episodes about Ong

Eng  Guan and these little episodes in the  Chamber

had  he  taken  action in time.  But  he  did  not,

because  he  did not want to save the parliamentary

system  of government then. He wanted to  save  his

Party.  Now when the time has come when  he  thinks

his Party can be saved and Ong Eng Guan jettisoned,

the moves against this gentleman start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if, as the Prime Minister has

said,  the  Opposition has taken  a  line  on  this

motion moved by the Deputy Prime Minister which  is

not  in  keeping with what you said should  be  the

tone  of the debate, might I ask the Prime Minister

to  indicate where in the course of the  debate  on

the main motion that has taken place? He might have

felt  it, but there is nothing on record so far  as

the main motion is concerned to indicate that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, this was the position.

The  motion  was  moved. The Deputy Prime  Minister

spoke as the mover of the motion, and then Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan started. In the course of his speech,  he

made  certain statements which seemed  to  give  an

indication  to  you  that he was  challenging  your

ruling,  whereupon, after some discussion, Mr  Ong

Eng Guan filed a motion challenging your ruling. In

those  circumstances, the debate on the main motion

was  then adjourned, and Mr Ong Eng Guan's  motion

was  debated  in the House. It was debated  on  the

basis  that  your  ruling in the circumstances  was

incorrect and that the House had no jurisdiction to

entertain   the   motion.   It   was,   in    those

circumstances, on a purely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



legal and constitutional basis that the matter  was

discussed. The merits of the question whether  the

conduct   of   the   Member  for   Hong   Lim   was

dishonourable was not gone into in the  debate.  It

was on a purely legal and constitutional basis that

Members of the Opposition spoke; and they had their

views. Surely the Prime Minister must concede that

not  only his views may be right but that somebody

else's views may be right; that he is not right all

the  time? Some of the difficulties experienced  in

this  Assembly  arise because  the  Prime  Minister

thinks he is always right. If he would only concede

that  he  might be wrong on one occasion  and  that

somebody else might be right on that occasion, then

we  might get on much better. That might have  been

much   better  for  the  parliamentary  system   of

democracy.  The difficulty with the Prime  Minister

is  that he feels that that is the only line on the

law  which  should  be  taken;  no  other  line  is

possible.  It has been repeatedly made quite  clear

in this House that if the first part of that motion

had  been taken on its own, then the question might

have been different. But because the first part  of

the  motion  which the Deputy Prime Minister  moved

was coupled with the second part of the motion,  it

was  the second part of the motion which caused all

the  debate  and all the trouble. This is  only  to

show  that the Prime Minister was suffering from  a

delusion when he said that that motion was  opposed

by  the  Members of the Opposition. The substantive

motion  was  never  before the  House  for  debate.

Before  that motion could come up, the  Member  for

Hong Lim had already resigned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as the Opposition is concerned, we

have tried to discharge what we consider to be  our

constitutional duties in this House. If  the  Prime

Minister thinks we were ineffective and we were not

as  good  as  he might have been in the Opposition,

well,  he is entitled to his view. But at least  we

can say that we have done our best, and our best is

good  enough.  If  it  is  merely  a  question   of

preserving  this system of parliamentary  democracy

in  which  the  Prime Minister  is  now  so  keenly

interested,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



there  have  been occasions in this House  when  he

seemed to express a doubt whether this system was a

good  system, but I am glad that in so far as  this

particular  debate and the motion that preceded  it

are  concerned,  he did think that this  system  of

government  was  worth saving  and  worth  fighting

over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so much for the Prime Minister;

but  I  must  congratulate him on  the  very  sober

speech  which  he did make, and the  Opposition  is

very  grateful to him. But I would remind him  that

the  tone  of this debate was set by the  principal

speech  made  by the Government on the motion,  and

that  was by the Minister for Culture. Mr Speaker,

Sir, you have made it quite clear a number of times

and  so  plain, in fact, that you had to  rule  and

refer a member of the public outside, who had dared

to   suggest  otherwise,  to  the  State

Advocate-General.  Your  contention was that the  debate  on

this issue should proceed on the basis that it  was

something  which was an affront to the  dignity  of

the House. But when I listened to the speech of the

Minister  for  Culture yesterday - and that  was  the

main speech - we were entitled to assume that it was

a  Government speech on the motion of the Leader of

the  House. It was nothing but a political  speech.

He was not concerned with preserving the dignity of

the  House  or  with its good name so  far  as  the

public  outside is concerned. All he seemed anxious

to  do  was to run down the S.P.A. and Mr Ong  Eng

Guan,  and say that Mr Ong Eng Guan had no  chance

in the Hong Lim by-election. What had the S.P.A. is

a  Party, what had the P.A.P. as a Party, and  what

had  Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan as a  gentleman  about  to

contest  the  Hong Lim by-election to do  with  the

motion before the House, Mr Speaker, I ask you? If

the  Government  chooses to set  the  tone  of  the

debate  and  finally ends up by saying - and  looking

fierce, as only the P.A.P. can look fierce  in  one

of  their fiercer moments - "We don't care what  the

Opposition does." In fact, the Minister for Culture

treated  this  as a Government motion.  The  whole

trouble in this issue has arisen from the fact that

although you yourself, Mr Speaker, Sir, with great

respect, had ruled that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



this was not a Government motion or a Party or  any

other motion but a motion moved by the Deputy Prime

Minister  not  in his capacity as the Deputy  Prime

Minister  but as the Leader of the House  in  whose

custody  was committed the dignity of this House - on

that  basis  he moved it - but when the Ministers  of

the  Government spoke, they spoke on the basis that

this was a Government motion intended to ditch  Mr

Ong Eng Guan. Now that might have been an accident,

but  the  Minister for Home Affairs  did  the  same

thing.  He  also  made  it clear  that  this  is  a

Government  motion,  that  he  was  supporting  the

Government and the motion. This is not a Government

motion, and yet some of the Back-Benchers also said

that  they  were supporting the Government  motion.

So,  Mr Speaker, Sir, can we on this side  of  the

House  be  blamed that we have given the impression

that this is a Government move intended to ditch an

erstwhile comrade and to blacken him in the eyes of

the  public  outside? If they have  given  us  that

feeling, who is to blame? They themselves are to be

blamed  for  it. They set the level of  the  debate

yesterday  when the Minister for Culture  read  out

his  prepared  speech  to the  Assembly.  When  the

Member  for  Cairnhill replied to him  in  suitable

terms,  the Prime Minister turned round and accused

him  of  not  paying proper respect to  the  motion

before the House and making his speech political. I

am suggesting, Sir, that if the tone of this debate

is  what it has been, then the fault primarily lies

with the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said one or two things which, I think, merit a reply. He talked about the

money which he got, and tried to show that he  went

to the United Kingdom in order to get money for the

defence  of  Singapore. He put it  to  the  British

Government  that as they were responsible  for  the

defence of this Island, therefore they had  to  pay

for its defence. I think that is a matter which has

not  yet  been settled. If it has been settled,  we

have  not as yet been informed about it. The money

which  the  Finance Minister did  receive  for  his

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



was  money  given  by  the British  Government  for

development   programmes,   perhaps   at   a   fair

commercial  rate of interest; but  that  was  money

given  to him for development projects and not,  as

the Minister said, because he put the question that

defence   should  be  paid  for  by   the   British

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also made the point that the Member for

Cairnhill talked about character assassination, and

that  the  Report contained nothing about character

assassination. I think the Member for Cairnhill did

not  refer  to  the  Report when  he  talked  about

character  assassination. I think  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  said  that  the evidence  given  in  the

commission  was of such a nature as  to  amount  to

character assassination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Minister for Finance also defended

the  statement made by the Minister for Culture  on

the basis that it was a dispassionate statement. So

if the Minister for Finance backed the statement of

the  Minister  for Culture, can we be  blamed,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, if we assumed that that was the  line

of  the  Government - that the Government  considered

this a Government motion and not a motion, as such,

moved  by  the Leader of the House in the interests

of the dignity of the House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Opposition has

agreed that a Sessional Committee be set up on this

whole business. If our Legislative Assembly (Powers

and  Privileges)  Ordinance had been  in  a  better

state than it is today, quite a lot of this debate,

and quite a lot of recriminations that have gone on

in  this  House need not have taken  place.  It  is

because  the  law on our rights and  privileges  is

uncertain that all this debate has taken place.  On

this  matter,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we are  very  glad

that  you  have now suggested this Committee  which

will  go into this whole question and put it  on  a

proper  footing, so that if a similar  incident  of

this  nature occurs, there will be no  need  for  a

debate of this type anymore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I wish to raise before you,

Mr Speaker, Sir, and which is troubling me from

the point of view of the Legislative Assembly, is

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



When Mr Ong Eng Guan resigned from his seat,  the

motion  was adjourned sine die. So when the  motion

was  adjourned sine die, Mr Speaker, the House had

resolved  itself into a Committee to  go  into  the

statements made by the Member for Hong Lim  and  to

deliver  a  verdict on them. In those circumstances

the  adjournment  was -taken sine  die,  which,  in

effect,  means that the House was still  seized  of

this  matter  in  a  judicial capacity.  While  the

motion was before the House, sine die no doubt, the

Government  saw  fit  to appoint  a  Commission  of

Inquiry.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am not  quite  clear

whether  this  appointment of a Commission  by  the

Government  while  this House was  seized  of  this

whole  inquiry, is not in itself a  breach  of  the

privilege  of  this House. Some of  the  Government

Benchers are shaking their heads; the Leader of the

House is shaking his head. I put it forward in  all

seriousness, while this Assembly is seized of  this

matter, that the Government has seen fit to appoint

a  Commission  of Inquiry. And I ask, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  whether  that  is  not  a  contempt  of   the

Assembly, and whether that is not a breach  of  the

privilege  of the Assembly. These are some  of  the

matters  which  should  be  looked  into  by   this

Committee of Privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which exercises my mind, as a

Member of this Assembly, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this:

that when the Commission first started its inquiry,

Mr  Commissioner rightly or wrongly insisted  that

the  Member  for Hong Lim should give his  evidence

first.  I  myself, Mr Speaker, Sir, am  not  quite

sure  in my mind whether the Commissioner, in  view

of  section  3 of the Legislative Assembly  (Powers

and Privileges) Ordinance, was entitled to have the

Member   for  Hong  Lim  brought  before  him   and

subjected   to  cross-examination  in  respect   of

something which he has said in this House. It is  a

pity  the Prime Minister is not here, otherwise  he

might accuse me of being partisan in the matter.  I

would  like  to assure the Prime Minister  and  his

colleagues that I am not being a partisan in  these

matters when I raise them. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



raise them because I myself am as keenly interested

in  the survival of parliamentary democracy as  the

Prime  Minister  is.  I think these  are  important

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there is some doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir,

whether  section  3  of  the  Legislative  Assembly

(Powers  and  Privileges)  Ordinance  protects  the

State. There is some doubt whether a Commission  of

Inquiry  is either a civil proceeding or a criminal

proceeding.  I  suggest to you, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that  if it is not a civil proceeding or a criminal

proceeding,  then statements made in this  Assembly

can  still be gone into by Commissions of  Inquiry.

If   the  intention  of  the  Legislative  Assembly

(Powers  and  Privileges)  Ordinance  was  to  give

absolute  protection  to  statements  made  in  the

House,  then this is one way of getting  over  that

protection. As these Commissions are apointed under

the Commission of Inquiry Ordinance, it is the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara who makes these appointments, the

appointment  of  this Commission necessarily  rests

with the Government. So the position could well  be

that if section 3 does not protect such a statement

made  in  the Assembly, and if such a statement  is

made  by  a  Member  of  the Government,  then  the

Government  might  choose not to recommend  to  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to appoint a Commission  of

Inquiry;  but if the statement is made by a  Member

of  the  Opposition, then they  might.  I  see  the

Minister for Education is shaking his head as if it

might not happen, or is it going to happen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do suggest to the Government that in these

matters,  everything should be equalised.  That  is

one  of  the ways in which parliamentary  democracy

can  survive, because if everything is weighted  in

favour of the Government, and there is nothing  in

favour of the Opposition, then that is not my  idea

of parliamentary democracy.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Leader of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



House  condemning the conduct of Mr Ong Eng  Guan.

Sir,  you  will  remember that the Opposition  have

always  condemned the conduct of Mr Ong  Eng  Guan

not  only now, not only here, but also when he  was

Mayor  in  the  City Council and when  he  was  the

Minister   for   National  Development.   We   have

condemned his conduct, Sir, not in his capacity  as

an  individual or to his personal detriment, but we

have   felt   that,   as  Minister   for   National

Development and as Mayor of the City Council,  what

he  did  was detrimental to the State of  Singapore

and   the  people.  Yet,  Sir,  at  that  time  the

Government  found  fit,  as  the  Hon. the   Prime

Minister  has  now  admitted to do  this.  This  is

reported in the Press of 31st January, page 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong said that when he was Mr Lee's friend

everything was all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee interposed that Mr Ong had never been his friend but only his political colleague. As

such,  every  wrong that Mr Ong did  he  concealed

from the public because he had to protect the unity

and solidarity of the party.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we blame the public if they start

wondering how many Mr Ong Eng Guans are now  being

concealed  by  the P.A.P. Government  in  order  to

protect  the  unity and solidarity  of  the  Party?

Going  by  the Hon. the Prime Minister's statement,

the  public will only know when these protected and

shielded  friends - I hope they are  friends  of  the

P.A.P. - turn renegade against them. Until  then  the

electorate will be in the dark, because the  P.A.P.

has to protect its unity and solidarity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that we have been

condemning his conduct ever since he came here,  it

looks  as if it should be logical that now  is  our

chance, as Government has moved a motion to condemn

him,  to  support the motion. But  as  we  are  not

supporting  the  motion and  as  we  are  going  to

abstain  from  voting on it, as the Leader  of  the

Opposition  has  said, I feel it  is  our  duty  to

clarify our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, let there be no doubt

whatsoever  that we do not condone,  sympathise  or

agree  with  the behaviour of Mr Ong Eng  Guan - not

only with regard to his behaviour in this House,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



but  we have on innumerable occasions condemned his

behaviour  as  Mayor and as Minister  for  National

Development.  It  was the P.A.P.  Government,  Sir,

which  had shielded him from exposure and concealed

his  misconduct which was damaging to the whole  of

Singapore.  They had not only created a smokescreen

to  protect the then invulnerable Mr Ong, but they

had  also  fired a fierce barrage at any Opposition

Member  who  dared  attempt to make  known  to  the

public  Mr  Ong's  misconduct.  Thus,  Mr   Ong's

misconduct  had been concealed from the public  for

18 long months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, probably you, in your position as Mr

Speaker, would not have gone round to  the  people

seeking  their opinion on the matter.  But  we,  as

representatives of the people, feel it is our  duty

to  seek  the opinion of our electorate  before  we

make a decision in this House. This is what we have

discovered, Sir. The electorate have been wondering

whether  the  whole  affair - Ong  Eng  Guan  versus

P.A.P. or Lee Kuan Yew - is not a political manoeuvre

in  the fight for power. As mentioned by the Member

for Cairnhill, when the previous Government held  a

Commission  of Inquiry to go into the  misdeeds  of

the  Mayor  of Singapore, the Hon. Prime  Minister.

then  a  Member  of  the  Opposition,  accused  the

Government  of making a political move against  the

P.A.P.  It  is  now commonly speculated  among  the

people  of  Singapore, Sir, that the Ong  Eng  Guan

affair,  including  the inquiry,  and  despite  the

amount  of truth in the accusations, may be another

political manoeuvre to kill politically a dangerous

Opposition.  Sir,  this  speculation  may  well  be

incorrect. I do not say it is correct. It may  well

be  incorrect.  But leading up to the  inquiry,  it

does  seem to have encouraged the speculation. What

the public was unable to reconcile themselves to is

the  fact that all the sins of Mr Ong Eng Guan  as

Mayor   and   later   as  Minister   for   National

Development  had  been defended  and  concealed  by

Government until the explosion when Mr Ong  turned

a  renegade to the Party. Before this, nothing that

Mr Ong did could be wrong. After this nothing he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



did  was right. The poor pin-up boy was ripped off

the   wall.  Could  it  have  been  a  coincidence?

Perhaps,  Sir,  it could well have  been,  and  the

public  were  prepared to give the  Government  the

benefit  of the doubt. But then during the inquiry,

so  much mud was dug out of Ong Eng Guan's past and

slung at him by the Government which admitted  that

they  protected  Mr  Ong  from  exposure  by   the

previous Government. This, Sir, creates a doubt  in

the minds of the public. And today we ask, Sir,  is

this - the  honesty  and  integrity  of  the  P.A.P.,

referred  to by the Minister for Culture?  Sir,  do

you  not think it is logical that people should ask

these questions? Why has the Government chosen this

specific - moment to expose Mr Ong Eng  Guan,  after

having  shielded him from exposure for  one  and  a

half   years,  after  having  stood  up  for   him,

supported his projects and - we can almost say - after

condoning  his  misconduct for all these  years  as

Mayor  and  as Minister? Why now? What significance

has  this  opportune  moment?  Is  it  a  political

manoeuvre   to   kill   politically   a   dangerous

Opposition? Sir, the public is still wondering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion may just about seal the coffin with

two  corpses in it - the corpse of Mr Ong Eng  Guan

and  his  opponent, which is the P.A.P. The  people

are  fed  up  with  this  ex-P.A.P. versus  P.A.P.

quarrel.  For two months the public have  had  that

rammed  down their throats. They have heard nothing

but  what the P.A.P. has wanted them to hear  about

this case over the radio. I was at a friend's house

one  day,  enjoying a cup of tea with  a  group  of

friends,  and it happened that the radio  was  just

announcing  some  words to this effect  - I  do  not

remember  the  exact words - that Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew

denied  that  he threatened to resign if  Mr  Yong

Nyuk  Lin  was not nominated. A few of  my  friends

simultaneously  shouted out, "Turn off  the  radio,

for  God's  sake!" I can quite understand,  Sir, I

myself   have  heard  that  statement.  I  am   not

commenting on whether it was right or wrong.  I  am

just saying that the same thing was heard over  the

radio again and again, and that when it did come on

again, people just got sick and turned it off.

do you not turn it off now!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> As for the newspapers, Sir,

you  only  had to look at the headlines  of   the

newspapers during that time. They told their  own

tale. Sir, I hope you will permit me to quote a few

of  them  to show you why we are so disgusted  with

the whole affair, with this ex-P.A.P. versus P.A.P.

affair,  and  why  we are unable  to  support  this

motion  that  is before us today, in spite  of  the

fact  that  we have been condemning the conduct  of

Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan ever since we  came  into  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government have, always tried to

give the impression that they are trying to build a

Malayan   nation,  with  Malay  as   the   national

language.  Yet,  if  you read the  papers  of  21st

January,  while Tunku Abdul Rahman was  busy  going

round  telling  people, `Teach Malay  to  friends.'

`Sacrifice  five minutes of each day.'  `The  Tunku

requests  Malays  at a rally?'  The  headlines  for

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ong accused: You're going slow



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, today charged former Minister for National Development,

Mr Ong Eng Guan...'



<br><br>and so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just quoting a few, Sir, If you look through

every issue, you will find more. On the 24th-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): On

a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I am just

wondering  whether what the Member for  Mountbatten

has  been  saying is relevant to the  motion  under

discussion. She is bringing out cases on  what  the

Straits Times did not do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that the debate on

this  motion has, in fact, gone off the  rails.  It

went  off the rails a long time ago. I am giving  a

little  latitude, but not too much, to  Members  in

this   matter.   I   might  remark   that   I   was

congratulating the House when they came back to the

motion when the Prime Minister spoke and when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Farrer Park spoke; but now I am  afraid

my congratulations were misplaced. Mrs Seow.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> In that case, Sir, I shall

not  quote the paper but I shall just mention  this

in passing. If you look through the papers you will

find  that  while  the  Prime  Minister  over   the

causeway   is  working  towards  nation   building,

relieving  unemployment (trying  to  get  jobs  for

34,000  or  340,000 people), trying to build  homes

for civil servants, and giving them lands and loans

from  Government, our newspapers were full of  "Ong

accuses  Lee", "Lee accuses Ong" and that  sort  of

thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister recently mocked at the

Opposition  when the Opposition tried  to  get  the

Government  to  restore  the  pay  cuts  to   civil

servants. He said we were thinking of little things

while   important  matters  of  State  were   being

discussed.  Now  we  find that  the  Government  is

wasting  money  and thousands of dollars  over  the

insignificant  little Mr Ong  Eng  Guan  when  the

Prime  Minister over the causeway has so much  work

to do for the good of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that while the P.A.P.

have  reasons  to conceal Mr Ong's wrongs  and  to

protect  him for the sake of protecting  the  unity

and  solidarity of the Party, we have no reason  to

support  or  protect  him.  In  fact,  as  I   have

mentioned  before, we have always  been  condemning

his  conduct. Why should we be obligated to support

Mr  Ong Eng Guan? They think that we are going  to

use  him as a stooge. Examples in this House  prove

that  we  will not be able to use him as a  stooge.

Mr  Speaker, you yourself will remember that while

speaking  against the Government Mr Ong eventually

voted  for  the Government. Can you  rely  on  such

support?   Are  we  going  to  support   him   now?

Therefore, let it be very clear, Sir, that  we  are

abstaining from voting because we feel that this is

really  and  truly the consequent of  the  internal

strife  that we have noticed has been plaguing  the

P.A.P. No matter what the P.A.P. say, no matter how

much  they say, no matter how long they talk,  they

cannot run away from the fact that Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



Ong  Eng Guan was a P.A.P., born a P.A.P.,  bred  a

P.A.P. flesh and blood of the P.A.P.,  right  from

the  beginning of his political career. When I  say

born, I mean politically born. He has been a P.A.P.

all  the  time of his life, and had been  protected

and  shielded by the P.A.P. In any smear on Mr Ong

Eng  Guan, the P.A.P. cannot hope to avoid a splash

of  it.  Much as the Government would like to  deny

it,  the public feels that the whole affair is,  in

reality,  whatever superficial dressings have  been

given  to  it,  nothing but a  battle  between  the

P.A.P. and the abandoned pin-up boy of the  P.A.P.

It  is a P.A.P. versus an ex-P.A.P. We therefore do

not wish to have any part in the settlement of this

family strife within the P.A.P.



<br><br>5.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

shall try to keep as close as possible to the terms

of  the motion. The second sentence in the findings

of  the  Commission  of Inquiry  on  the  terms  of

reference   states   that  Mr   Ong   Eng   Guan's

allegations were groundless and recklessly made and

that  there was no justification for making any  of

them.  Sir, on the strength of those findings,  the

Minister for Culture stated that the issue for  the

Hong  Lim  by-election will  be  a  choice  between

freedom to tell the truth and freedom to tell lies.

If  that  were  the issue then the choice  is  very

simple.  I would say that practically everybody  in

Singapore  would choose freedom to tell  the  truth

and  the  uncensored truth. Unfortunately,  in  his

haste  to  smear the Opposition, Sir, the  Minister

for Culture very soon after that made what appeared

to  me  to  be a groundless and reckless allegation

against the Opposition, thereby committing the very

same  mistake of which the former Member  for  Hong

Lim   was  accused  and  for  which  he  is   being

condemned.  What did the Minister for Culture  say,

Sir?  I  took particular note of what he  said.  He

said that the S.P.A. provided Mr Ong Eng Guan with

a  legal adviser for the Commission of Inquiry. The

Straits  Times,  I  suppose, publishing  the  whole

draft in full, said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The many S.P.A. and Labour Front lawyers who

advised   Mr   Ong  must  have  known   that   his

allegations could not stand close scrutiny.'



<br><br>Sir,  I checked up with my colleagues here and none

of  us remember having heard the Labour Front

link-up.  The allegation was that the S.P.A. provided  a

legal adviser for Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the date of the paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> It is today's date. Sir, we

would  like to ask the Minister for Culture - I  wish

he  were here, Sir; but as he is not here,  I  hope

his  colleagues  will convey this  to  him - on  what

grounds  did he make that allegation? Does he  know

that  as far as the S.P.A. is concerned, that is  a

falsehood?  If he does not know the  truth  of  the

allegation and he is raising it on a surmise  or  a

suspicion or a guess, or on an assumption based  on

a few strands of information, then he has done what

Mr Ong Eng Guan did.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Hold a Commission of Inquiry!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, that being so, since on

the   Government   side  Members  themselves   have

committed what Mr Ong Eng Guan has been accused of

committing how can we be asked to condemn just one?

Sir,  I  do  not  wish  to be accused  of  speaking

without  truth.  Sir, I would like  to  quote  from

Hansard  to  show that if groundless  and  reckless

allegations  have  been made, then  the  Government

side has allowed that to go on for far too long. If

the  Government from today onwards decide that they

will  not allow groundless and reckless allegations

to be made from their side, then, Sir, I am sure we

from  this side will co-operate. But having allowed

Mr  Ong  Eng Guan full rein when he was  Minister

for National Development, and then to say that they

are  a  clean and honest Party and all  others  are

unclean,  while we know that when Mr Ong Eng  Guan

was  there he was being protected by them, and then

now  he is unclean, fit to be condemned and treated

like a Singapore Lumumba-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Lumumba was a hero.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> We will let the electorate of

Hong  Lim decide. The truth of the matter  is  that

when  the hon. Member for Hong Lim was giving us  a

dose  of  his  fiery medicine, the Members  on  the

Government  side  were enjoying it.  But  when  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim, because of  some  clash  of

personality  or struggle inside their  ranks,  came

over to the Opposition and gave them a full dose of

the  P.A.P. brand of medicine, Sir, we on this side

were  sorry to note that they could not  stand  it.

[Interruption] Sir, if we have a sense  of  humour,

we can take it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If they have the medicine, they will

backfire.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I would like to quote a few

examples, Sir, from Hansard to show that I  am  not

just making up stories. In Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 3,

col. 85, dated 16th July, 1959, Mr Ong Eng Guan as

Minister for National Development on the Government

side was speaking. This is what he was accusing the

Member for Farrer Park of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for Farrer Park was in the City

Council for nearly ten years and we see the mess he

left  for  us to clean up. Mr Speaker, the  Member

for   Farrer   Park  was  also  in  the   Singapore

Improvement Trust and we are now doing the cleaning

up.  We  have  chosen the S.I.T. building  as  the

headquarters   for   the   Ministry   of   National

Development, because we believe that at present  it

is the most filthy and the most corrupt institution

in Singapore, and we are going there to clean it up

as expeditiously as possible.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the former Minister for National Development

is now a bad man. And yet-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the hon.

Member  will perhaps give us the reference  to  all

these  cases, because I do not think that they  are

strictly relevant to the motion. But if he wishes a

record  to be made of these so-called examples  and

if  he  just gives us the quotation in the Hansard,

volume  so and so, number so and so, and column  so

and  so,  I  am  sure  hon. Members,  if  they  are

interested, will read those records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the point I wish to make-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just inquiring from the

Prime Minister whether he is seeking elucidation on

the   Speaker's  remarks.  Is  it  or  is  it   not

elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If it is, then it is all right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I wanted to know whether you

intended  thereby that although  a  Member  of  the

Opposition  has not complained that  anything  said

about  him  is untruthful, yet we on the Government

side   should  investigate  the whole   series   of

defamatory  things that have been said  about  them

which they did not complain of?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All I really meant was to try

and  save  the time of this Assembly. I have  told

the  Member for Tanglin that if he could give us  a

list of all these incidents, then if any Member  in

interested he can read about them for himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point I

was  going to make by referring to this extract was

that when the hon. Member for Hong Lim was a member

of  the  P.A.P. Government, he practically  alleged

here   that   the  Member  for  Farrer   Park   was

responsible for the corruption in the City  Council

and the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member for Farrer Park, knowing what

parliamentary democracy is, allowed the thing to go

on  because we believe that the common sense of the

common  people will be able to tell them that  such

wholesale  allegations could be just brushed  aside

and ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next example occurred on the same day,

which  showed that they seemed to be fond of making

such allegations-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are going to read it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In col. 137 of the Hansard,

Sir,It is a short one. I think I will read it. Mr

Teo Hock Guan - it is just stated as a name here - was

speaking:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The former Government was very corrupted. How

were  they  corrupted? I give you  one  example.  A

teacher  told  me  that he went  to  the  Education

Department, and asked a clerk. "Why do you not work

seriously?' The clerk replied, "Go and ask Mr Chew

Swee  Kee." This proves that because the Government

was  corrupted, therefore the employees  were  also

corrupted.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such wholesale allegations that all the

Government employees were corrupted were groundless

and reckless.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Hold a Commission of Inquiry!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> If after this debate the

Government side will be more careful, Sir, we  will

appreciate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same sort of thing has occurred. I will

reduce  the  number of examples, Sir,  so  that  we

could go quickly to some of the main ones. In  Vol.

12-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon. Member

that the issue in the motion itself is quite clear?

The  motion invites the Assembly to condemn Mr Ong

Eng  Guan in the light of the Report of the Inquiry

Commission.  I have indicated that the debate  has,

in  fact,  gone off the rails and that it did  come

back  when  the Prime Minister spoke and  when  the

Member for Farrer Park spoke. Now, it seems  to  me

that  the Member for Tanglin is not only going  off

the  rails, but he is going into a ravine. I  would

now  suggest that he tries, as far as possible,  to

come back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The main point I wish to make,

Sir,  is  this.  If the Government side  themselves

have    been   making   groundless   and   reckless

allegations,  can  the  Opposition  at  this  point

condemn one Member who has been pushed out and  say

all the rest are innocent?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have tried to assist the

Member  for  Tanglin. He has made his point  and  I

have suggested that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



he  should list the references to these extracts so

that  Members could read them in their spare  time.

The  point has been made and, lest it be said that

he has no proof on this point, I have permitted him

to  go  as far as listing these passages.  That  is

all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> One more, Sir, a very

important one, which is found in. Vol. I 2,  No.  5,

of the Hansard, dated 13th of February, 1960, where

the  Minister for Home Affairs had alleged who  was

responsible again for corruption and mismanagement

in  the  City Council to the point where the Member

for  Farrer  Park, usually tolerant, at last  could

not stand it any more and challenged the Government

side  to  prove  the  allegation.  Yet,  Sir,   the

Minister  for Labour and Law, in Vol.  11,  No.  7,

dated  13th August, 1959, col. 402 of the  Hansard,

speaking    about   the   Minister   for   National

Development who was still with them then,  referred

to  the very good work done by the former Mayor and

his colleagues. Sir, the real truth is that-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope I have not dissuaded

the hon. Member from listing these passages. Do not

let it be said that I stopped the Member from doing

so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I think there is enough

evidence already to show that the Government  side,

excluding   the   former  Minister   for   National

Development, has also made groundless and  reckless

allegations.  I want that to be recorded,  Sir, If

that  is  recorded, then the issue is not purely  a

question of freedom to tell the truth or freedom to

tell a lie. It has become very confused. If it  can

be  made clear to both sides of the House that from

now   on  we  would  like  to  have  less  reckless

allegations, then we will have achieved something

from  this  debate. As far as we are concerned,  we

would like to see statements made with a sense  of

responsibility,  and today we  are  glad  that  the

Prime  Minister has set a new lead  which  we  hope

will be followed thereafter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.29 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr   Speaker,  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  has

complained at length that we on the Government side

have  in  the past failed to appreciate that  the

Opposition  has an important role to play  in  this

system of parliamentary democracy. However, let  me

assure  him and other Members of the House that  we

have always stood by this system, and if we are  to

maintain  this stand it is logical that  we  should

accept that the Opposition has indeed a proper role

to  play in this Chamber, provided, of course, that

we  have Members on the Opposition side who are not

only  responsible but who are prepared  equally  to

play the game. Only recently there was a conference

of  the  Commonwealth Parliamentary Association  in

Kuching  where there was a seminar on the  role  of

the   Opposition  in  a  parliamentary   democratic

system.  The  Opposition Member who  attended  this

conference, if I remember correctly, was the Member

for   Mountbatten.  It  is  accepted  that  in   a

parliamentary democracy we should have on one  side

a  government majority and, on the other  side,  an

opposition party. In fact, in the House of Commons,

the  role of the Leader of the Opposition has  been

considered  so  important that he is  even  paid  a

pension. But however, Mr Speaker, I am not  giving

hopes  to the Member for Cairnhill. But after  what

the  Member  for  Cairnhill said yesterday  of  his

meeting with the Prime Minister and myself, and his

meeting with Mr Ong Eng Guan, it is necessary that

I  should  let  the  House understand  clearly  the

circumstances, lest there be misconstruction of the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that on Wednesday, 14th

December, 1960,  the  House  was   debating   the

estimates and expenditure for Head 56 (Ministry  of

Education).  At  that  time,  the  Government   had

intended to move a motion to censure the Member for

Hong Lim for certain allegations he had made during

the  debate  on  the Budget on 10th  and  12th  of

December. Now, according to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



Standing  Order  No. 32 notice of the motion  shall

not  be  dispensed with except with the consent  of

the  Speaker and the general assent of all  Members

present.  Therefore, the Prime Minister and  I  met

the  Member  for  Farrer Park and  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  in the Library, to explain to  them  the

reasons for the Motion which we were going to  move

and  to  seek the assent of the Opposition  to  the

motion being moved without notice. According to the

Standing Order, your consent, Mr Speaker, also was

required.  Hence we had to discuss the motion  with

you. I wish to make it very clearly that there  was

no   collusion  between  the  Government  and   the

Opposition   on  the  one  hand,  or  between   the

Government  and the Speaker on the other  hand,  in

moving the motion to censure Mr Ong Eng Guan, then

Member  for  Hong  Lim. It was because  under  this

Standing Order we had to seek the Speaker's consent

and the assent of all Members to debate the motion

without  notice that meetings were  held  with  the

Leaders of the Opposition and the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to state that when we explained to

the  Member for Cairnhill and the Member for Farrer

Park  the reasons for moving the motion of  censure

against  Mr Ong Eng Guan, we did mention  to  them

that  if  Mr  Ong  Eng Guan did not  withdraw  his

allegations  and apologise, the Government  had  no

alternative but to appoint a Commission of  Inquiry

to  investigate and make known the truth.  Mr  Ong

Eng  Guan  then was still a Member of the  Assembly

and  at that time no one had any inkling that there

would be a by-election in the constituency of  Hong

Lim. The Commission of Inquiry which the Government

had  intended to institute could not therefore have

been  cooked up for any electioneering purpose,  as

the  Member  for  Cairnhill alleged yesterday.  The

Government was only anxious that the Commission  of

Inquiry  should be able to obtain clarification  on

Mr   Ong   Eng  Guan's  allegations  if  no   such

clarification could be obtained in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



Assembly.   In  fact,  a  Commission  was   already

prepared  when, to all our surprise,  Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan  on Friday, 23rd December, said that he wished

to  justify his statements in the Assembly. Because

of  this,  the  appointment of the  Commission  was

never  gazetted. It was only after he had  resigned

on   29th   December  without  substantiating   his

allegations that the Government proceeded with  the

plan  to  institute a Commission  of  Inquiry.  The

Member  for Cairnhill was aware that the Government

had  the  intention of instituting a Commission  of

Inquiry even before Mr Ong Eng Guan resigned  from

the  Assembly.  Yet  he chose  to  make  an  untrue

statement  that the Commission was  put  up  as  an

electioneering stunt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ramblings of the Member for Cairnhill

are  really hard to follow. He has zig-zagged  from

Keppel to Havelock, from Havelock to Cairnhill, and

now  he has asked the House to join in the guessing

game as to where his next destination will be.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Tanjong Pagar!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It could be the Southern

Islands or even the Straits of Malacca.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Vietnam!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if you were to

ask me for a definition of a "political sputnik", I

would answer that it is one which has been misfired

and  keeps  on moving from one political  orbit  to

another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Keeps travelling!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Aljunied and

the   Member  for  Punggol  were  foolish   enough

yesterday  to  say that they rejected this  Report.

They said so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



under cover of privilege in this Assembly. Let  Mr

Ong  Eng  Guan and the two Members opposite  go  to

Hong  Lim and tell the people that they reject this

Report. The simplest way of doing it is to re-state

exactly what Mr Ong Eng Guan and they have said in

this Assembly. Mr Ong Eng Guan has in this Chamber

and  in  the Commission of Inquiry made  some  very

interesting  statements. The Commission  has  found

those  statements to be untruths. He has found  Mr

Ong  to  be a person who is not to be believed  and

who  would tell an untruth whenever it suited  him.

If  Mr  Ong  wants to challenge these   findings,

there  is  one simple way of doing it,  namely,  in

Hong  Lim at a mass meeting to say that he  rejects

these findings, that what he has said both in  this

Assembly and in the Commission of Inquiry are true.

If  he  does  not do so, then the people  can  draw

their own conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us come to the main issue underlying this

motion.  It  is  whether we wish  to  maintain  the

system and principles of parliamentary democracy or

not.  If  it is our desire to uphold the system  of

parliamentary  democracy, then we in this  Chamber,

as  elected  representatives of  the  people,  must

equally  be prepared to uphold the dignity,  honour

and  prestige  of the Assembly. But  can  there  be

dignity  if  a Member is permitted under  cover  of

privilege  to  hurl slanders at other Members?  Can

there  be  honour if a Member, under the  guise  of

freedom  of speech, is permitted to make innuendoes

against other Members? Can there be prestige  if  a

Member  is  permitted to reduce  this  House  to  a

wrestling ring where mud can be freely slung about?

Whether  a  Member in the Assembly has committed  a

breach  of  privilege can only be  decided  by  the

Assembly  itself. You, Mr Speaker, suggested  last

Wednesday that a Committee of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



Privileges should be set up consonant with the  new

powers  of the Assembly under the new constitution;

and I shall at the next sitting of the Assembly  on

22nd March ask the House to approve the setting  up

of this Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to what the Member for Farrer Park

has   said   about   the  powers,  privileges   and

immunities of Assemblymen, the Minister for  Labour

and  Law  has informed me that the State

Advocate-General  is  already at work revising  the  present

Legislative  Assembly     (Powers  and  Privileges)

Ordinance,  1955,  as  well as  the  Commission  of

Inquiry Ordinance. When these Ordinances have  been

revised,  we hope any defects in the existing  laws

and  any  doubts on interpretation will be removed.

However, until the Committee of Privileges  is  set

up,  we have now to depend upon the findings of the

Inquiry   Commission.   The   conclusion   of   the

Commission are clear-cut, that there is no truth in

the  allegations     made by Mr Ong Eng Guan, that

these  allegations  are groundless  and  recklessly

made, and that there is no justification for making

any  of  them. Do the Opposition accept or do  they

not  accept the findings of the Commission?  If  we

accept  the  findings  of the Commission,  then  we

can   arrive  at  only  one  conclusion,  and  that

conclusion  is  that  Mr  Ong  Eng      Guan   has

flagrantly  abused the privilege of  the  Assembly.

Since  this  is  so,  then  correctly  we,  as  the

responsible  representatives of  the  people,  must

censure  and  condemn  Mr Ong  Eng  Guan  for  his

dishonourable conduct in this Assembly.
