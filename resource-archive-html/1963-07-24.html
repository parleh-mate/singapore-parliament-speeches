<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Questions 1* and 2+ have been postponed to 29th July, 1963.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Question No. 1 stood in the name of Mr Low Por Tuck -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister who were the members

of the Singapore team that attended the inter-governmental financial talks in Kuala Lumpur on

10th and 11th April, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Question No. 2 stood in the name of Mr Tee Kim Leng -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister what is the progress in negotiations on the question of compensation

for  the  massacres  by the  Japanese  Army  in Singapore  in  the  last war and  what  further

action he intends to take.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<div align="center"><b>BOGUS INSURANCE COMPANIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance what progress has been made in the action

taken against bogus insurance companies since 9th

April. 1963.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang will recall  that  in

the  last  sitting of the Legislative  Assembly  in

April,   he  was  informed  that  the  process   of

liquidating bogus insurance companies  was  in  the

hands of liquidators appointed by the High Court of

Singapore  in respect of three insurance  companies

incorporated in the State, and by the High Court of

Malaya  in  respect  of  the  other  13  insurance

companies incorporated in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquidators of most of these companies are

still processing, summarising and sorting out tens

of thousands of claims from all over Malaya and

Singapore, as well as realising the assets of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



companies where available. The liquidators  of  two

insurance  companies - one from  Singapore  and  the

other  from  Malaya  - however, have  already  begun

paying  out claims to policy holders, and  payments

are   now  almost  completed.  These  payments  are

practically  in  full  satisfaction  of  claims  by

policy  holders.  The process to make  payments  of

claims  to policy holders for another two companies -  again one from Singapore and the other from  the

Federation  -  is  reaching its  final  stages  and

claimants  will receive their payments  within  the

next three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquidators for the Singapore company reported

that  all claims from policy holders can be met  in

full. The remaining one Singapore insurance company

under  liquidation proved to be insolvent and  some

legal  action is still necessary before any payment

can be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other bogus insurance companies

incorporated  in Malaya, it is not known  how  long

the  liquidators will take before  any  payment  to

policy  holders  can  be made. However,  as  stated

before,  many  of these companies were  in  a  poor

financial  position and it would be optimistic  for

any  policy  holder  to expect more  than  a  small

fraction of his claims to be honoured.

<div align="center"><b>FLOATATION OF GOVERNMENT LOANS SINCE 3RD JUNE, 1959</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  since  3rd June, 1959 (i)  how  many  loans

have  so  far been floated by the Government;  (ii)

what  is  the amount for each loan; and (iii)   what

has been done with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir,

since  3rd June, 1959, five loans have been floated

by  the  Government, one for each  year  from  1959

to1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of loan in respect of the five

loans is $247,514,000. The breakdown of this figure

is as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, $40 million was floated under the

Development Loan (Local) Ordinance, 1959 (No. 50 of

1959).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, $30 million under the same Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, $50 million was floated under the

Development Loan Ordinance, 1961 (No. 7 of 1961).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, $60 million under that Ordinance, and in

1963, $67,514,000 under the same Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the funds raised by these loans have been

paid  into  the State Development Fund  to  finance

development  projects in the  State  in  accordance

with  section  5  of the Development  Loan  (Local)

Ordinance, 1959, in respect of those loans  floated

in 1959 and 1960, and in accordance with section  5

of the Development Loan Ordinance, 1961, in respect

of those loans floated in 1961, 1962 and 1963.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, this House has  only  just  now

received a report on the Common Market. That is why

I do not wish to raise any question now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member, by rising when his

name was called, has in fact asked the Question*. I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister indicate whether any copies of the  Report

were  supplied to the Press last week before  being

communicated to this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know. We

were   in   communication   with   the   Federation

Government and we were informed that the Federation

Government  would be releasing this Report  to  the

Press  as from today. I do not know whether  copies

were made available to the Press previous to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Minister not aware that in

the  Straits  Times of last Saturday, there  was  a

report purporting to contain a summary of the Rueff

Report? Would he indicate why Members of this House

could not have received the copies earlier?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, there

was  a  tie-up  between  this  Government  and  the

Federation    Government   and   there    was    an

understanding that the Report would be released  to

the Press as from today.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> At whose request was

that understanding arrived at?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In an agreement between both

Governments, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do not think the Minister quite

understood  me.  There  is a report  in  Saturday's

Straits    Times    - "Rueff    Report    Recommends

industrialisation,  109 pages."  I  am  asking  the

Minister  whether he was aware of how the newspaper

came  to  be in possession of a copy of the  Report

before it was presented to the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was not

released by the Singapore Government.

<div align="center"><b>(Applications for restoration of names to 1962 Registers of Electors)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (a) how many voters did not vote  in  the

National Referendum held on 1st September,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



1962;  (b)  how many of them applied for their names

to  be  restored to the 1962 Registers of Electors;

(c)   how many have had their names restored in  the 1962  Registers  of  Electors;  and  (d)   how  many

applications were rejected and why.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 53,581

persons did not vote at the National Referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,418 applied to have their names restored to the 1962 Register of Electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,467 have had their names restored to the 1962

Register of Electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None were rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Could the Minister indicate then why

the  discrepancy between the number of applications

and the number of restoration?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

difference  of  951 applications is in  respect  of

applicants   who  have  not  produced   documentary

evidence  to prove their absence from Singapore  in

time  for  consideration and approval for inclusion

in  the  1962  Registers. They will, therefore,  be

considered in connection with the 1963 Registers.

<div align="center"><b>1962 REGISTERS OF ELECTORS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (a)   how  many people in Singapore  became

entitled  to  have  their  names  entered  in   the

Registers of Electors, on reaching the age of 21 in

1962,   under  section  5  (1)   of  the   Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance; and  (b)

how  many have had their names entered in the  1962

Registers of Electors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to

(a)  is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singapore citizens reaching the age of 21 in

July  1962 are entitled to have their names in  the

Registers of Electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (b) is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is presumed that the Member for Choa Chu Kang

is  referring to the number of new voters who  have

had  their  names entered in the 1962 Registers  of

Electors. 45,066 new voters have had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



their  names  inserted  in the  1962  Registers  of

Electors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

is,  how many people? I wonder whether the Minister

can give us the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said

that all Singapore citizens reaching the age of  21

are  entitled  to have their names entered  in  the

Registers. As to how many, no record has been kept.

His guess is as good as mine.

July  1963  will  be entitled to have  their  names

entered in the Registers of Electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to (b) is:

is  referring  to  the number of new  voters  whose

names  will  be  entered in the 1963  Registers  of

Electors.  If  that  is  so, then  the  information

required can only be supplied after the publication

of  the  1963 Lists "A" and "B" and the  number  of

claims  from  new  voters that have  been  approved

during the 1963 revision of registers is known.

has  received  a report from the International  Red

Cross  on  the visit of their delegate to Singapore

to investigate conditions of detainees, and whether

he  would  make public the recommendations  therein

contained, and what action, if any, he proposes  to

take thereon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a report has

been  received  from  the  Vice-President  of   the

International Red Cross. A reply has been  sent  to

the  Vice-President thanking him for the report and

informing him that steps have been taken to improve

the  conditions of detainees which are now  better,

and, therefore, the Government does not consider it

necessary to publish this private report.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will the Minister reconsider the

question   particularly  in  the   light   of   the

inaccurate  appellation  that  it  is  a  "private"

report?  The  International Red Cross is  a  public

organisation.  It  was invited here  for  a  public

purpose at the request of public personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the main

objection, as far as we gather from the report,  is

that  the  detainees were confined individually  in

their  cells in Outram Prison. No detainee is being

confined individually in his cell at Outram  Prison

now. So there is no need to publish the report.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for your

indulgence. Would the Minister consider that if, in

fact, everything now is rosy in the garden there is

no   real   reason   why   the   report   and   its

recommendations  should  be  prevented  from  being

known  by  the  citizens of this country.  What  is

there the Government is afraid or ashamed of?

decision  because Tai Yuen's place  is  being  kept

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According to my

occurred in Pulau Senang in April this year. At the

Commission  has just been appointed. It  will  look

into the incident that took place on 12th July, and

I  would  imagine that it will also look into  this

incident, because it may have some bearing  on  the

incident in July.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I asked that question because if this

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  and when the  Government  will

build a Chinese-medium school in Tampines Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the

policy of Government to build schools to meet  the

demand  for  places  as far as possible,  provided

suitable  sites can be obtained and at  reasonable

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Tampines Road, which is more than

7  miles  long,  there are at present  11  Primary

schools  serving  this  area.  Of  these,  9   are

Government  Aided Chinese schools with 82  classes

and total enrolment of 2,873 pupils. It would seem

that  these  9 schools are more than  adequate  to

serve the needs of Chinese primary classes in this

area,  when judged by the registration for Primary

I  classes  for 1964 which was completed recently.

Although these schools could admit 808 pupils next

year,  only  404 or 50 per cent of  capacity  have

registered for admission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister visited Tampines

constituency  in February this year,  4  petitions

were -

Sir,  when  the  Prime Minister  visited  Tampines

Constituency in February this year, four petitions

were  received  for the building of  a  Government

Chinese  secondary school in the Tampines area.  A

survey  was immediately conducted by the Ministry.

Again  it  would  seem that the Tampines  area  is

reasonably  served  by no less than  five  Chinese

secondary   schools  in  the  neighbouring   Upper

Serangoon area,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The point of order being this: it

is  a  very  simple  question and  whether  it  is

permissible  that statements of such verbosity  be

permitted at Question Time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The general rule is that answers

should  be as short as possible. Of course,  there

is  nothing to prevent a Minister from elaborating

on  what  he has to say. The general parliamentary

practice  is that if the answer tends to be  long,

the  Minister  could  say  that  he  will  make  a

Ministerial statement after Questions. But I  have

allowed  rather lengthy statements  in  answer  to

Questions, for the simple reason that we have  not

had  so  very many questions on our Order  Papers.

Perhaps Ministers will bear in mind in future that

if their statements are lengthy, they could easily

make Ministerial statements at the end of Question

Time. Mr Yong may continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I shall gloss over the

details,  Sir,  and just say that there  are  five

Chinese  secondary  schools  in  the  neighbouring

Upper Serangoon area. On the south side there  are

another  three  Chinese secondary  schools  within

reasonable distance from Tampines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Government has decided to acquire two

pieces of land, one of four acres at 10 m.s. Upper

Changi Road, and the other over three acres at  7½

m.s.  Upper  East Coast Road. The land acquisition

notices  of  these  lands were  published  in  the

Government  Gazette Notifications  No.  609  dated

22nd  March,  1963, and No. 1088 dated  17th  May,

1963,  respectively. It is planned to build  three

integrated schools (one primary and two secondary)

at  these  sites  to serve both  the  Changi  and

Tampines areas.

purpose will be served at this stage by instituting

a sociological enquiry of the type envisaged by the

trained  housing management personnel of the  Board

from time to time have already conducted specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



sociological  surveys to assist the  manage, ment,

planning, and administration of housing estates  as

well as to assess sociological practice relevant to

clearance of slum areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand from the Minister

surveys?  And  if so, would he consider  publishing

surveys, would it not be helpful to publish a  full

course,  as a matter of principle, an advertisement

will   be  inserted  to  invite  applications   for

trainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point whether an allowance or a fixed

salary will be given during the period of training,

the  Government has spent so much money  mainly  to

create  employment  opportunities  to  seamen.  The

better  our seamen are trained, the more employment

opportunities there are for them. Therefore,  since

the Government has provided such facilities and  at

such  expense,  it is only fair that  the  trainees

should  be expected, as a matter of dedication,  to

pay for their own food.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



However, in deserving cases, the Seafarers' Welfare

Board  will consider subsidising them with  a  food

allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the opportunity to become trainees

will  be open to all those who have passed  out  of

school,  yes, of course, as far as practicable,  it

will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding question number four, I have mentioned

just  now  that guarantee of employment depends  on

how  successful this scheme is. If our  seamen  are

experienced  and well qualified,  I  am  sure  that

shipping quarters from all over the world will come

to  Singapore to recruit our seamen. In  fact,  the

training scheme is being mooted for this purpose.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

apart from that, there is a matter on which I would

like to seek clarification from this House, or from

the  Seafarers' Welfare Board, or other bodies.  At

the   moment,  seafarers  are  grouped  in  various

divisions  - the engine-room is mostly Chinese,  the

catering  department  is  for  Chinese,  and  other

categories are for Malays. So if this is the  case,

I  believe  this  is  not very healthy.  Could  the

authorities concerned give a definite clarification

in  this  House in regard to the matter so that  it

could  be  clearly understood and no problems  will

arise from that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this point

lies mainly with the employers. It is up to them to

stipulate  whether  they like Malay  people  to  be

employed  in  the  engine-room or in  the  catering

department  or  in  the deck  department.  In  this

connection, there are other factors which influence

employers to make such a decision. For instance, if

they have Chinese and Malays or other nationalities

in  one  department,  then  they  have  to  provide

catering  facilities. From the  point  of  view  of

convenience and economy, they will have  to  decide

whether  they would like to have an entire  section

of their crew of one nationality.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

feel  I need not debate this matter further, but  I

would like to draw attention to what I have already

said  in  this  House, and that is  that  with  the

existence of a plan to train our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



seamen,  with the contribution of so much money,  I

wonder  if  the  Government  will  still  want   to

register  seamen  who are non-citizens,  especially

from Indonesia, among whom quite a good number  are

registered  with the Seamen's Registry  Board,  and

who  are  given  opportunities of employment?  With

this  state  of  affairs  existing,  what  is   the

position regarding our own citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> conferred with the <b>Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye).</b>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it Dr Toh or Mr Wee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I trust there is no

misunderstanding.  Any Minister  may  speak  if  he

chooses.  It  is not confined to the  Parliamentary

Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before a

person  can  be registered, he must be a  Singapore

citizen.  So as far as the Seamen's Registry  Board

is  concerned,  the  person  must  be  a  Singapore

citizen before he can be registered as a seaman.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): For the record, I

would  like  to say there are people who  are  non-Singapore citizens who have been registered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> May I answer that? Mr Speaker,

it  is international practice that seamen who  drop

in  at  any  port will be registered at that  port.

Therefore, in following the custom we also register

all  seamen  who  leave their ships  in  Singapore.

However,  it is the practice here to register  only

new  entrants who are Singapore citizens. Those who

are  registered  for the first  time  must  possess

Singapore citizenship. But it is equally  true,  as

the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan says,  that  our

Registry  does contain names of seamen  from  other

parts  of  the world. Well, the privilege which  we

accord  to seamen from other ports is also extended

by other governments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



to  our  own Singapore seamen who happen  to  leave

their   ships   in   other  countries.   Therefore,

reciprocity is carried out.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what

has  been  stated by the Deputy Prime  Minister  is

quite  so.  But can he give an assurance  that  not

only do we not want Indonesians to be registered in

Singapore,  but  even  today,  seamen  from  Penang

cannot  be registered in Singapore? I think  he  is

more aware of this matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish for a vote?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali:</b> No. I withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as the Government is concerned, the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance, 1963,  which  extended  the

period  for  the revision of the 1962 Registers  of

Electors  until  30th  June. 1962,  and  which  was

passed  by  the Legislative Assembly on 15th  June,

1963,  is a good and sufficient Ordinance  for  the

purpose  for  which it was introduced. However,  in

view  of the doubts expressed and the fears  raised

by some Members of the Opposition, particularly the

Member  for Farrer Park, that this Bill  would  not

have the effect of validating the acts done by  the

Registration   Officer  in  connection   with   the

revision  of  the  1962 Electoral  Registers,  this

short  Bill has been introduced for the purpose  of

removing  any doubt that may exist or avoiding  any

possible  dispute  in  the future  as  regards  the

legality of the revised 1962 Registers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, therefore, expressly validates all acts

done by the Registration Officer in connection with

the revision of the Registers of Electors for 1962,

whether  done  before  or  after  the  coming  into

operation  of  the  Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,  1963,

and provides that such acts shall not be challenged

or called in question in any court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would seem

that the Minister is still unrepentant. He tries to

tell  this  House that what the Government  did  in

June  was  right.  If  it  was  right,  why  is  it

necessary  to  table  this amending  Bill?  It  was

because  the  opinion given to the  Minister  at  a

later  stage after that debate confirmed that  what

the   Opposition   said  was  right.   Surely   the

Government  would  not want  to  introduce  a  Bill

unless  it  is  vitally necessary  to  prevent  any

possibility  of  any doubts that could  be  legally

raised  as  to  the validity of the 1962  Electoral

Registers.  The Government, through the  Minister's

speech,  is  just trying to cover up  this  glaring

example of the dictatorial P.A.P. Government trying

to  ride roughshod over the Opposition. I warn  the

Government to stop playing this kind of game or  it

will find itself thrown out unceremoniously -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Fighting the elections?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, on the 15th of June, this

House  debated  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  (Temporary Provisions) Bill,  which  has

now  become law, against the objection of a  united

Opposition. The Government carried the day with  23

votes against 20 Opposition votes. The present Bill

seeks  to introduce an amendment to that Bill which

was debated and forced through only last month, and

this  Bill  is  introduced  on  a  Certificate   of

Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us take our minds back to the debate on

the 15th of June. My



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



colleague,  the  Member for Farrer  Park,  was  the

first  Opposition Member to open our  guns  on  the

dictatorial   P.A.P.  Government.   I   seek   your

indulgence, Sir, and the indulgence of hon. Members

to  quote  two paragraphs of his speech  which  are

very relevant to the matter now before the House. I

quote from the Official Report of the debate of the

15th  June [Unrevised Transcript, page 31- Hansard,

Vol.  20,  No. 11, cols. 1356-7]. This is what  the

Member for Farrer Park said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one difficulty

which  I  wish  to  bring to the attention  of  the

Minister  in  charge of this Bill and the  Minister

for  Law. Under this Ordinance, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, the whole of the registration process must  be

completed within the year of registration. What the

Minister  wants  to do now, what  the  Minister  is

asking  the  House to do rather, is to  extend  the

time  to the 30th June in order to enable the  1962

registers to be completed. I understand that  steps

have already been taken by the Registration Officer

some time towards the end of February this year  to

start the compilation of the 1962 registers. To  my

mind,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  all  those  steps

which  he  has now taken are ultra vires, null  and

void,  of  no legal effect, so that all the  claims

and  objections which have been registered, all the

tentative  registers which he has put up  (Lists  A

and B) are all illegal and have no effect. That  is

the  present  position. All that  the  Minister  is

asking  the House to do is to extend the  time  for

the    certification   of   the   registers.    The

certification of the registers on the steps  taken,

to  my  mind,  will be an illegality;  without  the

sanction of the law. I do not see how, even if this

Assembly  passes the Bill in the way it is  framed,

any  certification resulting from the steps already

having  been taken by the Registration Officer  can

make these registers valid. Thai is my view which I

put forward to this House. In spite of this, if the

Minister  carried this Bill through, it could  well

be  that  somebody would contest  the  validity  of

these registers, and any elections which were  held

on  the  1962 registers might all be null and  void

and have no effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister whether he has taken the

advice of the State Advocate-General on the present

position on this specific proposition - that  steps

already  having been taken to compile the registers

(which  stops  are illegal at the moment)  and  the

Bill  drafted in the way that it is without further

provisions  which  would cover  the  illegal  steps

already  taken by the Registration Officer, whether

this  Bill  would, in fact, enable a  proper  valid

legal register for 1962 to be completed.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also spoke at this sitting, and I would

like  to  quote from the same Official  Report  the

relevant part of which deals with this legal point.

That is at page 38 [Hansard, cols. 1368-9]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Do not press on with something that might turn

out  to  be a legal problem, as pointed out by  the

Member for Farrer Park. Let us say we have the  by-election in Sembawang based on these 1962 electoral

registers.  What  is to prevent any  candidate  who

lost  in the by-election to file a petition on  the

ground  that  the  1962  electoral  registers   are

illegal and not in accordance with the law? I would

urge upon the Government to reconsider its stand on

this issue.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Law was silent on this very

important  legal point although we had expected  to

hear gems of wisdom from him. But the Minister  for

Home Affairs replied and that is at page 38 of  the

unrevised transcript [Hansard, col. 1369]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a temporary provisions

Bill seeking the Assembly's approval to extend  the

time   for   the  revision  of  the  registers   of

elections,  which  should have  been  completed  in

1962. This Bill was drafted and vetted by the State

Advocate-General,  and so far as  I  can  see,  the

legal aspect of it would have been taken care of by

the State Advocate-General's Department.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cautioned the Government. We urged it to

reconsider  its  stand in the light  of  the  legal

point  raised  by us. If it had been  a  democratic

Government giving due weight to reasons advanced by

the  Opposition, if it had not been an arrogant and

a  dictatorial  Government, surely, Sir,  it  could

have  deferred the Committee stage of the Bill  for

just  a  few  hours in order to give the Government

time  to consult the State Advocate-General on this

very valid legal point raised by the Opposition. If

this  step  had been taken, as it should have  been

taken, then this amending Bill would not have  been

necessary.  All our cautioning, all our  urging  on

the  good sense of the Government, was just brushed

aside  by  the dictatorial P.A.P. Government  whose

leaders  consider  themselves to be  cleverer  than

anybody else. The whole Opposition fought them.  We

lost.  But  we were not dismayed. We knew  we  were

right and we would be proved right. We lost. But we

were  aroused and would fight again and  again  and

again until we delivered a knock-out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



blow  on  a dictatorial Government that sets  party

interests  above  the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before the House is a complete

admission that we were right, and with right on our

side  we  will renew our opposition and  will  vote

against the Bill as we did last month.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  no  consolation to us to say that  we  were

right.  No, Sir. All of us have been saying  for  a

long,  long time that the P.A.P. has been  arrogant

and dictatorial. It is only now that the S.P.A. has

chimed what we have been saying.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I only want the Member to

understand  that  we  who  sit  in  front  are  the

Singapore Alliance, and not S.P.A. or the  U.M.N.O.

And  as  one  united force, we will knock  out  the

P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> S.P.A., Singapore Alliance,

Labour  Party, or whatnot - they have been  changing

names for a long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before the House, from what we can see,

is  important from a very different aspect.  It  is

important not in the way that the leader of the new

Alliance  has stated - the arrogant and dictatorial

ways  of the P.A.P. It is more important than that.

It  is important in that this is an example of  the

P.A.P. always doing anything and everything to turn

something  illegal into something  legal.  Anything

which is wrong is turned into right. Anything which

is white is turned into black, and a traitor into a

so-called hero. This is exact proof of what we have

been saying all along. Now that the P.A.P. realises

that  it has done wrong, it is trying to "legalise"

that  wrong. But does the legalising of that  wrong

make it right? However many legal phrases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



it  uses  to right this wrong afterwards,  a  wrong

still remains a wrong. Under no circumstances  will

the  wrong be made into a right, either morally  or

legally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill that was passed on 15th June should

have been thrown Out. But, as usual, the Government

steam-rollers through everything that it  wants  to

push  through.  This is an abuse of  power  by  the

Government. We have seen this for quite some  time.

As  it is, parliamentary democracy in Singapore has

fallen into great disrepute. Who does not know that

today in Singapore we have a dictatorial Government

and a pocket dictator in the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Pocket emperor.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Pocket emperor? Yes, he wants

to  think that he is an emperor. He goes round  the

constituencies -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> To your dismay.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not to our dismay, Sir, because

the way that the Prime Minister has been compelling

people  to  pay for receptions in order to  welcome

the Prime Minister, forcing school children to line

the streets -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon. Member

for  Queenstown  that we are debating  an  amending

Bill,  and we are not debating the Prime Minister's

visits to the constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no intention of touching

on  that aspect of the Prime Minister's activities,

because the intention and the way that he has  done

it is now well known all over Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that the way the Government

has   gone  about  in  this  Bill  has,  in   fact,

emasculated  in  many  ways  the  powers   of   the

Judiciary. It says here that any act done  by  such

and such a person "shall be valid and shall not  be

challenged or called in question in any court."  If

anything  pleases  the  P.A.P.,  it  can  be   made

unchallengeable in court, and therefore -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He can wait.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest to Members

that  if  there is, on the face of it, a reasonable

request  that  some information or  elucidation  he

given, then the Member speaking should give way. If

the  parliamentary practice of a Member giving  way

is  abused, then the Member is entitled  in  future

not  to  give  way.  Is the Member  for  Queenstown

giving way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I take your advice, Sir, and

give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I rightly heard,

the  Member  for  Queenstown  said  that  any  act,

however  unlawful,  would be  legalised  under  the

terms  of this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, as a  matter

of   fact,  I  would  refer  the  Member  to   this

particular clause that we propose to introduce into

this  Bill. All the acts referred to are acts which

are  necessary  for  the purpose  of  revising  the

Registers  of Electors: not any acts, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That proves my point, Sir. Any

act  for  the purpose of revising the registers  in

order  to  suit the P.A.P. That is exactly  what  I

have  been trying to tell the Minister. Well, I  do

not know what sort of a skull he has got.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> A very good skull!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It takes some time to

penetrate. That, Sir, only proves to you  that  the

P.A.P. to suit the P.A.P. can do things  any  way,

anyhow,  at  any time; and all not  to  please  the

people of Singapore, as the Prime Minister has been

trying  to  tell us all along, but to please  those

few persons sitting on the Front Benches there, the

puppets  and  stooges  of the colonial  masters  in

Britain. Those are the people who have been selling

out  the rights of the people of Singapore.  It  is

time  that  they, who want to give  the  impression

that  they  are  working in the  interests  of  the

people,  should wake up. This Bill, as far  as  the

people  of  Singapore are concerned,  is  merely  a

repetition  of  what  they have  known  all  along,

namely P.A.P. deceit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important significance of this Bill as

well  as  the Bill which was passed on  15th  June,

1963, lies in the fact that it allows the P.A.P. to

exclude  a  large number of voters from the  coming

elections  and  possibly from the  1964  elections.

Whether  the Government holds the general elections

immediately after the elections to the 15 seats  to

the  Central Parliament or next year, it  is  clear

that  the intention of the Government is to exclude

a   large  number  of  voters  from  the  electoral

registers. The electoral registers for 1962 will be

used  for  the elections this time, and unless  the

Government changes this and has the 1963  Electoral

Registers ready for 1964, according to law, it will

be  using the 1962 Electoral Registers for the 1964

general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, Sir, round about 60,000 babies are

born,  and only about 10,000 people die.  So  there

should be an addition of at least 50,000 people  to

the electoral registers every year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already pointed out that the 1962

Electoral Registers have less voters than the  1961

electoral  registers. We asked  the  Minister  many

questions, but somehow or other, he fought  shy  of

answering  any  one of them. We must remember  that

this  Bill serves, in effect, to exclude  from  the

electoral registers a large number of young men and

women  who  the  P.A.P. know will be against  them.

That is the meaning of this Bill. We will oppose it

right  through  all its stages, and  we  hope  that

consequent on the criticisms that we bring up,  the

Government will not try to shut out the huge number

of  voters  who should, by right, have a chance  to

vote. They must not be denied their right.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess

that  I enjoy hearing the P.A.P. Minister for  Home

Affairs  sound  like  Burns' - Wee  little  cowering

mousie. He says, "We are introducing this Bill"  in

his  most timid, smiling and frightened manner - the

new Pelandok - "because the Opposition has -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member

for  Anson  that  all  these epithets,  descriptive

phrases are completely unnecessary?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted to

you for your advice, but if you will permit me, the

description  in pictures is worth a great  deal  of

verbosity which would otherwise be necessary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not wished to over-rule

the Member for Anson, but I will be forced to if he

uses  those descriptive phrases which can be - I  do

not know whether they are - offensive.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

a pelandok is a national animal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was referring to the terms in which the Minister

introduced this Bill - "out of deference for doubts

expressed  by  the Opposition". Sweet words  - words

that one expects from a constitutional government - and  it is the first time I have heard these  words

from the P.A.P. Front benchers in all my experience

here! That is the amusing part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect that I would like to point out is

that  if  they  were  capable of  modesty,  of  the

constitutional  approach of giving due  weight  and

consideration to Opposition views, they  would,  as

has  been  pointed out by the Member for Cairnhill,

have adjourned or sought adjournment of that debate

for  a  day  or  for  a few hours  to  clarify  the

position. But they were convinced they were  right,

and  with  their  normal  arrogance  and  in  their

traditional manner, they proceeded with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why have they suddenly changed their minds?

There has been no representation since the Bill was

passed.  It is not because of the doubts that  were

expressed  on the day that they forced through  the

measure,  hut it is because they have learnt  since

then  that in fact the Opposition advice is correct

and  the  conduct  of  the Executive  in  purported

pursuance  of the Ordinance was illegal.  But  have

they  the courage and the decency to admit it? That

is  asking more than even the new facade the P.A.P.

can  support, that they should honestly and frankly

say,  "You were right. We were wrong. We would like

to   have  an  amendment."  No,  Sir.  No  possible

question.  God and the P.A.P. can do no  wrong;  or

perhaps the P.A.P. and God.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Only one.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, one other aspect that I would

like  to  draw your attention to, and that  is  the

intervention of the Minister for Law. He tells  you

that  the Member of the Barisan Sosialis who  spoke

on  this  measure erred in saying that this  clause

validates  all criminal acts because it  says  "all

acts in pursance of the purposes of the revision of

such registers". Well, Mr Speaker, I would suggest

that if the Minister were to consult those who read

the  law  without P.A.P. spectacles, he would  find

that  in  fact a person can, in purported pursuance

of  the  revision of the registers, commit criminal

acts  and that the Registration Officer could,  for

example - not that I say he does - conspire with the

Minister  or  other  political  Parties   for   the

purposes   of  criminally  refusing  or   admitting

persons  who would be entitled to be registered  or

who  are  not entitled to be registered.  We  could

have,  for  example,  5,000  members  of  the  Work

Brigade   registered   in   every   one   of    our

constituencies in purported pursuance of the powers

for the purposes of the revision of such registers.

This clause, Mr Speaker, does not deal merely with

acts  that  are done bona fide. It deals  with  all

acts - criminal and legitimate. I say that that  is

yet  another  approach, that they  should  seek  an

amendment  is  right,  since there  has  been  this

passage  of time and acts have been performed.  But

the spirit in which it is sought and the manner  in

which the amendment is placed before this House,  I

say to you, Mr Speaker, are wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

have read the Explanatory Statement provided by the

Government in support of this Bill. On page  2,  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... this Bill seeks to remove any doubt that may

exist as to the validity of acts done ...'.



<br><br>This  Explanatory  Statement,  I  take  it,  is   a

statement  being  put  out  by  the  Government  to

persuade  the  whole House to agree to  this  Bill.

Normally, the speech by the Minister in conduct  of

any particular Bill will be in the spirit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



of  the Explanatory Statement. Whereas listening to

the Minister's speech, he most definitely said that

the  Government  was satisfied  that  the  Bill  as

passed by the House was sufficient for the purposes

for which it was intended, if that is the stand  of

the  Government,  then I think it would  have  been

completely logical if the Government had refused to

bring  in  this amending Bill. The reason given  by

the  Minister  was  that he wished  to  accommodate

certain  Opposition views, although he himself  was

not  convinced of those views but that in order  to

accommodate  those  views  even  though  they   are

incorrect  this amending Bill has been  introduced.

Now  really,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask you,  in  all

seriousness,  should  the  Minister  in  his  right

senses   get  up  in  this  House  and  say.   "The

Government  is not convinced that certain  sections

of  the Opposition are correct," and yet waste  the

time  of  the  House by bringing in a useless  Bill

which  in  his view is a useless Bill? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  quite frankly, so far as we on this  side  of

the  House are concerned, if the Minister does,  in

fact, think that this does not add one iota to  the

legality of the previous Bill that has been passed,

let  him  withdraw  this Bill. I challenge  him  to

withdraw this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point I wish to raise is a matter which I think has been touched upon by the Member for Anson. As the clause is phrased, it could cover two aspects of all acts taken by the Registration Officer. One set of acts taken by the Registrar are procedural steps which result in the

registers being compiled and certified. The  second

set of acts taken by the Registrar is in the nature

of  a  quasi-judicial  inquiry  which  affects  the

rights of the citizen. Now it could be that the way

this clause is worded it could affect the rights of

an  individual on the question of his  name  having

been  left  out  from  the  register.  If  this  is

intended as a covering act for all those acts which

deprive  the citizen of his basic electoral rights,

then I think this clause as phrased here should  be

objected  to.  But if it is merely  a  question  of

saying that all acts taken by the Registrar with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



view to producing the registers after 31st December

shall  be  deemed  to have been taken  before  31st

December,  there  is some point  in  this  amending

Bill. But if it is to validate the rejection of  an

application  to  have a name put on  the  register,

then this clause should be objected to.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding

the  Bill  on  the  compilation  of  the  electoral

registers  for  1962,  today  the  Government   has

introduced  another Bill for the  approval  of  the

House  to  validate the actions of the Registration

Officer  before  or  after  the  passing   of   the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition has always been against this method. We oppose such actions because, as I have said on previous Bills, we want a House which practises parliamentary democracy. I hope the Government will introduce Bills into this House in a fair way. The practice is to inform the

Opposition  according  to parliamentary  democracy.

Here,  I  do not expect it to be carried  out  that

far,   but   the  Government  should  not  suddenly

introduce Bills in this Assembly and give no chance

to the Opposition to consider them. If we study the

Explanatory  Statement,  it  is  clear   that   the

Government  wants to play down the allegation  that

it is acting unfairly and illegally in carrying out

its  objectives.  In this way,  the  Government  is

obstructing  us from finding out what it  wants  to

carry out and so bringing their actions before  the

court.  This is one of the things we are not  happy

about.  If we live in a free country where  we  can

practise  democracy, there must  be  the  right  to

bring  a matter to court. This should be encouraged

because    it   will   not   only   smoothen    our

administration, but it will also give an  assurance

to  the people that they can practise their rights.

If the Government takes the opportunity to legalise

the wrong that it has done, this will be bad for  a

healthy country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Explanatory Statement - I will read this in English. (In English) In this Bill -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The difficulty we are faced

with  here is the simultaneous interpretation. That

is  why  we  have a Standing Order which says  that

once a Member commences his speech in one language,

he must continue to speak in that language. So that

if  the Member for Southern Islands wishes to refer

to   the  Explanatory  Statement,  he  should  just

paraphrase what is in it in Malay.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker.  I  would  like to draw attention  to  the

Explanatory   Statement.  At  the   end   of   this

Explanatory  Statement, there is a  sentence  which

says that this Bill seeks to remove any doubt which

may  exist as to the validity of acts done  by  the

Registration Officer for the purposes  of  revising

the registers in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Mr Speaker, we have heard doubts

and  rumours that the Government is carrying out  a

campaign  to  transfer their voters and supporters.

This  is  an act which they are trying to cover  up

through  this  Bill, and which later on  we  cannot

take  to court. Lately we have heard over the radio

and television that the Prime Minister made visits.

This  is  not questioned, Mr Speaker,  because  we

know  that  the Government has all the  facilities,

all  the  machinery,  in  their  hands.  The  Prime

Minister himself has challenged the workers in  the

Harbour  Board and made them frightened -  "We  are

not stupid," and so on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest to the hon. Member

that  all  that  is completely irrelevant  to  this

particular Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, if I

cannot touch on that point, I will not do so. But I

would  like  to state here that we Members  of  the

Opposition are not people who cannot think what  is

right  and what is wrong. If it is good, it is  our

duty to support it, to allow and to approve it. But

I  am  sorry to say, and I would like to emphasise,

that  if  the Government carries out this practice,

our  hope  to  establish a country which  practises

parliamentary democracy cannot be realised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, it is quite

clear  that  we  are  near  election  time  because

everybody  has been making a lot of fuss over  what

is  a very simple issue. The last time I think  the

Opposition  Members, in particular, the Member  for

Farrer  Park, indicated that they had  some  doubts

about  the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

(Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Ordinance.  They

expressed  some  doubts  that  if  elections   were

carried  out,  somebody could  invalidate  all  the

provisions  of  the Ordinance. The  Government  was

certain,  hut  what we are doing, in  view  of  the

representations made, is that we are making it more

certain that the provisions of the Ordinance  would

not be questioned later on in the courts of law.  I

am  not  a lawyer, Sir, but I understand that  most

lawyers flourish because provisions of the law  are

never  a  hundred per cent certain.  Therefore,  if

somebody has indicated some kind of loophole in the

law,  then  it  is  our duty to  bring  forward  an

amendment  to ensure that that loophole is  closed.

And  that is what this amendment seeks to  do.  For

all  I  know,  Sir, if the S.P.A. or  the  Barisan

should  win  the next election, then  it  is  quite

possible that somebody may query the whole validity

of  the  elections, bring it before a court of  law

and  invalidate the whole process. To that  extent,

this  amendment would ensure that if the S.P.A. or

the Barisan should win the next election, the whole

process is not invalidated because of a loophole in

the  law.  Therefore, probably it is quite possible

that  the  Barisan have decided that they  are  not

going to win the next election, so, "Let us make  a

fuss  about  this little amendment." So I  suggest,

Sir, that there is no question of the P.A.P. or the

Government  trying to pull a fast  one.  This  Bill

does not favour either the P.A.P. or the Barisan or

the  S.P.A. It ensures that the Ordinance  is  more

foolproof than it is at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Culture repeats what the  Government

has said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



earlier on. If, as the Member for Farrer Park says,

the  Government is certain of the legality  of  the

earlier  Ordinance, then there is no necessity  for

it to bring in this Bill, and the Member for Farrer

Park has challenged it to withdraw the Bill. If  it

is  certain, I do not see what can prevent it  from

withdrawing this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister tries to suggest that out of

kindness  to  the Barisan and the  S.P.A.,  if  the

Barisan or the S.P.A. should win, the P.A.P. do not

want  someone  to  go to court and  invalidate  the

elections.  And  out  of  kindness  they  want   to

introduce  this  Bill. Surely,  Sir,  we  know  the

P.A.P. well, and the people know the P.A.P. well.

They  are  not going to do anything out of kindness - out  of anything - for any Opposition group, be  it

the  Right-wing  S.P.A. or the Barisan  or  anybody

else  for that matter. Sir, we must call a spade  a

spade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government seeks by this Bill to legalise

illegal  acts. What it seeks to do is  to  legalise

criminal  acts. Sir, we know that its intention  is

to legalise illegal criminal acts which can be done

by  a  few  civil servants because  they  would  be

forced  to  do them on instruction from the  P.A.P.

Sir,  the conduct of the Government in the past  is

ample  proof that it will not hesitate to stoop  to

any indecent level. By any standard, the Referendum

Ordinance  is a legal rigging, because they  passed

the  Bill here. It was adopted, made into law  and,

therefore,  it has legal backing. But,  in  effect,

what  happened was rigging. I do not think any  man

who  chooses to be honest can stand up and say with

a clear conscience that the results of the national

referendum reflected the will and the desire of the

people. Sir, having judged them by their manner  of

conducting  the National Referendum and by  various

other  acts,  they  are  capable  of  rigging   the

elections. We have said this in the past. We say it

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular clause, Mr Speaker, Sir, can be

used  to  deny  the Opposition certain  fundamental

rights.  For  example, we know the  Government  has

quite an efficient security system. They are trying

to find out who the Opposition candidates are going

to be and so on. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



they  can find out the list of candidates that  the

Opposition  may field, their names  can  easily  be

left out of the electoral registers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And to stand for election, one must have

one's name in the electoral register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Your name is already there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the clause says not only acts done

before the coming into operation of this Ordinance,

but  also after the coming into operation  of  this

Ordinance. What other revision is going to be  done

to  the  registers, we do not know. We do not  even

know  definitely when they are going  to  hold  the

elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You will find out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is no use telling us that they have

certified  the  registers.  Sir,  this  is  a  very

serious  matter  because it affects  certain  basic

tenets of democracy. Sir, elections and the one-man-one-vote  system are fundamental to the success  of

any  democracy. It is only in an election that  the

people  can  have  an opportunity to  choose  their

representatives, to choose their leaders, to choose

their  Government. If the Government had wanted  to

be sincere in giving the people a fair opportunity,

then it should have followed our earlier suggestion

to set up an independent Commission for the conduct

of  elections. Sir, if it is confident, as  it  has

always  said  it  is  confident,  of  winning   the

elections  and that the people are on  their  side,

why  is  it  afraid  of appointing  an  independent

Commission  which can conduct the elections  as  is

the case in the Federation of Malaya, instead of -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the hon.

Member that that is possibly irrelevant to the Bill

we are discussing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I have to refer to this earlier

call  we  made.  The Government seeks  to  try  and

justify all the illegal acts it has done because it

has some means of pushing through any Bill it wants

to  push  through.  We  say  in  fairness,  if  the

Government is sincere in this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



all  right,  let  us  have  it  fair  - set  up   an

independent  Commission and  let  this  independent

Commission conduct the elections as is the case  in

the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for  Culture  has  said  that  the  issue

involved in this Bill is a simple one. Sir, if  the

issue  is  really simple, why must  it  go  through

three  Readings  on a Certificate of  Urgency?  Why

cannot  we  let  the Bill go through  the  ordinary

parliamentary procedure of three separate Readings?

The  fact that the Government have seen fit to rush

a  Bill like this through the unusual procedure  of

three Readings shows that, to them, it has become a

vital  issue. The public must not be given a chance

to  know that this is being discussed in the House.

Sir,  we  would  like  to ask the  Government  this

question.  Why do they consider Bills  relating  to

elections  as being so urgent at this  stage?  They

have seen fit to postpone the Sembawang by-election

for  nearly  a  year.  Their reason  was  that  the

electoral registers were not quite ready and  there

must  be time for revision and so on. And now,  all

of  a  sudden, all Bills relating to elections must

be  rushed through. They know the reason why.  They

sought  to conceal the reason, Sir. They have  gone

ahead electioneering in an improper manner, without

giving the other Parties knowledge that an election

is   pending;  using  public  funds  and  all   the

propaganda  machinery  under  the  control  of  the

Government,  which  we consider improper.  If  they

believe  that  they have logic and reason  and  any

sense  of fair play, how could they, without giving

due notice to the runners, summon their own runners

ahead,  get them on the mark, get set and fire  the

pistol? That is what they are trying to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Party in power dare not follow the rules of

the game, they are setting a bad example for future

governments.  Parliamentary  democracy   will   not

succeed  if the rules are easily pushed aside  just

because  it  is to the advantage of  the  Party  in

power so to do. Sir, to be really fair, honest  and

democratic and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



since they claim for justice here, they should have

the  decency not to pass this Bill on a Certificate

of  Urgency. To try to do that is to show that they

are  trying  to do things in their own way  and  to

catch the Opposition and the public by surprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue was mentioned by the Member for

Anson, and that is this clause where the words "all

acts"  practically validate or legalise  any  wrong

acts  of  the Registration Officer. It is a serious

matter.   "All   acts"  - very  comprehensive.   The

Registration Officer surely is a human being liable

to  err. But under this Bill, if passed, he becomes

somebody  who cannot err, or if he errs,  then  his

errors  must become legal and right. Sir, it  is  a

big  issue to give all that power to a man,  unless

the  idea,  the  aim,  of the  Government  is  that

through  this particular gentleman, they  can  from

their   bag  of  tricks,  which  have  been   quite

plentiful,  produce something which they  can  push

through  this gentleman and mislead the electorate.

Sir,  I  am afraid this Bill involves quite  a  big

issue  and  a  dangerous issue which  we  dare  not

accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 15th June, page 39 in the typescript, the

sixth  paragraph  [unrevised transcript]  (Hansard,

Vol.  20, No. 11, col. 1370), the Minister for Home

Affairs said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As for the revision of the 1963 pre-electoral

registers, I wish to inform the House that work has

already  been set in motion. In fact,  revision  of

the 1963 registers is being carried out now ...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the revision of the 1963 registers is

being  carried  out now, why should there  be  this

unholy  haste where everything, including  mistakes

made  in the 1962 registers, is legalised?  Sir, I

venture  the reason; that after giving  the  public

the  impression  that  there  will  be  no  Federal

elections  until  one year after Malaysia  Day,  as

discussed   between   them   and   the   Federation

Government, without the Opposition being consulted,

they  suddenly decided it is to their advantage  to

start  the football match, not at the regular  time

of  five  o'clock, but at their own  time,  at  one

o'clock, while the others



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



are  having lunch. That, to them, is fair play. So,

all of a sudden, thinking that that is the best way

to  catch  the Opposition by surprise and  have  an

unfair  advantage  in  the  elections,  they   have

decided, "Well, we let the Prime Minister go  round

on   his   fashion  parade.  Do  not  say   it   is

electioneering. No, say he is on his  State  visit.

Then  when we have covered enough ground,  we  rush

through  all  these Bills." Sir, if  what  we  have

surmised is not true, well, the Party in power  can

easily do the right thing. Withdraw this Bill,  let

us have the 1963 registers prepared; let us have an

election   based  on  registers  which  cannot   be

regarded as being cooked; let us not have this Bill

which  will validate and legalise all acts  of  the

Registration Officer.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not understand

how   the  Opposition  can  lead  themselves   into

believing  that  we  are being arrogant  and  being

dictatorial  because we introduce this Bill  before

the  House. A point of legal difficulty was pointed

out to us in the course of the debate the last time

the  Bill was before this House. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

there  might  be some substance in  that  point  of

legal difficulty or there might be nothing in it at

all.  The  constitutional course open to  us  would

have  been to adjourn the Third Reading of the Bill

and  look into the matter further at that time,  or

introduce this new Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also been accused of rushing through this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency. Now, this Bill provides that a new clause should be added to the previous Bill, a clause of only eight lines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the revision of the electoral registers for 1962 should have been completed on or before the 15th of September, 1962. This was not done for a variety of reasons which the Minister for Home Affairs has already explained to the House at the last sitting. The Singapore Legislative

Assembly     Elections    (Temporary    Provisions)

Ordinance, 1963, extended the date of completion of

the  1962 electoral registers to the 30th of  June,

1963. The issue is whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



notwithstanding the extension of the  date  of  the

completion  of the 1962 registers, there  would  be

legal  validity  for  the  procedural  work  to  be

carried  out  in  the preparation  of  the  revised

registers  for  1962  outside of  the  time  limits

prescribed  by sections 10 (1)  and 15  (1)   of  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance

(Chapter  53). There it is provided,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, that every year work on the preparation of the

revised  registers should begin sometime after  the

1st  of  February and be completed by the  15th  of

September of that same year. Surely it is  not  our

intention  to ask the House to give legal  validity

to criminal acts done by anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General is satisfied that the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance passed at the last sitting of

the  Assembly is sufficient in law to validate  the

work  of the Registration Officer in preparing  the

revised  registers for 1962 outside the  limits  of

time  prescribed by sections 10 (1)  and 15  (1)   of

the   Singapore   Legislative  Assembly   Elections

Ordinance (Chapter 53). But to make doubly sure, we

have  included  this new validity  section  in  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance ex abundante cautela.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this   is   the   P.A.P. system  of  parliamentary

democracy.  When  moving the  Second  Reading,  the

Minister for Home Affairs explained the reasons for

this Bill. He said that the amending Bill passed on

15th June this year was sufficient for the purpose,

but in order to clear the doubts of the Opposition,

it  was  necessary to table this  Bill  to  further

amend the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th June, when the Minister for Home

Affairs  tabled the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill, the Assembly

spent  some  three hours debating this undemocratic

Bill. At that time we pointed out to the Government

that the amendment was a great departure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



from the system of parliamentary democracy. We said

that  it  was  the intention of the  Government  to

legalise their illegal acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Minister introduces another Bill, the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions)  (Amendment)  Bill,  only   after   the

Government   has  discovered  that   the   previous

amending  Bill  was insufficient for  a  particular

purpose,  that  is to say, although they  tried  to

legalise  their  illegal  acts  previously,   those

illegal  acts  are still illegal  and  they  remain

illegal.  That  is  why  it is  necessary  for  the

Minister to introduce this Bill to further legalise

those  illegal acts. That is to say, on  15th  June

the  P.A.P. Government "killed" 500,000 voters. But

they  were  unable to "kill" all of them,  although

they  "killed"  some. So they  are  now  trying  to

legalise  their act of "murdering" these voters  in

this House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few moments ago, in reply to my question No. 8 on the Order Paper, the Minister said that the 1962 Electoral Registers have about 45,000 new voters. But in reply to my question No. 9, he said that those new electors would have their names entered in the 1963 Electoral Registers, and

he  finally  pointed  out that the  1963  Electoral

Registers would be completed before 1st March  next

year. This accounts for the intention of this  Bill

before  the  House. It explains why the  Government

are  unable to answer the question with  regard  to

the number of persons who are actually entitled  to

vote.  They  know that through this Bill  the  1963

Electoral Registers will not be ready and therefore

the  people will not be able to vote. But  this  is

quite  different from what the Minister for Culture

has said - that this Bill is introduced to look after

the interests of the Barisan Sosialis or the S.P.A.

and  to prevent anybody from going to court to  get

an order that the election is illegal. Mr Speaker,

this  is  the  first time that we  have  heard  the

Minister  for  Culture saying such  kind  words  to

Members of the Opposition. As a matter of fact,  it

is  the intention and purpose of the Government  to

legalise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



through  this  Assembly all their undemocratic  and

dictatorial acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the revision of electoral registers is not difficult in so far as printing is concerned. If the Minister finds it impossible to complete the 1963 Electoral Registers because of a shortage of staff or because of financial difficulties or for some other reason, then the simple thing for him to do is to ask the Minister

for Finance to put in a Supplementary Estimate with

which   to   recruit  additional  staff  for   this

particular purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have seen the Government spending thousands and thousands of dollars on expanding television programmes and the Army. If the Elections Office has not got enough money, then I believe the Government can easily put before the Assembly a Supplementary Estimate, and this will not endanger the financial position of Singapore to

any  substantial extent. I am certain that  if  the

Government were to put in a Supplementary Estimate,

as  I have suggested, then Members on this side  of

the  House  would  fully  support  it  without  any

opposition.  So one can very clearly see  that  the

motive  of the Government in introducing this  Bill

is  not  that they are incapable of completing  the

registers in time but because they want to preserve

their political life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that all Bills relating to elections are introduced by the Government for the purpose of ensuring their own political life. They say that the previous amending Bill was good. Of course, it is good to the P.A.P., but to the people of Singapore it is bad. It is undemocratic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the 1962 Electoral Registers were only completed at the beginning of this month, and were put up for inspection by the public only recently. Many people who voted at the National Referendum discovered that their names do not appear in the latest Electoral Registers. In the eyes of the P.A.P. Government, these people would

courageously come forward in the next elections and

vote   against   the  candidates  of   the   P.A.P.

Unfortunately their names



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



do not appear in the 1962 Electoral Registers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> No. (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,

all  these  things that I have said  are  based  on

facts.  I am not making allegations that cannot  be

substantiated. Mr Speaker, we can see very clearly

that  if  the P.A.P. did not introduce the amending

Bill on 15th June, they would have to complete  the

Electoral Registers within the time limit  set  out

in  the  Ordinance, and I believe that those people

whom  I  have  mentioned just now would  then  have

their names entered in the Register. But because of

that  amending Bill, these people do not have their

names entered in the latest Electoral Registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whatever the People's Action Party do, and whatever Bills they bring before the House, they only show clearly that they are undemocratic and dictatorial. They have shown their true colours. Their legislation is PAP, legislation, which is oppressive and suppressive and is not aimed at promoting the interests of the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this amending

Bill  is  not  designed to deprive anybody  of  his

electoral  rights,  as feared  by  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park. It is just to validate all procedural

steps  taken by the Registration Officer to compile

the  1962 Registers. The Bill was drawn up  by  the

State  Advocate-General's Chambers and approved  by

the  State  Advocate-General  himself.  I  am  sure

Opposition Members will agree that the S.A.G. will

be  the  last  person to approve any Bill  that  is

specifically designed to cover any criminal act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has alleged that the Bill could conveniently leave out the names of any prospective candidates of the Barisan Sosialis. The Registers have been compiled and certified last month, and I do not see how any names could have been left out of the Registers

now. I can assure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



Member   for  Thomson  that  the  Government   took

exceptional care to ensure that the names of the 14

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are in the Registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has alleged just now

that   many  people  who  voted  at  the   National

Referendum  have found that their  names  have  not

been  included in the 1962 Registers. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I tried to elucidate this information from him

just  now, but he refused to give way. There  is  a

Claims  and Objections period during which  persons

who  voted at the National Referendum and who found

that their names were not included in the Registers

could  file claims to have their names restored  in

the  Registers. Unless the Member for Choa Chu Kang

can  give  details or particulars of these  persons

whom he has alleged were deliberately excluded from

the  Registers by the Registration Officer, then  I

think it is quite proper for me to call him a liar.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Minister must know

that  that word is absolutely out of order in  this

Assembly, whether used directly or indirectly of  a

Member. He must withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think a qualified

withdrawal  like that would suit me or  the  House.

The  Speaker is here to uphold the dignity  of  the

House,  not  only his own dignity. I  want  just  a

simple withdrawal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, I withdraw that

word.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown could not understand why

there  have been less voters in the 1962  Registers

than in the 1961 Registers -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the Minister

will take a few more minutes. I intend therefore to

suspend now. I will take this Chair again at  half-past five.

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying

just  now  before we adjourned that the Member  for

Queenstown seemed not able to understand why  there

should be less voters in the 1962 Registers than in

the  1961 Registers. If he is clearly ignorant  why

there  should be less voters in the 1962 Registers,

then  I  am  afraid I have credited him  with  more

intelligence than he should deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in the day, in answer to the Member for Choa Chu Kang, I have stated that there were more than 53,000 persons who did not vote at the National Referendum, and if he had paid attention to the answer I have given he would have understood why there should be less voters in the 1962 Registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a straightforward amendment to remove the doubts of the Opposition Members, particularly the Member for Farrer Park, and to make the legality of the 1962 Registers doubly certain. Inasfar as the Government's position is concerned, we are satisfied that the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance, 1963, is sufficient for  the

purpose.  However, because doubts have been  raised

by the Opposition Members as to the legality of the

procedural acts taken by the Registration  Officer,

this  amendment is introduced today. The  amendment

has   been  introduced  at  the  instance  of   the

Opposition  Members. If now the Opposition  Members

after  having first cast doubts on the legality  of

the   1962   Registers,  are  unhappy  about   this

amendment, then I wish to withdraw this Bill and in

this respect I wish to seek your guidance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> At the moment, the House is seized of

a  motion, that is, the motion that the Bill be now

read a Second time. Therefore, the first step would

be for the Minister to proceed under Standing Order

No. 40 which deals with withdrawal of motions. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



will read the relevant part. Standing Order No. 40,

paragraph (1):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A motion ... may be withdrawn, at the request of

the  mover, by leave of the Assembly ... before the

question is fully put thereon, provided that  there

is no dissentient voice ..'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the position. If the Minister seeks the

leave  of the Assembly that the motion be withdrawn

and  the  Assembly  agrees,  the  motion  will   be

withdrawn.  Then there will be another  step  which

will have to be taken to discharge the Order of the

House for the Second Reading of the Bill, Will  the

Minister then proceed under Standing Order  No.  40

in the first instance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave

of  the  Assembly, under Standing Order No. 40,  to

withdraw the motion for Second Reading.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that the motion be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion is not withdrawn. Does the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will put the Question then. The

Question  is, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many as are of that opinion, say Aye.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Aye.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To the contrary, say



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.

have it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Division, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Too late. There is no other further

step to be taken. The motion for the Second Reading

has  been  defeated. The Bill will  remain  on  the

Order Book until such `me as the Minister, if he so

desires, wishes to replace it on the Order Paper.

<div align="center"><b>INHERITANCE (FAMILY PROVISION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to introduce into Singapore

the  provisions of the English Inheritance  (Family

Provision)  Act of 1938. As this Bill  will  change

the  existing law and will affect the  right  of  a

person to will away his property as he likes, it is

proposed to refer it to a Select Committee so  that

full consideration can be given to its provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the former English law did provide for family

provision  in giving the wife a right to dower,  by

virtue  of  which if the wife survived her  husband

she  became  entitled to an estate for  life  in  a

third  of all her husband's freeholds of which  she

has been seized at any time during the marriage. As

this  right  to the wife attached even  though  the

husband alienated the land, it gave rise to a great

deal  of practical inconvenience and was eventually

abolished  by  the  Dower Act of 1833.  After  that

there  was  nothing to stop a man (or a woman  with

respect  to  her separate property), from  devising

and bequeathing his whole estate to charity or to a

complete   stranger  and  leaving  his  widow   and

children  penniless. It was to  prevent  this  evil

that the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act of 1938

was enacted. The Act did not cast upon the testator

any  positive duty to make reasonable provision for

his  dependants,  for  it would  be  impossible  to

impose any such obligation, but it provides that if

he  fails  to  do  so  the  Court  may  order  such

reasonable  provision as it thinks fit to  be  made

out of the estate for his dependants as defined  in

the  Act.  The Act was further amended in  1952  to

extend  it  to cases of intestacy, as it  was  felt

that  the general laws of intestacy might  leave  a

child  inadequately  provided for.  The  provisions

relating to family provisions appear to have worked

well  in  England and it is proposed  to  introduce

them into Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim Law contains provisions to

safeguard  the position of widows and  children  in

cases  of  intestacy. As there is already  existing

provision  in section 41 of the Muslims  Ordinance,

1957,  to  enable the court to vary the will  of  a

Muslim testator to make provision for his heirs, it

is   therefore  not  pro, posed  to   extend   the

legislation to Muslims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been considered by the Singapore Bar

Committee and has been agreed to by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first

measure, to my knowledge, that this Government  has

introduced  in  deference to Opposition  sentiment,

and I would like to say that I welcome it and I  am

particularly   pleased  that  the   Government   is

conscious of the impact that this will have on  our

people  for  generations  to  come,  and  the  need

therefore to refer it to a Select Committee. It  is

my  earnest hope that public-spirited citizens  and

organisations  will  be  made  conscious   of   the

importance of this measure, will seek to  study  it

and  will  make representations. It is an important

Bill  to  meet a social evil whereby  a  man  could

deprive,  by his will, his dependants from adequate

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I welcome the Bill, I am frankly dubious as

to certain aspects and the way they might work out,

and  I  am,  as  I  have said,  glad  that  further

consideration  in Committee will be given  to  this

Bill  and, I hope, given to it in a completely non-partisan spirit.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, first I want to echo what the Member for Anson

has  said about organisations and woman leaders  in

Singapore being made conscious of the importance of

this  Bill,  and  I hope the Government  will  also

invite  them  to  express their  views  before  the

Select   Committee  as  they  did  on  the  Women's

Charter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that I would like to remind

the Government that when the Member for Anson and I

brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



up  the  question  in connection with  inheritance,

that  when  a man dies intestate his wife  inherits

only  a  portion of the property, whereas when  the

wife  dies intestate the husband inherits  all  her

property,  the  Government did promise  to  put  it

right. I hope this will be remembered during Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other promise was that when a man dies

intestate  and without children, the wife  inherits

half  and  the  other half goes to the  State.  The

Government also said it would do something about it

when  they do introduce a new Inheritance  Bill  to

see  that justice is done to women. So I would just

like to remind the Government of their two promises

and  I  also hope that women organisations will  be

given a chance to air their views.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome this Bill

but  there are certain aspects of it which are,  in

fact,  troubling me, and on which I had  wished  to

speak  this  afternoon. But looking  at  the  Order

Paper,  I  found that the Government  is  going  to

refer  it  to Select Committee and so  I  will  not

raise the point this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the Bar Committee has cleared it, but there are certain legal aspects of the Bill which are, in fact, troubling me, and I do hope that when the Bill is referred to Select Committee, the Bar Committee will be invited to come and answer certain questions which could arise on this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I just give some guidance?

If  the Member for Farrer Park wishes to touch upon

certain  aspects of the Bill in order to guide  the

Select   Committee,  then  I  think  this  is   the

appropriate moment, because we cannot presume  that

the Member for Farrer Park will be nominated to the

Select Committee. Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, there are one or two points which,

with your permission, I wish to touch upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clause 3 of the Bill - that is the important

clause  of  the Bill. The Bill deals with  the  net

estate, the net estate being the estate less  debts

and funeral



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



and testamentary expenses and estate duty as on the

date  of  death  of the deceased person.  Now,  the

intention  of the Bill is, in so far as the  family

is  concerned, to protect the husband or  the  wife

and  the  children. There is nothing  in  the  Bill

which will preclude a person from assigning all his

property away to somebody before his death. If  the

intention  of the Bill is social, and it wishes  to

protect the wife and child, that position could  be

defeated, it seems to me, under this Bill by a  man

assigning  his  property away two days  before  his

death,  because the property which is  affected  by

this  Bill  is the net estate on the  date  of  his

death. That is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point could be this. A husband during

his lifetime might have made adequate provision for

his  wife and children and die intestate, but under

the provision of clause 3, it would appear that  .a

further  provision would become necessary  for  the

wife and the children. This is the second point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point which readily occurs to my mind is

a  daughter who has not been married or who  is  by

reason   of  some  mental  or  physical  disability

incapable of maintaining herself. Supposing such  a

daughter is married and dies with her husband, what

then is the position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are what strike me as being some of the

matters  which could arise if the Bill were  passed

in its present form. I may be wrong, Sir, but these

are  matters which readily arise to my mind at  the

moment.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation  that this Bill be  proceeded  with.

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the

Central  Provident  Fund  Ordinance  so  that   the

Central  Provident Fund Board may not be restricted

in  declaring a higher rate of interest than 2« per

cent  per  annum to contributions of the  Fund.  At

present,  the Board is precluded from  declaring  a

higher  interest than 2½ per cent per annum  unless

the  assets  of the Board at current  market  value

exceed  its  liabilities  by  ten  per  cent.  This

amendment  of the Central Provident Fund  Ordinance

is  in  line with what has been introduced  in  the

Employees  Provident Fund (Amendment  No.  2)  Act,

1960  of  the Federation of Malaya which came  into

force  on 31st December, 1960. The Board  is  in  a

financial  position to declare  a  higher  rate  of

interest  than  2½  per  cent  per  annum,  as  the

redemption value of the Board's investments is very

much more than its liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Central Provident Fund

Ordinance    have    been   introduced    on    the

recommendation of the Central Provident Fund  Board

from  the  experience gained in  administering  the

Ordinance  since it came into force  on  1st  July,

1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I will be moving that this Bill be committed to

a  Select  Committee after its  Second  Reading,  I

shall  only  touch briefly on the  other  important

amendments  which this Bill seeks to  make  to  the

Central Provident Fund Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 introduces a definition of the word

"employed" and modifies the existing definitions of

the words "employee" and "employer" in section 2 of

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the amendments read in conjunction

with clause 9 are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to extend the benefits of the Ordinance to

certain  classes of workers who at present  because

of  their  conditions of employment do not  benefit

from the provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to make the principal employer who may not be

the immediate employer of an employee liable to pay

contributions under the Ordinance, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to limit the application of the Ordinance in

the  case of seamen to Singapore citizens only, and

to  anticipate  the  possibility  that  it  may  be

desirous  to exempt owners of vessels  who  do  not

have  a  place  of business in Singapore  from  the

provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also introduces a new definition of

"wages"  as  the existing definition  is  extremely

cumbersome   and   has  led  to   difficulties   in

interpretation.  The  proposed  amendment   defines

"wages" simply as remuneration in money due  `to  a

person in respect of his employment as an employee.

The  effect of the amendment is, however,  modified

by  paragraph (g)  of clause 5 which provides  that,

for   the   purpose  of  calculating  contributions

payable  in  accordance with the  Schedule  of  the

Ordinance,  any casual overtime earned by  a  time-rated employee in regular employment over and above

his usual earnings may be disregarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of employees who are not paid by time

or who are not in regular employment, contributions

to the Fund will be based on the total remuneration

in money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 4 of the

Ordinance  to  empower an inspector to  examine  or

summon  for  examination an employer  in  the  same

manner   as  an  employee  in  regard  to   matters

connected   with   the  Ordinance.   The   existing

Ordinance  limits  the power  of  an  inspector  to

examine only an employee and not an employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill also provides that the

members  of  the Board and its employees  shall  be

deemed to be public servants within the meaning  of

the  Penal  Code. This amendment follows  what  has

been  introduced in regard to members and employees

of  other Boards such as the Public Utilities Board

and the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 6 of the

Ordinance whereby a higher rate of interest than 2½

per  cent  per annum on contributions to  the  Fund

could  be declared by the Board on approval of  the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present provision prevents the Board from

declaring  a  higher rate of interest than  2½  per

cent per annum because the Board's assets valued at

current market value exceed its liabilities by  ten

per cent. This provision is considered to be unduly

restrictive.  The Board is in a financial  position

at  present to justify the payment of a higher rate

of  interest  of more than 2½ per cent  per  annum.

This clause also amends subsection (4)  of section 6

of    the   Ordinance   to   clarify   Government's

liabilities  in respect of the Fund as the  meaning

of   the  existing  subsection  (4)   is  considered

obscure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 (a) of the Bill amends section 7 of the

Ordinance   by  removing  the  provision  requiring

employees to work for an employer continuously  for

one  month before contributions become payable  for

them. This amendment, read in conjunction with  the

amendment  to  the Schedule of the Ordinance,  will

make it necessary for contributions to be made  for

all  employees who earn more than $20 from the date

of employment and not after one month of employment

as at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 (d) amends section 7 of the Ordinance to

enable employers and employees to contribute excess

contributions to the Fund at any time and not  only

at regular monthly payments as at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 (g) introduces a subsection (6) to

replace  the  existing  subsection  (7) .  The   new

subsection  specifies  more  clearly  the  way  the

amount  of  wages for a calendar  month  is  to  be

determined in the case of employees whose wages are

paid  at  intervals  of longer than  a  month.  The

proviso   to   the  new  subsection  modifies   the

amendment  to the definition of "wages"  which  has

already been explained in clause 2 above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 10 of the Ordinance to

remove the provision under which employees over the

age  of 55 may become members of the Fund by giving

notice  to the Board within one month of the coming

into force of the Ordinance that they desire to  be

members of the Fund. As the Ordinance has now  been

in force for over seven years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



there is no longer any need for this provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill deletes section 23 which

being  transitional  is  no  longer  required.   It

introduces a new section which will enable money to

be  transferred to the Fund from private  provident

funds.  This  is considered necessary because  many

private  provident funds make provisions  in  their

rules  for such transfers to be made, but there  is

at  present no provision in the Ordinance  enabling

the transfers to be accepted by the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill repeals section 24 of the

Ordinance   in   regard   to   return   of   excess

contributions   and  inserts  in  its   place   the

provisions of Rule 15 of the Central Provident Fund

Rules.  This  new section will give  power  to  the

Board to retain certain monies paid in error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 25 of the

Ordinance   to   enable  the   Minister   to   make

regulations to extend the benefits of the Ordinance

to   workers  whose  terms  of  employment  do  not

constitute  a contract of service or apprenticeship

and to provide that when an employee is employed in

a   specified  employment  under  the  control   or

management  of a principal employer or  is  engaged

and  paid  by a supplier of labour, such  principal

employer or supplier of labour shall be treated  as

employer  of  the  employee  and  liable   to   pay

contributions  for  him under the  Ordinance,  even

though  the employee may have an immediate employer

directly  in control of him. This clause  has  been

introduced in order that certain classes of  casual

employees  who at present do not have contributions

made for them are benefited by the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill amends the Schedule to the

Ordinance by increasing the maximum amount of wages

in  respect of which contributions are not  payable

from  $10  to  $200.  The amendment  is  considered

necessary  as  a  result of the  amendment  whereby

contributions for an employee become liable as soon

as he commences employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise

a  point  which  I  feel that the Select  Committee

should pay attention to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought up this point at the last sitting and

the Minister for Finance did not quite catch it.  I

thought then that the women were trying to get  the

best  of  both worlds, but later on, in the  C.P.A.

Room,  when  I  explained it to  him,  he  actually

thought that there was gross injustice there and he

promised that something would be done about  it  to

remedy the situation. I did bring out the fact that

it  is  very  dubious whether a  married  woman  in

Government service after 15 years is pensionable or

not,  as  this may not apply to future  generations

and  future employees. But there are a great number

of  married  women who were in the  service  before

parity or equal pay was given to women, and who are

still  in  the service, and this affects them,  and

their  position is dubious. After they have  served

for  15 years and they retire, they will get three-quarters  of their pension and they will  therefore

not  be eligible for provident fund. But they  will

have to wait till they are 55 years old to withdraw

whatever money they have put in. On retirement, not

only  will  they have to wait for their money,  but

whatever gratuity or money they get from Government

has  to be used to pay back what Government has put

into  their  provident  fund.  Therefore,  such   a

married  woman  is penalised, once, for  having  to

subscribe  to the provident fund when  she  is  not

entitled  to  draw  out her money  later  on,  and,

secondly, to pay Government's share, and then  wait

till  several years more - she retires at 45 and  she

has to wait till she is 55 - to draw out not only her

money,  but also the money she has to pay on behalf

of the Government. As the Minister for Finance felt

that  it  was  grossly  unfair,  would  the  Select

Committee look into it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for

the transfer of responsibility for the provision of

parking  places, which is now vested in the Highway

Authority,   to   the  Minister  upon   the   final

integration of the Local Government Authority  with

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Chapter 227),

the  responsibility  for the provision  of  parking

places is vested in the Highway Authority which is,

by  definition, the City Council within the  limits

of  the City, and' the Chairman of the Rural  Board

within  the Rural Board area. However, as  soon  as

the Local Government Integration Bill - which is now

before  the  Select  Committee - becomes  law,   the

integration  process will be completed.  The  Local

Authority, which at present constitutes the Highway

Authority for the purpose of the `the Road  Traffic

Ordinance,  will  go  out  of  existence  and   the

Minister will have to assume these functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already provided in section 63 of the new

Road  Traffic Ordinance (No. 26 of 1961)  that  the

Minister shall provide parking spaces for vehicles,

and  not the Highway Authority as in section 64  of

the  Road Traffic Ordinance (Chapter 227). With the

coming  of  merger, road transport  will  become  a

Federal subject, and the administration of the  new

Road  Traffic Ordinance will come under the Federal

Government of Malaysia. It is, therefore, desirable

that separate legislation should be prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



to enable the Minister to assume the responsibility

for  parking  places which is essentially  a  local

government function.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill re-enacts substantially section

63 of the new Road Traffic Ordinance, 1961, and the

only  new  provision is in clause 8 which  provides

for revenue collected from the operation of the car

parking  scheme  to be paid into  the  Consolidated

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to provide for a

separate and more effective control of broadcasting

and   television  services,  such  control  to   be

maintained by the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the statutory authority for levying

broadcast   listening  station  licence   fees   is

embodied in the Telegraphs Ordinance (Chapter 108).

This  Ordinance is administered by the Deputy Prime

Minister's Office mainly in connection with matters

pertaining      to      telecommunications.      As

telecommunications will be a Federal subject  after

merger,  so will the Telegraphs Ordinance become  a

Federal Ordinance. However, it has been agreed that

radio licence fees are an item of State revenue. As

such,  it  is only proper to divorce the  statutory

authority  for  collecting  such  fees   from   the

Telegraphs Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also decided to transfer the responsibility

of  enforcing radio licensing, hitherto carried  on

by  the  Broadcasting Division of the  Ministry  of

Culture,  to the Inland Revenue Department,  since,

with the extension of broadcasting services and the

introduction   of   television,  the   Broadcasting

Division  has  found it more and more difficult  to

devote  its  time to look after the enforcement  of

licensing. Nevertheless, it has become more  urgent

to  tighten the control and to curb the evasion  of

licence fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill to which the statutory authority

will  be  transferred is based on  Part  V  of  the

Telegraphs Ordinance, which deals with the  control

of wireless telegraphy generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will continue to confer on the Government

the   exclusive   privilege  of  establishing   any

broadcasting station and of installing  or  working

any  apparatus  for the purpose of transmitting  or

receiving broadcasting matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of licensing is to be

maintained  and  those establishing a  broadcasting

station  or installing, or working any broadcasting

apparatus without a licence will be punished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the day-to-day administration, the

Minister is empowered to delegate his powers  under

the new Ordinance, except that of making subsidiary

legislation. He is also empowered to authorise  the

refund  of any licence fees out of the Consolidated

Fund  and  to exempt any person from the provisions

of  the  Ordinance  or  of any  related  subsidiary

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing law - section 38 (2) of the

Telegraphs Ordinance - a search can only be made  by

a  police  officer  who has been granted  a  search

warrant  by  a magistrate in order that  preventive

action  can be carried out more promptly  and  more

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the present Bill empowers the

officers,  who  have been duly  authorised  by  the

Minister  and who have reasonable cause to  believe

that  an offence has been or is being committed  in

any broadcasting station or other places, to make a

search of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



station  or other places. Again, the provisions  of

the  existing  Radio Communication Regulations  can

only  be enforced through a prosecution and threat

of prosecution. However, the temptation to evade is

strong,  particularly  with  owners  of  the  cheap

transistor sets which cost as little as $20 per set

and  are  easy to conceal. Radio dealers have  been

ignoring    the   requirement   to    supply    the

Telecommunications  Department   with   names   and

addresses  of persons who have purchased new  radio

sets,  and  the only remedial action of  cancelling

the  dealers'  licences has been found  to  be  too

drastic a step to resort to in most cases.  In  the

circumstances, it is considered more expedient  and

expeditious  to  provide  for  the  compounding  of

offences, and such provisions are now made  in  the

clauses in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 95 of the Malaysia Bill which is attached

as  Annex  "A" to the Malaysia Agreement and  which

will  be presented to the Assembly on Friday,  26th

July,   states  that  Part  VIII  of  the   Federal

Constitution which deals with elections  shall  not

have  effect for the purpose of election of Members

of  the  House  of Representatives  from  Singapore

until  the  second general election to  that  House

held after Malaysia Day, and those Members shall be

elected as may be provided by any law passed by the

Legislature  of Singapore with the concurrence  of'

the  Yang di-Pertuan Agong, including any  laws  so

passed before Malaysia Day,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



and the period for which they are elected should be

the   period   until  the  second  dissolution   of

Parliament after Malaysia Day. Therefore, Singapore

elected  representatives to the Federal  Parliament

will,  under  normal circumstances,  represent  the

people   of  Singapore  in  the  first  and  second

Malaysian Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the preambles to the Singapore (Elections

to  the  Federal  House  of Representatives)  Bill,

1963,  states  that  it has  been  agreed  that  15

Members  of the House of Representatives should  be

elected  from Singapore in such manner  as  may  be

determined by the Legislature of Singapore with the

concurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Malaysia Bill lays down that

there  will  be  15 Members from Singapore  in  the

House of Representatives. There will, therefore, be

no  nomination of the 15 Members from  amongst  the

present Members of the Legislative Assembly.  There

will  be  elections  and those elected  will  serve

until  the  second dissolution of Parliament  after

Malaysia Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 95 (2) of the Malaysia Bill also provides

that  the  delimitation  of constituencies  by  the

Elections  Commission will not apply to  the  first

elections    of   Members   of   the    House    of

Representatives  from Singapore. This  delimitation

of  constituencies  in connection  with  the  first

elections will be under the provisions of section 8

of  the  Singapore  Legislative Assembly  Elections

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides for the election of these 15 Members and proposes that the manner and procedure of these elections shall follow that of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance with the amendments and modifications as set out in the Schedule to the

Bill.  Provision  is  also  made  to  empower   the

Minister    to   make   further   amendments    and

modifications  to  the Rules and  Regulations  made

under  the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance  which  may  appear  necessary  for   the

purpose of elections under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 of the Bill provides that the Ordinance

shall come into operation on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



such a day as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara may  by

notification in the Gazette appoint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 provides that the elections should be

held at any time after the coming into operation of

this  Ordinance, as decided by the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 refers to the manner and procedure of the

elections which I have already mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that the Electoral Registers

prepared  under the Legislative Assembly  Elections

Ordinance  shall  be  conclusive  evidence   of   a

person's  entitlement to vote at the  elections  to

the  House of Representatives of the Federation  of

Malaysia. It also provides that where any electoral

divisions for the Federal elections consist of  two

or  more  electoral  divisions  for  the  Singapore

Legislative   Assembly  elections,  the   Electoral

Registers  in respect of the two or three electoral

divisions  for  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

elections  shall  together  be  deemed  to  be  the

electoral  division  for the Federal  elections.  A

further  provision  in  this  clause  makes  it  an

offence  for  any  person to vote  at  the  Federal

elections in Singapore under this Bill if he is not

entitled  to  vote under the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly  Elections Ordinance. A  person  can  vote

only  in  the  electoral division in  which  he  is

registered   as  an  elector.  As  I  have   stated

previously,  the  manner  and  procedure   of   the

elections   shall  follow  that  of  the  Singapore

Legislative   Assembly  Elections  Ordinance   with

amendments  and  modifications as set  out  in  the

Schedule to the Bill. In the Schedule to the  Bill,

a  number of amendments and modifications contained

in   the  Schedule  are  consequential  changes  to

definitions arising from the elections taking place

to  the  House of Representatives of the Federation

of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other amendments of which

note should be taken. One of the amendments set out

to  the Schedule is the modification to section  47

(4)  of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance   which  provides  for  the  mixing   and

counting of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



ballot   papers  contained  in  the  ballot   boxes

relating  to a Federal electoral division  or  such

part  as the Returning Officer considers expedient.

This  provision enabling the Returning  Officer  to

count  any part of the ballot papers of the Federal

electoral   division  separately  would   make   it

possible  for  him to count separately  the  ballot

papers   for  the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly

electoral  divisions which are grouped together  to

form  part  of the Federal division, although  when

the  result is declared only the total figures  for

the  electoral  division will be  announced.  Under

this  arrangement, candidates will be able to  know

how  each  component Singapore Legislative Assembly

electoral   division  forming  part  of   the   new

electoral  division voted. As the House is  already

aware,  the Government's intention is to group  the 51   Singapore   Legislative   Assembly   electoral

divisions into groups of threes and fours  to  form

each new Federal division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment to section 65 (1) provides for

the increase in election expenses from $6,000 or 50

cents  per  elector, whichever is  the  larger,  as

provided  in  the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance, to $12,000 or  50  cents  per

elector,  whichever is the larger. The increase  in

the   expenses  is  due  to  the  increase  in  the

electorate for the Federal electoral divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made in the amendments and

modifications to section 73A for the  inclusion  of

increased powers of search by the police  where  it

is  expected that canvassing is being conducted  by

any person on polling day. Where a person enters or

is  seen at more than two houses or places of  work

of electors in the same polling district other than

his  own house or place of work on polling day,  he

is   presumed  to  have  committed  an  offence  of

canvassing, unless the contrary is proved  by  him.

These  provisions  were included  in  the  National

Referendum Ordinance and it is considered desirable

to include them in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further provision taken from the National

Referendum  Ordinance  is  in  respect  of  persons

debarred  from taking part in election  activities.

Under this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



provision,  it  is an offence for  any  person  who

attends  a primary or secondary school as a student

or  a  person against whom an order has  been  made

under   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance or secret society activities to take part

in  election activities. This provision is included

in the Bill by way of modification to section 73c.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will note that modifications are made to

sections  57  (2)   and 73 (1) . These  two  sections

relate  to  the disqualifications of  persons  from

being  either registered as electors or Members  of

the  Legislative Assembly when convicted of corrupt

or  illegal  practices. While such persons  can  be

convicted  and  sentenced for  these  offences,  it

follows that any disqualifications arising  out  of

these  convictions  should be a  matter  under  the

Federal  law, since these elections are in  respect

of  membership  to the House of Representatives  of

the Federation of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the Schedule under this Bill, section

79   is   deleted,  because  it  refers   only   to

disqualifications  of  elected   Members   of   the

Legislative Assembly of the State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment to note is with regard to

section  94 (1)  which enables the Returning Officer

to  use  free  of charge as a polling  station  any

school or part thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the House is aware, I have already given notice of amendments to the Schedule. At the Committee stage, I shall give reasons in detail for these amendments, but at this stage, I need only mention that the amendments refer to the qualifications of persons to be elected as Members

of  the  House of Representatives of the Federation

of  Malaysia, the notification to be issued by  the

Minister specifying Federal electoral divisions  in

Singapore for purposes of elections to the House of

Representatives in the Federation of Malaysia,  and

provision    for   persons   conducting    election

activities   to   be  in  possession   of   written

authorities signed by candidates or their  election

agent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the time is drawing near when elections will be held for the first time in Singapore for the people to choose their 15 representatives to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



House  of  Representatives  in  the  Federation  of

Malaysia,  and  it  is  very important  that  these

elections  are carried out in a smooth,  effective,

impartial and efficient manner. This Bill seeks  to

achieve  that objective by adopting, in  the  main,

with  a  few modifications, the provisions  of  the

time-tested  machinery and procedure laid  down  in

the   Singapore   Legislative  Assembly   Elections

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

oppose the Bill, and my reasons are -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Obvious.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> One, we have not yet debated the

Prime  Minister's motion on the Malaysia  Agreement - item  10  on the Order Paper. Until this has  been

adopted - if  it  is  adopted -  the  question  of  the

manner of electing 15 Members to the Federal  House

of  Representatives does not arise. The  Government

should  have arranged the order of business in  its

proper  sequence, and the Second  Reading  of  this

Bill  should  rightly come after item 10  has  been

disposed  of.  The  Opposition  would  then  be  in

possession  of  the  documents  relating   to   the

Malaysia  Agreement, and it would be  in  a  better

position  to debate this Bill in the light  of  the

disclosures   that   can  be  gleaned   from   such

documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, the second paragraph of the Preamble to the

Bill reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`AND WHEREAS it has been agreed that fifteen

members  of the House of Representatives should  be

elected  from Singapore in such manner  as  may  be

determined by the Legislature of Singapore with the

concurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong:'



<br><br>I repeat, Sir, "with the concurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong". I am not a lawyer, Sir, but  it  is

my  humble view that until after Malaysia Day, that

is  the  31st of August, His Majesty the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  has  no constitutional  sovereignty

over  Singapore, and I respectfully submit that  he

has  therefore  no constitutional  jurisdiction  to

concur. I do not say that I am right, but this is a

matter for constitutional experts to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



advise.  I  cannot  help but recall  the  mess  the

Government  was  in over the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill. And

because of this glaring example of the Government's

lack of consultation of legal opinion, I would  ask

the  Government to inform the House whether it  has

received  advice  as  to  whether  or  not  it   is

constitutionally right for His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong to concur with the laws of Singapore

before Malaysia Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that a Certificate of Urgency

has  been introduced for the Second Reading of this

Bill.    This   is   indeed   very   strange    and

unprecedented.  The  Second Reading  of  any  Bill,

unless  introduced  on  a Certificate  of  Urgency,

takes its normal course under Standing Orders,  and

under  Standing Order 71 (3)  (a), "... no amendment

shall  be  proposed unless two clear  days'  notice

thereof  has  been  given."  The  Government   have

already  given  notice of certain amendments  which

they  propose to move. On a Certificate of Urgency,

however,  no notice need be given of any amendment,

and  the  fact that the Government has  taken  this

unprecedented step is an indication to us that some

surprise  amendments  are in their  bag  of  tricks

which they may pull out, depending on the trend  of

the debate on the Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, under Standing Order 81, because of

the  introduction of a Certificate of Urgency,  the

Opposition  is deprived of any move  to  refer  the

Bill to a Select Committee. I charge the Government

for   wanting  to  play  out  the  Opposition   and

therefore  the interests of the people.  Otherwise,

such  a Certificate of Urgency for a Second Reading

is  not  necessary  as the Government  has  already

given  notice  of  certain  amendments  which   the

Minister  proposes  to  move during  the  Committee

stage of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his speech just now has said

that  it is only after the first elections  to  the

Federal  Parliament  that the statutory  autonomous

Elections  Commission in Kuala Lumpur will  operate

in Singapore. This shows us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



how  important  it  is that the Malaysia  Agreement

should  have been in our hands. Then we' will  know

what it is all about. As it is, are we to trust the

words  of the Minister when he says that such  are

the  facts? There have been many instances  of  the

P.A.P.  Government trying to prove  that  white  is

black and then prove that black is white -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Please name them.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - until the Prime Minister was

red  in  the  face. They have done it. If  this  is

true,  it  is  just unfortunate that the  statutory

autonomous  Elections Commission will  not  operate

until  after  the second elections to  the  Federal

Parliament  - if what the Minister says is  correct.

And  now the elections that will be held under this

Bill  will  be  under the control  of  an  Election

Office  squeezed  like anything by the  Government.

But   the   debate  on  the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill  has

disclosed - it is left to the Government to deny the

disgraceful interference of the Government with the

working of the Elections Office -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - in carrying out the duties

imposed  on the Registration Officer by section  15

of  the  Singapore  Legislative Assembly  Elections

Ordinance. The Minister for Law says nonsense,  but

under  section 15 of this Ordinance, if  there  had

been  no  interference by the Executive Government,

the  Registration Officer would have easily carried

on with the registration and carried out his duties

as  demanded by the law. But no, the P.A.P. wanted

to   play  the  referendum  game.  Therefore,   the

Registration Officer was told, "Wait a  minute.  We

say  stop, you stop. We say go ahead, you go ahead.

If  you behave well, maybe we will give you a medal

after  that."  That  is what the  P.A.P. is  doing

always.  Added to this, Sir, is the unholy haste  - as  evidenced by the introduction of a  Certificate

of  Urgency on a Second Reading - of the Government

to  hold  elections for the 15 Members to represent

Singapore in the Federal House of Representatives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have ample instances of the Government

indulging   in   practices  which  are   apparently

undemocratic and dictatorial.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Apparently.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I use the word "apparently",

Sir, because although I did not have a Minister for

Culture  with me when I was the Chief  Minister,  I

would  like to be at least more cultured  than  the

Ministers of the Front Bench who, in spite of their

Minister for Culture, cannot be cultured at all.  I

use  the word "apparently", but it would seem  that

it  hurts the Minister for Culture more than if you

were to say it is a fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What are you trying to say?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is apparently

undemocratic and dictatorial. They can deny  it.  I

use  the word "apparently". Why is there a move  to

deprive  Mr  Markandu  of  his  citizenship,  just

because  he said, "I will fight the Prime  Minister

for  his  interference with the fight of my  union,

with  the  industrial  activity  of  my  particular

union."? And what is more shocking to us,  Sir,  is

that  the  Prime Minister himself on television,  I

think   it  was - he  likes  to  see  his   face   on

television, said, "Oh, Mr Markandu, I  know,  man,

you  are no Communist." "But why do you deprive  me

of  my  citizenship if I am not a Communist?",  Mr

Markandu  asked. This is what the P.A.P. does.  Is

this not dictatorial?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another one. Suddenly with all the fun

that  they had in the Harbour Board, gates  closed;

10,000  workers  not allowed to go out  for  lunch,

listening to the Prime Minister, "Eh, I am going to

give  you an award." And then after that, he  said,

"Oh,  I trust the good sense of the workers of  the

Harbour  Board."  What happens now?  Deregistration

is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering whether the

Member  for Cairnhill can bring his remarks  within

the ambit of the Bill we are discussing.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am pointing

out where we cannot trust the Government. These are

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



instances  that the Government have  given  to  the

public  and  to that extent we cannot  trust  them.

They  are always doing undemocratic and dictatorial

things and what better instances than the instances

that  only occurred the night before. Can we  trust

them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they de-registered this Union just because it

refused to bow to the blandishments and threats  of

the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must stop the Member for

Cairnhill because he is going too much into detail.

He can just mention these things in passing, but he

is going too much into detail.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Sir. That happens to

be   the  last  sentence  and  the  most  important

sentence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> An election speech.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister for Culture

says  that it is an election speech. I do not  know

what  the  Prime  Minister  does  going  round  the

constituencies kissing babies. Oh, not election  at

all!   The  Prime  Minister,  the  great  hero   of

Singapore seeing the people of Singapore! But  when

we  say  something here, it is an election  speech.

Never  mind, if the P.A.P. want elections, if  they

will just go for general elections tomorrow -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We may.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> God help you then.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is strange, Sir, that the

Minister for Law should call on God now when he had

denied  God when he became a Minister in 1959!  May

God look after them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I denied God, in what way?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, when we add all these

together  and  bearing  in mind  the  acts  of  the

Government, we can justifiably say that we  do  not

trust the P.A.P. Government. We say that the P.A.P.

Government  by  this  Bill is attempting  to  force

Opposition  Parties  to  fight  the  elections   on

P.A.P.'s  dishonest  terms,  which  are  loaded  to

ensure a P.A.P. victory at the polls.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I thought you had mass support.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Up till today, Sir, we have not

yet  received  copies  of the  Malaysia  Agreement,

although it has been officially released in  London

and the British Parliament has already approved the

Agreement  reached  in London. The  fact  that  the

Government is attempting to give as little time  as

possible   to   the   Opposition   to   study   the

implications  of the Malaysia Agreement  signed  in

London  shows that there may be something  for  the

Government to hide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> For how long?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We want to know the terms of the

Agreement reached in London. The Minister has  just

told   us,  "Yes,  the  terms  are,  we  will  have

elections  for  the  first time and  the  Singapore

Government  is free to hold elections  until  after

the  dissolution of the second Federal Parliament."

This is what the Minister said. But he did not  say

that  whoever gets elected now under this  proposed

law,  will remain until after the general elections

to  the second Federal House of Representatives. It

is not here. And we do not trust the P.A.P. because

if  the  P.A.P. just get one man in -  "All  right,

election  overnight." If they get twenty men  in  - "Tidak apa lah, go to Kuala Lumpur and say, can  we

make it three terms instead of two terms?" That  is

what  the P.A.P. are good for - twist and turn,  and

cheat  as much as possible. They would not say  it,

but  now  they  say, "How long? It is  not  in  the

Bill."  We do not trust the P.A.P., when it is  not

in the Bill. [Interruption] Sir, the Minister keeps

on saying that this is what has been written in the

White  Paper. Why not give us the White  Paper?  We

have  enough  evidence, and we do not  believe  the

word  of  the  P.A.P. until we receive  documentary

proof. We remember the Prime Minister when he  came

back  as  a  great hero saying, "Ah, we  give  them

loans. It has been agreed that Singapore will  send

50  per cent of workmen to the Borneo territories."

Straightaway  there  was  a  denial  by  the  Chief

Minister Designate of Sabah, saying, "There has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



been  no  such agreement." And what did  the  Prime

Minister say? "Ah, semua (everything) is written at

the  back of an envelope." My God, the fate of  the

people of Singapore at the back of an envelope! Now

we  ask where is the Malaysia Agreement? We want to

see  the  terms agreed upon for this representation

to the Central Parliament. We have not seen it, but

the  Minister  for Home Affairs says, "Until  after

the  second Federal Parliament." We do not  believe

it.  Or is the Minister now going to say, like  his

great  Prime Minister, "Oh, all that is written  on

an  envelope." He can say it if he likes. We do not

know  all these things other than what the Minister

for  Home Affairs feels that he should let us know.

Why  can  he  not  give us the  Malaysia  Agreement

documents and defer the Second Reading until  after

the  debate  on  the  Malaysia Agreement  has  been

disposed  of?  Oh no, P.A.P. style,  run  down  the

Opposition as much as you can!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sinister motive behind this is apparent

to  us.  Why  is the Government so anxious  and  so

desperate  to hold these elections to  the  Federal

House   of   Representatives  when  it   has   most

dictatorially withheld the by-election in Sembawang

for  one  year?  God  rest the soul  of  Ahmad  bin

Ibrahim  -  a good man. The Sembawang seat  is  the

most vital as the strength in this Assembly of  the

Government  and  the Opposition is evenly  divided.

The  success  or defeat of the P.A.P. candidate  in

the  Sembawang  by-election will  mean  either  the

right  of  the  P.A.P. Government  to  continue  in

office  or that it has no moral right to  cling  to

office.   Why   has  the  Government   conveniently

withheld this vital by-election for a year, and  is

now  so anxious and desperate to hold elections  to

the Federal House of Representatives, the result of

which  will  not  mean the fall of  the  Government

should  the  P.A.P. fail to get  the  majority  of

seats? The motive is clear. The P.A.P. are adopting

these  tactics to test the market. Are  the  P.A.P.

popular with the people -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Find out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Or are the P.A.P. a dead duck?

If   they   win   in  this  election,   they   will

straightaway have the Assembly dissolved  and  call

for  general  elections. If they  lose,  then  they

still  have  many  months  left  to  rectify  their

mistakes.  They can make full use of the radio  and

television  and indulge in a number of undemocratic

acts   and  political  corruption  in  a  desperate

attempt  to  bluff the people once again,  so  that

when  general elections take place next year,  when

the life of this Government comes to a natural end,

they hope to be able to recoup their losses. And to

play this game to suit their own selfish ends, they

are  prepared to make the public pay about $400,000

to  meet  the  cost of holding these elections.  We

strongly  oppose  the use of  public  funds  for  a

purpose  to suit the selfish ends of the  Party  in

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, Sir, are the grounds on which we oppose the

Bill. I know that P.A.P. top propagandists, trained

in  the same camp with ex-comrades and ex-Political

Secretaries who are now under detention and branded

by  the  Government as Communists, Communist  front

leaders  and  Communist  stooges,  will  twist  and

distort  our  stand by saying that the Alliance  is

afraid  to meet the P.A.P. in an election.  Let  me

tell  them  straight to their faces,  the  Alliance

will meet the P.A.P. at the polls any time -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -anywhere and anyhow. What I have

said is aimed at exposing the P.A.P. which has been

up  to  tricks  for far too long.  The  P.A.P. has

already  made full and complete plans  to  win  the

elections by hook or by crook. Their candidates are

ready.   They  have  been  grooming  the  Political

Secretaries  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  to  the

Minister for Culture, Mr Jek Yuen Thong and  Inche

Rahim  Ishak, and these two men will definitely  be

put up as P.A.P. candidates. They have been groomed

out of public funds and are valuable sycophants  of

Emperor Lee - "our beloved Prime Minister,"  so  say

banners  put  up by the P.A.P. We do  not  say  it;

P.A.P. banners put it up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has been conducting an

election  campaign for the P.A.P. for  some  months

now   at  the  expense  of  the  public,  and   the

delineation of the electoral divisions  is  already

known  to  the P.A.P. for some time. The P.A.P. is

ready  and  well prepared and will not hesitate  to

take unfair and unjust advantage over its political

opponents  who  will  have to fight  the  elections

against great odds imposed by P.A.P. trickery.  Did

the   Prime  Minister  not  say  to  City   Council

employees at that memorable meeting, "I can fix you

but  you  can't fix me!"? Sure, the Government  can

fix  the  Opposition but the Opposition cannot  out

the   Alliance,   I   mean,   can   knock   out   - [Interruption]  I  like that  remark,  that  is  my

phrase, Sir,I would like to say that because -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are groggy.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, they have some sense of

humour  left in them. But the Alliance  will  knock

out  the  P.A.P. if they but dare come  out  for  a

general election tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And be voted out.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If they but dare. But the P.A.P.

dare not. The P.A.P. wants to test the market first

through  these elections to the Federal Parliament,

and  then do a little bit of juggling in the  State

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think we can defeat this Bill. Who

knows?  If  each and every Member in the Opposition

will  attend  and vote as one united force  - united

not in ideology or political beliefs but united  in

a  concerted  effort to teach this  arrogant,  this

dictatorial  Government  a  lesson  that  is   long

overdue -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification and on a

point  of information too, I would be much obliged.

Does  the  Member for Cairnhill call on  Opposition

Members  to  support him in his opposition  to  the

Bill?  Would  he indicate whether his Party  stands

for the principle of direct representation from the

people to the Federal Parliament?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim Lim Yew Hock: Sir, the Member for Anson has

not heard me out because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



I  leave the more important ones towards the end. I

can  assure  him  now  that  we  stand  for  direct

representation and we will fight the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We will not allow the P.A.P.

Government to make use of the election machinery to

suit their own political ends, and we do this as an

attempt  to expose them and they are exposed.  Sir,

as  I  have  said, if we can just be  united  in  a

concerted  effort  to  teach  this  arrogant,  this

dictatorial  Government  a  lesson  that  is   long

overdue,  then  the situation will change  for  the

better. Then there is hope that the Government  can

be   knocked  out  and  that  the  Opposition   can

overthrow the Government. Two Alliance Members  are

paired with the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Finance  because  they  are  in  Kuala  Lumpur   on

official business, but this pairing will not affect

the   voting  if  each  and  every  Member  in  the

Opposition will vote as one united force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of pairing, I now give notice to

the  Government that Alliance Members will  not  in

future  pair  with  any Government  Member  as  the

Government has not done the decent thing to arrange

a  pairing-off when the Member for Bras  Basah  was

indisposed  and could not attend the June  sittings

of the Assembly. I spoke about this on the 7th June

and  I  do  not  propose to quote from  Hansard  to

strengthen my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say I do not think we can defeat this Bill

but   we   still  may,  and  the  Government   will

definitely  go  ahead and hold these  elections  on

terms all loaded in their favour. Despite this  the

Alliance will field candidates to fight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his recent campaigning

and television broadcasts has stooped so low as  to

put  into  practice his training in  the  Communist

camp at character assassination. He has made use of

the  radio  and  television  to  say  a  number  of

personal  things about me. I did not care to  reply

and  retaliate on the same level as I cannot  bring

myself to sink to the depth that the Prime Minister

has fallen. I will, however, meet him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



in   the   elections  to  the  Federal   House   of

Representatives. I will not lay down conditions  of

delineation of the electoral divisions, but I  will

go  to his stronghold, Tanjong Pagar, and meet  him

there.  If, however, the Prime Minister feels  that

the  Federal  constituency  that  includes  Tanjong

Pagar  is  not safe for him, then I ask him  to  be

good  enough  to  give  me advance  notice  of  his

intentions  so that I can give him the pleasure  of

ascertaining from the voters in Tanjong  Pagar  and

other  contiguous  wards, or  in  any  constituency

chosen  by  the Prime Minister, whether  they  give

their confidence, their trust and their support  to

him  or  to  me. [Interruption] By this  Bill,  the

Government  should choose its own  ground  for  the

fight.  To them, it is a laughing matter.  Cheating

to them, Sir, is a laughing matter. I will meet the

Prime  Minister  on any ground  that  he  cares  to

choose,  and I am doing this not out of bravado.  I

am doing this because I am so sick of the political

dishonesty of the P.A.P. that I consider it my duty

to   try  and  rid  Singapore  of  this  menace  to

democracy and fair play.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say the people are fed up with the P.A.P.

and,  knowing  this,  the Government  is  therefore

afraid to face us in a general election. The proper

and decent thing for the Government to do, now that

it does not have the moral majority in the Assembly

to  continue  in office, is to hold the by-election

in  Sembawang  or  to hold general  elections.  The

Government has most dictatorially withheld the  by-election in Sembawang for one year, simply  because

the  P.A.P. knows that its fate will be sealed,  as

it  was in Hong Lim and Anson, but the P.A.P. keeps

on crowing that the Prime Minister is a great hero.

If  the  P.A.P. sincerely believes in  this  claim,

then let us have general elections soon instead  of

its  wanting desperately to hold elections  to  the

Federal  House of Representatives with the ulterior

motive  of  testing the pulse of the electorate  to

enable  the arrogant and dictatorial Government  to

plan  strategy  for the general elections.  Let  us

have general elections soon and then hold elections

to  the Federal House of Representatives later. The

P.A.P. dare not because it knows deep down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



in  its heart - if it has any heart at all - that the

people, if given the opportunity now to cast  their

votes  in  a  general election, will give  a  clear

verdict.  And  what will be their  verdict?  R.I.P.

P.A.P. May their wicked souls rest in peace!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not need to

go  over  some of the points which the  Member  for

Cairnhill  has already touched on. It is ridiculous

of  the  Government to ask us in the Opposition  to

discuss  something which we have not as  yet  seen.

The Minister talks of -[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what is the

purpose  of  the  Front Benches of  the  Government

interrupting unnecessarily. Perhaps we can  have  a

silent debate from now on. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He talks of section 95 of the

Malaysia  Agreement, he talks of Annex J. What  are

all  these things? What is section 95 and  what  is

Annex J or Alex Josey? [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time that we hear that

those   elected   will  serve  until   the   second

dissolution  of Parliament after Malaysia  Day.  In

other   words,  those  who  are  elected   in   the

forthcoming   15-seat  elections  to  the   Central

Parliament will serve six years and not five years.

Is  that  correct? Would the Minister confirm  this

right now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Could well be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It might well be. Therefore, it

is  for six years. Sir, the whole idea of this Bill

today  is to allow the Government a chance to  hold

snap  elections,  and, what is more  important,  to

allow  the Government to choose safe seats for  the

Government  Ministers   - of  course,  holding   snap

elections,  taking advantage of us is  nothing  new  -  the  only question is, why they are doing this  so

blatantly and openly, throwing away their  mask  of

democracy,   even  their  sense   of   fair   play,

everything?  They just throw aside  everything  and

now  in  their desperate situation they are holding

on  to  any  straw, hoping thereby  to  give  their

Ministers   a  chance  to  serve  in  the   Central

Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on what the Member for Cairnhill

has referred to. He has mentioned the fact that  in

the Preamble to the Bill it says that the manner of

elections to the House of Representatives must have

the concurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. I  do

not  want to refer to that again, but I would  like

to  refer to clause 2 which says that the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara can at any time hold elections, that

is,   at  any  time  the  P.A.P. decides  to  hold

elections. If you will notice carefully,  Sir,  all

the amendments which the Government has put forward

are  to  give the P.A.P. the chance to hold a  snap

election  in  order  to  place  Opposition  Parties

completely at a disadvantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 3 (2) it says that the Minister may at

any    time    make   adaptations,   modifications,

amendments to the forms in the First Schedule. This

must  be  linked with the new amendment in page  5,

line 6, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) No person shall conduct any election activity

unless  he  is in possession of a written authority

signed by a candidate or his election agent in  the

Form 22 (A) or the Form 22 (B), as the case may be,

in  the  First  Schedule to  this  Ordinance.  Such

authority ...'.



<br><br>Now, Sir, these are the important words - "shall  be

issued only on or after the day of nomination."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24 (2) of the Singapore Legislative

Assembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance

reads  - it  refers, first of all, to  the  writ  of

election being issued by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

and it follows in subsection (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every such writ shall be in the Form 1 in the

First  Schedule to this Ordinance and shall specify

the  date or dates hereinafter referred to  as  the

day  of  nomination not being less than 9 days  nor

more than one month after the date of the writ  and

the  place  or  places  of  nomination  hereinafter

referred to as the place of nomination.'



<br><br>In  other words, Sir, the day of writ to the day of

nomination, will take 9 days. But elections can  be

held  from the day of writ to the day of poll,  all

in  21 days. In fact, this period of 21 days can be

further  reduced  even to 18 or  19  days.  I  have

worked  in the Ministry of Home Affairs and I  know

exactly  what the minimum period for elections  can

be.  It means that within three weeks from the  day

of writ by the Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



Negara,  general elections can take  place  or  any

elections  can take place. If we take away  9  days

from  the  day  of writ to the day  of  nomination,

there  will  be only 10 days or 12 days  left,  and

within these 10 to 12 days, those who wish to  take

part  in elections  - Parties or candidates - will have

to  get their election agents; print their symbols;

look  for  places for election offices.  They  will

have to do all sorts of difficult things in a short

campaign  that will last only 10 days.  Of  course,

the   Government  will  thus  take  full  advantage - -unfair   advantage,  according  to  the   Alliance

Members - by playing out the Opposition according  to

the Member for Lim Yew Hock -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.

Member  for  Queenstown can locate the constituency

called "Lim Yew Hock".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Cairnhill. Sir,

the  Government taking advantage of the  Opposition

is  no surprise to us at all. But as I have already

mentioned,  the  wonder  of  it  is  that,  in  its

desperation,  it  is ready to take  off  completely

their mask and openly try to, legally again, as  in

the Referendum Ordinance, rig the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as everybody knows, the P.A.P. is making

use  of  the office of the Prime Minister to  allow

the  Secretary-General of the PAP, to  conduct  an

election campaign for the P.A.P. It has the use  of

the   radio,  television,  all  the  space  in  the

newspapers,  and everytime it talks of  the  P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- how good the P.A.P. is. But, of course, we can

come  to  debate  later on what the Prime  Minister

today  has been doing. Everybody knows that he  has

sold out the rights and interests of the people  of

Singapore.   The   P.A.P. has  also   denied   the

Opposition all opportunities of direct Contact with

the  masses.  For example, Sir, we in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  applied for a permit to hold a  rally  at

Pulau  Saigon two weeks ago. Last week  we  applied

for  a  permit to hold a rally in Bukit  Timah,  7½

milestone.  But on both occasions the  P.A.P. have

denied



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



us  the  right  of assembly. Not even a  registered

political Party has the right of assembly  and  the

right  of direct contact with the masses!  This  is

what  they mean when they talk of democracy  today.

When they give reasons, they say it is because they

do  not  have enough policemen to guard  the  Prime

Minister. The next time they change their  tune.  I

am  sure there will be more changing of tunes  very

soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the Government intends to do,

but  it  is  quite clear that the P.A.P. today  is

openly  intimidating not only  Assemblymen  in  the

Barisan. Sosialis but also all trade union leaders.

It  is taking away their citizenship and intimating

that  they might be put away, arrested. We are  not

afraid  of these bankrupt P.A.P. politicians trying

to cling on to straws in their last desperate gasp.

The  people's verdict will prove that it is a thing

which they cannot fight against. They may make  use

of  the  State power to hinder us in our work,  but

they  will  be struck off from the political  stage

anyway, anyhow, soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the amendment which the P.A.P. seeks,

namely,  to  allow them to amend, adapt and  modify

those  forms and regulations in the First Scheduler

the  P.A.P. seeks to allow Opposition Members start

the  election  campaign only after nomination  day.

The  P.A.P. hopes not only to take advantage of the

fact that they know already the electoral divisions

and  have everything prepared for the election  but

also  to  confuse and make more and more  difficult

for  Opposition Members and candidates to fight the

elections. For example, Sir, new rules  can  be  so

fixed  that even election agents may have to submit

ten   photographs  or  something   like   that   to

Government before they can become election  agents,

or  some such ridiculous things like this. But,  of

course, the main reason behind this Bill is for the

P.A.P. to get safe seats for P.A.P. Ministers.  You

will  remember,  Sir, in the referendum,  that  the

counting of votes was done in such a haphazard  way

that opposition counting agents were in no position

to  know what was really happening. Today with that

experience  in mind they are hoping to  repeat  the

same performance. They want to count the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



votes  of  the various divisions and know how  many

votes  there are for the P.A.P. in each  particular

division.  But the Opposition Members will  not  be

allowed to have such knowledge. The P.A.P. wants to

mix up all the ballot papers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> You will be allowed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and then, of course, nobody

will  really know except the P.A.P. The P.A.P. can

count  the number of votes in such a division,  and

then  the  Prime Minister will stand in a  division

that  is "safe". If not safe, then, of course,  the

second-rate  Back-benchers,  the  third-rate  Back-benchers  will stand in them. That is exactly  what

is  going to happen. The Back-benchers will have no

hope  of getting safe seats for themselves. If they

have  a chance of standing again, they will be just

starters.  Just starters! That is all.  Even  their

Front bench Ministers will also be starters anyway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Where do you start?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The start is, if at any time

they  tell  us where they want to go, we will  make

sure of sending suitable opponents to topple all of

them. I do not wish to waste the time of the House,

Sir,  but we must realise that the whole object  of

this present Bill and the amendments thereto are to

allow  the P.A.P. to seek an unfair advantage  over

the  Opposition Parties and to allow the P.A.P. to

seek safe seats for their Ministers.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I think we must

not  allow what the Member for Cairnhill  has  said

just  now  to go by. He unfortunately has a  little

obsession and he makes great pretence that he is  a

scholarly lawyer trying to interpret Ordinances  at

a  time  when even lawyers are very quiet.  He  has

mentioned  just now that this Bill makes  no  sense

because  it mentions in the Preamble that  "WHEREAS

it  has  been  agreed that fifteen members  of  the

House  of  Representatives should be  elected  from

Singapore  in  such manner as may be determined  by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



Legislature  of  Singapore with the concurrence  of

the Yang di-Pertuan Agong." Surely it will occur to

him  that  the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in this  sense

represents the Federation Government and that  this

Bill  is being introduced in this Legislature  with

the  agreement  of  the Federation  Government.  He

further  says that by moving the Second  and  Third

Readings  of this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency,

the  Opposition has no opportunity to  put  forward

amendments to this Bill. Members will remember that

this  Singapore (Elections to the Federal House  of

Representatives) Bill was introduced  at  the  last

sitting  of the Legislative Assembly, and  if  they

really  have  any  intention  or  desire  to   make

amendments  they  could have done so.  The  trouble

with  the  Opposition is that they have adopted  an

attitude  that  whatever  the  Government  does  is

always  wrong.  They showed this  attitude  only  a

little  while  ago.  When  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  expressed his willingness to withdraw  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions)    (Amendment)   Bill,   because    the

Opposition did not like it, they opposed  even  his

attempt  to withdraw. They did not like  the  Bill,

and yet they said to the Minister for Home Affairs,

"Thou shall not withdraw." It is just a lot of  hot

air  and dust that has been generated by the Member

for  Cairnhill  over this Bill. In reality,  as  he

must  admit, the Opposition is really reluctant  to

face  the people and allow the people to choose  15

representatives to the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us be quite honest about Opposition

attempts  to denigrate the Government and sneer  at

the  lack  of a majority on the Government benches.

They  had many times in the past an opportunity  to

outvote  the Government on any important issue.  If

we  had been defeated on any decisive Bill - on  the

Budget,  for  instance  - we  would  have   had   no

alternative  but  to resign. Now, the  Opposition's

reluctance to face the people, of course, is  quite

understandable.  If we go to elections  either  for

the  15 seats or for the 51 seats, the P.A.P. will

stand on its record of achievements during the last

four years. The S.P.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



can  only stand on the memories of the Lim Yew Hock

Government. The Barisan will stand on its record of

infamy  and betrayal. The U.P.P. will stand on  the

famous  Hong  Lim resolutions. Let me put  it  this

way. If the S.P.A. -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What S.P.A.? The Alliance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> If the Alliance wishes to form

a  united front with the Barisan Sosialis  and  the

others  - pro-Malaysia elements sleeping on the  same

bed  with  anti-Malaysia  elements   - and  seriously

consider that they must oppose this Bill, then,  of

course,  they avoid going to elections  on  the  15

seats -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You should resign.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But they cannot avoid elections

on the 51 seats -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is what we want.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And I would say to them that it

is  inevitable.  It is going to  happen  sooner  or

later -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Well, make it sooner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And it is the intention of the S.P.A. -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Alliance. I told you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The S.P.A.-U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-M.I.C. Alliance?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> At a suitable opportunity,

perhaps  after  31st August, if not  earlier,  they

will  combine  forces  and  seek  to  outvote   the

Government  on a critical issue. That is  going  to

happen.  It  did  not  happen at  the  last  Budget

sitting  or on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech,

but it may well happen on this crucial Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad indeed that the Member for Anson

asked  the  Member  for Cairnhill  to  clarify  his

Party's   stand   on  whether  he   wanted   direct

representation to the Federal Parliament from this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



Assembly.  The Member for Cairnhill  was  only  too

eager  to have himself appointed from this Assembly

into the Federal Parliament



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No. Sir, let us face this

simple  fact. None of us 50 Members in  this  House

were  elected or were given a mandate to  represent

the people in the House of Representatives in Kuala

Lumpur -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Nor do you have a mandate -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - and therefore for the Member

for  Anson  or  the  Member for Cairnhill  ever  to

suggest that this should be the method by which the

people of Singapore should choose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification, if the

Deputy Prime Minister would permit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I spoke of direct

representation  from the people - the  principle  of

direct  representation  from  the  people  to   the

Federal  House  of  Parliament. Now,  this  is  not

direct  representation if you are nominated by  the

Assembly. I never suggested that, and I am  against

it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am obliged to the Member for

Anson,  Mr Speaker, for clarifying his point.  But

let  me warn any Member in this House who cherishes

the  idea that the correct thing to do would be  to

appoint or nominate 15 Members from this Chamber to

the House of Representatives that he is taking upon

himself powers and a mandate which were never given

to  any  of us. It would be a shameful thing indeed

for  15  people to be directly nominated from  this

Assembly  to  enter  the House  of  Representatives

because that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



would mean entering Parliament by the back door.  I

am  quite  sure that none of us have the  hides  of

elephants  in that we wish to cherish this  way  of

finding  ourselves  seated in Parliament  in  Kuala

Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, much air has been given out by the Member for

Cairnhill  that the Prime Minister has  been  using

his  State  visits  as a preamble  to  an  election

campaign.  The  Member for Cairnhill  is  quite  at

liberty to visit the people and I hope he uses that

opportunity -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> How can I use Government funds

and television? What are you talking about?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> However, let us face this

problem. The first Federal Parliament will probably

sit  either in September or October. We do not know

which month. But the people of Singapore will  have

to find 15 representatives to represent them in the

first Malaysian Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one peculiar attitude of the Opposition

which  is  very difficult to understand. I remember

the  Minister for Home Affairs did write to Members

on  the  Opposition Benches, asking them for  their

proposals or their views on the delineation  of  15

constituencies in order to facilitate elections  to

the  Federal House of Representatives. And  we  had

curious replies; not direct replies to the Minister

for  Home  Affairs, but replies in the Press.  Take

the  S.P.A. for  instance. Their Secretary-General

first issued a statement that Tun Lim Yew Hock  was

going  to  represent  the S.P.A. at  an  All-Party

meeting;   the  Barisan  called  for  an  All-Party

meeting;  and  the U.P.P. called for  an  All-Party

meeting. Since the Minister for Home Affairs had no

replies  in  respect  of  their  proposals  on  the

delineation of 15 constituencies, he therefore sent

out  another  letter inviting them to an  All-Party

meeting -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> Point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In connection with

the request by the Minister for Home Affairs to the

Opposition Parties to send representatives,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



U.M.N.O. replied to the effect that we did not wish

to participate in the meeting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I thank the Member for the

Southern Islands for the information he has  given.

He  has  been  courteous enough  to  reply  to  the

Minister for Home Affairs directly and not  through

the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying just now, when the Minister for

Home Affairs invited the Opposition to an All-Party

meeting,  the excuse they gave was that  they  were

going to be outvoted at this All-Party meeting  and

so  on and so forth, because there were going to be

five  P.A.P. representatives and  four  Opposition

representatives. I would really  like  to  be  very

fair and would still like to open the door to them.

If  they  believe  that five P.A.P. representatives

will outvote four Opposition representatives on the

delineation of boundaries, then I say that  we  are

prepared to meet four to four. Therefore, some form

of  agreement can be arrived at on the  delineation

of boundaries. I am quite sure that the opportunity

will  be  used in the future by those  defeated  in

these  elections to say that these  boundaries  had

been  rigged  up, that there was gerrymandering  in

the  elections  in order to try to cover  up  their

defeat. However, to those who claim that they  have

always  the support of the masses, I am  sure  they

are  not worried as to where they stand. The Member

for Cairnhill has been brave enough to announce  in

the  House  just now that he is going to  meet  the

Prime Minister. You are not withdrawing, are you?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There is no need for bravery to

meet  the Prime Minister. Decency and common  sense

will knock him out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Prudence!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I do not require bravery.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, besides decency and common

sense you also need guts, and it is a quality which

I  am  sure the Member for Cairnhill is not lacking

in,  knowing his record in the past years  when  he

was  in  Government  and  when  he  was  the  Chief

Minister -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He wants to be a Senator.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I appeal to the House. Let us

deal with this problem seriously. Do not let us  be

fatuous about the whole business. I do not think we

really  want to ram it down the Opposition  throats

that the reason why they are opposing this Bill  is

that  they  are afraid to meet the people.  We  are

responsible people; we have a job to do; we have to

lay  the  basis so that the people, the electorate,

in  Singapore can find 15 qualified representatives

who  can  represent them in the Federal Parliament.

And  one  of  the reasons, I may add here,  why  we

should  oppose at all cost nominations direct  from

this Assembly is that some Members in this House do

not  qualify  for elections under the Federal  law,

simply   because   they   do   not   satisfy    the

qualifications which are required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has mentioned just now

that  we  really ought to have debated  the  Second

Reading of this Bill after item 10, that is,  after

the  Malaysia Agreement has been dealt with in this

Assembly.  Up to a point, he is correct, because  I

think  one  of  the points he has  raised  in  this

debate  is  that the 15 representatives  will  only

have a life of nine months or less than a year  as,

according to the Federal Constitution, the  Federal

Parliament must dissolve in 1964. Therefore, if  we

have elections to the Federal Assembly now, we will

probably  face a second Federal election  in  1964.

But  as  the Minister for Home Affairs has informed

the House, this is not the case. It has been agreed

with  the  Federation Government that the first  15

representatives who will represent Singapore in the

Federal   House  of  Representatives   will   leave

Parliament  only at the second dissolution  of  the

Malaysia Parliament. In other words, if the Federal

Parliament



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



should be dissolved in 1964 and fresh elections are

held  in the Federation of Malaya, the 15 Singapore

representatives will continue to retain their seats

in the second Malaysia Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I add that we are honest about

holding  elections to the Malaysia Parliament?  Let

me  reiterate that we would still like to open  the

door to the Opposition, and if they so desire, they

can meet to discuss the broad basis on how these 15

constituencies should be drawn up. Let  it  not  be

said in the future by any candidate who should lose

in  these elections that all this has been  rigged.

That is a point which the Member for Cairnhill  has

been  trying to ram down our throats, that we  have

been  twisting their tails and that  we  have  been

trying to rig the elections. If he is honest  about

this, let him accept our offer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, because my colleague, the Member  for

Hong  Lim, is not feeling well today and is  unable

to  take part in the debate, I rise on behalf of my

Party to say a few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government have introduced the Singapore (Elections to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill. It can be clearly seen by us that this Bill is equally dictatorial and undemocratic as the National Referendum Bill. This Bill gives the P.A.P. Minister full control of

the  elections. He will have the power to formulate

rules  and regulations governing elections  without

coming  to  this Assembly. Actually, in so  far  as

matters of elections are concerned, the formulation

of  rules  and  regulations should  lie  with  this

Assembly, because elections are very important. But

the P.A.P. Government are now trying to make use of

undemocratic means to deprive this Assembly of  the

right to make rules for the elections. They want to

transfer  all such powers to the Minister  so  that

undemocratic  means  can  be  resorted  to  in  the

elections  to  the Federal Parliament.  We  do  not

trust  or believe that the P.A.P. will be clean  in

the coming elections to the Federal Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the provisions of the White Paper,

representatives to the Federal Parliament should be

elected  under  the supervision of  an  independent

Elections  Commission. Why is it  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  refuse  to follow this  procedure?  Why

must   they   resort   to  this  undemocratic   and

dictatorial  Bill to ensure that the Minister  will

have  the  power  to regulate the  election  of  15

representatives  to the Federal Parliament?  It  is

because  we know that the P.A.P. are not  confident

of  winning the elections. They do not want to give

the Opposition a chance of being returned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the delineation of the

constituencies, the P.A.P. again are not very fair.

We  are of the opinion that each Party should  send

representatives  to attend an All-Party  conference

on  this matter. Even during the regime of the  Lim

Yew   Hock  Government,  democratic  methods   were

adopted. If the P.A.P. are sincere about this, then

after  two  or  three  meetings  of  the  All-Party

conference, the problem could be solved. I hope the

P.A.P. will pay heed to my advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the delineation of constituencies was

done  on 1st June this year even before the request

was  made  to  the various Opposition  Parties.  In

order  to  cover  up  their undemocratic  ways  and

tactics,  the  P.A.P. put  up  the  pretext   that

representatives of other political Parties would be

allowed in a conference to be held to consider  the

delineation   of  the  constituencies.   Only   one

representative of each Party was to be allowed, and

that  would  mean  four  representatives  from  the

Opposition.   But  the  P.A.P. would   have   five

representatives.  Where  is  the  democracy    - five

against  four? All this is done to cover  up  their

undemocratic acts. That is why all Parties  in  the

Opposition refused to attend this meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far back as 1st May this year, we heard that

the  P.A.P. had already finalised arrangements  for

the  delineation  of  the constituencies.  We  also

heard  that the constituencies of Geylang East  and

Mountbatten would be combined into one constituency

for   the   purpose  of  election  to  the  Federal

Parliament.    In    this    particular    combined

constituency, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



constituency   for  the  U.M.N.O. candidate   was

excluded to ensure that the U.M.N.O. representative

would  not  be  defeated.  So  the  P.A.P. is  now

resorting  to  all sorts of undemocratic  means  to

ensure  that they would be returned to the  Federal

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now trying to make use of public funds to

hold  mass  rallies  during  the  Prime  Minister's

visits  to  the constituencies. In fact,  when  the

Prime   Minister  returned  from  London,  it   was

reported  that  some  20,000  people  went  to  the

Airport  to welcome him. The information I received

was that the P.A.P. hired about 50 S.T.C. buses  to

go  round the rural areas to drive the residents to

the  Airport. But, in fact, some buses  were  quite

empty throughout the whole night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are trying to deprive my Party of its

symbol.  I  mentioned this during the  last  Budget

debate.  I  said to the Minister for  Home  Affairs

that  my Party symbol was approved by the Registrar

of Societies and the Registrar of Trade Unions, and

he replied that there might be a possible confusion

between my Party symbol and other emblems.  I  then

said that my Party symbol was a unique three-circle

symbol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party also suggested that the elections should

be    conducted   by   an   independent   Elections

Commission,  but the P.A.P. were not in  favour  of

this  suggestion. After some bargaining, the P.A.P.

were able to reach an agreement with the Federation

Government  to the effect that the first  elections

to  the  House  of Representatives  would  be  left

entirely  in  the  hands of the  P.A.P.  Who  knows

whether, before these elections are conducted,  the

P.A.P. would  not  have a  desire  to  arrest  the

prospective  candidates of the Opposition  so  that

their own chances of being returned to the House of

Representatives  would greatly increase?  All  this

threat of foul play and undemocratic means will not

frighten  the people. In fact, the people will  see

that  the P.A.P. is defeated. On 31st August, 1963,

when   the   Central  Government  takes  over   the

responsibility  of elections and  the  police,  the

P.A.P. will  lose all control over the  police.  I

believe  this behaviour of the P.A.P. is  going  to

bring about their own downfall.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, it is not my intention to speak at  length

on  this matter. It is clear that if we wish to see

a  Malaysia  Parliament  whose  Members  are  truly

representatives  of  the  people,  then  I   cannot

understand why some people are afraid to  face  the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill who talked at length in a

raised voice charged that the P.A.P. Government has

made  preparations for safe seats for its Ministers

to  contest  in the forthcoming elections.  He  has

clearly shown that he is trying to measure his coat

according    to   the   measurement   of    others.

Fortunately,  because of his adaptability  and  the

name  of  the Labour Party, he won the election  in

the  Keppel  Ward. But in 1955, he ran from  Keppel

Ward   to   Havelock.  Subsequently,  because   his

colleagues  in  the Labour Front contested  against

him  in  Havelock, he fled to Cairnhill for safety,

so  that none of his former Labour Front colleagues

could be found in this Assembly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



excepting himself - from the defunct Labour Party to

the  defunct Labour Front, thence to the S.P.A. and

now  to  the  Singapore Alliance. Mr Speaker,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill thumped his  chest  in  this

Chamber saying, "We challenge the Prime Minister to

contest  in  bur ward, or we will go to  the  Prime

Minister's constituency."
