<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission

to  table  Miscellaneous Paper No. 3 of  1974,  a

report of the Singapore Mass Transit Study, Phase

I,  in  this House? I shall be referring to  this

Paper  when  we come to Question No. 6  for  Oral

<div align="center"><b>(Purchase of flats built by Housing and Urban Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd.)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Labour

if  he will consider extending the provisions  of

the  Central  Provident  Fund  (Approved  Housing

Schemes)  Regulations,  1968,  to  purchases  of

flats  to  be  built  by the  Housing  and  Urban

Development  Company (Private) Limited,  so  that

persons  in the middle-income group may make  use

of  the amounts standing to their credit in,  and

their  contributions  to, the  Central  Provident

Fund for the purchase of such flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



recall  that the Central Povident Fund  (Approved

Housing   Schemes)   Regulations,   1968,   were

primarily  designed to encourage  home  ownership

among  the  lower  income group.  Notwithstanding

that,  I  told  the House last  March  that  this

policy  would be reviewed in 1976 with a view  to

extending  the  provisions of the regulations  to

the  middle income group. My Ministry understands

and  appreciates  the problems  and  difficulties

faced by the middle income group in purchasing  a

flat  or a house and we are in full sympathy with

them.  We  have therefore decided to  review  the

policy this year instead of in 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will be glad to know that

my Ministry has decided in principle to allow the

middle  income  group to use part  of  their  CPF

savings for the purchase of flats to be built  by

the Housing and Urban Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd.

The  details of the middle income housing project

are  being  worked out by the Housing  and  Urban

Development  Co.  (Pte.)  Ltd.  Once  these   are

finalised,  the  rules and regulations  governing

the use of CPF savings by the middle income group

for  the  purchase of these flats will be  worked

out and announced. This scheme will be available

only  for  housing  units built  with  Government

funds,  for  example, those built by the  Housing

and  Development Board and the Housing and  Urban

Development Co. (Pte.) Ltd.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Additional facilities and construction of second runway)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications,  in  regard  to  the  Paya   Lebar

International Airport, (a) if it is  proposed  to

erect  a  step-like platform in the Waving Gallery

to  enable more people to watch aircraft  landing

and  taking  off;  (b)  if he  will  consider  the

provision of bigger lockers for the use of transit

passengers and a restaurant or refreshment room on

the ground floor of the terminal building; and (c)

with  the  heavy aircraft traffic,  what  is  the

progress in the construction of the second  runway

and when it will be completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Conununications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to inform the hon.

Member  for Anson that the waving gallery at  Paya

Lebar  International  Airport  was  closed   with

effect from 19th March, 1974, for conversion  into

offices, in view of the shortage of such space  at

Singapore Airport. An announcement to this  effect

was made in the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the provision of bigger lockers for

transit  passengers, I would like  to  inform  the

Member  that  the present luggage  locker  service

which commenced business in February this year has

51  standard-sized lockers to accommodate  normal-sized  baggage. Larger-sized baggage, which cannot

go  into  any  of the standard-sized lockers,  are

being  accepted  at  the  operator's  counter  for

storage behind the counter where some open storage

space   is  available.  The  Department  of  Civil

Aviation  has  requested the operator  to  provide

bigger  lockers  and  the  operator  is  presently

looking into this request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the provision of a restaurant or

refreshment  room  on  the  ground  floor  of  the

Passenger  Terminal  Building,  with  the  current

heavy passenger traffic which is increasing, it is

not considered desirable to re-assign space on the

ground floor for restaurant or refresh-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



ment area, as such facilities would occupy a very

large area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present airport restaurant at the Passenger

Terminal Building occupies almost the entire first

floor above the public Main Concourse. Easy access

from  the ground floor has been provided to enable

passengers  as  well  as  their  well-wishers   to

patronize  the  restaurant.  Furthermore,  in  the

departure/transit hail, restaurant facilities have

also  been provided for transit passengers to have

their meals and refreshments, if needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although approval for the construction of the

second   runway  was  given  by  the   Development

Planning  Committee  in  July,  1973,  no   actual

construction work has begun. The subject is  still

under  review consequent to the steep rise in  oil

fuel  early  this  year, and we are  watching  the

impact  on  the  rate of traffic growth.  However,

land  acquisition and resettlement are  proceeding

for the second runway. If traffic warrants it, the

second runway could be ready by the early 1980s.

<div align="center"><b>(Transfer of Division I Officers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications how many Division I Officers in the

Postal  Service  have  been transferred  to  other

departments  of the Public Service  since  March,

1973, or how soon such transfers will take place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since March, 1973, three Division I Officers in the Postal

Services Departn:ent have been transferred out as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. An Assistant Controller of Posts,

with 2 years 6 months' service in the

Department, was absorbed into the

Statistics Service and attached to the

Ministry of Labour as from 16th August,

1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. An Assistant Controller of Posts, with a

degree in Engineering, took up the appointment  of

Mechanical Engineer in the Public Works Department

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



effect  from 1st November, 1973. He had 1  year  5

months'   service   with   the   Postal   Services

Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. An Assistant Controller of Posts, with 2

years  8  months'  service in the Department,  was

absorbed  into  the  Administrative  Service  with

effect from 1st January, 1974, but remains in  the

Postal  Services  Department on secondment  basis

for  a  period  of one year with effect  from  1st

January,  1974,  or until the vacancy  is  filled,

whichever is earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why was the Mechanical

Engineer recruited into the Postal

Services Department in the first instance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, the Postal

Services  Department is a closed service,  and  if

someone with a degree in Engineering applies for a

post in the Postal Service and is accepted, I  see

no  reason  why we should not allow  him  to  work

there.  But after working for some time, he  shows

more  interest  in some other department  and,  in

fact,  that  was the reason why he was transferred

out.

<div align="center"><b>POSTAL SERVICES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motorised delivery of mail in rural areas)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  (a~  how many scooters  and  motor

cycles (including reserves) are available in  the

Postal  Services  Department for the  delivery  of

mail  in  the rural areas; and (h) how  successful

has  the  use  of these motorised  units  been  in

expediting  the  delivery of  mail  in  the  rural

areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 88 out of a

total  fleet  of 124 motor scooters are  available

for delivery duties in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of the Postal Services Department

that  the  use of scooters in the rural areas  has

been  successful.  In  these areas,  the  delivery

beats  cover relatively longer distances of travel

between the delivery post office and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



first delivery point. The delivery points are also

more  scattered. Use of scooterised beats  in  the

rural  areas  has reduced the travelling  time  of

postmen by about 60 per cent, and each scooterised

delivery  beat can handle up to 33 per  cent  more

mail traffic than a bicycle beat.

it  is  the intention of the Registrar of Vehicles

<div align="center"><b>MASS TRANSIT STUDY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress made)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong</b> asked the

Minister  for  Communications what  progress  has

been  made in the Mass Transit Study, and  whether

there  is  any  recommendation  made  or  decision

reached on the subject so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the long awaited Final

Report  on Phase I Mass Transit Study has at  last

been  completed and, with your permission, I have

earlier  on  tabled it in this House  as  a  Misc.

Paper  No. 3 of 1974. This is the Report in Brief,

as  the actual Final Report is somewhat voluminous

with 232 pages and quite technical in character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consultants, Wilbur Smith and Associates, in

association   with  Parsons  Brinkerhoff   - Tudor-Bechtel   who   prepared  the  report   for   the

International   Bank   for   Reconstruction    and

Development,  in  short,  the  World   Bank,   as

Executing Agency of the United Nations Development

Programme  and the Government of the  Republic  of

Singapore indicated several reasons which make it

vital  that any transport policy needed to support

the   development  envisaged  for  Singapore  must

provide for a Mass Transit System.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study examined six alternative systems, viz.

(a)  an extension of the existing road-based  all-bus system on shared rights-of-way; (b) three rail-based  systems;  and  (c) two all-bus  mass  rapid

transit   systems   incorporating  grade-separated

busways.  Each of these systems was  evaluated  in

terms  of operational feasibility, economic costs

and  benefits  and impacts on the community.  From

the evaluation, the Consultants have recommended a

rail-based mass



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



rapid  transit  3R  system  for  further  detailed study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the recommended system has

a total length of 24 miles, of which 10

miles would be underground and the

balance at surface or at elevated levels.

A total of 31 stations are planned, of

which 16 would be underground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail system envisages a network of

connections  from Jurong in the west  through  the

Central Area to Siglap in the east, with a  branch

line  from  the Central area through  the  Orchard

Road  corridor, thence to Toa Payoh and ending  at

Ang Moh Kio to the north.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of the recommended 3R MRT

system  (according to 1972 prices) is $698 million

which,  however,  does not include  the  cost  of

rolling stock or financing costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has since decided to proceed with

further Phase II detailed study of the recommended

MRT system in respect of the engineering, economic

and financial feasibility and which is expected to

be  completed, within a period of six months.  The

objectives for the Phase II study are as  follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Soils tests along the proposed railway

route,  with  special reference to those  sections

for which underground construction is recommended;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Updated estimates of construction costs, to

an accuracy of approximately 20 per cent;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Analyses and comparisons of fare structures,

ridership   and  revenues  for  the  railway   and

scheduled bus services;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Updating of costs and benefits for the years

1982 and 1992, and calculations of financial  and

economic   rates   of   return   for   alternative

investment  sequences of the  MRT  system,  having

regard to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the impact of planned highway investment, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the proposed short-term measures to

promote   the  efficient  use  of  existing transport facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has

been  some  publicity  in  recent  months  on  the

establishment  of  a  Community   Chest   in   our

is  aware  that  the Singapore Council  of  Social

Service  is  actively working on the establishment

of  a Community Chest with the aim of centralising

fund-raising efforts to finance voluntary welfare

activities in the Republic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry supports the concept of a Community

Chest. The establishment of such a Community Chest

will  result in an efficient utilisation of public

donations  for  those in need and,  moreover,  by

preventing the duplication and profusion of fund-raising  efforts by the various voluntary  welfare

organisations,  the Community Chest  would  enable

these voluntary welfare organisations to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



concentrate mainly on welfare work per se  and  to

increase  its  efficiency and scope  to  meet  the

     1969        471

     1970        467

<br>There is no accurate record of the number of aged

sick persons in the various charitable homes known

to the Social Welfare Department. According to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



records  maintained by these homes, the number  of

<pre>

     Year      Number

     1969        295

     1970        316

     1973        451

</pre>



<br>The  only  Government Chronic  Sick  Hospital  has

about 100 aged sick persons under its care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu will agree that caring

for  the  aged  and aged sick, as in  all  welfare

efforts,   must   be  a  community  responsibility

involving  both the efforts of the Government  and

the  private sector. There is happily no  lack  of

initiative from both these sectors in the planning

and  implementation of more adequate services  for

the  aged  and  the aged sick. Although  both  the

Government and voluntary welfare organisations  do

provide  institutional care for the aged  and  the

aged  sick, this we recognise is, at best, only  a

poor    substitute   for   family   care.   Recent

developments  in  the Republic have  been  in  the

direction of establishing facilities and  services

which will encourage the aged as well as the able-bodied    persons   to   continue    living    and

participating in the community. In the planning of

more  adequate  services for these  categories  of

people   therefore,   both  the   Government   and

voluntary welfare organisations have borne in mind

the  need  for a balanced approach and have  taken

steps  both  to  improve facilities  and  increase

accommodation in institutions for the aged as well

as to introduce new services which will enable the

continued  participation  of  the  aged  in   the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Government effort is concerned, in

addition   to   the  construction  of   four   new

dormitories in the Woodlands Home for the Aged  to

accommodate a greater number of aged persons,  the

Department  of  Social Welfare is  proposing  the

setting up of Area Social Welfare Centres  in  the

various housing estates which will provide,  among

other services, the establishment of Old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



People's  Clubs  where the  aged  could  have  the

opportunity  of socialising with others,  engaging

in  leisure activities and on the whole leading  a

more meaningful life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the new thinking not to isolate

the   aged  from  the  community,  the  Government

recognises the need to assist the aged to continue

living with their families. The revised Income Tax

laws which allow for tax relief for maintenance of

aged  parents  and grandparents  is  one  of  the

positive  measures  by  the  Government  in   this

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voluntary sector, the Singapore Council

of  Social  Service is setting up a Home  for  the

Aged at Mandai. A community Home for the Aged  in

a  housing  estate  at  Henderson  Hill  has  been

implemented successfully, and this has encouraged

other  efforts by the Singapore Council of Social

Service to explore the possibility of establishing

a  paying  hostel for old people  at  Housing  and

Development Board estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that with the longer life

expectation which people now enjoy, the problem of

the care of the aged will become more acute. There

will,  therefore, be necessity for the  activities

of  the  various organisations concerned with  the

care  of the aged to be co-ordinated. It may  not,

however,   be  necessary  to  set  up  a  National

Association for the aged sick but to have such co-ordination  done through existing  facilities  now

available.  It may be possible for the Council  of

Social  Service whose objects are "to  co-ordinate

voluntary welfare activities in Singapore not only

as  between  member organisations of the  Council

but  also  with other organisations" to  undertake

this function.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, would the Parliamentary Secretary please inform

the  House whether there is any intention  to  lay

down  minimum  standards in the running  of  these

medical  care, and also to control the  activities

of  some of these homes which are being run  along

commercial lines?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats, Sir, referred to in the Question, are

the  emergency-type  flats.  It  is  difficult  to

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Thank you, Sir,I refer

Members   to   the  budget  of  the  Housing   and

Development Board for 1974/75, which was published

in  the Government Gazette on 24th May, 1974.  The

Board   will  spend  $40  million  on  management,

maintenance  and  repairs in its estates  for  the

current  fiscal  year.  It hopes  to  recover  $18

million   from  its  collection  of  service   and

conservancy   charges  at  the  old   rates.   The

increases in service and conservancy charges  will

bring  in  another $15 million, making a total  of

$33  million. So the Board has still to provide  a

subsidy  of  $7  million for the  maintenance  and

management services to its estates. The  financial

statements which I referred to do not include  the

capital  costs  of  constructing  swimming  pools,

sports   complexes  and  recreational  and   other

amenities in the housing estates, nor the increase

in  loan servicing expected for all new Government

loans  as  a  result of the new Central  Provident

Fund rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that when I announced in

Parliament   on  30th  November  last   year   the

increases in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



selling  prices  of Housing Board  flats,  I  also

informed  Members that the service and conservancy

charges  for HDB flats will be increased  in  1974

and  that  rentals may be increased. Rentals  have

not been increased but the service and conservancy

charges  have  been revised with effect  from  1st

July, 1974.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the revision have been explained

in  the  press statement issued at the  time.  The

service and conservancy charges have never gone up

since  1960 when flats were first built for rental

by  the  Housing and Development  Board  nor  for

flats  sold under the Home Ownership Scheme, first

introduced in 1965. Most of the tenants in  flats

built by the former Singapore Improvement Trust do

not  pay any service and conservancy charges. This

is an anomaly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 10 years, there have been mounting

increases  in  the service and conservancy  costs.

The  charges for water used in cleaning the common

areas  have  increased  by  about  248  per  cent.

Charges  for electricity for lighting  of  public

areas,  the  running of lifts and  power  to  pump

water  to the roof tank has increased by about  69

to  70 per cent. Wages of workers and salaries  of

management  staff  have also increased  with  the

National Wages Council recommendations and  higher

Central  Provident Fund contributions,  while  the

inflation in our construction industry has raised

the costs of redecoration and maintenance works by

more  than 100 per cent. Lift contractors  charged

from  $30 to $50 per month to maintain a lift  in

1964. Now they charge $80 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents in Housing Board estates now enjoy

better  environment, services and  amenities  than

they did 10 years ago. More greenery, gardens  and

playgrounds  have  been  added  in  the  estates.

Sports  complexes and swimming pools are  provided

in  each  new  town.  There  is  emergency  repair

service  round the clock for repairs to electrical

and  sanitary fittings in their flats.  They  can

call  upon  the service of the Lift  Rescue  Unit.

Residents  will  enjoy  even  better  environment,

services and amenities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



in the   future.  Swimming  pools  and  other  sports

facilities  are  being  extended  to  old  housing

estates.  The  first such swimming pool  is  under

construction for the Old Kallang Airport  and  Tan

jong  Rhu Estates. Other swimming pools are  being

planned  for  the  Bukit  Ho  Swee  and  Alexandra

Estates   while  a  sports  complex   will   serve

residents   in  the  Tiong  Bahru,   Redhill   and

Henderson Road Estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in service and conservancy charges

has  been  modest. They appear large only  because

they  had not been gradually adjusted since  1960.

For the 66,744 owners of Housing Board flats, the

maximum  increase (for the larger-sized flats)  is

only  $10 per month. Fifty-five per cent of  these

owners  are  using their CPF credits  to  pay  for

their  flats. The only cash outlay per month  for

their homes is the service and conservancy charges

and property tax, which together come to less than

the rental they would otherwise have to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board subsidises the

rents of tenants. It cannot subsidise increases in

service   and  conservancy  charges.  The   90,450

tenants  of  Housing Board fiats,  who  previously

enjoyed lower service and conservancy charges than

owners,  have  to pay the same rate as  owners  of

Housing Board flats. But to minimise hardship, the

increase  ranging  from $6 for 1-room  (emergency)

flats   to  $18.50  for  4-room  flats,  is  being

implemented in two stages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To equalise subsidies between old and new flats,

service and conservancy charges for sold SIT flats

are  now  the  same as for owners  of  HDB  flats.

14,990  tenants of SIT flats will now pay service

and  conservancy charges similar to  HDB  tenants.

These  SIT tenants have been enjoying free service

and  conservancy for the last 17 years. This  was

due  to an administrative oversight. Nevertheless,

to   relieve  hardship,  the  Housing  Board   has

implemented the increase of these charges also  in

two stages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has to revise

the  service and conservancy charges to  be  more

equal in its treatment of old and new tenants, and

between owner-owned and rented, premises. Lastly,

may  I remind Members that the Board must also  be

ready  to  meet  increased subsidies  as  interest

rates  for loans from CPF funds go up for the  new

estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister why has it

been  necessary  for  the Housing  Board  to  show

discrimination  in the issue of these  notices  to

tenants   and   owner-occupiers  of   HDB   flats?

Owner.occupiers   received   their   notices    by

registered  mail  whereas the  tenants  had  their

notices  pasted on their doors without  any  prior

notice at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

was  no intended discrimination between owners and

tenants  even in respect of the service  of  these

notices. Under the law it is necessary to serve  a

tenant  or a lessee-owner with a notice  which  is

headed,  "Notice to Quit", before the service  and

conservancy  charges can be raised; the  intention

is  to terminate the tenancy so that a new tenancy

can  be  offered and signed between the Board  and

the  tenant. In the same way, notices  had  to  be

served  on owners of flats, telling them that  the

old  rates  do not apply and that new  rates  will

apply as from the 1st of July. Under the terms  of

the  tenancy  agreement, of which I have  a  blank

copy here, clause 18 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`all notices, including notices to quit, which

the  Board  may require to be given to the  tenant

shall  be  in  writing and shall be deemed  to  be

sufficiently served if they are posted  upon  some

conspicuous  part of the premises or if  they  are

addressed  to  the  tenant  at  the  premises  and

forwarded by AR registered post.'



<br>To  have served nearly 196,000 occupiers  of  HDB

flats  with  letters by AR registered  post  would

have  cost  a  lot of money. Even the post  office

charges have gone up! So where a tenant was not at

home the notice was posted on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



to  the  premises. As far as the owners or lessees

were   concerned,  there  was  no   such   similar

provision  in  any of the clauses  of  the  lease.

Letters, therefore, had to be sent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this time of economic strain and

stress,  what  justification  is  there  for   the

Housing  Board  to  provide  such  luxuries  like

swimming pools and a sports complex? Will there be

any economic return because we do not know what is

in Store for us in the future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, financially, of

course,  it  is a strain on the resources  of  the

Housing  Board to provide recreational or  sports

facilities, but the dividends do not come  by  way

of money. They come by way of better and healthier

citizens. Besides, nowadays tenants and occupiers

of  Housing Board flats expect swimming pools  and

parks. When the Housing Board first built flats in

1960, all  it did was to provide homes with  very

little recreational or sports facilities. But our

standards have gone up and their demands have gone

up,   and   we  will  provide  these  sports   and

recreational facilities even if we lose  money  on

them.  I think the dividends that come by  way  of

higher  standards of sports, or healthier citizens

(social  dividends if you like) are  really  worth

the money spent.

agencies have been registered with his Ministry to

conducting  overseas group tours; (d) whether  and

how many complaints of breach of contract against

tighten



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



control over group tour orientated travel agencies

in order to save the public from being taken for a

ride by fly-by-night travel agencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Tourist

Promotion Board has since December 1970 introduced

the  Tourist Promotion (Licensing and  Control  of

Tourist  Agencies)  Regulations  to  license  and

control  tour agencies. So far, 150 tour  agencies

conducting local tours have been licensed.  Among

these, 38 are agents of the Singapore Airlines and

54 of them also conduct overseas group tours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been seven cases of complaints of

breach  of contract lodged with the Board  against

licensed  tourist agencies. All these  cases  have

been   amicably   settled  between   the   parties

concerned.  Where  complainants  appear  to   have

reason to feel cheated., the agencies have, on the

advice  of  the  Board, paid  compensation.  Where

services  rendered have been poor,  the  agencies

have been warned to maintain a reasonable standard

or  have  their licences revoked. The  Board  has,

therefore,  been  able  to  influence   and,   if

necessary,   exercise   effective   control   over

licensed tourist agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect members of the public from being

taken for a ride, as the Member for Delta puts it,

by  fly-by-night travel agencies, I have asked the

Board  to  introduce regulations to  require  any

person  or  company engaged in the business  of  a

tour  agency to take out a licence, even where  it

handles only outward travel. The amendments to the

regulations to empower the Board to license local

tourist agencies handling outward travel are being

drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the new regulations are brought into

force,  it  is suggested that Singapore residents

book   their  passages  for  their  travel  abroad

through  the  54 licensed Singapore tour  agencies

conducting  overseas tours. The  names  of  these

licensed   agencies  can  be  obtained  from   the

Singapore Tourist Promotion Board.

Industrial Training Board in April 1973,  (a)  how

many students have graduated from institutions of

the Board, and whether they have been able to find

suitable employment in industrial establishments;

and (b) how many of the Board's training officers,

instructors, etc., have resigned and  the  reasons

for   their  resignations,  and  what  steps   his

Ministry  is  taking to prevent  further  loss  of

these specialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the establishment of the

Industrial  Training  Board in  April,  1973,  the

total  number of students who have graduated  from

ITB  institutions is 4,173. Apart from  those  who

are  called up for national service, most  of  the

graduates   have  been  able  to   find   suitable

employment  in industrial establishments  through

the  placement service provided  by  the  ITB  in

supplying   names   of   graduates   of   various

institutions  to  relevant  industries   for   the

purpose  of offering employment. The only  source

where information on employment of graduates from

ITB  institutions can be obtained is  through  the

response  from the industrial sector in notifying

the  ITB  when  appointments are accepted  by  the

graduates. However, information provided by  this

source  does  not reflect the correct position  as

industries  concerned do not all  notify  the  ITB

when offers of appointment are made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 823 professional staff on the

establishment of the Industrial Training Board  in

April 1973. Since then, 41 officers have resigned.

They  comprise 30 Education Officers and  training

officers,  seven  workshop instructors  and  four

workshop assistants. This constitutes 4.9 per cent

of  the  professional staff. Most of the officers

did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



not  assign any reason for their resignation.  It

can,  however, be surmised that they left  because

of   better  prospects  in  the  private   sector.

Turnover  of  staff  is  to  be  expected  in  any

organisation.  The  rate  of  resignation  in  the

Industrial Training Board is not considered  high.

However,  to keep the resignation rate as  low  as

possible, various measures are being taken to make

the   service  more  attractive.  These   measures

include  a  revised salary structure,  accelerated

increments   for   deserving  officers   and   the

conducting of more frequent promotion exercises.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only source where statistics on hte employment of non-citizen

graduates can be obtained is the general survey on graduate employment

conducted by the Economic Research Centre in August 1973. The survey

covered the 1972 and 1973 batch of graduates and yielded the following results:

</pre>



<br>However, it is to be noted that these figures do not reflect the ture picture as

only 70.3 per cent of the 1972 graduates and 57.1 per cent of the 1973 graduates

responded to the survey, and it was conducted only three months after the 1973

graduation when many graduates were still seeking employment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Now, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President

in  respect of the Bill, laid upon the  Table  by

the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act,

formerly  known  as the Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance, was brought into force  on

21st  October,  1955, and has been extended  from

time to time. The Act will lapse on 20th October,

1974, unless further extended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act provides primarily for the maintenance

of   public   safety,  peace  and   good   order,

prevention of strikes and lock-outs in  essential

services,   and  detention  and  supervision   of

persons  associated with activities of a criminal

nature. Since its introduction, this Act has been

very  effective  in  the maintenance  of  public

peace  and  order  in curbing the  activities  of

persons associated with secret societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indication of the effective use of the

provisions  for  detention  under  the   Act   is

established  by  the fact that for  the  past  10

years the average number of persons arrested  per

year under section 43 was 1,090. As on 31st July,

1974,  the total number of persons detained under

section  30  was 1,074 and the number of  persons

ordered to be placed under Police supervision was

832.   These  are  known  criminals   who   would

otherwise be free without the powers provided  by

this Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation with regard to secret

societies  in the Republic is under control.  For

the  past  10 years there has been an average  of

about  six  secret society incidents  per  month.

However, without exercising the provisions in the

Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act it  would

not be possible to maintain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



this  control.  There  is, therefore,  a  need  to

extend  the operation of the Act. It is  essential

that  the suppression of secret societies  in  the

Republic  should go on relentlessly  and  also  in

view  of  their  possible  involvement  in  racial

disturbances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Utilities Board has for a long

time   recognised  the  need  for   comprehensive

legislation  to  license,  control  and  regulate

electrical  workers  of  all  grades  engaged  in

electrical works. The need for such a legislation

has  become  even more pressing  with  the  rapid

development  of  Singapore  into  an  industrial,

commercial   and  communications  centre.   Such

development   entails   the   installation    and

operation   of   complex  electrical   equipment

operating   at  increasingly  higher  power   and

voltage levels, with inherent problems of  safety

and    requiring   competent   workmanship    and

supervision.   This   need   has   been   further

reinforced   by  the  recommendations   of   the

Commission  of Inquiry into the Robinson's  Fire.

Whilst some form of legislation could be achieved

by   means   of  Regulations  under  the   Public

Utilities   Act,  legal  opinion  is   that   the

licensing  system contemplated would  require  an

Act   of  Parliament  rather  than  a  subsidiary

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professional Engineers Act, 1970, prohibits

anyone  other  than professional  engineers  with

prescribed   qualifications  from   engaging   in

electrical  work. It also regulates  the  ethical

conduct  of  such professional engineers.  It  is

thus,   apparently,  limited   to   professional

engineers and to those exempted under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Professional Engineers Act stands, it

will   not   be   possible,  unless  specifically

exempted,  for electrical contractors, artisans,

craftsmen    and   technicians   to    undertake

electrical  work. These grades of  workers  exist

and are necessary in the engineering field. Such

electrical    workers   should   be    licensed,

controlled and regulated. The Electrical Workers

and  Contractors Licensing Bill now  before  this

House has, therefore, been specially drawn up  to

cover  these  categories. Professional  engineers

engaged  in  electrical power  engineering  work

have  also been included in this Bill. The Public

Utilities  Board at present registers  electrical

contractors  to provide an ancillary  engineering

service.  There  is, however, no registration  of

electrical  workers.  Even  the  registration  of

electrical  contractors  lacks  legal  powers  to

regulate their duties and res-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



ponsibilities.  The  Board can  only  deregister

them.  The  Bill  now makes a  clear  distinction

between  an  electrical worker  involved  in  the

personal performance of electrical work, and  an

electrical contractor who, in the course of or in

connection with any trade or business, carries on

electrical work. The classification of electrical

workers  according to qualifications, duties  and

degree of responsibility and the licences  to  be

issued will be spelt out in the Regulations to be

made under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular licence would specify the scope

of  the electrical work to be carried out and any

restrictions  in regard to the type  of  work  or

class   of  electrical  installations,   or   the

circumstances or manner in which the  holder  of

the   licence   may   perform  electrical   work.

Provisions have been made in the Bill  to  ensure

that it is not too restrictive in its operation,

especially  in  regard  to  contractors  on   the

Board's  temporary register. I will also move  an

amendment  to  the Bill in Committee  which  will

ensure that bona fide users of electricity may be

able to perform simple electrical operations such

as  changing an electric lamp bulb and  replacing

any fuse in premises used for dwelling purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall aim of the Bill, therefore, is to

achieve   licensing  and  control  of  electrical

contractors and electrical workers with a view to

ensuring  that they will render good  service  to

those  who employ them. Penalties in the form  of

fines  and/or  imprisonment  or  both  have  been

provided under the Bill, and convey the assurance

that  by reason of their qualifications they will

perform  electrical work in a safe and  efficient

manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill now

being  read  a Second time. But I would  like  to

urge the Minister for the Environment to give due

consideration  to avoid causing any  serious  or

undue  hardship  to  those  contractors  who  are

without  qualifications but who have been engaged

in contracting operations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



in  electrical work in the past years. I wonder if

the Minister would also inform the House the basis

on  which  the licences of electrical workers  and

electrical contractors will be issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> As I have mentioned just now, we already have a register of

contractors and electrical workers. The  basis  on

which  they  are  registered  depends  upon  their

qualifications.   Among  them  are   professional

engineers, holders of diplomas from the  Singapore

Polytechnic,  technicians  who  have  completed  a

prescribed course in the vocational institutes and

contractors who, from long association with  their

work, are considered to be competent to deal  with

electrical  work.  We  have on  the  register  961

contractors and 732 competent persons working with

the   electrical  contractors.  It  is   apparent,

therefore,  that  most,  if  not  all,  of   those

contractors  who are carrying out electrical  work

are  registered. This Bill is unlikely, therefore,

to cause hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principal amendments proposed in this

Bill  relate to Part V of the principal  Act.  Not

only  are substantial amendments proposed  to  the

existing  Part  V  dealing with the  licensing  of

eiectrical  and supply installation  (as  defined)

but  a  new  Part  VA  is  also  proposed,  which

provides  for  the  licensing  of  water   service

workers, such as plumbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While drafting the Electricity Regulations,

under  sections 62 and 88 of the Public  Utilities

Act,  the  Public Utilities Board  recognised  the

necessity for recommending amendments to  Part  V.

This  Part,  as  it  stands,  is  limited  in  its

application   to  private  electrical  generating

plant. The increasing use of electricity in major

industries,   highrise  buildings  and   shopping

complexes  poses  the  problem  of  ensuring   the

periodical inspection of electrical installations.

The  necessity for legislation in this  regard  is

dictated  primarily  by safety considerations  in

places  of  all public concourse. This is  further

underlined  by the recent recommendations  of  the

Commission   of   Inquiry  into   the   Robinson's

Departmental Store fire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission's first recommendation, Sir,

is   that  for  electrical  installations  of   a

stipulated higher current rating, consideration be

given  by the Public Utilities Board to grade  the

licensing  of electrical workers with  a  view  to

ensuring  that  only personnel with the  requisite

professional expertise and experience  be  allowed

to  undertake such work. This has been taken  into

account  in the Electrical Workers and Contractors

Licensing  Bill,  1974, which is  now  before  the

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing these amendments, Sir, full

consideration  has also been given to  the  second

recommendation, that is, for a system of  periodic

inspection of places of public concourse  so  that

the  appropriate  authorities  may  be  aware   of

unauthorised additions or alterations which  might

endanger the safety of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed to Part V of the Act are

significant in that they would have the effect  of

making    it    mandatory   for   all   electrical

installations,   including   private    electrical

generating plants except those owned and  operated

by   the   Board,  Government,  other   statutory

authorities,   or  those  used  exclusively   for

domestic  purposes,  to  be  licensed  and  to  be

supervised  or operated by such class of  licensed

electrical  workers  as  are  prescribed  in   the

Electrical  Workers  and  Contractors   Licensing

Bill, 1974, and ensure also that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a licensee of an installation must cause an

installation to be inspected at such intervals  as

the B'oard may deem necessary;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an inspection as required by a licensee must

be  carried out by such licensed electrical worker

as  the  Board  may direct; on completion  of  the

inspection a Certificate as to the fitness of  the

installation  for  licensing  purposes   must   be

issued by a licensed electrical worker;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) specified procedures are observed in case of

dangerous defects in installations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) serious accidents and the investigation

thereof are reported;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) installations existing before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



commencement  of the amending Act are  subject  to

the Act and the Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Board at the present time does

operate  an  administrative system of  registering

plumbers, it lacks the legal power to regulate the

duties  and  responsibilities of such plumbers.  A

new  Part VA has accordingly been introduced  into

the  Act  to  remedy  this deficiency.  A  licence

granted to a water service worker will specify the

scope of the water service work to be carried  out

and  any  restrictions in regard to  the  type  of

work,  or class of water service installation,  or

the circumstances or manner in which the holder of

the  licence may perform water service  work.  New

definitions   of  "water  service  installation",

"water  service  work" and "water service  worker"

have been included in this Part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19 (3) of the Act, as it stands, does not

empower  the  Board to enforce any  limitation  of

supply or to cut off supply made necessary in  the

public interest.

The need for amending this subsection became clear

when   consideration  was  being  given   to   the

introduction   of  surcharges   in   the   Tariff

Regulations  by  which the Board sought  to  limit

consumption of electricity to consumers,  and  in

the   event   of   any  consumer  exceeding   that

limitation  to  impose  a  surcharge.  Under   the

existing provisions, the Board would not  be  able

to  cut off the supply of electricity to offenders

who   flagrantly  disregard  the   limitation   of

consumption  without prosecuting them.  Subsection

19 (3) of the Act has, therefore, been amended to

confer  that power on the Board in this  situation

or  in other situations in which the interests  of

the   public  are  affected.  Again,  Sir,  a  new

subsection (4) has been inserted in section 19  to

enable  the  Board  to  cut  off  the  supply   of

electricity   to  any  person  who   operates   an

electrical  or  supply  installation   without   a

licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments appearing in the Bill have

the   effect  of  increasing  the  penalties   for

contravention  of the Act. The existing  penalties

have   not  been  changed  since  1963  and   have

therefore ceased to be realistic as a deterrent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 would like to

ask  a  point  of information from the  Minister.

Since   the   Bill  requires  every   electrician,

wireman,  and so on, to be registered or qualified

before he could handle any electrical work, may  I

know  whether there is any examination board where

people  who seek to be qualified electricians  can

be tested?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, there are many institutions

which conduct courses in electricity. It may  lead

to  a degree, diploma, or a certificate. We on our

part have carried out certain examinations in the

past - and I think we will continue to do so -  to

prove  that a person who is to be licensed  is  at

least competent to handle electrical work. But  we

now   have   the   vocational   institutes,   the

Polytechnic, and the University, and I think they

should  be  able  to  turn out  enough  electrical

workers for our needs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, this information is not

enough to satisfy me. At the moment, there  are  a

lot  of  experienced wiremen, and if this Bill  is

passed  then these people will not be  allowed  to

handle  any electrical work. So they want to  find

out  whether  there is any examination  board  to

which  they can go for a test in order to  qualify

as  licensed  electrical workers.  Otherwise  they

will be stranded the moment this Bill is passed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I do not know if the hon.

Member for Bras Basah was present just now when  I

made  my  Second Reading speech on the  Electrical

Workers  and Contractors Licensing Bill, but  just

in  case  he  was not present or that he  was  not

listening, I would like to repeat what I said just

now. We have already got 732 licensed persons  who

in  our  view  are competent to handle  electrical

work, and this figure excludes 951 contractors. If

there  are in existence people who feel that  they

are competent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



enough to do such work, then I think they should

be wise enough to get themselves registered. And

if they are left out, obviously they are

incompetent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill that is now before the House was sent to

Select  Committee  and the report  of  the  Select

Committee  has  been circulated  to  all  Members.

There  is,  accordingly, no  need  for  me  to  go

through  this Bill clause by clause  as  no  doubt

hon.  Members would have read this report  of  the

Select  Committee.  There  are,  however,  certain

important  recommendations in the  report  of  the

Select  Committee which I would like to  bring  to

the attention of Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, one of the most important

recommendations made by the Select Committee is in

respect  of  the proposed management  shares  that

will  have to be issued by newspapers required  to

go  public. These will have to be paid for at  the

prevailing market price of the ordinary shares  of

a newspaper company, that is, such price as would

prevail   at  the  date  of  the  issue   of   the

management shares. It follows, accordingly,  that

if a particular company's shares are quoted on the

Stock  Exchange, it is the market price ruling  on

that  day that would be taken as the value  to  be

attached  to  management shares so issued.  Where,

however,  the company's shares are not so  quoted,

there  would  be no ready yardstick which  can  be

applied.   The   recommendation  of   the   Select

Committee,  therefore,  is  that  such  shares  of

unquoted  companies would be issued at  such  fair

and  reasonable value as may be determined by  the

Minister.  In  order that the  valuation  of  such

shares may not be arbitrarily imposed, it has been

suggested  that that valuation be made subject  to

review  by  the courts. Accordingly, the  Bill  in

accordance    with    the    Select    Committee's

recommendation, now makes the Minister's valuation

subject to appeal to the courts. Even without such

provision in the law, I would like to assure  hon.

Members that such valuation as may be given by the

Minister  would have to be based on expert  advice

from  persons  such as qualified  accountants  who

would  be  required to go through recent  accounts

and  annual  reports of newspapers.  The  Minister

would    also   have   in   mind   various   other

considerations  such as up-to-date  valuations  of

immovable   property,  machinery,  fixtures   and

fitting  of  a newspaper company when  seeking  to

arrive at a fair and reasonable valuation of  such

shares.  However,  with  this  specific  provision

allowing  shareholders of newspaper companies,  or

the companies themselves to seek such redress  as

they  may  require on valuation, there  should  be

adequate   safeguards  against  arbitrary   values

placed  upon  these unquoted shares  of  companies

involved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second recommendation of the Select Committee

which  I would like to touch upon is in regard  to

the  greater voting rights conferred on management

shareholders. Such superior voting rights can only

be used in respect of any resolution touching upon

the  appointment or dismissal of any director  or

any  member of the staff of a newspaper  company.

In   regard  to  other  matters,  the  holder   of

management  shares will rank pan  passu  with  the

holder  of  ordinary  shares of  a  company.  This

recommendation   gives  effect   to   Government's

declared  policy that it is not its  intention  to

upset  the  commercial  operations  of  newspaper

companies   nor  to  interfere  in  the   routine

management of newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another useful recommendation of the Select

Committee is the transitional provisions contained

in  clause  36 of the Bill. As in all  probability

some  newspapers that are required to  go  public

will  find  it  difficult, if not  impossible,  to

comply  with all the provisions of this Act before

it  comes  into operation, it is thought necessary

that transitional provisions be inserted. It is to

provide   for   the   possibility   of   newspaper

companies finding it difficult to suitably  amend

their  memorandum and articles of  association  in

time and to the satisfaction of the Registrar  of

Newspapers, and to accommodate them in  regard  to

other  procedural  requirements which  they  might

have  to  comply  in the issue  of  shares,  these

transitional   provisions   have   been   devised.

Although  ample  notice  has  been  given  to  the

newspapers  of Government's intention  to  require

newspapers  in Singapore to become public  limited

companies,  it is to ensure that such requirements

that  may be imposed may not unduly interfere with

the  ordinary business of a newspaper, that  these

transitional  provisions have  been  inserted.  To

this  end,  clause  36 of the Bill  in  particular

provides  that  the chief editor of any  newspaper

required to comply with the requirements of  Part

III   of  this  Act  shall  be  granted  a  permit

authorising the publication of a newspaper  up  to

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



including 30th June, 1975, on the undertaking  by

the  chief  editor of such newspaper  in  writing

that   he  will  convert  his  newspaper  into   a

newspaper company. Even so, any newspaper that  is

unable  to meet this deadline of 30th June,  1975,

may  apply  for  further  period  or  periods  of

extension,  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the

Minister may see fit to impose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Select Committee has recommended

that appeal should lie to the President in respect

of  every  decision made by the  Minister  in  the

exercise  of  discretionary powers,  for  example,

whether to refuse or grant his approval under Part

III  of  the  Act  or whether to grant  or  refuse

further extensions of time under clause 36. It  is

hoped  that  this  will allay  any  fears  of  the

Minister  acting arbitrarily when  exercising  his

powers  of  discretion under  the  Newspaper  and

Printing Presses Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the committal of

this  Bill to a Select Committee has provided  an

opportunity  for interested parties to  air  their

views.  It  has  enabled the Select  Committee  to

recommend   some   very   important   and   useful

amendments.  The Bill as amended is in  conformity

with  Government's declared policy. I would  like

to  assure  Members  that the  Government  has  no

intention whatsoever of taking over the press  nor

does it want to upset the commercial operations of

any   newspaper.   The  sole   purpose   of   this

legislation  is,  and  I  emphasise,   merely   to

safeguard our national interest and the well-being

of our citizens by preventing our newspapers from

being used as instruments for subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Standing Order No. 95 (2) be amended by

deleting the words "as Parliament may refer to the

Committee" appearing in the tenth line thereof and

substituting therefor the words "as the  Committee

may think fit".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has accepted certain

proposals of the Auditor-General for improving  on

the  accountability of statutory institutions. One

proposal recommends that Statements of Accounts of

such institutions which are laid before Parliament

be  examined  by  the  Public Accounts  Committee.

However, under paragraph (2) of Standing Order No.

95, only accounts showing the appropriation of the

sums   granted  by  Parliament  to   meet   public

expenditure  and  laid  before  Parliament   stand

referred  to  the  Public Accounts  Committee  for

examination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



To  implement  this proposal the Public  Accounts

Committee,  in paragraph 12 of its Second  Report

to  Parliament as contained in Paper Parl.  3  of

1973,  recommended that an appropriate  amendment

be  made  to  the Standing Order.  The  amendment

suggested in my Motion is to give effect  to  the

Committee's recommendation. Moreover, it  is  so

worded as to give the Committee discretion in the

selection of accounts for examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Motion stands referred to the

Standing Orders Committee under the provisions

of paragraph 4 (b) of Standing Order No. 95.
