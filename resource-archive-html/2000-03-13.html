<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FIRES IN INDONESIA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S.C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Simon S.C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment what steps have been taken to deal with the fires

in  Indonesia that have and are again causing haze  pollution

in the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, at the last ASEAN Ministerial Meeting  on  Haze

held  in  Singapore  in August last year,  ASEAN  Environment

Ministers agreed that plantation fires are the root cause  of

the  regional  haze problem.  The Indonesian  Government  was

urged to enforce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>

against plantation companies that use fires to carry out land

clearing  activities,  and  to put  in  place  the  necessary

regulations to enforce a zero-burning policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has since announced its draft Regulation to

implement the zero-burning policy.  In January this year, the

Indonesian   Government  held  a  dialogue  with   about   60

plantation  companies  in Sumatra  to  notify  them  of  this

impending  Regulation.  The plantation  companies  were  also

told  of  Jakarta's determination to enforce against  illegal

burning  activities.   Indonesia  has  also  stepped  up  its

awareness-building programmes in fire-prone provinces such as

Riau  and  South  Sumatra to alert local populations  to  the

threat  of  another  haze disaster.  All these  are  positive

efforts on the part of the Indonesian Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, unfortunately, political and economic

problems  have  continued to hamper Indonesia's  ability  and

effort  to  prevent plantation fires.  In fact, as  we  know,

there are already large-scale burning activities taking place

in  Central  Sumatra.   As a result,  the  Riau  province  is

affected by severe smoke haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been in constant contact with the

Indonesian  authorities to track the situation in  Riau.   To

date,  Indonesian officials have confirmed with us that  most

of  the recent fires were started by plantation companies  to

clear   land   for   cultivation  purpose.   The   Indonesian

Environmental  Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL)  has  since

despatched  teams of officials to investigate  the  fires  in

Riau  and to take measures to suppress the fires.  They  also

intend  to  round up the plantation companies and  conduct  a

dialogue to remind them not to use fire to clear land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, Singapore has been providing Indonesia with

National   Oceanic   &   Atmospheric  Administration   (NOAA)

satellite  pictures  to alert them to the  locations  of  hot

spots  since  the beginning of the latest spate of  fires  in

Riau. Recently, at the request of the Indonesian authorities,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>

we   have  also  started  to  provide  Jakarta  with   higher

resolution pictures acquired from the French SPOT satellites.

These  are pictures that can pinpoint the locations of  fires

up  to  a  resolution  of  20  metres.   We  hope  that  such

information would be helpful to the Indonesian authorities in

their efforts to act against the errant plantation companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides satellite pictures, Singapore has also been

providing  other forms of technical assistance to  Indonesia.

To  date,  we  have  provided  them  with  communication  and

computer   equipment   to  facilitate  fire   detection   and

enforcement,  air monitoring equipment, as well  as  training

for  their  local officials in the area of satellite  imagery

and  air quality monitoring.  We will continue to offer  such

assistance if requested by Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have since written to the Indonesian State Minister

for  the  Environment,  Dr Sonny Keraf,  to  express  to  him

Singapore's concern over the fires in Sumatra.  I  have  also

sought the co-operation of his office to undertake prompt and

firm  enforcement actions against plantation  companies  that

use  fire  to  clear land.  My counterpart in  Malaysia   has

likewise expressed his concern to Dr Keraf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current La Nina event is expected to weaken in the

months  ahead.  Weather experts have predicted  that  the  El

Nino dry conditions may return in the later half of this year

or  in  2001.   For  now,  because  of  the  prevailing  wind

directions, Singapore's air quality is not likely to be badly

affected by haze originating from fires in Sumatra.  However,

if  the fires and haze there persist in the months ahead, our

air quality can be significantly affected when the winds blow

in our direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to work closely with the

Indonesian authorities to urge them to take immediate actions

to  avert  another major haze episode.  We will also continue

to participate actively in regional and international efforts

by working closely with our other ASEAN neighbours as well as

international

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>

agencies  and donor countries on programmes that  would  help

Indonesia  improve its ability to deal with the problem.   To

this  end,  ASEAN Environment Ministers will  be  meeting  in

early April to review the situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S.C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, given that the

fires  have recurred, does the Minister believe that the  new

Indonesian  government understands the need for urgency,  and

the  fact that there is a question of credibility of the  new

reform government at stake?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much

encouraged   by  the  response  so  far  by  the   Indonesian

government,  by  President  Abdurrahman  Wahid  and  by   the

Environment Minister, Dr Sonny Keraf. I think they are trying

their best to resolve the problem which, of course, is a very

difficult  issue.  They have threatened so far  to  prosecute

and  suspend the licences of four companies which  have  been

found  to be causing the fires.  I think it is very important

for  Indonesia  to show that it has the political  commitment

and  the  will to tackle this problem and to prevent it  from

becoming a disaster for the region again.  Not only  will  it

affect  the  people living in Pekanbaru and  other  areas  in

Sumatra  and  Kalimantan near the fires, where the  haze  has

caused  the  index to shoot up at some point to about  1,000.

Over  here, when it was close to 200, we could already  smell

the  smoke and it was causing health problems.  Right  there,

near  the fire locations, the fires are really causing health

problems to the people living there.  And, of course,  it  is

burning up Indonesia's resources as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be helpful here if I inform Members about the

response  of Dr Keraf to my letter.  I am pleased  to  inform

the  House that he has responded and informed me that  ground

checks  had  confirmed that hot spots detected  by  satellite

pictures  were largely due to land clearing activities  using

fire.   He  has  assured  me that his  government  is  taking

comprehensive  measures to address the  situation,  including

strengthening its national strategy in controlling  land  and

forest fires.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Keraf also revealed that on the ground, district fire

fighting  teams have been mobilised in all regions where  hot

spots have been detected, and that law enforcement teams have

been  despatched  to  the  field  to  investigate  plantation

companies on whose land fires were detected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome Dr Keraf's public warning that his

government  would revoke the licences of forestry  concession

holders  and  plantation companies if they are  found  to  be

responsible  for any illegal burning activities.   Indonesian

President Abdurrahman Wahid himself has also reportedly  said

that his government would take all steps possible to stop the

plantation fires, and that he had personally "instructed  the

Cabinet Ministers to take measures to handle the problem."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are positive developments that demonstrate

Jakarta's  anxiousness  to do its  utmost  to  avert  another

regional  haze disaster.  Indeed, Jakarta has since announced

that  enough  evidence has been gathered against  four  large

plantation  companies in Riau, and that the authorities  were

prepared to prosecute them for flouting the law.  I hope that

all  those responsible for the catastrophic situation in Riau

recently will be brought to task soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister two further

questions?  First, given that the emphasis is on the need for

law enforcement, is there some room to focus work not only at

the  Ministry  of the Environment between our countries,  but

also  with the Attorney-General and law enforcement agencies?

My   second  question  is  that  since  large  companies  are

involved,  and  some of these companies  trade  or  may  have

Singaporean, Malaysian or other regional investments,  is  it

timely  to consider a code of conduct for Singapore companies

who  invest, trade and lend monies to companies in Indonesia,

in relation to fires?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I think it is very important for

Indonesia to make sure that its laws are clear and there  are

sufficient

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>

teeth   to  take action against the culprits.  Unfortunately,

at  the  moment, I think the laws are not really water tight.

I  read of reports in newspapers and elsewhere that they have

to  actually  get the evidence and find out who  started  the

fires,  and they have taken video pictures and so on.   There

is  also  a  need  for them to make clear  the  structure  of

enforcement.  Is it the BAPEDAL, the environment agency  that

is  responsible, or is it the forestry and plantation  people

who   are   responsible?   Or  is  it  the  local  provincial

officials?  All these have to be clarified and, of course, on

the  legal side, the Attorney-General could well play a part.

To the extent that we can help them in these areas, I am sure

we will be happy to do so within the ASEAN framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second question whether it is timely to take

action  like a code of conduct for companies, our  stand  has

consistently  been that we separate trade from other  matters

like  environment and labour.  I think that is  an  important

distinction for us to make and we have done that  during  the

WTO  meeting here and other WTO forums.  I think we  will  be

very  reluctant to depart from that position.  On  the  other

hand, if Singaporeans find the haze intolerable, on their own

they might find it not worth their while to support companies

that are causing the fires in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I was very

happy to hear from the Minister on Saturday that MOM would

like to see even a small percentage of the women who have

stopped work to return to the workforce, and also that

funding is not an issue for the Skills Redevelopment

Programme (SRP) as it has surplus unused funds.  The SRP

focuses its attention mainly on retraining retrenched workers

and on upgrading currently employed workers who have

inadequate or obsolete skills.  I believe that it does not

currently provide for housewives or homemakers, women who

have previously stopped work, to attend to family

responsibilities, but would now like to rejoin the workforce.

There are many issues to be addressed in getting women back

to work, but one of them is that these women need to be

reskilled, both from the perspective of updating their

outdated skills as well as simply to regain confidence in

being able to cope in a workplace environment again.  Flowing

from the Minister's two points on Saturday, I would like to

ask him to consider extending the support of the SRP to such

women.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, on

Saturday,  several  Members had spoken  on  skills  training,

retraining  and  the  manpower  development  aspect   of   my

Ministry's  work.   Allow  me to  take  this  opportunity  to

respond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly that skill upgrading is indeed an

urgent task and I would like to reassure all Members that  we

are pressing ahead with our manpower development efforts.   I

am  very  happy to announce that the Ministry of Finance  has

approved  my  Ministry's  plan to  deploy  the  $200  million

Manpower   Development   Assistance   Scheme   (MDAS)   which

Government agreed to in principle last year. The Ministry  of

Finance  has given full approval for the $200 million  budget

to be utilised over the next five years. The MDAS has already

been  formulated  to  support all  our  manpower  development

initiatives  by  co-funding with  employers  to  train  their

workers,  develop skills standards and also develop  learning

infrastructure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDAS will support three major programmes: the

workforce development

programmes,   the   skills  recognition   and   certification

programme   and   the  learning  infrastructure   development

programme.   $90  million has been set aside  under  MDAS  to

provide  additional  support for skills  training  under  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  Our target is to reach

100,000  workers  by the year 2003.  We have  also  allocated

$20 million over five years to support the Strategic Manpower

Conversion  Programme (SMCP) to be launched  in  April  2000.

This  was  the  programme I mentioned on Saturday.   This  is

another  skills  upgrading programme to train non-IT  workers

for  jobs  in  the rapidly growing IT industry.  We  hope  to

initially train about 300 IT specialists a year.  $40 million

will  go  to  the National Skills Recognition  System  (NSRS)

which  is an industry-driven certification system which  will

accord   national  recognition  to  skills  obtained  through

modular training.  I will have more to say about the national

recognition  skills system later.  Last, but not  least,  $50

million  has  been set aside for the development of  learning

infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to support employer-based training, the SDF levy

will  also be revised.  The salary ceiling for the collection

of  a 1% payroll levy will be raised progressive to $2,000 in

the year 2004, as announced by DPM last year.  The first step

is the increase from $1,000 to $1,500 on 1st July 2000.  This

will increase the levy collection from $20 million a year  to

$48  million a year.  The SDF will be committing  about  $100

million  in this financial year for training grants  and  the

Training Leave Scheme for older workers with lower education.

Members can see for themselves that we are, in fact,  placing

a tremendous amount of resources into manpower development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of lifelong learning is critical. We must

get  all Singaporeans to adopt lifelong learning as a way  of

life.  It  is critical for our success in the knowledge-based

economy.   While  we can provide funds and introduce  various

support mechanism, our employers and workers must adopt a new

lifelong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>

learning mindset.  From the end of March this year,  we  will

start to publicise the need and value of lifelong learning in

the  various media. This will lead to the Singapore  Learning

Festival which will take place at the end of August and early

September.  This event will further highlight the  importance

of  lifelong  learning  in  the  new  economy  by  showcasing

learning  opportunities and promoting learning as a  fun  and

rewarding experience. I hope Members will not see this as yet

another  Government campaign but as a bold new initiative  to

get  our  people to prepare for the knowledge and  technology

challenges ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong on Saturday raised the issue of

professionalising certain industries. We recognise that there

is  a group of older workers who lack the basic literacy  and

numeracy skills to be equipped with capabilities to  take  on

the new jobs.  For this group of workers, our strategy is  to

re-engineer and professionalise jobs and industries which are

currently of low value-added and are labour-intensive.  As it

stands  today,   many of these lower skilled  jobs  in  these

industries  are filled by foreign workers.  We will  continue

to  restrict the supply of unskilled foreign workers to  this

area.   At  the same time, we encourage more locals to  enter

such  occupations  by improving productivity  through  better

practices  and processes, the use of technology  and  raising

the  image  of the industry.  This strategy has already  been

initiated  in  the cleaning and construction industries.   We

are  aiming  to  transform cleaning jobs  into  trades  where

workers   can   acquire  new  skills,  operate  sophisticated

cleaning  equipment effectively and perform their  jobs  much

more  efficiently, and hence command higher wages and greater

responsibilities.  Other areas identified for job enhancement

are the hotel, retail and healthcare industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government believes that learning, while it should

be  employment  driven and employer-linked, also  requires  a

high  degree of personal motivation. For any programme to  be

successful,  the individual must be prepared to  put  in  the

time and effort for continuous learning.  Mr Ong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>

on  Saturday cited examples of workers who engage in training

but  subsequently find that they still cannot find  new  work

with their new skills.  He observed that when they started on

the  training  programme,  they  did  not  have  good  enough

information to guide them. We intend to address this  gap  by

setting  up  one-stop career centres, which I have  mentioned

earlier   on,   and  e-Career  network  to   make   available

information on learning and job opportunities. This will help

workers  make  informed  decisions on  skills  upgrading  and

career  development.  A pilot one-stop-career centre will  be

launched  later  this  year.  Mr Ong also  pointed  out  that

management  skills are also important in the new economy  and

that  we  have  to  train our managers  in  addition  to  our

workers.   For  this  purpose,  the  SDF  currently  provides

support  to  the  SMEs  for management training.   While  the

importance  of management training is recognised,  Government

support in this area should be selective and focused  on  the

companies   and  areas  of  greatest  need  since  management

training is already widely available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government is committed to encouraging

workers to engage in skills upgrading, this effort will  only

be  successful  with  strong partnership from  employers  and

workers.  Employers need to recognise that workers need their

support for training.  On the other hand, workers need to see

the  importance of training and to engage actively in  skills

upgrading.  A complacent attitude towards skills upgrading is

a  dangerous mindset.  If employers and workers do not change

this mindset and move out of the "comfort zone", we will face

a  serious problem in the future. We would see an increase in

structural unemployment with a growing mismatch between  jobs

available  and  a  growing pool of Singaporeans  lacking  the

skills  for  these  new  jobs. Our  programmes  for  manpower

development are targeted at narrowing this gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen suggested that industry experts must

be involved in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>

establishing  the National Skills Recognition  System  (NSRS)

and  that  the standards that are being set must be  reviewed

regularly.    I   agree  with  him.   The   National   Skills

Recognition System seeks to define standards for specific job-based  competencies that are relevant to industry  and  which

can  be  nationally recognised.  Such a system would make  it

easier for workers to upgrade their skills.  In addition, the

establishment  of  competency standards  and  recognition  of

skills  would  enhance  the professionalism  and  quality  of

service of the workforce.  It would enable the better trained

and  better  skilled  workers to serve their  customers  more

professionally and to offer better quality service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that industry experts must be

involved  in  setting  up  the  National  Skills  Recognition

System.  We will be identifying industry lead bodies to  take

ownership  of  the development, maintenance  and  recognition

process.  Industry lead bodies are, in fact,  key players  in

their  areas.   They  would comprise  industry  associations,

group of companies or leading companies in the industry,  and

the  economic  agency that is responsible for promoting  this

sector.   We  will  also  set  up Industry  Skills  Standards

Committee to establish skills standards, promote the National

Skills  Recognition  System  and also  review  the  standards

regularly, as suggested by Mr Chay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Skills Recognition System is currently

being tested in the hotel, cleaning and marine industries. My

Ministry  is  working  closely  with  the  Productivity   and

Standards  Board,  the  Singapore Hotels  Association  (SHA),

Environmental Management Association of Singapore (EMAS)  and

the  Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI).  They

will  drive  this pilot project.   In addition,  key  players

within these industries are consulted as well.  This includes

companies  like  Conrad International Centennial  and  Westin

Stamford  and  Westin  Plaza  in  the  hotel  industry,   ISS

Servisystem  and UMC ServiceMaster in the cleaning  industry,

and Keppel Hitachi Zosen and Sembawang Shipyard in the marine

industry.  Under this pilot run, the participating  companies

are sending

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>

about   250  workers  to  be  assessed  for  National  Skills

Recognition System certification.  We are targeting to  train

and  certify  3,000 workers in the pilot phase.  My  Ministry

will proactively seek out the industries, including the small

and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which can  provide  jobs

after  NSRS training, and also participate in the development

of  standards.  This will address the point raised by Mr Seng

Han  Thong  on  Saturday.   He  was  concerned  that  smaller

companies may not be involved in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng also suggested that the NSRS take into account

the needs and capabilities of older workers.  I agree on that

score  too.   Under  the National Skills Recognition  System,

workers  are  trained and certified according to  the  skills

standards set by industry.  They do so in modules, small bite

sizes,  which they can digest easily, tailored  to  meet  the

capabilities and working experience of older workers.   There

is  thus a lot of flexibility for them.  They can progress at

a  pace  that they are comfortable with.  NSRS trainers  will

develop  suitable software to meet the needs of older workers

in  the industry.  This will encourage more older workers  to

undergo skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the remarks by Mr Low Thia Khiang.

Unfortunately, he is not here this morning.  Mr Low made  the

point   that   training  programmes  must  be  supported   by

employers, which I agree.  He would like more information  to

be  communicated on the opportunities available for  training

upgrading.   That is also an area we agree upon and  that  is

something   that  my  Ministry  will  pursue  to  extensively

publicise all the various training programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to say that during the recession in 1998

and  early  1999  a  lot of workers had difficulties  getting

jobs.   If  his  purpose is to imply that we have  not  given

these  workers  sufficient assistance or rendered  sufficient

support to workers who are affected by the downturn, I  would

like  to  take  this  opportunity to correct  the  impression

because, on the contrary, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>

is  true  that my Ministry has been very proactive in helping

unemployed workers secure employment, particularly during the

economic downturn in 1998 and even early 1999.  We have  been

especially  proactive in helping the lower skilled  group  of

older workers who had the greatest difficulty in seeking  re-employment.   In fact, in 1998, it was quite clear  that  the

economy was going to take a turn for the worse.  We set up an

employment  facilitation team to proactively  hunt  for  jobs

from  various  employers and to offer these job opportunities

to  workers  who are affected by retrenchment or workers  who

registered with the Employment Department of my Ministry.  My

Ministry was present during the most difficult period of  the

economic downturn in 1998 and 1999 at most of the large scale

retrenchment  exercises conducted by various  companies.   In

many  of these exercises, we also arranged suitable companies

that  were still recruiting workers to be present on site  to

immediately   offer   retrenched  workers   alternative   job

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also worked closely with the CDCs, self-help

groups, NTUC and economic agencies to organise many job fairs

during  1998  and 1999.   In 1999, for example, we  organised

more than 10 large scale job fairs.  We publicised these  job

fairs  extensively  through newspapers, radio  advertisement,

posters, personal letters to retrenched workers and  also  to

the  community grassroots organisations and the various self-help networks.  As a result of our publicity effort, the  job

fairs  were  very  well attended.  Some of  these  job  fairs

attracted  crowds of 3,000 people looking for  job  placement

assistance.   At  every  such event, my Ministry's  officers,

together with representatives of NTUC, the CDCs and self-help

groups,  would  be on hand to offer advice and assistance  on

employment  and  the  training  assistance  that   would   be

available.  In fact, in November 1998, we worked with Hougang

CDC to organise a community job fair at the Hougang Community

Centre, and this would certainly have benefited residents  of

Hougang constituency.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been very proactive in helping retrenched

workers  who  are under-skilled or low skilled  to  enrol  in

training.   We work with the CDCs, NTUC and various  employer

groups  to encourage these workers to take up training  under

the Skills Redevelopment Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this will address the points that he mentioned

and  I  reiterate that there is no basis to say that we  have

not  been  paying sufficient attention to the needs  of  this

lower  educated  or lower skilled group of  workers  who  are

affected by the downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mdm Claire Chiang who on Saturday spoke

about  the  difficulties facing different groups of  workers.

She  was  more concerned with the middle management  and  the

executive  group  who  also faced job  pressures  during  the

economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that it is true that in our approach to

retraining and skills upgrading, we focus on the needs of the

lowest  level  of workers, the least educated and  the  lower

skilled  group  of  workers.  This is because  it  forms  the

largest  group.  About 500,000 of our workers have less  than

secondary  education.   So this is the  group  that  is  most

vulnerable to structural unemployment and most likely  to  be

displaced  as  industries upgrade to  higher  technology  and

higher skills level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the executive and middle level managers, most are

well educated, as I mentioned earlier on in my response to Mr

Ong  Ah Heng.  They already receive fairly good education and

for  many,  they  have been working for  some  years  in  the

company  and  have  very good working  experience  and  track

records  also.  Our universities and polytechnics offer  many

opportunities for continuing education and training which are

available  to  this group of people, and they are  the  group

that  would  have  the most resources available  to  them  to

continue such training.  The Singapore Institute of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>

Management and other private sector educational providers are

also  doing  a  thriving  business offering  many  management

upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the raising of the salary ceiling for contributions

to  the  SDF,  which I have mentioned earlier on,  would,  in

fact,  help this group too.  Because once the salary  ceiling

is  raised to $2,000, SDF would be able to allocate  more  of

its  available resources to provide training for  the  middle

level  managers.  For this group of executives and management

personnel,  they are, of course, also able to use the  income

tax relief of $2,500 for individual upgrading programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not to say that we do not have any programme

for  this  group  of  Singaporeans.  In fact,  our  Strategic

Manpower  Conversion  Programme, which  I  had  mentioned  on

Saturday, could possibly be extended in the future  to  cover

this  group.   Initially,  when  we  launched  the  Strategic

Manpower Conversion Programme, we were going to focus on  the

IT  industry.   That is the area where there is the  greatest

need  for  IT-trained manpower and there is a growing  demand

which  cannot  be  met.  So we are trying to  convert  non-IT

trained people to take on these new jobs.  But later on, with

the  benefit  of  experience of  our  initial  launch  in  IT

industry,  we  could  expand this programme  to  cover  other

areas,  in management areas, for instance.  So we can  create

opportunity for management personnel to change profession  to

respond to the new demands that are emerging in the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also encourage Chambers of Commerce and various

industry  associations to set up their own life-long learning

programmes  for  their  managers and executives.   Under  the

Manpower   Development  Assistance  Scheme,  which   I   have

mentioned  earlier  on, we have allocated  funds  to  develop

training infrastructures.  We can make use of those resources

to  assist Chambers of Commerce and industry organisations to

set up this kind of training facilities.  My understanding is

that  the  Singapore National Employers'  Federation  is,  in

fact, embarking on one such initiative.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, I would like to point out

that  those  with tertiary educational qualifications  -  the

managers  and  the  executives  -  are  already  much  better

equipped   to  adjust  with  the  changes  in  the   economic

environment, compared to the less educated and lower  skilled

workers.   For  the  managers and the executives,  there  are

options  for  seeking new employment, going into business  on

their   own,  becoming  self-employed,  and  be  free  agents

offering   their   expertise   and   services   on   a   more

entrepreneurial scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual drive and enterprise will ultimately

determine how each person will be able to make a living.   It

is  important  that  they also adopt this life-long  learning

mindset  to  prepare themselves, to keep themselves  relevant

and up-to-date with what is needed in the job market.  A high

degree  of individual proactiveness is required and  will  be

helpful  to them in anticipation of any economic downturn  or

any sudden changes in their job prospects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to draw Members' attention to an

article  in  The Asian Wall Street Journal on the 3rd-4th  of

March  (the  Friday-Saturday paper), which is headlined  "Old

Manager  Learns  New Tricks".  The article is  based  on  the

story  of a Korean executive.  I am sure we will find similar

examples  in  Singapore  also which may  not  yet  have  been

highlighted.  I am quite confident we have similar  inspiring

examples.   This  article tells the story of  a  50-year  old

Korean  executive  who  was  facing  retrenchment  from  this

company.   Instead of sitting around and bemoaning his  fate,

he  looked around to see which other sector offered  him  the

best  opportunity.  He concluded that the growth  sector  was

the    telecommunications    industry    in    Korea.     The

telecommunications companies were the ones  that  were  still

recruiting.  So he found a telecommunications company (Telco)

that  is planning to replace a manager in about five  or  six

months'  time, and he decided that he wanted to try for  this

job.   He  is  a 50-year old competing with the 30s  and  the

early 40s.  He spent four months learning everything he could

about  Telco operations and management, learning from friends

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>

the business, reading from books and magazines.  He even went

to  the extent of giving up his golf to jog regularly so that

he can improve his physical appearance to compete with the 30-something who would turn up for the interview.  Well, he  got

the  job.   From  the story, those of you who are  interested

should read the article, the employer is very happy with  his

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the moral of it is that there is a lot of individual

responsibility, there is a lot that we can do  as  a  person,

faced  with  such an unpleasant situation.  If  we  make  the

effort, I think it would pay off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Dr Jennifer Lee who asked what are the

training  opportunities for housewives who want  to  re-enter

the workforce.  If we have SRP for workers who are retrenched

or  facing retrenchment, what assistance is available to help

housewives refresh and update their skills so that  they  can

go back to work?  In this regard, we are taking a two-pronged

approach.   First, the Productivity and Standards  Board  has

introduced  core skills training programme for  job  seekers.

This  was  set in place since September 1996.  And  over  the

years  we  have trained about 5,000 new employees,  including

many  women.  They were equipped with new skills or to update

their  old skills so that they could fit into the new working

environment.   The  second  approach  is  that  managers  and

supervisors  must  also  be trained on  how  to  nurture  and

develop  their  new  employees, who have just  re-joined  the

workforce,  because you have to treat them a bit differently.

You  have to manage them in a different way because, although

they have past working experience, they may have been out  of

touch  for  some years, raising children, looking  after  the

family.   Since  they are newly back into the workforce,  you

have to manage them differently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have training programmes for managers and

supervisors,  and several hundred managers have been  trained

under these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 and 1997, we started to look at how to get more

women back into the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>

workforce.  We had a committee called Back-to-Work Committee,

chaired  by  Mrs  Tan  Ai Lian, to study the  various  issues

concerned.  But in 1998, because of the economic downturn, it

seemed  to  be less critical and less necessary to  launch  a

massive  effort to get women back into the workforce, because

we  were  already having very high unemployment rate.  So  we

scaled  back  the programme in this area.  But now  that  the

economy has recovered and employers are again crying out  for

more  workers, I think it is appropriate to revisit all these

old  areas and see what more we can do in order to help women

re-enter the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, we launched the Critical Enabling

Skills  Training  programme  or  CREST  programme.   We   are

thinking of using this CREST programme to replace the Back-to-Work  Core Skills Training Programme.  The PSB has set  aside

$200  million for this CREST programme.  This is  a  separate

programme.   They  have  allocated  $200  million  for   this

programme  which will equip workers with critical  skills  to

enable them to acquire new skills and competency in the  job.

The  CREST programme basically gives workers tools with which

they  can learn new skills.  It is not imparting job specific

skills  but  giving them the tools for them  to  acquire  new

skills on the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are thinking of including IT as one of the packages

under the CREST programme, because IT is nowadays required in

many jobs that are available.  So housewives who want to  re-enter the workforce will find this aspect of IT training very

useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the CREST programme has been

making  good progress. As of February 2000, there were 21,000

providers  providing 87 training modules in the  seven  CREST

skills.  To-date, more than 24,000 CREST training places have

been  taken  up  by workers.  We have found  it  to  be  more

effective  and appropriate to encourage employers to  recruit

housewives  and to send them for CREST training, rather  than

to train housewives first and then try to find a job for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>

them.   So this is the approach that we will take.   We  will

encourage  and support employers who are willing  to  recruit

housewives.  And once they are recruited, we will  send  them

for  the full range of CREST training and subsequently follow

up with any job specific skills training that is required.  I

think  this would be a more productive approach and it  would

maximise return on our investments in training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered all the points raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to advise hon. Members that

we  are  very far behind schedule for this amendment, and  we

have  three more amendments on this Head.  In order  for  the

three  amendments  to  be  heard,  I  propose  to  drop   the

"guillotine" on this amendment at around 2.05 pm.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, may I seek one clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> On the NSRS for older workers

employed   by  SMEs,  may  I  know  whether  the  medium   of

instruction will also be in Malay or Mandarin, as the problem

of  the older workers is that when they attend these classes,

they  may "liak bo kiu" or "catch no ball", which means  they

cannot fully understand.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, let me reassure Members that

when   we  set  up  the  training  for  the  National  Skills

Recognition  System,  we will look  at  the  profile  of  the

workers who are coming for the particular course.  There  may

be  instances where we will have to resort to using languages

other  than  English to communicate lessons and the  training

materials to them.  We are prepared to consider this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I also inform the hon. Member that

the    language   he   has   used   earlier   is   considered

unparliamentary.  I must ask you to withdraw those words.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the

questions   which   I  would  like  to  raise   are   whether

Singaporeans are financially prepared for retirement and,  if

not, what is the Ministry proposing to do about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue has assumed significance because of a finding

by  an  Inter-Ministerial Committee that  unless  they  start

planning  now, Singaporeans may not have enough  savings  for

their  old  age.   This  finding is  supported  by  anecdotal

evidence.  Reports carried by the Straits Times suggest  that

Singaporeans may have seriously over-estimated their  ability

to meet their future needs.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the facts? In 1995, the median CPF balance at

age  55  was  $86,000, equivalent to only 32  months  of  the

average salary then.  That figure is inclusive of withdrawals

for housing and other investments which means that the actual

cash balance is much less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 CPF annual report disclosed that among those

close  to retirement, that is, people in the 50-55 age group,

only half of some 80,000 active members have balances of more

than  $150,000.  Again, that sum include sums  withdrawn  for

housing  and other investments.  So the cash element is  much

less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing what is available is only half the story. How

much  do  Singaporeans  require  in  retirement?   Needs  and

expectations have increased by leaps and bounds.  There are a

number  of  reasons  for  this:   first,  greater  longevity,

second,  better  lifestyles today, and  third,  a  desire  to

maintain that lifestyle into retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a shot at a decent lifestyle after retirement,

you would need per month at least the equivalent of what $750

can  purchase today, with no mortgage on your house, no  hire

purchase on your car, and no other debt.  Not many people are

going to have that kind of cash when they retire.  You do not

have to be a financial wizard to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>

quickly  work  out that unless Singaporeans have  substantial

voluntary savings, we may be running into a serious problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the year 2030, Singapore will have nearly 800,000

people  aged  above 65.  That is 19% of the population.   How

are they going to manage if they do not have sufficient cash?

Their  children have their own expectations and  obligations.

The reverse mortgage scheme will help but can it take care of

all  affected  members  without diluting  the  value  of  the

underlying  properties, and thereby affecting the  amount  of

cash that will be ultimately available?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has this come about? The CPF scheme was implemented

to help Singaporeans prepare for retirement.  It is a prudent

policy.  But it has had a wholly unintended effect.   It  has

led many Singaporeans to believe that their CPF reserves will

be  sufficient in their retirement to maintain their  present

standard of living.  It has lulled Singaporeans into a  false

sense  of complacency.  The figures show that this confidence

is misplaced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should be told that their CPF savings may

not  be enough, and in many cases will not be enough.   Their

CPF reserves are already being eaten into for other permitted

uses,  which  are  not  as  liquid  as  cash  and  which  can

depreciate  in value.  As for the cash, CPF balances  do  not

earn  the  best interest rates.  One economist has calculated

that  the  CPF real rate of interest from 1987  to  1998  was

zero, because of inflation.  Add to that, the fact that  many

among  the  self-employed, who account for about  8%  of  the

working population, do not contribute to CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, this misperception of the size of the CPF

safety  net  is  not  the  only cause  of  the  problem.   In

Singapore, a culture of instant gratification is taking root.

As a result not many Singaporeans plan for the future.  It is

very  important that the Government lay out the facts so that

Singaporeans understand what is in store for them  when  they

retire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a sad irony if the CPF policy, which was

designed to help us in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>

old  age, is blamed for hurting us in our retirement  because

the  policy  led Singaporeans to make some false  assumptions

about their worth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do well to lay out the facts and the figures.

It  will  be  worth our time and money to give  each  account

holder an idea of how long his savings are likely to last  at

different  levels  of  expenditure,  taking  inflation   into

account.  It will be a rough guide at best.  But Singaporeans

need  to have some information and to act on it if we are  to

avoid a major problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to bring

up  a  similar  subject  of provision  for  retirement,  just

brought up by Mr Davinder Singh, and this is on the extension

of  retirement age.  Since the extension of retirement age to

62  was implemented in January 1999, I received feedback from

older workers and union members who would like to work beyond

the  age  of  62.   This is in stark contrast from  reactions

received  when the issue of extension of retirement  age  was

first  brought  up.  Then some workers mistakenly  asked  why

they  should be compelled to work beyond the age of  60.   Of

course, there is no compulsion as the extended retirement age

has given workers the option to work beyond the age of 60.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are practical people. They want to

maintain their lifestyle in old age and would like to work to

achieve  that.  They want to continue working  beyond  62  so

that they can remain financially independent.  Sir, there are

older Singaporeans who need to work because they do not  get,

or  they get very little financial support from their  family

members,  or  they  do  not have sufficient  CPF  savings  to

support  their retirement.  We should stay on course  towards

the long-term plan for the extension of retirement age to 67.

Towards  this end, the tripartite partners can start  talking

to  prepare for the eventual extension of retirement age  to,

first, 65 and then 67 in years to come.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a small workforce and, as a result of that, we

have  to  bring in foreign workers to support our  workforce.

Other than encouraging our housewives to go back to work,  we

can  tap  the  resources and services of our  older  workers.

Even  if  we are not going to implement further extension  to

the  retirement  age in the immediate future,  we  can  start

discussing the matter among the tripartite partners  so  that

we  can  understand the issues and problems of the respective

parties before we can start negotiating.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe):</b> Sir, let me first respond to Mr Davinder

Singh.   Sir,  the  1995 National Survey on  Senior  Citizens

showed  that the majority of citizens aged 55 and  above  did

not  make  any  financial provision for  old  age.   Ensuring

financial  security  in  old  age  is  therefore  a   serious

challenge for an ageing population, especially for one  which

is rapidly ageing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past 45 years, the CPF Board has helped

Singaporeans  to save for retirement.  In more recent  years,

the  Board  has  conducted a public  education  programme  to

remind  CPF  members  on the need to  plan  early  for  their

financial security in old age.  Sir, this is done through the

CPF  NewsLine,  media features and special supplements.   The

Board's public education programme is targeted at CPF members

in  the different age groups.  It emphasises that CPF is  for

old  age  and  that CPF members should make  a  conscientious

effort  in  planning the use of their CPF savings  under  the

various schemes.  Sir, the CPF Board's projections show  that

at  the long-term contribution of 40%, CPF savings should  be

sufficient  for  basic retirement, health  care  and  housing

needs.  Sir, however, there is a tendency for CPF members  to

take  for granted that their CPF savings will allow  them  to

maintain the same living standards and lifestyle after  their

retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to remind CPF

members  that all their CPF assets, including cash  in  their

CPF accounts, property and investments are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>

for  their  old age needs.  Some may have bought a  house  or

apartment  which is more than what their income can  actually

support.   So these members could end up asset rich and  cash

poor.  If such members wish to retain their properties bought

with  their CPF savings, they should put aside more  personal

savings  on  their  own to supplement their  CPF  savings  or

continue  working for as long as they can.   Otherwise,  when

their   cash  savings  run  low,  they  have  to  sell  their

properties and move to smaller units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the HDB has started to build studio apartments in

various  parts  of Singapore.  These studio  apartments  will

help  those who need to transfer to smaller flats to free  up

their  savings for retirement needs.  Hence, if  Singaporeans

desire  to maintain a higher standard of living on retirement

and  want a more comfortable retirement life, they should put

aside  personal savings over and above the CPF.  Sir, as  the

Member pointed out, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing

Population reinforced the need for individuals to plan  early

for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in support of the Committee's recommendation, the

CPF  Board has stepped up its public education programme  and

work with related agencies, such as the Ministry of Community

Development   and  the  Financial  Planning  Association   of

Singapore to reach out to different target groups on the need

to  "Take  Charge" and "Plan Early" for a secure future.   An

example  of  such  an  effort was  the  "Achieving  Financial

Security  and Personal Happiness" seminar, recently organised

by  the  Financial Planning Association of Singapore and  the

Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE) in which  the  CPF

Board has taken an active role to promote the seminar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the CPF Board stepping up its public education

programme, together with the related agencies, we  hope  that

Singaporeans would plan early for their old age needs and are

able  to  enjoy  the desired living standards  and  lifestyle

after their retirement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will deal with the question which was posed by

Mr  Hawazi  Daipi.   He  has pointed  out  that  the  minimum

retirement  age  was raised from 60 to 62 years  with  effect

from 1st January 1999.  Sir, it is a bit too early for us  to

review  the  minimum  retirement age at  this  juncture.   We

should  allow  for  more  time  for  companies  to  make  the

necessary  adjustments and implement the  recommendations  of

the  Tripartite Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age.

However,  the Ministry will monitor closely the  progress  of

the implementation and carry out a review when the timing  is

more appropriate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

Singapore  is a small country with a small population.  To  a

certain  extent  , we have been depending on foreign  workers

to   help  sustain  our  economic  development.   Take  local

factories, for example.  But for the great number of  foreign

workers  to make up for the shortfall in our local  workforce

in  this sector, we would not be able to sustain the momentum

of  our production in Singapore, and the factories would  not

have  survived.   In  turn, the survival of  these  factories

provides  our  local  labourers with the   opportunities  for

employment.   Therefore,  our trade unions  and  people  also

recognise  and  affirm  the  contributions  of  the   foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recently attended the ILO Asia-Pacific Seminar on

Foreign  Workers.  It was established at the seminar that  as

compared  to  other  countries,  Singapore  is  in  a  better

position  to  give  better protection  and  benefits  to  the

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last year's Labour Day celebration, the Minister for

Manpower  said  that  foreign  workers  enjoyed  equal  legal

protection and the various basic welfare schemes as our local

workers   in   Singapore.   In  certain  circumstances,   the

Government  even went to the extent of amending the  Criminal

Procedure  Code  to give greater protection  to  the  foreign

workers, like the domestic maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of foreign workers in Singapore is very

large.  We have about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>

400,000 foreign workers in Singapore.  In the media, we  have

occasions to learn of incidents of ill treatment or abuse  of

foreign  workers.  For example, on the 5th of  March,  Lianhe

Wanbao  mentioned  the poor living conditions of some workers

and  cases  of  abuse of foreign domestic  maids.   From  the

picture,  we  could  see that it is like an  indented  labour

hostel during the colonial days.  Although such cases are few

and   far  between,  maybe,  one  out  of  10,000,  it   does

nevertheless  have an undermining effect on  our  reputation,

and  give our neighbouring countries a wrong impression  that

we   have  treated  our  foreign  employees  very  badly   in

Singapore.  So  we must consider measures to deal  with  such

irresponsible employers. But I think, more importantly,  with

our    globalisation   and   economic   reform,   we   should

substantively  reduce our dependence on foreign  labour.   In

the sectors which are more dependent on foreign workers, such

as the construction industry, I hope the Ministry of Manpower

will try and help the industry to raise their productivity by

introducing innovative construction methods to cut down their

manpower  requirements.  MOM should shorten the timeframe  in

tightening  the Man-Year-Entitlement.  I also hope  that  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  would  look  into  the  accommodation

condition  for  the  foreign workers.   We  must  tackle  the

problem at the roots.  Here, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  the  present  system of work permit  allocation  has

achieved  its desired outcome and does the Ministry have  any

plan to reduce the problems of repatriation.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would advise Members to be brief with

their  speeches, otherwise we would not be able  to  complete

discussion on this Head. Mr Thomas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we have a

significant  number  of  foreign  workers  and  they  make  a

significant contribution to our economy.  Moreover,  being  a

nation  of  migrants, our forefathers, at one time or  other,

were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>

foreign  workers.  Because of this, I completely  agree  with

the  sentiments  that  the  Minister  expressed  on  Saturday

regarding  treatment  and  welfare  provisions  for   foreign

workers.  Because of that, I just have got two points that  I

want to bring up today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that the way many foreign workers come to

Singapore  is  through employment agents and  many  of  these

employment  agents  profit from workers who  are  desperately

trying  to  get  out  of  the  poverty  trap  in  their  home

countries.  We  say that labour should not be  treated  as  a

commodity  but  the  way the whole system works  where  these

people  pay the agents for a chance to work here, it is  more

than  a  commodity. These agents collect the money,  many  on

false  promises,  and  sometimes, they are  brought  in  here

illegally.   To maximise profits, some of these  agents  work

with  employers to change them more frequently.  In all these

cases, workers end up the losers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower to review

the  way  that they bring these workers in.  I know  we  have

modified  some  schemes  but  can  we  also  look  into   the

possibility  of a Government agency being the sole  authority

to  bring in these foreign workers and cut off many of  these

unscrupulous employment agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that while we are bringing in foreign

workers  cheaply,  we also have problems, which  many  of  my

fellow Members have raised, on older workers finding it  very

difficult  to  get jobs. Most of the time, the older  workers

are  the first to be retrenched.  Foreign workers are  mostly

cheaper.   We find a lot of evidence and stories around  that

the  employers  do  depress their wages, especially  for  the

unskilled  levels. We would also like to get  some  assurance

from MOM on what is taking place to ensure that the interests

of  the  older  workers  are also there  and  wages  are  not

depressed too low with cheap foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wish to

refer to the work permits for unskilled foreign workers, now

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>

known  as  RO  passes,  being  administered  by  the  Foreign

Manpower  Employment  Division of the Ministry  of  Manpower.

Under  the  current policy, semi-skilled,  that  is  R1,  and

unskilled,  R2, foreign workers are granted an R work  passes

for two years. Although employers can apply for the extension

for  such  work  passes,  they can  file  no  more  than  two

extensions.  Therefore, an unskilled foreign worker  is  only

allowed  to  work in Singapore for a maximum  of  six  years.

Although  I  appreciate that this cap is imposed to  minimise

the  social  problems resulting from the protracted  stay  of

unskilled  foreign workers in Singapore, certain  sectors  of

the   manufacturing  industry  are  heavily  reliant  on  the

contribution  of  these so-called unskilled foreign  workers.

These  workers  may  not possess any paper qualifications  or

professional   skills.    They  are,   nevertheless,   highly

proficient  and  experienced in their  respective  jobs.   It

normally  takes a number of years to train up this  group  of

unskilled   workers,  who  are  well-versed  with  production

processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore a pity that by the time they have become

fully  trained,  their employment may have to  be  terminated

under  the  current  policy.  Once  these  unskilled  foreign

workers  have  reached  the maximum of  six  years'  stay  in

Singapore and are thus required to leave, employers  have  no

choice  but  to  recruit another  batch of unskilled  foreign

workers  and  train  them all over again before  they  become

competent  enough. Overall, productivity  will  suffer  as  a

result.   Employers  are faced with the  dilemma  for  it  is

critical that the production process should not be disrupted.

Recruiting   locally   is  also  not   a   solution   because

Singaporeans are not interested in jobs of this nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the circumstances, we wish to appeal to the

Government  to  exercise greater flexibility  and  relax  the

policy  for  extension  of work passes  in  the  interest  of

achieving optimal manufacturing productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I go on to my second cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many of our

friends  in  the construction, food and beverage  and  retail

business  are  telling me that it is more and more  difficult

for  employers to carry on with their business  in  Singapore

nowadays.   Because of acute shortage in local workers,  they

have no choice but to depend on foreign workers, in order  to

survive  and  to develop.  However, under the very  stringent

provisions  under the Employment Act, they  are  like  "birds

startled  by the mean twang of a bow-string", that is,  badly

frightened people. Every day, they have to deal gingerly with

all  sorts of labour problems. However, it is sometimes  very

hard to guard against all eventualities.  Make one slip,  and

you  will be charged in court with contravention against  the

labour  laws, and face fines, jail sentence, and even caning.

They are in a very sorry plight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that there is an upward trend in the

number  of  businessmen being charged in  court  with  labour

offences every day. I wonder if the Minister can enlighten us

on the relevant statistics. Let everyone know what crimes our

business   people,  particularly  those  in  the  SMEs,   are

committing.  Can MOM leave one side of the net open, and give

these enterprising business people some chances by not taking

them to court at every turn, as it would run contrary to  the

Government's policy to encourage Singaporeans to venture  and

be enterprising?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when implementing its policy on foreign workers,

the  Government  seems to have taken  the  easy  way  out  by

pushing all the responsibilities relating to the labour  laws

to  the  employers.   This  kind of  "lopsided"  policy,  and

implemented by the inhumane and bureaucratic civil  servants,

is  bound  to create havoc and invite complaints  from  those

affected.  By taking such a confrontational stand against the

employers, the Government has completely destroyed the spirit

of tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore parents all wanting their children to

grow  up  to  be somebody and the popularisation of  national

education, the younger generation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans   generally do not want to  work  as  labourers,

salespersons,   waiters  or  lower-level   workers   in   the

construction  and retail industries.  Yet, at whatever  stage

of  development our nation is, we would still  need  to  have

such a workforce to support the sustained development of such

SMEs.   In  the circumstances, MOM should conduct an  overall

review  and  re-planning  of our policy on  foreign  workers,

based  on the present and future needs of foreign workers  in

the  various  industries in Singapore. It should  adopt  more

proactive measures to assist the various SMEs in Singapore to

source for supply of workers from overseas, in order to solve

the   problem  of  acute  labour  shortage  in  the  relevant

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government can change its confrontational

stand  against the employers and solve the problem of  labour

shortage of the SMEs in the same way it assists the  GLCs  in

recruiting  their  senior  staff, the  suppliers  of  illegal

foreign workers will have no room to manoeuvre, and they will

have  to beat their retreat in the face of difficulties.   In

this  way, the Government would not have to waste such a  lot

of  resources  to  deal with all these problems  relating  to

illegal foreign workers.  At the moment, the syndicate  which

specialises  in smuggling illegal workers must  have  spotted

the  weakness in the Government's enforcement of  the  labour

laws,  that  is, taking the local employers as the scapegoats

and not pursuing the root of evil of these syndicates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in most cases, the employers who were

charged  in  court  were small time shopowners and coffeeshop

operators.  Very often, they did not examine the authenticity

of  the  documents produced by the prospective employees  and

mistakably took in one or two illegal foreign workers.  As  a

result,  they  were  charged  in  court,  while  the  illegal

syndicates  which forged the work permits got off  scot-free.

In  the meantime, the illegal workers themselves got to  stay

in Singapore longer so that they could testify as prosecution

witnesses against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>

their poor employers.  They were even allowed to work here to

raise  money  to  buy their tickets to  fly  home.   In  such

circumstances,  how  could we expect those  affected  in  the

business  community to have good feelings  towards  and  have

confidence  in  the Government?  Worse still, will  this  not

result  in  a wrong signal being sent by the Government  that

its  policy  is  conducive to the activities of  the  illegal

workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with a very heavy heart, I am reflecting a genuine

labour  shortage predicament of our friends in  the  business

community.   It is often said that "good advice jars  on  the

ear".   But I hope that the Minister would seriously consider

conducting  a  thorough  review of  the  current  policy  and

legislation on foreign workers as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, as a matter of

policy,   the   Government   has  encouraged   companies   to

regionalise  and hive-off their lower value-added  activities

to  lower labour cost countries.    Many companies have  done

so  but  some  are  facing obstacles in  terms  of  the  slow

approval process to bring in their foreign manpower for short-term  training  attachments in Singapore.  I have  learnt  of

cases  where the approval process has taken as long as  three

months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an aggressive global business environment where speed

matters   a  lot,  this  imposes  constraints  to  businesses

headquartered   in   Singapore  with   support   subsidiaries

elsewhere  in  the  region.   In many  cases  also,  products

manufactured  in regional subsidiaries are semi-finished  and

have  to be brought back to Singapore for further value-added

operations  to  be  performed on the products.  The  lack  of

trained workers in the companies' off-shore subsidiaries will

therefore  affect the performance and reputation of Singapore

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Manpower to review

what  causes  the  delay  in  approving  training  attachment

requests  of  foreign manpower, and to assist in facilitating

and streamlining the approval process so that companies do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>

not  have  to wait very long to bring their foreign  manpower

for training to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, when

foreign  experts, including the performing artistes  come  to

Singapore to work on short assignments of a few months,  they

always encounter difficulties with the authorities.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has announced that there would

be  two  categories of permits.  For those earning more  than

$2,000  a month, they can apply for professional visit passes

and those below $2,000, permits. But this will also give rise

to  some  problems, particularly to the performing  artistes.

When  they  come  to  Singapore to  help  with  some  of  the

performing  groups  and clan associations  to  help  them  to

compose  songs  or  to take part in their performances,  they

would  normally  come  a short time just  before  the  actual

performance for rehearsals.  They would not stay for  a  long

time.   Some of these performing artistes come from countries

where  the background is quite different from ours.  If their

pay  is below $2,000 per month, then they will have to  apply

for a work permit and not a professional visit pass.  For the

performing  groups or associations in Singapore,  every  time

they apply for a performing artiste to come in, they have  to

furnish  a  bank guarantee of $5,000.  If there are  four  of

them,  they  have  to  furnish bank guarantees  amounting  to

$20,000.   This is a burden for those who are not financially

strong.   Furthermore, these foreign experts who may be  well

respected  in  their own countries were treated  as  ordinary

foreign workers here, and told to affix their thumb prints on

the  papers. It is an insult to them.  I have heard a lot  of

complaints   about  this.    These  are  all   administrative

problems  which  can  be resolved through  some  coordination

among MOM, MHA and MCD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreign experts, we should have a special Work

Permit  (Arts) so that these performing artistes who come  in

do not have to affix their thumbprints, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>

the   sponsors  may  be  exempted  from  furnishing  a   bank

guarantee.  If it is a clan association, so long as  you  are

verified by the Singapore Federation of Clan Associations, it

should  be  enough.   I  hope that the three  Ministries  can

coordinate  better so that it will be easier for our  foreign

experts  to come and help us enhance the standard of cultural

performances in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the

core  ideals in the Singapore 21 Report is developing  strong

families.  It is the hope of realising this ideal that I want

to  raise  the issue of work permit holders who are attracted

to work in Singapore and who themselves are attractive enough

for  Singaporeans  to  propose  to  them.   The  Ministry  of

Manpower's  permission has to be sought before a work  permit

holder  is allowed to get married.  Obtaining this permission

is  itself  no easy task.  I hope the Ministry  can  be  more

upfront with evaluation criteria relating to this issue.  But

even  when  MOM  gives permission, couples do not  just  lead

normal  lives and join other happy Singaporean newly-weds  to

raise families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have to go through another institution to ensure

that  the  foreign spouse can stay in Singapore  -  the  SIR.

Usually,  they are given long-term social visit  passes,  but

long-term  passes can range from a few weeks to a few  years.

Sir,  I do not see how strong families can develop out  of  a

situation  where one of the spouses and would-be parent  live

in  uncertainty as to whether he or she will  be  allowed  to

stay  in  Singapore.  Naturally, faced with the  prospect  of

continual  uncertainty, many who get married this way  almost

always  apply for PR status, and in many instances  they  are

not  successful, adding to the uncertainty of their  stay  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister whether his Ministry will

work  closely with SIR to develop a policy that would provide

certainty  and assurance to couples and families facing  this

situation.   A policy based on strong families, it  seems  to

me,  requires  the  assurance  of  an  undisturbed  stay   in

Singapore for the foreign spouses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>

of Singaporeans.  MOM has the first task of ascertaining that

the foreign work permit holder should be given the permission

to  marry.  It should take into account the prospect of  long

term residence in this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only ask that what MOM has joined together, SIR

should not put asunder.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I want to thank all the Members

who raised various issues on work permit and foreign workers.

In  case  I  do not have time because of the "guillotine"  to

reply  to all their questions, may I suggest that they  raise

them on another occasion as Questions for Oral Answer so that

I can give them a full reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take the points raised by Mr Yeo Guat

Kwang.   I  think he asked for better policies to look  after

foreign  workers  who  are  here in  Singapore,  particularly

housing  and recreational facilities.  I think the point  has

been  addressed  in  my answer to Mr Gerard  Ee  on  Saturday

morning.  So I would not belabour that point again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to say that we have continued to keep our

labour  market  open  to  foreign  workers  in  the  economic

sectors,  because many employers, in fact, do  require  these

foreign  workers.   We continue to educate the  employers  on

their   rights  and  responsibilities  in  employing  foreign

workers;  and  in the case of foreign workers, in  coming  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the employers' dependency, Mr Yeo

suggested  that  we  should try to reduce the  dependency  on

foreign  workers.  This is in stark contrast with the request

by  the Nominated Member who wants my Ministry to review  our

foreign worker policy to allow employers, especially  in  the

SME  sector, to have more foreign workers.  So we have to try

to maintain a balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is that foreign workers are welcome. We

understand that some employers need them, but it cannot be an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>

unrestricted entry into Singapore.  There must always be some

moderating rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also raised several points with particular focus

on   construction   workers,  referring   to   the   man-year

entitlement allocation system.  This is a new system that  we

are using to allocate the foreign workers to the construction

sector.   My Minister of State will have more to say on  that

later in response to a cut on Construction 21.  So if he will

be patient, he will get the answer later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas suggested that we review the ways we bring

foreign  workers  to  Singapore.  He  suggested  that   maybe

Government act as a central employment recruiting  agency  to

bring  all  the foreign workers into Singapore.  Let  me  say

that we are aware that there are malpractices going on in the

recruitment  process of foreign workers.   But  not  all  the

problems originate in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our understanding of the way the foreign workers are

recruited is that the Singapore employment agent works with a

counterpart in the home country.  We must remember that these

are  huge  countries  and the workers who  want  to  come  to

Singapore come from various parts of the countries.  Some are

from very remote rural areas.  No single agency can reach out

to  all these potential foreign workers out there.  They need

a  local agent who knows the country and people well, and who

knows the procedures within the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, the abuses or the exploitation of the

foreign  workers begin with his own employment agent  in  his

own  country, sometimes even in his own village.  We have had

reports  of  employment agents in villages in Bangladesh  who

exploited  their  own fellow villagers and were  subsequently

subject  to  vigilante laws by the villagers when they  found

out.  This has happened before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you have exploitation taking place at that level

among  employment agents who are their own people, and it  is

very  difficult for us to regulate, prevent or to  anticipate

this kind of exploitation.  When I meet my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>

counterparts in the countries which send their people to work

here,  I have always suggested to them that they should  make

greater  effort to regulate and control their own  employment

recruiting agencies, because that is the only way  that  they

can  prevent the exploitation from taking place in their  own

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment agents in Singapore, if they exploit the

foreign  workers,  if they make unreasonable  or  unjustified

deductions  from  the salaries or ask for  very  high  agency

fees,  we  will look into these problems.  We will make  sure

that they do not exploit the workers.  We will make sure that

they  do  not run foul of the Employment Agents Act and  also

the  conditions  under which we issue the employment  agent's

licence to the person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is on Government trying to serve as a

central agency.  I think that has never been our approach for

Government  to  be the sole agent by which we  bring  in  all

these  hundreds of thousands of foreign workers,  whether  to

work as domestic maids or to work in the electronic factories

or  hotels.   It  is well nigh impossible, I would  say,  for

Government,  as  a single agency, to be able to  satisfy  the

demands  of so many tens of thousands of employers.   If  the

Government  were  to try to do that, we may well  become  the

single biggest bottleneck to the economy.  We may well become

the  single  biggest bottleneck to employers  recruiting  the

quality  and the number of workers that they need within  the

timeframe  that they need these workers.  I do not  think  we

should become a bottleneck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also made a very valid point, which I entirely

agree with him.  There is an older group of Singaporeans, low

skilled,  and  they  are facing stiff  competition  from  the

foreign  workers  if  we allow foreign  workers  to  pour  in

without any restrictions.  These older groups of Singaporeans

are  the ones who are going to be permanently unemployed.   I

think we should not allow that to happen.  We should continue

to  regulate the entry of unskilled foreign workers  so  that

they  do not price our own Singaporeans out of the job market

completely.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Tay Beng Chuan. Firstly, he said

that  unskilled foreign workers can remain in  Singapore  for

six years.  Did I hear him correctly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I have to correct his impression,

because it is only four years and not six years.  We allow an

unskilled  foreign worker holding a work permit to renew  the

work  permit once.  So it is four years' maximum  stay.   The

reason is that we want to ensure that these unskilled workers

do  not  stay in Singapore too long to either sink  roots  in

Singapore  or  for  the employer to become too  dependent  on

these  unskilled  foreign  workers.   After  all,  they   are

unskilled.   So getting a new unskilled worker to replace  an

old  unskilled worker is not a serious problem, nor  will  it

involve a lot of effort on the part of the employer.  If  the

employer finds that this worker is particularly skillful  and

experienced in a certain operation, then the onus is  on  the

employer  to  send  this  worker  for  skill  upgrading   and

training,  so  that he qualifies for a higher grade  of  work

pass  and therefore can be allowed to stay longer.  We  allow

skilled  foreigners to stay here for much  longer  than  four

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the coin is that while the employers

may  be saying that the four years is a problem causing  them

to  lose  their  workers, the real situation  on  the  ground

which,  unfortunately, many employers are not  aware  of,  is

that  nearly  73% of unskilled  foreign workers do  not  stay

longer  than three years in Singapore.  Even though we  allow

them  to  stay  a full four years, they have, voluntarily  on

their own or because of their employers' desire to phase them

out, left the country within three years.  So if we raise  it

to  six  years, eight years or whatever it is,  it  makes  no

impact.   73% are already going back after three  years.   In

the construction sector, a larger number goes back after even

a shorter period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to extension of the period of the work

permit, I think raising it at this juncture serves no  useful

purpose.   The point to make is that I hope the  Chambers  of

Commerce and all other employers take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>

note that if they have foreign workers in their company, they

should  make  every effort to help them upgrade their  skills

and qualify for a higher grade of work pass.  In that way, we

will welcome them here to stay longer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also made a very passionate appeal on behalf of

employers  who  were found to have violated our  law  on  the

employment  of foreign workers.  While we are sympathetic,  I

think  most of his passion is misplaced.  Because we have  to

understand  that it is simply not sustainable for  Singapore,

both  from  the  economic and social point of view,  to  have

unlimited  number  of  foreigners coming  to  Singapore.   We

cannot simply afford a situation where any employer who wants

a  foreign  worker is entitled and can demand for  a  foreign

worker.   If you accept the position that there must be  some

restrictions and there must be some control, then you have to

accept that those who do not comply with the restrictions  or

the  controls that are agreed upon have put themselves beyond

the law, and they should be dealt with accordingly, no matter

how  they themselves feel about the need for foreign workers.

If  you  had employed a foreign worker without a work permit,

you  have violated the law and you will have to be dealt with

according to the law.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to deal with this problem of illegal workers,

we  have to deal with it from two perspectives.  One  is  the

demand  and the other one is the supply.  We have  to  ensure

that  very  few foreigners can sneak into Singapore  to  work

illegally.   That is the supply side.  But we  also  have  to

ensure  that  very few Singaporean employers would  willingly

want  to go and employ an illegal worker.  That is the demand

side.   Only  by  working from both angles, can  we  nip  the

problem  completely.  I want to say that our  approach,  both

trying to contain the entry of illegal workers into Singapore

and  also cutting down the demand, has worked quite  well  so

that the illegal worker

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>

problem  is  not getting out of hand, and I think  we  should

continue to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have strict rules about work permit eligibility.

Therefore, those who choose to contravene the rules must face

the  consequence of our law.  I cannot understand when Mr Tay

said  that some employers unwittingly or unknowingly employed

workers who turn out to be illegal.  Because under our  rule,

if  you  want a foreign worker, you have to apply for a  work

permit.   As the employer, he has to apply for a work permit.

If  he had never applied for a work permit for this foreigner

who  is  working  for  him, he will know obviously  that  the

foreigner  is  an illegal worker.  There is no way  that  the

foreigner is entitled to work for him because the work permit

card  carries the name of the employer.  If the  work  permit

card  carries the name of some other company, he is obviously

not  the legal employer, and he employs the foreigner at  his

own risk, knowing full well that he had violated the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the kind of risk that the Government is

encouraging  entrepreneurs to take to  break  the  law.   The

risks  that we are encouraging entrepreneurs to take are  the

risks  involved in doing business, setting up new  technology

start-ups.  To  break  the  law by  willingly  and  knowingly

employing  a  foreigner without having  applied  for  a  work

permit is foolhardy.  The question is one of time: when  will

it  be  detected?  If you are caught, you must face the  full

consequences of the law.  I am sorry to say that, but the law

has  to  come  down  hard on employers who choose  to  employ

illegal workers, otherwise we will have a terrible problem of

having  large  numbers  of foreigners in  our  midst  working

illegally and causing all kinds of other problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the point that our laws have been unfair by

putting all the responsibility on the employers.  As  I  said

earlier  on,  we  take a two-pronged approach  to  catch  the

people   who  bring  in  foreigners  to  work  illegally   in

Singapore.  These are the traffickers and illegal agents  who

bring  them  in.  When they are caught, they are  dealt  with

very severely under the law too.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>

The workers themselves are also penalised.  The employers, of

course,  as  I  have  explained earlier  on,  face  the  full

consequence of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we are conscious of the fact that

there  are  many  businesses that do depend  on  the  foreign

workers  to survive.  We will endeavour to meet their  demand

subject  to  also  meeting  all  the  other  constraints  and

reservations such as those expressed by the Nominated Member,

Mr  Thomas,  about  the older groups of workers  and  how  to

ensure  that  they also have jobs waiting for them,  if  they

need it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Seng Han Thong.

Both of them spoke about the work permit or work pass system.

In  the case of Mr Ahmad Magad, people who are coming in  for

short-term training or attachment, my understanding  is  that

we  have fairly straightforward procedures for companies that

want  to  bring  in their foreign employees for  training  or

short  term attachment in Singapore. The processing time  for

such a work pass application is generally very short.  It  is

within  three days if all the information is provided.  In  a

more  complicated  case, it might take a little  longer,  but

sometimes   a  difficult  case  may  be  because   inadequate

information was provided in the first instance.   It  is  the

responsibility of the employer to provide all the information

required  by  either  the  employment  pass  or  work  permit

department  to ensure that the application can  be  processed

quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked whether we could make the work

permit category a bit more flexible.  For instance, create  a

special category for artistes and performers who would not be

finger-printed.    Let  me  say at  the  outset  that  finger

printing should not be a problem. All Singaporeans have to be

finger  printed.  Why is it so difficult that we finger-print

a  foreigner who wants to come here to apply for a pass?  All

our people have carried a finger print on their ICs too.   So

that in itself should not be a difficulty.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that we should expedite, and that is what

we  would do.  In fact, we had already gone some way  towards

helping  to  expedite this entry of performers and  artistes.

For instance, we have liberalised the Professional Visit Pass

Scheme   which  allows  the  entry  of  these  artistes   and

performers  into  Singapore.   They  can  now  come  in   for

performances,  filming, exhibit their work in  terms  of  the

paintings   or  give  lectures  or  speak  at  other   public

occasions, or also foreign sportsmen to participate  in  some

sporting  events.   They can all come in  without  having  to

apply for a special pass.   They can do all these things with

their normal social visit pass and it can be extended for  up

to  three months, if necessary.  In fact, most of the  people

who  are coming in for such performances will be covered, and

they can do so with their ordinary social visit pass.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are coming here for a longer stay will have to

apply  for  the appropriate permit, whether it is  employment

pass  or work permit.  Let me say once again that the  salary

criterion  is not a rigid criterion.  It is not a rigid  cut-off  point.  We will consider special high talents or  highly

capable  performers   who are coming  in  and,  for  whatever

reason,  they  are going to be paid less than $2,000.   There

are borderline cases which we will consider on its own merit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as Prof. Chin Tet Yung's point on marriage is

concerned,  we  have to prevent a large number  of  unskilled

foreign  workers  from  sinking roots  in  Singapore  through

marriage  with a Singaporean.  We have now more than  450,000

unskilled foreign workers in Singapore.  If through  marriage

to   Singaporeans,  they  can  immediately  claim  right   of

permanent residence in Singapore, we could end up with a very

serious problem.  Already we have difficulty in finding  jobs

for  the  nearly  500,000 Singaporeans  who  have  less  than

secondary  education.  Can you imagine  we  then  double  the

number  with  another  500,000  equally  low  skilled,  lowly

educated  foreigners?  At the next economic crisis,  what  is

going to happen? Obviously, we cannot do that.  So we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>

to  assess  those work permit holders who apply for  marriage

approval.   Those whom we assess to be able to contribute  to

the economy and not likely to be a liability to Singapore, we

approve   their  application.   In  fact,  70%  of  all   the

applications by work permit holders to marry Singaporeans are

approved.  The policy is not unreasonably strict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been a member of the ILO for some

time  already.   And as mentioned by Mr Thomas  on  Saturday,

Singapore  may already be in compliance or will  have  little

difficulty in complying with the requirements of several  ILO

conventions.   However, we have still  yet  to  ratify  them.

Could  the Minister tell us his Ministry's policy with regard

to   ratification   of   ILO  conventions,   especially   the

conventions  pertaining  to the minimum  employment  age  and

equal  remuneration, and also the ILO convention on the Right

to Organise and Collective Bargaining.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Siir, Singapore has to

date  ratified  a total of 20 ILO conventions, including  two

out  of the seven core conventions, namely, Convention 98  on

the   Right   to  Organise  and  Collective  Bargaining   and

Convention  No.  29 on Forced Labour.  These conventions  are

classified  as core labour conventions as they are considered

by the ILO as conventions concerning basic workers' rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to ratify additional ILO conventions

which would not undermine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>

our  national interests.  We are studying the remaining  five

of  the  remaining seven core conventions to  see  which  one

could  be  ratified.   For conventions  which  Singapore  has

already  ratified, we will review our laws to ensure that  we

are in full compliance with these conventions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ratification of every convention involves obligations

to  fully  comply with the requirements, we need  to  closely

examine our laws and policies to ensure that they are in line

with  these  requirements.  This will be done in consultation

with  the relevant agencies, including the Singapore National

Employers' Federation and the National Trades Union Congress.

As  soon as we are satisfied that we are able to comply  with

the  relevant convention, the Government will inform the  ILO

of our decision for ratification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of discriminatory job advertisements was

raised  in this House some years ago by the Secretary-General

of NTUC, when he was still a backbencher.  It was pointed out

then  that  there were many job advertisements that specified

preference for a particular race, age or gender.  This  issue

has been raised from time to time since then and again during

the  recession.  Could the Minister give us an update on  the

current  situation  on discriminatory job advertisements  and

let us know if his Ministry will consider legislation against

such advertisements?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, in response to the

prevalence  of  job advertisements containing  discriminatory

criteria,   the  Ministry,  in  consultation  with  Singapore

National  Employers'  Federation  (SNEF)  and  NTUC,  jointly

formulated  and  issued  a  set of Tripartite  Guidelines  to

advise   employers  to  select  candidates  based  on  merit,

experience, capability and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>

other bona fide job requirements. This is consistent with the

principle  of meritocracy and will help employers select  the

best  candidate for the job. With the support of the  various

employer associations, the trade unions, and Singapore  Press

Holdings, the Guidelines have been effectively implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our surveys of job advertisements in the print media

show   that  discriminatory  job  advertisements  have   been

significantly reduced. Compared to January 1999  where  there

were  some 32% of job advertisements containing at least  one

discriminatory  selection criterion,  the  latest  survey  in

February  this  year  revealed that  only  0.3%  of  the  job

advertisements were discriminatory in nature. This shows that

employers   have  responded  positively  to  the   Tripartite

Guidelines  and  have  adopted  objective  criteria  in   the

selection of job candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This significant drop in the number of discriminatory

job advertisements shows that the promotional and educational

approach  is  working well and has achieved the objective  of

eliminating discriminatory job advertisements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with our educational efforts to make

employers  realize  the  importance of  recruiting  the  best

candidate   based   on   merit  and   capability,   so   that

discrimination,  in form and substance, can be  fundamentally

eliminated.  With Singapore moving towards a  knowledge-based

economy,  enlightened employment practices  will  enable  our

companies  to attract and retain the best talents. This  will

help our companies to be able to compete more effectively  in

the  global  environment.   So  we  will  continue  with  the

promotional and educational approach for the time being.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give us an update on the

progress of the Construction 21 plan launched in October last

year  and if any of these measures implemented have led to  a

reduction  in  the  number of unskilled  foreign  workers  in

Singapore,  and to the raising of skills and productivity  in

the  construction industry?  Have any of these measures  such

as  the  reduction  in  the  man-year  entitlement  adversely

affected the construction industry?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the Construction

21 (C21) blueprint launched in October 1999 aims to transform

the construction industry into a professional, productive and

progressive   industry.  The  recommendations   address   the

immediate  issues  at hand, that is, low productivity,  heavy

reliance   on   unskilled  foreign   workers,   poor   safety

performance,  and  lay  the  foundation  for  a  stable   and

productive industry in the longer term.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Construction 21 report was only launched in

October   1999,  not  all  the  recommendations   have   been

implemented.  Nevertheless, some of the initiatives under the

purview  of  BCA  and  the Ministry of Manpower  are  already

underway.  Given the immediate concerns over low productivity

and  heavy  labour reliance, priority will be in implementing

measures that directly address these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight these areas of priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the promotion of buildability. More buildable

designs   enhance  labour  productivity  and   lower   labour

reliance.   The legislation on buildability requirements  was

enacted on 1st April 1999 and will take effect on 1st January

2001.   Sir, the long period will enable all participants  in

the construction industry to make adjustments and prepare for

the new requirements.  Building plans which are submitted for

approval  after  1st  January 2001  must  achieve  a  minimum

buildable   score.    This  buildable  score   computes   how

efficiently  a building can be constructed.  A  higher  score

means better design,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>

requiring fewer workers to construct the building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another measure of priority is the tightening of

the  Man-Year Entitlement, or MYE, formula used  in  the  new

Work  Permit Allocation System.  The MYE was first introduced

in  April  1998.  It was tightened by 10% in April  1999  for

building   and   upgrading  project  categories.    C21   had

recommended  reducing the MYE formula annually,  so  that  it

reaches  70% of current levels by 2005 and 50% by  2010.   In

line with this, the Ministry will tighten the MYE formula  by

15%  for  building projects and 10% for upgrading  and  civil

engineering projects with effect from 1st April 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this rate of tightening has taken into account the

changes in the productivity level since the last MYE revision

in April 1999 and the MYE utilisation patterns.  It has taken

into  consideration  the readiness of the  industry  for  the

proposed reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been monitoring the new Allocation

System  carefully.  Our observations suggest  that  the  main

contractors  have indeed been more circumspect in  allocating

MYEs  to  their  sub-contractors.  So far, for projects  that

have  been completed, only 55% of total MYEs have been  used.

This  has translated into fewer work permit applications  and

the  number  of  unskilled foreign construction  workers  has

decreased  since the reduction of the MYE formula.   The  MYE

reduction in April 1999 has therefore not adversely  affected

the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the time constraint, my answer has been

a  bit  brief.  If the Member wants more information,  please

file a Question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small nation with a limited supply of

land.  As we grow economically, there is competing demand for

the use of our limited land resources.  Singapore is renowned

internationally  as a very well planned and  organised  city.

This  did  not  come  about by chance,  but  through  forward

planning  and  the political will to execute the  plan.   The

last  concept plan was done in 1991.  I understand that there

will be one done for Year 2001, called Concept Plan 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what are the main

planning  criteria  which he will use in formulating  concept

Plan  2001.   We  have a current population  of  3.9  million

people.   What will be the targeted population in  10  years'

time?   On  what basis is this number arrived at?   With  the

emphasis now on recruiting foreign talent, what will  be  the

targeted  ratio  between foreign workers and  the  indigenous

workforce?   How can we meet the housing needs of both  local

and  foreign  workers?  Is the Minister  satisfied  with  the

accommodation provided for foreign workers?  Today, if you go

downtown  on  a  Sunday, you will see the  Filipina  domestic

workers  gathered  at the Botanic Gardens  or  along  Orchard

Road, the Indian workers in Little India and the Thai workers

along Beach Road.  In 10 years' time, will we continue to see

these  ethnic enclaves in our main commercial districts?   Or

should  we  not  start working towards a better distribution,

and perhaps, even integration of our different ethnic foreign

workers to different parts of Singapore, to the different HDB

commercial  areas,  for example?  We  have  this  for  public

housing already where we impose a quota for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>

each ethnic household in the HDB estates.  Can we not do  the

same  for  foreign workers, not by law, but through  planning

and  spreading  out the building of recreational  and  retail

facilities that cater to their needs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With competing demands for the use of land, how do we

decide how much should be set aside for housing, how much for

commercial use and how much for industrial use?  Whatever the

ratio  or  percentage we come up with, I think  there  is  no

running  away  from  the  need to  build  on  our  land  more

intensively.   For housing, the Government has increased  the

plot  ratios  in many areas already, leading to a  deluge  of

selective en bloc sales and windfall profits for many lately.

I  urge  the Government to continue to allow the building  of

residential housing to a much greater density and plot  ratio

in  prime  areas so that more of our residents  can  live  in

prime areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also build more intensively in the light

industrial parks and the science hubs.  If you take  a  drive

through  our science park, you will notice that it  resembles

the  Silicon Valley area.  By that, I mean it is  mainly  low

rise,  well spread out and beautifully landscaped with  open-air  car parks everywhere.  In USA, they have plenty of land,

hence   building  low  rise  is  logical  and  perhaps   more

economical.  In Singapore, as we are short of land,  I  think

we  should  start  planning for our science parks  and  other

light  industrial parks to be built to a higher  plot  ratio.

The  same  policy  should apply to our educational  belts  as

well.   Our universities and polytechnics still use a lot  of

land,  with many open-air car parks.  In their next phase  of

expansion,  I  think  we  should  encourage  them  to  better

intensify the use of their existing premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-location of facilities is another principle we should

adopt  to  continue to encourage the better use of our  land.

In  future tenders of sites, we should have more mixed use or

white  sites.  Hotels can be built with retail and commercial

outlets  on  top of MRT stations, as in the case  of  Raffles

City, which is a prime example of mixed use.  We should  also

allow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>

residential units and hotels to be built on the same plots of

land.  The JTC and the HDB should relax their strict rules on

the  use  of  industrial  land for  industrial/administration

purposes  and for subletting.  The way we work in the  future

will  be  changed  drastically by the use of  computers,  the

Internet  and e-commerce.  We may be able to work  more  from

home  and  at  all  hours as the world  becomes  more  inter-connected.  We should also liberalise the use of the home for

work  so  that more people, whether housewives or others  can

work  and  look after their children at the same time.   This

would  also  help  to solve the problems of over-reliance  on

foreign  maids.  In order to support this for the future,  we

have  to  wire  up  all  our buildings in  the  planning  and

building  phases, not just for private, but also  for  public

housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that many people will have many ideas to

contribute  towards  the  Concept  Plan  2001.   I  hope  the

Government  will  consult  widely with  the  people  and  the

business community in drawing up the Plan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, although Singapore

has  often been described as a city-state, we are,  in  fact,

much  more than a city.  Other large cities in the world need

only   provide  land  for  commercial,  residential,  retail,

educational and transportation purposes, and maybe some areas

for  parks  and recreational activities.  We need  more  than

that;  we are an independent country, and in addition to  all

of  the above, we have to set aside large tracts of land  for

our  industries, airports, reservoirs, water catchment areas,

nature reserves and military training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve all of this and build a world class city-nation, we have to maximise our land use. The Government has

always been looking for ways to utilise land more effectively

and  I  am  heartened to hear that the Ministry  of  National

Development  will be doing Concept Plan 2001 as part  of  its

continual  review  of  our  land use  policy.   Further,  the

Concept  Plan will not be drawn up by the Government agencies

in  isolation but will incorporate the inputs and suggestions

of the public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parliamentary colleague, Mr Lew, has touched on

certain general principles, and I would like to just look  at

certain specific suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, in view of our limited land size, our

guiding principle in planning must be to intensify the use of

our  land  and facilities wherever possible.  The  particular

agency  in  charge of any parcel of land or  facility  cannot

afford  to  be possessive but must allow it to be shared  for

economic  and  quality-of-life purposes.  The National  Parks

Board  is  a  good example when it opened its  new  Visitors'

Centre  at the Botanic Gardens and expanded the use of  these

facilities  to co-locate a cafe, and a posh restaurant  in  a

conservation  house  nearby.  This  allows  people  to  enjoy

refreshments  within the setting of the  Gardens  whether  as

part  of  a visit to the Gardens or as a special occasion  on

its  own.  More can be done along this line.  There are  many

other lovely parks located throughout the island.  Could  the

National  Parks  Board  consider  allowing  more  refreshment

outlets, like coffee clubs, to be set up along the fringes of

these  parks, so that patrons could have an area to  sit  out

among the greenery and enjoy the ambience?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another location that I feel could be better utilised is

the  Central  Business District, in particular,  the  Raffles

Place-Shenton  Way  area.  This area  goes  through  a  daily

metamorphosis.  During the business day, it is  bustling  and

full  of  activities of commerce.  The car  parks  are  full;

people  move  about  with  a sense  of  purpose;  and  it  is

difficult to get a table for lunch.  At night and during  the

weekend, it sleeps and hibernates.  The streets are deserted;

the  car parks are empty; and the restaurants are quiet after

office hours.  Food outlets cater for the lunch sitting only,

compared  to Hong Kong where good restaurants are packed  for

breakfast, lunch, dinner and even supper.  I think it is such

a  waste  of resources to invest in the roads, the car  parks

and  the  general infrastructure and derive not  the  fullest

from them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Suntec City has done wonders by

wearing the different hats of commerce, exhibition and retail

businesses,  sometimes simultaneously.  Such a  diverse  menu

keeps the place alive, and the infrastructure well used.  All

this  inspite of not having the convenient access to the  MRT

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inject more life into Raffles Place after office

hours,  I  would  suggest that a large retail cum  exhibition

complex  be built adjacent to it.  This will attract a  large

critical mass of people to the area even after office  hours.

So,  even  as the financial commercial activities  wind  down

with  night  fall, another life emerges offering exhibitions,

entertainment,  lively  shops and  eateries.   Raffles  Place

would  then  not  only  serve  that  singular  purpose  of  a

commercial hub.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point relates to public housing estates. When

we  think  of using land and infrastructure more effectively,

it  is  also  relevant to take into account our  standard  of

living  and the need to create a generally pleasing ambience.

These  will  go  a long way in adding a sense of  beauty  and

grace to our surroundings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much credit must go to the HDB for continually improving

the  design and quality of its flats.  When we step  into  an

HDB  estate, just by looking at the common areas, we can tell

straightaway   the  era  when  the  flats  were  constructed.

However,  more  modern and better facilities, such  as  lifts

which  stop  at  every  floor  and  better  looking  lighting

facilities,   or  light  fittings,  mean  higher  maintenance

expenses.  There is a correlation between the age of the  HDB

flats  and  the  cost of upkeeping them.  At the  operational

level,  it  costs  more  to maintain the  newer  HDB  estates

because  they have more facilities and features.  It is  like

comparing  a  new car with an old one.  The  latest  BMW  and

Mercedes  Benz  are full of electronic gadgets controlled  by

micro-processors.   These  cars  have  to  be   serviced   by

authorised  trained mechanics and each service can  run  into

thousands  of dollars.  On the other hand, I drive a  12-year

old Mercedes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>

200.   Any  workshop can give the car a routine  service  for

about  $100  but I am aware that the likelihood  of  a  major

breakdown  is  higher and that will mean big money.   In  the

case  of the town councils, the expenses for a major overhaul

of  an  older estate are already provided for by way  of  the

sinking  fund.  It is the cost of the routine maintenance  of

newer  estates  that is a concern.  I hope the Minister  will

take  this  into  consideration so  as  to  enable  the  town

councils  to maintain the newer estates at the standard  that

its original designers had in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point relates to private estates. Senior

Parliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee revealed  last  week  in

Parliament that the Government was considering setting  aside

funds for upgrading of our private estates.  I feel that this

is  a  very  important issue because in the existing  private

estates,  there  are  certain areas  that  may  have  slipped

through  the cracks between the various Government  agencies.

Within  the estate, there may be a small piece of state  land

that has been left vacant because no one agency thought it as

its  responsibility to fully utilise it.  And, so it is  left

as it is, and sometimes the vegetation gets trimmed so as not

to  breed mosquitoes.  However, the residents there know that

the land could be put to better use.  It would be very useful

if  the residents' association could come up with ideas as to

how  to  use it more effectively and the Government  provides

the funding to realise these ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce Singapore, we need many more

creative  approaches for this city to continue  to  grow  and

flourish as a vibrant world class home.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, Singapore aims to be a metropolis

where people can work, live and play comfortably in the  21st

century.   To  achieve this, we need to adopt strategic  land

use  planning so as to meet the needs of both individuals and

the  business community.  The Singapore Concept Plan  is  due

for  revision.   I wish to seek the following  clarifications

from the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key considerations when drafting the

Concept Plan 2001?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the balance between built-up area and the

provision of green spaces in our living environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What specific planning features are incorporated to

cater to the needs of the elderly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to

ensure  that high-density living will not affect the  quality

of living in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, there

was  a  debate where the topic was really whether our success

was  due  to  our  small  size or  because  of  our  leaders.

Needless to say, the team that said the leaders, despite  the

size,  won,  not  just  because  it  is  biased  towards  the

leadership in Singapore, but because of the points  they  put

forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I want to make here is that one of them

suggested that, suppose we had a big space, say, of Batam  or

Bintan  size,  in addition to what we have,  and  whether  we

would have done it.  It remains a hypothetical question.  But

it  brings me to this topic today.  If you look at  the  last

few  years, various things had happened in Singapore.  We had

gone  through various policies to curtail the property bubble

and we did the right things ahead of time in 1996 that, today

we  have  come  out  of  this  potentially  big  bubble  from

bursting,  as  it  has happened in some of  the  neighbouring

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the last decade or so, many of the young

Singaporeans  have aspired to own a private property  and  we

have  done  reasonably  well to increase  the  percentage  of

private  homes in Singapore from 14% in 1990 to  the  current

18%.  And more and more younger Singaporeans still aspire  to

own private residence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have been always referred to as a fine city

by  many foreigners (I think we have 7 million tourists every

year)  and,  as  our PM said at the National Day  Rally  last

year,  we  should also try to become a fun  city.   All  this

means  that, as our population grows, and I do not know  what

is the optimum population, I would like to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>

ask the Minister what is the target over the next 10-20 years

that  Singapore  can target for so that living  in  Singapore

would be more comfortable and it would not be as congested as

it  is  in,  say,  Hong Kong.  Given all these  developments,

together   with  the  attraction  of  foreign  talents   into

Singapore to build our knowledge-based economy, I would  like

to  find  out  what the review that the GPC  Chairman  talked

about  Concept  2001  would be and whether  some  fundamental

review  would  be  done to take into account  some  of  these

factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for MTI, Mr Lim Swee Say, last

week  mentioned  that  his  Ministry  will  be  looking  into

increasing   the  optimum  use  of  land  in  Singapore   for

industrial  use by building more multi-storey factories,  and

so  on.   I  would like to find out how the commercial  angle

would  be looked at from the MND's point of view and  whether

we  would  also  be pulling down those one storey  commercial

developments  and  try to make greater  optimum  use  of  the

commercial  land  that  we have in  Singapore,  and  how  the

present tenants would be compensated for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the residential side, I would like to know whether we

will  move  from this 18% upwards to a higher  percentage  so

that  more  of the younger Singaporeans can afford a  private

home.   Also,  like  what Mr Ong Kian Min mentioned,  whether

there  will be greater developments in downtown, particularly

in  the  Marina South that we have heard about, whether  land

has  already  been released fully, if not,  when  would  this

downtown  development be completed.  Sir, I  hope  all  these

answers  would be in the review that the Ministry is planning

to undertake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I just want to mention something about the

land  sales which are of great importance to a lot of  people

in  this  House  and  outside.  Sir,  the  Government  has  a

reasonably good approach to land sales in Singapore which, on

the  one  hand, looks good on paper, but in practice,  it  is

much more complicated to implement.  Because it does not make

either the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>

property  developers  or  those  who  have  aspired  to   buy

properties happy.  Just look at what had happened in the last

year.   The residential property prices went up 33% in  1999.

And many of the constituents that I spoke to, felt it was far

too  much in too short a period of time, ie, 33% in  a  year.

When  I spoke to some of these developers, they told me  that

"Well,  it  is  still 27% lower than it  was  in  the  second

quarter of 1996."  So the question is: how do we balance this

expectation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point is that, in the last 10-15 years,

many  corporate companies, bus companies, for instance,  have

gone  into  property.  So have many other entirely  different

business  focused  companies gone into property.   This  gold

rush   towards  property development where you can  make  all

your  money  must change.  The mindsets of Singaporeans  must

change.   While we want property prices to be stabilised,  it

should not be accelerating too much, too fast.  We should use

this  Internet  boom, where everybody is now rushing  towards

the  Internet,  to move away from the focus towards  property

and try to stabilise property prices in Singapore so that  we

do   not  get  pushed  by  just  the  developers  but,   more

importantly, we cater to the needs of the silent majority  of

Singaporeans who aspire to own property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I hope that the Minister will look

into all these points in this review.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, as stated in the Development

Control  Handbook  1991, developers of  industrial  buildings

with  a  gross  floor area of above 5,000 square  metres  are

required  to retain 30% of the development for 10 years  from

the  latest date of TOP issuance.  This policy was introduced

to  ensure that one major stakeholder would be responsible to

prevent common properties of such buildings from falling into

disrepair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the progress of time and the increased

professionalism of property management firms, such policy has

become obsolete.  To date, the Strata Titles Act has adequate

provisions to make sure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>

that  all  buildings  are  well  maintained.   As  such,  all

residential developments are no longer required to  have  30%

retention,  and  yet are properly managed by  the  respective

Management Corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30% retention policy for industrial buildings has

indeed  increased  the holding cost and financial  burden  of

developers   and  industrialists.   It  also  restricts   the

opportunities  for  developers or  industrialists  to  expand

their businesses.  Although developers or industrialists  can

sell  the 30% to a single purchaser, the transaction  chances

are  low.  Thus, I would urge the Ministry to reconsider this

policy of 30% retention for industrial building development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> I know that the CIDB, and now the BCA,

has been working hard to improve the productivity and quality

in  the  construction sector.  It has been 15 years since  we

started  the CIDB.  I would like to ask the Minister how  the

productivity of our construction sector compares with that of

the  developed  countries, like USA, Germany,  Australia  and

Japan.   I am given to understand that it still takes  a  lot

longer to build a building in Singapore than in some of these

countries.   Why  is  that so?  Are our  workers  still  less

productive  because  we are still over-reliant  upon  foreign

workers  who  are mainly unskilled?  What are  our  plans  to

further improve their productivity?  How many foreign workers

in  the  construction industry do we have and what  is  their

average   length  of  stay  in  Singapore?   Are  we  wasting

resources  training them only to lose them quickly when  they

return home?  Are we able to get architects and engineers  to

come  up  with  more  buildable  designs  that  will  enhance

productivity in the construction sector?

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, in the debate

on  the Budget Statement, I have spoken briefly on the report

presented  by  the Construction 21 Committee.  I congratulate

the Committee for doing such a thorough job in evaluating all

the  problems arising out of our construction industry.   The

39  recommendations have been supported by the  Minister  and

have been given a timeframe to be implemented.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have certain reservations and remain cautiously

optimistic.   In  my  30-over  years  of  practice   in   the

construction  industry, I have been constantly frustrated  at

the   low  productivity,  efficiency  and  the  standard   of

workmanship achieved.  In Singapore, our building cost is one

of  the  highest in the world and the time taken one  of  the

longest  and,  worse  still, the  standard  of  the  finished

product leaves much to be desired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the years, much effort and time have been spent

in trying to address these numerous problems that plagued the

construction   industry  but  with   very   little   success.

Therefore, it is most timely that the Construction 21  report

is  being released.  It is comprehensive, thorough,  but  all

such  reports are as good as how all its recommendations  can

be implemented effectively. Otherwise, they would end up just

as well-prepared academic studies.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 39 recommendations are well-researched and relevant.

But  there are still many areas which I feel should need more

attention  and  scrutiny. I shall mention two more  important

ones. The first is our contracting system, in respect of  the

professionalism of our contractors. While there are a  number

of   fairly   competent  and  professional   contractors   in

Singapore,  many  could not measure up to the professionalism

it requires.  Most construction companies are still headed by

non-qualified professionals.  It is not uncommon that  having

successfully  secured  the  contract,  the  partner  of   the

construction firm would appear only for the first meeting and

subsequently leave the job to the employed project  managers,

who  may or may not be professionally qualified.  Because  of

the  fact that they are employed personnel, they do not  have

any personal commitment to the company and, therefore, it  is

not unusual to see project manager posts change three or four

times during the duration of the project.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a situation, even if all other productivity

factors are in place, it is impossible to see how the project

can  be  completed in time and achieve the high standards  it

requires.   Before  we can consider all  the  other  numerous

problems  associated with the industry, we must first  ensure

that  our contracting firms must have qualified professionals

as  partners,  especially those who  are  in  charge  of  the

project.  Therefore, it may be necessary for the Ministry  to

consider  registering builders in the same  manner  in  which

professional architects and engineers are being registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is an urgent need to ensure a constant

supply  of skilled labour.  Many Members have already  spoken

of such requirements.  It is a serious problem, especially as

we  are  so  short of manpower.  The requirement for  foreign

workers to go through a few weeks, or even one or two  months

of skills training cannot resolve the problem.  We must train

our  own  local  workers as tradesman.  In  Australia,  every

construction worker is a certificate holder.  They  go  to  a

trade  school for two or three years to acquire the necessary

skills. They do not consider themselves labourers, but rather

as tradesmen who are highly skilled and productive.  They may

even  earn more than the professionals.  Very often, you  see

four or five tradesmen working on the construction site of  a

house  in  Australia and it takes 6 to 8  months  to  finish,

compared to the 20 to 30 labourers running around on the same

project  in  Singapore,  and taking  11/2  to  two  years  to

complete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more areas which the Ministry can tap on

the  experience  of  the professionals  and  the  experienced

personnel in the industry.  Their inputs are required to  see

that  all  the  recommendations in  the  Construction  21  be

implemented  effectively  and, more importantly,  to  examine

more  in-depth areas where the report needs refinement or  be

supplemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that this will be the beginning of a

new era in our construction industry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the Construction 21 report aims to

produce  world-class builders. To achieve this, there  is  an

urgent  need  to inject more professionalism in the  building

industry.  We  must  develop  a  core  capability  of   local

construction firms and provide more support for  these  firms

to   be   world-class.    I  wish  to  seek   the   following

clarifications from the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the policy of the Ministry in nurturing

potential world-class builders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will the Ministry provide incentives for

construction  firms  to  merge  and  strengthen  their   core

capabilities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to

improve professionalism in the industry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Will the Ministry consider licensing building

professionals so that better professional accountability  can

be achieved?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, we have a public housing scheme

that is the most comprehensive in the world, catering to  82%

of  the  population.  This means that even  the  upper-middle

income  people live in public housing.  You would think  that

this   group  of  people  would  appreciate  and  thank   the

Government for the privilege of being able to live in  public

housing  at  subsidised prices despite their  income  levels.

Yet,  we know that this is not so and they all aspire to move

to  private  housing at the earliest opportunity, whether  in

landed  properties or condominiums.  This brings  me  to  the

issue  of our public housing policy. The question is:  should

we  continue  to  cater to the needs of  upper-middle  income

Singaporeans   through  premium  HDB  flats   and   executive

condominiums?  I think no matter what name we  give  it,  and

whatever  finishing we put on it, it is still  deemed  a  HDB

flat and is regarded as public housing.  In fact, such upper-middle income Singaporeans, who are usually

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>

younger  professionals, are a bit embarrassed and  apologetic

when they disclose that they still live in HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government review this

policy   of   building  premium  HDB  flats   and   Executive

Condominiums and let the private sector assume a bigger  role

for this segment of the market. We could release more land to

the  private sector for this purpose so as to keep the  lower

end  of  the private housing market affordable and provide  a

more gradual and seamless transaction from public housing  to

private housing.  When we provide so much public housing,  we

are  unwittingly creating an over dependency syndrome on  the

Government,  which will be an obstacle to  the  promotion  of

greater   entrepreneurship  and  innovation.   I   hope   the

Government will review this policy seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I join the GPC Chairman in

making a similar point, but from a different angle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the last decade or more, the Government

has  moved  from  regulatory statutory boards  to  make  them

corporatised, and then to private particularly  for  some  of

the  monopolies  that exist in Singapore. I will  give  three

examples.   First  is the SIM group which took  over  TCS  to

become several companies who compete with each other. We have

got TCS, TV12 and so on. Second is the transport structure in

Singapore.   For the bus services, we now not only  have  SBS

but TIBS as well, competing in some areas. Then the MRT.   We

are   going  to  have  a  new  competitor  to  run  MRT.  For

telecommunications, we have liberalised. StarHub is coming in

and  competition  will  be there. I think  the  key  word  is

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at public housing today in Singapore,

HDB  is the monopoly.  I have served as a board member in HDB

and  I  would  say  that  HDB  is  doing  an  excellent  job,

particularly under its CEO, Mr Tan Guong Ching and  his  team

and  their productivity is extremely high, their buildability

excellent by international standards and we have gone to Hong

Kong to compare what we are doing, and we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>

come up tops.  And we learnt from Hong Kong in the 1960s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I would like to make is that it may

be  time  to look at an alternative to HDB, that is, to  have

two  companies  that do public housing.  I do not  completely

agree  with  the idea that we should push everything  to  the

private  sector because for public housing, there are certain

things that the Government should still have control. The one

better  way would be to split HDB, just like the way that  we

have  run town councils and their services.  It was all  done

by HDB, but now the town councils are running it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar way for building HDB flats, we could split

it out and spin off two companies which compete head on under

similar rules set by Government.  This will make the building

of  public  housing much more efficient through  competition,

where quality of designs will improve and they will benchmark

themselves  with  the best in the private housing.   The  two

companies,  if set up, will look critically at  the  building

cost  and  continually find ways to reduce these costs,  just

like  the  way  that the computer industry  is  driving  down

prices  every  day.   We may not be seeing  price  reductions

every  day,  but  I am sure that the prices will  come  down.

Overall,  the bottomline is that the Singapore citizens  will

be  much happier that the price does not go up too much,  too

soon.   On  that note, I would like to call for a  review  of

this public housing policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point I want to add here is regarding the

upgrading  scheme that we have.  The Main Upgrading Programme

(MUP) is an excellent scheme but it is time to review how  we

address this space adding item (SAI), particularly for the 4-and 5-roomers. Maybe, we have to do away with this scheme for

4- and 5-roomers and concentrate it on the 3-roomers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we now only do certain items for

the  MUP.  I  would like to propose that as long  as  it  has

anything  to  do with the facade of the building,  we  should

change it completely. For example, we do the painting, but we

do not change

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>

the  windows.  I think it will be useful if the MUP  includes

the changing of windows or the grilles so that when it is all

done,  it  looks as good as a new flat.  I hope the  Minister

will take these points into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, a recent research in the United

Kingdom has shown interesting housing trends in Europe.  Home

ownership policy has become problematic resulting in  various

problems in some countries.  It was found that countries with

high   home   ownership  also  have  high   social   services

expenditure.  Those with high home ownership also experienced

higher unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two possible reasons were cited for these trends.

Firstly,  market forces have severe impact on  job  security,

thus  making homeowners more vulnerable and unable to service

their mortgages. Secondly, people tend to lose their drive to

work  or quit work once their mortgages are fully paid,  thus

resulting in wastages of human talent and resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these trends, I wish to make the following

clarifications with the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the percentage of HDB homeowners in

mortgage  payment arrears or receiving welfare assistance  in

the last 10 year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to

balance between home ownership and family nuclearisation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Ministry consider removing the 5-year

occupation  requirement, and allow HDB flat  owners  to  swop

flats at market rates to live near their family members?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What is the impact of the home ownership policy on

the mobility of labour in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would also

like to provide a slightly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>

different  perspective  from Mr Lew  on  the  same  topic  of

Executive Condominiums (ECs).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall, the EC scheme was conceived a few years

back  to  cater to the growing sandwiched segment,  that  is,

Singaporeans  who  were closed out of the  private  upgrading

market  because of run away private property prices. We  have

yet  to complete a cycle for the ECs, but already the Housing

and   Development  Board  is  offering  premium   apartments,

purportedly  by  a  revamp  of two existing  design-and-build

schemes.   Based on the proposed design features and  pricing

levels for these premium apartments, and notwithstanding some

differences, I would like to ask the Minister what  would  be

the impact of this offer on the EC scheme and, indirectly, on

the Executive Apartment Scheme as well, and its impact on the

resale potential for such apartments. Would this scheme  pose

unfair competition for EC developers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to echo some of Mr Sinnakaruppan's

sentiments. A fundamental question would be the need for  HDB

to be involved in meeting needs beyond the basic level which,

for  the sake of argument, could refer to housing for  first-timers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, building new

housing  estates  is one of the key priorities  of  HDB.  The

usual  reaction of a potential house owner would  be  one  of

eager anticipation. Upon receiving his keys, the reaction  is

one  of  joy.  Upon moving into the new estate,  his  joy  is

tempered and harsh realities set in. Soon, the inconveniences

of  a new estate will dawn upon him.  Sengkang New Town is  a

case in point.  It was touted as the new town to live in.  It

was  a town where the conveniences of a new estate are to  be

matched   by   a  superb  transportation  system.    However,

residents  who  have moved in over the past  few  years  have

faced  the harsh realities.  Conveniences are far and few  in

between, and inconveniences abound.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, much can be done to improve the design of

future flats in Sengkang.  Covered linkways are aesthetically

appealing to the eye, but often do not shelter you  from  the

rain.   I  have  walked there at night and even  in  a  light

drizzle,  you get wet.  Block signs are so small that  it  is

extremely  difficult to find your way around, not  only  when

you drive around the parameter but even when you are within a

cluster itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenities are few and therefore prices of goods,

including market produce, are significantly higher than other

places.   Although  there are at least about  20,000  housing

units,  there are only two clinics tucked away in one corner.

The  scarcity of amenities has resulted in outrageous  rents.

This  has been passed back to the consumer as an increase  in

consumer prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, in terms of the comparison of rental

prices  of  clinic  space,  in Ang Mo  Kio  estate,  existing

rentals  for  a  precinct are about $3 per  sq  ft.   Hougang

estate  is  about  $4 per sq ft.  These are  for  HDB  rental

units.  For those which have been sold by HDB and sub-let, it

is  about $9-$15 per sq ft.  Those in Sengkang range from $25

-  $34 per sq ft.  So if we compare them to Ang Mo Kio, it is

almost 10 times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shops or market units in comparison, in Ang Mo Kio,

the  going  rate  for a flower stall is about  $250-$468  per

month.   Comparatively, in Sengkang, it is $2,500,  which  is

more  than  five times.  A fish stall is about $350-$650  per

month.   Comparatively,  in Sengkang,  it  is  about  $3,000-$4,000.  So it is about six times.  For meat and poultry,  it

is  about $288-$850 in Ang Mo Kio.  In Sengkang, it is  about

$3,000-$3,500.  This is about four times, and so  on  and  so

forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not unexpected sometimes in new estates to

expect  an increase in prices.  But I think what has happened

is that the scarcity of amenities and facilities has resulted

in  these  high rents.  The unnecessary increase in  consumer

prices made things very difficult for the residents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first like to thank the Minister for the support

given  to the grassroots organisations with the formation  of

the  Sengkang Town Development Steering Committee.   We  have

given various recommendations to the Ministry to improve  the

quality  of  life in Sengkang Town.  We would be grateful  if

the   Minister  can  kindly  enlighten  us  on  some  of  the

development projects, so that my residents will  be  able  to

see  that Sengkang Town is the town that they would  want  to

live in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the suspension

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with

the  rapid  advances  in IT and Internet technology,  today's

offices are no longer the same as the traditional offices  we

have in mind.  Sectors such  as IT technology, e-commerce and

technological   services  can  be  located   in   residential

premises.   So  long  as  there is  a  desktop  computer,  PC

software  development and other business  activities  can  be

carried out.  In this respect, I would like the HDB to do the

same  by allowing HDB lessees to register their business  and

carry out certain commercial activities in their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>

flats.   Lessees and tenants should be allowed to  carry  out

their  business from their flats, so long as these flats  are

not used as warehouses.  With the saving on rent, it will  be

better  for  these  young entrepreneurs  to  start  up  their

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emergence of e-commerce, the neighbourhood

shops  in HDB estates will be gradually phased out.   I  hope

the  HDB  and  MND would not build more shopping centres  and

shops  because with the emergence of e-commerce, it  will  be

difficult for these shops to survive.  I also hope  that  the

Building Control Department can relax on the ratio for  space

in the warehouses to be used as offices.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in surveys done

of  working  parents,  two  of the benefits  listed  as  most

helpful   in  enabling  them  to  balance  work  and   family

responsibilities are, firstly, flexible working  arrangements

and,  secondly, on site or near site childcare  centres.   In

Singapore, the MCD has done much to promote the establishment

of  childcare  centres,  both at the  workplace  and  in  the

community.    Apart  from  the  quality  of  care   provided,

convenience of location is an important factor.  Best for the

parents  are  childcare  centres  conveniently  sited  at   a

location  near to home, often a HDB void deck, or a workplace

centre.   A  review  of workplace childcare  centres  reveals

however that the majority are in Government agencies or  GLCs

with  large  manpower establishments.  This is not surprising

as  it  makes little sense for a small company with  a  small

staff to set up a childcare centre of its own.  The economies

of  scale to run such a centre are just not there to make the

enterprise  viable  without  huge  subsidy,  something  small

companies are generally not in a position to undertake.   The

numbers of staff benefitting are small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason why, however, employees of many

companies  sited  within  a  grouping  of  buildings  in   an

industrial,  business  or office complex  would  not  find  a

childcare centre conveniently located somewhere within the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>

complex  most useful.  Combined numbers make the  running  of

such  an establishment by professional childcare operators  a

viable  proposition.  This is not, however,  a  consideration

that  will occur to most developers and landlords and  if  it

did,  that  they  might  pay  any  attention  to.   Yet,  the

availability  of  such  centres would be  another  small  but

eminently  integral piece of the jigsaw of measures  that  go

towards helping working parents cope with the demands of both

work and family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister therefore consider under National

Development's  planning requirements to require  the  setting

aside  of  space for a childcare centre or, better still,  in

view  of  our  changing demographics, a multi-service  centre

which  would  also  cater for day-care for the  elderly,  for

office,  business and industrial complexes beyond  a  certain

size?   In tandem with this requirement, of course,  we  will

need  to have the agreement of the authorities to exempt this

square  footage set aside from the gross floor  area  in  the

calculation of the plot ratio.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> I would like to touch on affordability

of  HDB  flats  for  Singaporeans.  I  think  the  Government

defines  affordability in relation to household income.   The

Government  has  also  come  out with  various  indexes,  for

example,  new flat affordability index, which is based  on  a

ratio of targetted percentile household income to the minimum

qualifying  income needed to buy flats based on an affordable

loan instalment pegged at about 40% of household income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often we have heard in this House from the present

Minister  and  the  past Minister, Mr  Lim  Hng  Kiang,  that

Singapore's HDB flats are affordable.  Yet, when we have  our

constituency  dialogues  with residents, many young  couples,

middle  income families, always disagree with this  point  of

view, and they say that they are finding it very difficult to

afford  the  flat  that  they  have  or  aspired  to  upgrade

slightly.    The   question  is  where   is   this   gap   of

understanding.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from a broader perspective, it is not

sufficient to just define affordability by household  income.

I  think  we  have moved from the 60s, 70s, to  80s  and  90s

where, to some extent, the lifestyle changes and family  size

have to be taken into cognizance.  Because if you have two or

three  school going children, sometimes you find  that,  just

taking  a  household  income per se for a  husband  and  wife

versus  somebody with three or four, or like Mr Ong Kian  Min

who has five children, it is going to be very difficult.   It

is very difficult to therefore just base on household income.

We  are,  on  the  one hand, encouraging  our  middle  income

families to have more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon said that our

reproduction rates are not sufficiently high as  before.   If

not the lifestyle, we should particularly consider the family

size  in  deciding  this because the households  with  school

going children face a lot of middle class squeeze, whether to

send their child to the childcare centre or whether it is the

PCF  childcare centre which is available, if not, some church

or  other  private  childcare centre.  It is  the  same  with

kindergartens,  whether to send them to the  normal  schools,

the  autonomous or the independent schools, which are  a  bit

more  costly, and so on.  The list goes on.  We have to  take

into  consideration some of these facts because, whether  you

like  it  or  not, when your neighbour's kids or the  child's

classmate comes with $2 or $3 pocket money, you also have  to

give  your  child that $2 or $3.  Where does the  money  come

from?   These  are the nuts and bolts issue that many  middle

class  families face in Singapore.  We should, in particular,

if  not the lifestyle, take into consideration the number  of

children  in  the house in determining affordability.   So  I

would  like  to  ask  the Minister to  seriously  review  the

definition of "affordability" in this context.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (West Coast):</b> Sir, it is an undeniable

fact  that the HDB has a successful public housing programme,

which  is the envy of many countries.  More than 85%  of  the

population  live  in HDB flats and about 90%  own  their  own

homes.  I applaud the HDB in the effort to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>

keep  prices  of new HDB flats affordable.  However,  as  the

structure  of  the  economy and society changes,  and  at  an

increasing rate, with the power of information technology,  I

would  like the authority to constantly monitor the  equation

between  price  and  affordability.  I fully  agree  with  Mr

Sinnakaruppan that the current principle of keeping the  cost

of  housing  at 40% of the household income may  need  to  be

reviewed.  The household income might be the same but, as  Mr

Sinnakaruppan has said, the needs of each family can be quite

different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 40% of the household income is a very blunt

instrument  to  determine affordability  of  the  HDB  flats.

Especially in a knowledge-based economy, there will  be  some

families  who  will  lose out because of their  inability  to

cope.   As a result, their  income level may fall below  that

of  the  average household and the gap between the  different

household income groups could increase.  Similarly, while the

typical  household size is likely to decrease in the  future,

there  will still be families who cannot afford but  to  live

together.  Households with low incomes and more members  will

therefore  find it very difficult to own their  home.   Would

the  Minister  look into the needs of such families  who  are

facing difficulties in owning their HDB flats?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I would like to raise a point

regarding  the  pricing philosophy for HDB flats.   There  is

currently  a  gap,  albeit not a serious  one,  in  terms  of

expectations  between buyers and HDB.  It  is  not  uncommon,

especially  during the crisis as well as during the  property

market boom, for many HDB dwellers to express frustration and

uncertainty over what they would actually pay for their flat.

Part of this can be attributed to the queuing time which  can

be  inordinately long for the more popular zones.  Apart from

this,  there is also little or a direct reflection of pricing

by, firstly, the location of the new flat and, secondly, on a

per  square  metre or per square foot basis.  The  latter  is

used  throughout  the  private housing  market  for  whatever

benchmarking it offers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the HDB, however, the emphasis is on room-type and

although  most  Singaporeans understand the references  quite

well by now, a 3-room flat really has two bedrooms and both a

4-room and a 5-room flat have only three bedrooms. Some  have

expressed  surprise  too that the new  5-room  flats  somehow

appear or are in fact smaller than the older generation ones.

This  sense  of  being  shortchanged is misplaced  and  quite

unnecessary.  Can the Minister reveal how the sense of  value

for  new  HDB  flats  can be properly  conveyed  to  would-be

buyers?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I echo Mrs Lim's

description  of the problem concerning HDB flat prices.   Let

me  just  illustrate the problem.  During the  onset  of  the

financial  crisis, some applicants for HDB  Executive  flats,

for  example, were asked to select their flats based on  pre-crisis prices. This was in November 1997.  Even in March 1998

when  they went to collect their keys and pay their 20%,  the

price   remained  unchanged.   But  last  year   when   these

applicants moved in, they found to their surprise that prices

had  dropped  dramatically for the unsold flats.   The  price

drops  ranged  from  $30,000 to  as  much  as  $100,000.   In

percentage terms, the range was from 15% to 35%.   Naturally,

the  flat owners who paid these high prices would, of course,

like  to  have their prices adjusted downwards to  reflect  a

fairer  deal.   I  think  it is an example  of  the  lack  of

coincidence  between the expectation of  the  buyer  and  the

approach by HDB.  After all, the point that many buyers  made

is  that  HDB  has the monopoly as far as public  housing  is

concerned and potential owners do not really have the  luxury

of choosing their time to purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether it is not desirable for

HDB  to   have  a fairly stable price structure whatever  the

market  conditions are like, and whether in such an instance,

HDB  could  consider adjusting the prices of those  affected,

ie,  the Executive flat owners who paid substantially  higher

prices for their flats in 1997.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> The HDB upgrading programme has been

generally well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>

received   by  residents.   Most  residents  vote  for   this

programme, pay their share of upgrading cost, are prepared to

put  up with the inconvenience during the upgrading, and  are

happy with the outcome when the upgrading is finished.   Many

see  their  flat  values rise significantly after  upgrading.

The  only  source  of unhappiness and contention,  especially

during  the  upgrading, is the selection of the  space-adding

item  within their flat and the choice of finishing of  their

flat.   Two  of my blocks in my constituency had  their  main

upgrading  not  too  long  ago.   I  must  confess  that  the

upgrading  within their flats caused quite  a  few  problems,

with  differing  views on the space adding items,  choice  of

tiles,  leakage problems and some lack of cooperation on  the

part of residents who refused entry to contractors to work in

their flats for whatever reasons.  A few felt that they  were

not given what they wanted despite having to pay for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the question whether the HDB should be

involved in the upgrading of the interior of HDB flats during

the  Main  Upgrading Programme.  Why do we not just focus  on

the  upgrading of the common areas at the precinct and  leave

the   renovation  of  the  inside  of  flats  to  the  owners

themselves?  Different households are at different stages  of

their lives and have different needs and different capacities

and resources to pay for them.  We should leave the upgrading

of  the  interior  of flats to the owners to  allow  them  to

maximise  their economic utility and also help speed  up  the

upgrading  process.  In my view, the main  upgrading  process

now  takes far too long, in fact, long enough for you to pull

down  the entire block and rebuild.  I hope the Minister will

review this policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, our Government has

been  carrying on these Interim Upgrading Programme and  Main

Upgrading   Programme  with  the  view   of   improving   the

environment  and providing better service to  the  residents.

With  this ageing population, I think the most important item

in  the upgrading programme is to improve the service of  the

lifts.  In the older HDB estates, lifts do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>

not  stop  at every floor.  For those who are living  in  the

high  floor,  particularly the senior citizens,  it  is  very

inconvenient.   HDB understands this problem.  Therefore,  in

the  new flats, the design is such that the lifts would  stop

at  every  floor.   They provide very  good  service  to  the

residents, particularly the senior citizens, and this has won

the praises of the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have about 280,000 people aged 60 years and above.

90%  of them are staying in HDB flats.  Every day, they  have

to  make use of the lifts to go upstairs and downstairs.   If

the lifts do not stop at the floor on which they are staying,

they  would  have  to walk up one or two floors  before  they

could  use  the  lifts.  To the young  people,  there  is  no

problem.   But for the old people, particularly those who are

not feeling well, it poses a problem.  On one occasion, I met

an  old man who was sitting at the ground floor of the  flat,

waiting  for his son to come back to help him to go upstairs.

He said he could not walk up.  I asked him how  he managed to

come down.  He told me in Teochew, "My legs are not listening

to me.  I can walk down but I cannot walk up."  I came across

a  newspaper  report that when a person  gets  old  his  most

vulnerable part is his legs.  They would not be able to  walk

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, I am living in an HDB estate and work very

closely  with the residents.  I understand the problems  they

are  facing,  and  their needs.  I feel  that  improving  the

service  of  the  lifts  is the most important  item  in  the

upgrading  projects.   I  think the  lifts  and  the  covered

walkways are the two most important and most frequently  used

facilities in the HDB estates.  HDB should seriously consider

installing  new  lifts with landing on every  floor  for  the

benefit of  the residents, particularly the senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered that some Interim Upgrading Programmes have

not included the improvement to the lifts.  The residents are

very disappointed with it.  HDB rules that improvement to the

lifts  would  only  be  carried out  in  the  Main  Upgrading

Programme.   For  some estates, after the  IUP  projects  are

implemented, the residents have to wait for some 10 years, or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>

even  longer for the MUP projects.  I think this is too long,

particularly for the old people.  They may not be around when

the lifts are eventually improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we can give this matter more urgency. As

the  Finance Minister has said, we have a budget  surplus  of

$3.2  billion.  I think we should set aside $300  million  to

help HDB in improving the lift service for the benefit of the

280,000 senior citizens in our population.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, since 1992, selected old HDB

flats  have  been  undergoing  upgrading  through  the   Main

Upgrading  and  the  Interim  Upgrading  programmes.    These

programmes  are highly popular with the residents since  they

have  brought  about  new facilities  and  amenities  in  the

precinct  as well as an enhancement in the value of the  flat

in  this  resale market.  The benefits to the  residents  are

immense.   Covered linkways provide shelter; communal  places

allow  residents  to  interact with  one  another;  and,  the

upgraded  lift lobbies and common areas make the  place  look

more attractive.  I therefore would like to congratulate  the

HDB  and  the  Town  Councils for doing a  wonderful  job  in

creating  a  higher quality living environment  for  our  HDB

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the financial crisis behind us, may I urge the

Ministry  to  accelerate the upgrading  programmes.   Besides

benefiting the residents, these upgrading projects will  also

provide opportunities for the construction sector to speed up

its recovery.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the HDB upgrading programmes, ie,

MUP  and  IUP,  are  implemented in phases.   Each  upgrading

precinct  comprises between five and 10 blocks.  Very  often,

covered  linkways are designed to link blocks  together,  and

from  blocks  to  bus-stops  or  other  amenities.   But  the

Ministry does not allow the MUP or IUP budget to be used  for

covered  linkways  beyond the upgrading precinct.   As  such,

covered  linkways  are  sometimes not  completely  linked  to

blocks or public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>

amenities  to  provide a seamless connection  for  residents.

This  is  especially so when the linkway  spans  across  land

parcels belonging to different authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some MUP and IUP, certain infrastructure works

belonging to HDB, such as access road and car park,  are  not

upgraded  during the upgrading programme.  This has  affected

the overall rejuvenation of the upgraded precinct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgraded precinct with its new facilities, such as

lift  stopping at every landing, will also increase the  cost

of  maintenance for Town Councils.  Sir, I wish to  make  the

following suggestions for the Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide additional budget for covered linkways

which  link  upgraded  precincts to  buildings  or  amenities

outside the upgraded precinct boundary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Coordinate with LTA, ENV and Land Office to ensure

that  linkways  can  be  constructed to  bus-stops  or  other

amenities during upgrading programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide a budget to provide anti-mosquito breeding

features  to be incorporated in the upgrading precinct,  such

as clothes hanging poles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide a budget for HDB to upgrade car parks and

access roads of upgrading precinct during MUP and IUP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Provide a grant for Town Councils to bring forward

cyclical  works  of  upgrading precinct  so  as  to  minimise

inconvenience to residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Provide a special grant to Town Councils, which

have blocks with lifts stopping at every floor landing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many of our older

HDB  flats  are now undergoing upgrading.  Most of them  were

built  some 20-over years ago when the problem of  an  ageing

population  was not an issue.  In these estates, some  blocks

have lifts and some do not.  Even for those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>

with  lifts, the lifts do not land on every floor.  Moreover,

for this special type of flats known as segmented blocks, the

residents  would  have to walk a distance  along  the  public

corridor on the lift-landing floor before walking up or  down

the stairs to their respective flats. To the senior citizens,

the problem is aggravated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend Minister Mah Bow Tan for making

the  decision to  allow the lifts to stop at every floor, and

for building additional lifts in some of the older blocks.  I

would  like to urge HDB to provide these facilities  for  all

the blocks in order to look after the ageing population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the following years, I think there will be more

problems with the lifts in the older estates.  In fact,  from

what I know, some people have to upgrade simply  because they

are  fed  up  with  the inadequacy  of the  lift  service  at

their old flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the lifts in the upgrading precinct, there are

still  other problems to be resolved.  Who is going to  share

in  the  cost  and who can vote and who cannot vote,  or  can

everyone  vote?   This issue has not been resolved.   I  feel

that we need some specific ruling on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, I would like to thank

HDB  and the Government for the upgrading programmes.  We saw

4,900 units of flats in my constituency, Boon Lay, benefiting

or  about  to  benefit from the Interim  and  Main  Upgrading

Programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older constituencies like Boon Lay, most if not all

of  the  flats are eligible for main upgrading.  But being  a

nation-wide  programme, upgrading could  only  proceed  at  a

certain  pace.  So, many residents are therefore afraid  that

it will take quite some years before their turn for upgrading

of flats will come.  Some of the older ones wonder whether if

they will live long enough to see the upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the sentiments expressed by the earlier

speaker,  Dr  Wan  Soon Bee.  And I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister,  in view of the economic recovery and the  stronger

financial position, and, in fact, larger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>

surpluses  accumulated by the Government, whether  HDB  could

accelerate these upgrading programmes so that more  of  those

who  live  in  the  older  estates  could  benefit  from  the

programme early.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on HDB

upgrading, I recall that on 7th March, during the  debate  on

the  financial  policy of the Government,  the  Minister  for

Finance, in reply to questions on the budget surpluses,  said

and  I  quote:  "Who is the Government?   The  money  in  the

reserves  is yours.  What is the Government?  The  Government

represents the people.  The Frontbench and the Ministers  are

just your agents holding the money."  The Minister spoke with

justification and good reasons.  But the more I think of  it,

the  more I become doubtful.  The Government's money  belongs

to the people.  But it is for the Government to decide how to

spend  it.  The ruling Party, the PAP, is using the  people's

money  to  threaten the people by saying that if you  do  not

vote  for the PAP, you would not get the benefit of upgrading

funded by the Government with the people's money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said time and again that the

Government  represents  the  people.   Since  the  Government

represents  the people, it should be fair to all  the  people

alike.   But  the  scheduling of the upgrading  programme  is

based  on  the  election results.  In  the  PAP  wards,  some

estates  which  are not very old have already been  upgraded.

But  in my Hougang constituency, some older flats in the  old

Punggol  estate are already more than 23 years old,  yet  the

turn  has  not  come  for  them to be  upgraded.   Since  the

Government's money is the people's money, why is it that  the

people  in  the Opposition wards do not have a share  in  it?

Perhaps the PAP Government does not regard the people in  the

Opposition wards as their people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last general election, Prime Minister Goh Chok

Tong even went to the extent of saying that the flats in  the

Opposition wards might become slums one day.  These are words

coming  out from the mouth of the Prime Minister.  I am  very

surprised.  When I referred to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>

upgrading  issue  in  Parliament, the Minister  for  National

Development said that it was not possible to upgrade all  the

flats  at the same time.  The Opposition wards must queue  up

at  the  end.  But now the situation is that the flats  which

are  less  than  10  years old in the PAP wards  are  already

upgraded, while flats which are more than 20 years old in the

Hougang constituency have not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate the Minister for National Development

telling  me that there is a difference between IUP  and  MUP.

Be  that as it may, the people in Hougang can suffer a little

bit of disadvantage.  The Government can just provide IUP  to

these flats that are more than 20 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this policy of two different kinds of

upgrading  is that flats in Hougang which are older  than  20

years  are  not  upgraded, but flats in other  constituencies

which  are  less  than  10  years  old   are  upgraded.    My

conclusion is that the Minister's explanation that it is  not

possible  to  have  all the estates upgraded  does  not  hold

water.   What  the PAP Government really meant was  that  the

Opposition  wards  would have to wait  till  what  the  Prime

Minister  said  at  the last election that "opposition  wards

will become slums".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the Prime Minister has said, one fine day the

Opposition ward does become a slum, compared to other  wards,

this  will be the desired outcome of the PAP in consolidating

the  hold  of its power and an achievement of Prime  Minister

Goh  during  his term of office!  By then, I  wonder  if  the

Cabinet,  which  the Minister for Finance  described  as  the

custodian of the people's money, will feel proud of the slums

among them in the so-called Singapore 21 vision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me thank all the Members who have

spoken.   I  am  grateful to them for keeping their  speeches

short.  Because I have got a fairly long agenda to take  care

of,  I  need a bit more time.  Thank you very much, first  of

all, to the Members who have spoken on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>

the Concept Plan review.  This is a subject that I will first

touch upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau, Mr Ong Kian Min, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr

Sinnakaruppan,  in particular, spoke about the  Concept  Plan

review  and  asked  questions regarding the upcoming  Concept

Plan review, and also raised several questions pertaining  to

that review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the issues raised are indeed being studied

as  part  of  this current Concept Plan review.  The  Concept

Plan  is  a  blue-print which guides our planners in  shaping

Singapore's physical development to make Singapore a thriving

world-class city, a city which Singaporeans can be  proud  to

call their home and, of course, to make it a livable city and

attractive city so that foreigners want to come here to live,

work and even settle down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Concept Plan review, the starting point is to

decide,  first  of all, on what is our long-term  population,

what  planning  parameters do we use for population,  because

this  decides  how  much  we  set aside  for  infrastructure,

services, and so on.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1991 Concept Plan, the figure that we used for

planning  purposes was four million.  The focus then  was  on

the  indigenous and the resident population and that included

of course PRs.  Since then, we have attracted more employment

pass  and work permit holders in order to support the growing

economy.  As a result of this, the total population has grown

rapidly  from three million in 1990, when we were  doing  the

previous  Concept Plan, to about 3.9 million.  So  obviously,

we  need  to update our original 1991 Concept Plan population

of four million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this review, we are adopting a long-term population

figure  of  5.5  million.  This includes citizens,  permanent

residents,  employment pass as well as work  permit  holders.

By  long term, I am talking about some time in the middle  of

this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>

century,  2040-2050, because that is the  long-term  planning

horizon  when we are talking about land use.  But  this  does

not, in any way, suggest that Singapore can only support  5.5

million people.  Indeed, it would be very difficult for us at

this  point in time to know or to project what life is  going

to  be like in 40 or 50 years' time. With further advances in

technology,    information   technology,   telecommunications

technology,   reclamation  technology,  building  technology,

transportation  technology, we may be  able  to  plan  for  a

population larger than 5.5 million in future.  But,  at  this

point  in  time, for this current review, this is the  number

that we are looking at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our limited land space is a given in this exercise

and  we  need  to  optimise  the  use  of  our  limited  land

resources,  as  Mr  Lew,  Mr Sinnakaruppan  and  others  have

pointed  out.   In  order  to  effectively  accommodate  more

people,  in order to provide more commercial, industrial  and

recreational space, we would have to optimise or maximise the

use of this limited land.  This means building upwards, high-rise  residential  apartments, commercial  towers,  high-rise

flatted factories, and so on.  HDB has announced that it will

be  building its first 40-storey block in Toa Payoh.  If  the

response is good, HDB will build more where it is possible to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses that cannot go high rise are located where there

are  height constraints.  In Singapore, there are many places

where  buildings cannot go up beyond a certain height because

of  the  height constraints, airspace constraint, and so  on.

Pollutive  industries would be grouped together  to  minimise

the  constraints  they  impose  on  their  surroundings,  ie,

sewerage  treatment  plants  and noise  polluting  industries

where  buffers  are required by law in order to  protect  the

environment.  These would be located together so  that  their

buffers will cancel one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisure and recreational facilities, such as golf

courses,  would  be  located within  water  catchment  areas.

Again,  this  is  so  as not to use up additional  land.   If

necessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>

and  if possible, we will put some of our infrastructure  and

services  underground.  The Environment Ministry is  starting

work  on  the deep tunnel sewerage system.  Mindef is looking

at   underground  ammunition  dumps,  or  ammunition  storage

depots.   We  will  encourage the co-location  of  compatible

uses.  Mr Ong Kian Min mentioned just now the possibility  of

providing  recreational or eating facilities  in  our  parks.

This  is  indeed being done and some of our parks are already

host  to  very thriving, very successful and very  attractive

eating places,  for example, the Botanic Gardens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we can also cluster different uses together.

Community   facilities,   such  as  community   centres   and

libraries, can be clustered together.  This in fact is  being

done  now,  the  first one being the Marine Parade  community

centre in the Prime Minister's constituency.  By doing it  in

this  way,  by imaginative and creative use of land,  or  co-location  of such facilities, we can save as much as  40%  of

the  land  compared to the situation where we have  to  build

them separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must also be realistic. There is, at the end of

the  day, a limited amount of land that we have in Singapore.

So  notwithstanding the many areas and many ways in which  we

can  optimise land use, at the end of the day, we would still

need  to make very difficult trade-offs in planning our  land

use.   For example, we would have to decide how much land  we

want  to  set aside for housing, and for a better quality  of

life,  how  much green space to set aside and, on  the  other

hand,  how much industrial land we need to set aside in order

to  attract industries, investments and dollars to create the

jobs  that  will fuel economic growth.  These  are  difficult

decisions.   Ultimately, the Government would  have  to  make

these  decisions.   But in arriving at these  decisions,  the

Government  would involve as many people as possible  in  the

planning process.  Not only do we let people have a say,  but

I  think  it  is  also  good  to let  people  understand  the

difficulties  that are faced in arriving at  such  decisions.

Collectively, Sir, we will have to determine the kind of city

we want for ourselves and future generations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to a basic concern of many Members, which is

housing.   Do  we  have enough land for housing?   The  short

answer is yes.  Even for a population planning target of  5.5

million,  let  me  assure the House that  there  will  be  no

shortage  of  land for housing.  We have one million  housing

units today spread over 10,000 hectares of land.  A total  of

16,400  hectares  of land have been safeguarded  for  housing

over  the  long  term.  This is sufficient  to  house  a  5.5

million population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For private housing, since 1990, the Government has

systematically  injected more housing units into  the  market

through the Government land sales programme.  And as a result

of  this, the proportion of private to pubic housing  in  the

housing  stock  has risen steadily from 14% in  1990  to  18%

today.   This  is going to increase even further  because  we

recognise  that  we have to cater for a population  which  is

becoming  more  affluent, which will have higher  aspirations

for  more  exclusive housing types and are prepared,  willing

and  able  to  pay  for  them.  But at  the  same  time,  the

Government  will continue to build sufficient public  housing

to cater to the majority of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For planning purposes, MND will adopt the housing mix of

75:25,  in other words, 75% public, 25% private.  But let  me

just  say that we cannot cast these plans in stone.  We  have

to  take into account the changing tastes of the market.   We

must  be flexible in order to accommodate any changes in  the

marketplace.  While this would be the planning  norm  in  the

current  Concept  Plan review, the situation  may  change  in

subsequent plans.  But for this particular purpose,  we  feel

that this is a realistic and reasonable mix to plan for.   We

will  monitor the market closely and we will have  to  adjust

the public housing as well as the land sales programme as  we

go  along  in order to meet the changing aspirations  of  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the quantitative aspect of the housing and land

use  problems.  But even as our planners strive to meet these

quantitative aspects of housing and other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>

needs, they would also do well not to neglect the qualitative

aspect  of  our  built  environment.  Our  existing  planning

system   has  facilitated  the  development  of  a  generally

efficient,  safe  and attractive urban  environment.   But  I

think we can do more to enhance Singapore's attractiveness as

a city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the design quality of our buildings improves and as

our  construction industry matures, URA has also relaxed  and

reduced  its development controls and urban design guidelines

over  the next few years.  URA will explore various  ways  to

further  facilitate and encourage creative developments.   It

will review the existing development control and urban design

guidelines,  for  example, those  that  pertain  to  the  key

districts, such as the Civic District, the Historic District,

the  Central  Business District and the  tourist  belt  along

Orchard  Road.   All  these can be made  known.   Architects,

designers  and  planners will then know what  areas  need  to

comply  with the guidelines.  And outside of these areas,  we

can  afford  to  be a bit more relaxed and  only  apply  very

minimal urban design guidelines.  In this way, we hope to  be

able to encourage more creativity and more innovation in  the

design of the built environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that URA intends to do is to establish an

international  advisory panel to provide  ideas  on  planning

strategies  and proposals.  URA is already currently  engaged

with  international  experts.  But they hope  that  they  can

formalise  this through the formation of such a  panel  which

will comprise eminent experts from all over the world.  After

all,  we  do  aspire  to  be  a global  world-class  city  of

excellence.    But   we   need  to  also   complement   their

contributions  with those of our local experts.   Conferences

and  workshops  will be organised to raise  the  standard  of

local   design   and  also  to  promote,  very   importantly,

appreciation by the public, the owners and developers of what

constitute good and creative designs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan review is an exciting and a very

important  exercise.  We will be entering soon a phase  which

allows  the  URA  to involve the public in  various  planning

issues  and  the  Concept Plan will be finalised  after  such

consultation exercises.  This public consultation  will  take

place at different levels.  There will be small focused group

sessions with the professionals and informed members  of  the

public  to  discuss issues and trade-offs that are  faced  in

land use planning.  On a larger scale, public exhibitions  of

the  plan  will  be held next year.  Again, this  is  another

opportunity for the public to comment and to give feedback on

these  plans.  With the participation of the public and  with

URA's  proactive strategies, I am confident that we  will  be

able  to  make Singapore a thriving world-class city  in  the

21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to address some of the specific issues

that  were  raised by the Members just now.  Mr Lew  Syn  Pau

suggested  that  we  allow  a higher  plot  ratio  for  prime

residential land in order to allow more people to live in the

prime areas.  Sir, this does make good economic sense and, as

far  as possible, this would be done, as indeed, it is  being

done today.  But he would also agree that not every piece  of

land can support a higher plot ratio.  There will be limiting

constraints  and factors, such as height constraints  imposed

by   flight  paths,  as  well  as  capacity  constraints   of

infrastructure, or services, like roads, sewerage, etc.   But

as far as possible, this is something that will be done.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, along the same lines, spoke about the

need  to  bring more life into the Central Business District,

such  as Raffles Place. I agree with Mr Ong.  Our CBD can  be

better  utilised.   In  fact, we have  gradually  started  to

introduce  mixed use and residential developments  to  create

more  life  and vibrancy in the CBD after office  hours.  For

example, if you take the Boat Quay development, when you look

out  of Parliament House, you will agree, if you are here  in

the  evenings,  how vibrant and how noisy  it  is.  Fullerton

Hotel is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>

development that has been awarded to a developer to create  a

top-class hotel and I believe that will also bring life  into

the  city.   Far  East Square is another  example.   For  our

future downtown at Marina South, we will be zoning more sites

as  white sites.  What these white sites allow developers  to

do  is  to  give them flexibility to plan for wider range  of

uses so as not be constrained by URA guideplans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min and Dr Teo Ho Pin spoke about planning

for the aged. Yes, this is going to become more important  as

our   population   ages.   I  chaired  the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  last  year to look at the problems  of  an  ageing

population  and  the  Committee  came  up  with  a   set   of

recommendations including the need to cater for  the  elderly

in  our  built  environment  and the  need  to  provide  more

facilities  such  as  nursing homes,  aged  homes  and  other

support  facilities. URA and HDB will work together with  the

Ministry  of Health and the Ministry of Community Development

and  Sports to ensure that sufficient land is set  aside  for

such uses. The Land Transport Authority has also factored the

transportation needs of the elderly into its plans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked how we provide greenery within our

built  environment. We have, within our residential  estates,

provided a variety of parks and common green, as well as park

connectors  and these will form the green link between  parks

which  is  useful  to enhance the quality of  life.  Finally,

there  was the question about how we can factor IT  into  our

commercial developments. Yes, this is an important aspect  of

the  review  and  what the review will do  is  to  take  into

consideration  the  rapid  technological  changes  and  their

impact  on the way we live, work and play.  This would impact

ultimately  on  the  amount of land that  we  set  aside  for

industry and commercial developments, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered all the relevant questions on

the  Concept  Plan  review.  May I now  respond  to  Members'

questions  on public housing.  But before I do so,  first  of

all,  I  would  like  to remind the House  that  the  HDB  is

celebrating its 40th anniversary this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB was set up in 1960 to solve Singapore's housing

problems.  At  that  time  in  1960,  less  than  9%  of  the

population lived in low-cost housing.  The majority lived  in

slums  and squatter colonies. Today, 40 years later, as  many

Members have pointed out, it is 86% of our population  living

in  HDB  flats,  and 9 out of 10 HDB dwellers own  their  own

flats.   And  over these years, public housing has  developed

from  the  very  basic, spartan low-cost housing  units  into

homes  and communities that our citizens are proud  of.   HDB

flats   are   spacious,   comfortable,   well-furnished   and

affordable and provide residents with clean and secure  homes

within self-contained communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public housing programme is one of Singapore's

enduring success stories.  It has given Singaporeans a  stake

in  the nation. It has contributed to social stability in our

nation-building process.  When you talk about  the  Singapore

heartbeat,  if  you want to find the Singapore heartbeat,  go

down to the HDB's heartlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore owes a deep debt of gratitude to many men and

women  of  HDB  who  have  made this possible,  led  by  many

distinguished Chairmen, including the first Chairman, Mr  Lim

Kim  San, Mr Howe Yoon Chong, Mr Lee Hee Seng, Mr Michael Fam

and Mr Hsuan Owyang. Some time this year, HDB will be handing

over the keys to the 800,000th family. This is indeed a great

achievement.   I  have  asked HDB to  organise  an  event  to

commemorate this significant milestone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On specific issues raised by Members, Mr Sinnakaruppan

made  a very interesting suggestion and I think I should take

his  suggestion  first.  He asked whether the  Government  is

prepared  to  introduce  more  competition  into  the  public

housing  arena.  He did not use the term, but I presume  that

he meant a HDB 2 because he still wants to have all the rules

and regulations and subsidies associated with public housing.

Over  the  past  40 years, HDB has accumulated  a  wealth  of

experience  in  public  housing  and  the  Member  would  not

disagree  with me that this, together with the  economies  of

scale of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>

building  so  many  public housing  units,  has  enabled  the

Housing  and Development Board to keep development  cost  low

and housing quality high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public housing is held in great esteem and regard by

many  countries and I do not mean just developing  countries.

Members  who have visited the HDB, the Ministry and Singapore

from the developed countries are equally amazed at how we are

able, not just to develop and build, but also to maintain and

keep HDB housing to the highest quality and standards.  I was

in  Hong Kong recently. I went there to look at their  public

housing and they were quite frank in telling me that a lot of

ideas  were actually adapted from Singapore, and  I  am  sure

Singapore's  HDB  did  the  same.   There  is  a  wealth   of

experience built into this and this is manifested in the kind

of public housing we have today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we move quickly into carving out HDB into two, or

even three blocks and get them to compete with each other, we

should  pause a while and consider the implications of  this.

Having said that, there is a valid point in the sense that we

should  try as much as possible to involve the private sector

in  schemes to build and upgrade public housing.  There is  a

difference  between doing that and what the Member suggested,

which  is  to create a competitor to HDB. How does Government

do   this   at  the  moment?   Through  the  design-and-build

programme,  the  Main and Interim Upgrading  programmes,  the

Executive Condominium scheme and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am hesitant to talk about a HDB 2, at the same

time,  I  must tell the Member that we are always looking  at

ways   to   engage  the  private  sector  in  public  housing

programmes  and  projects and if there is an area  where  the

private  sector  can do a better job than the public  sector,

then  I agree that we should give them the opportunity to  do

so.   I  do not see the need for Government to set up another

agency at this stage to compete with HDB or to privatise HDB.

We should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>

not  lose  sight of the fact that a major component of  HDB's

mission  is  not  about building flats.  It is  about  social

cohesion  and  community  bonding.  Those  are  things  which

cannot  be easily measured in terms which the private  sector

understands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, like Mr Sinnakaruppan, Dr Wan Soon Boon,

Mrs  Lim Hwee Hua and Prof. Chin, amongst others, have spoken

about  the question of affordability of HDB flats.   Let  me,

first  of  all,  explain  to Members  how  and  what  is  the

rationale  behind Government's pricing policy of  HDB  flats.

First  of  all,  the Government is committed to  keeping  the

prices  of  HDB  flats affordable to the Singapore  citizens,

especially to first-timers and to lower-income families.  How

is  this  done?   By  pricing HDB  flats  such  that  90%  of

Singaporean households can afford at least a 3-room flat, and

70% at least a 4-room flat.  5-room flats and Executive flats

which  HDB  used to build in the past but which they  do  not

anymore,  are  additional choices for those  households  with

higher  incomes.  In line with these principles, smaller  HDB

flats  are generally given more subsidy.  HDB does not follow

the  private  sector's practice of pricing  its  flats  on  a

dollar per square metre or dollar per-square-foot basis which

is  what Mrs Lim Hwee Hua was suggesting just now.  If we did

so,  then the differences between large and small flats would

be  blurred.   I  do not think this is the intention  of  the

HDB's  pricing  policy.  This explains  why  the  dollar  per

square metre of Executive flats, for example, is higher  than

that  of 5-room flats, 5-room flat per-square-metre is higher

than  4-room,  and so on. And because of these  affordability

criteria, 9 out of 10 HDB dwellers today own their own homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee mentioned the 40% of household income

that  is being used to determine maximum loan quantum,  which

in  turn determines whether a person can afford a HDB flat or

not.   If  you take the average HDB flat prices, the  average

monthly mortgage instalment for a HDB flat as a percentage of

his  monthly household income, is way below the 40% criterion

of  a  purchaser's household income.  Dr Wan can be reassured

that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>

40% is not a limiting factor in terms of pricing and allowing

HDB flat dwellers to own their own homes.  In fact, what that

means  is  that  most HDB flat dwellers are able  to  service

their  mortgage  loans entirely with their CPF contributions.

To  another question posed by another Member, there are  very

few  HDB dwellers who do not pay their HDB mortgages in time.

For  4-room flats, the mortgage instalments are roughly about

18%  of  the  applicant's household income;  and  for  5-room

flats, around the same, 19% of the household income. This  is

the amount of money that HDB dwellers pay as a percentage  of

their total household income, way below the 40% limit that Dr

Wan was talking about just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan then posed another interesting

proposition. He asked whether HDB can consider lifestyle  and

family size in the setting of flat prices for HDB. This is  a

very  novel suggestion but this is going to send a very wrong

signal  to  the people concerned.  If we take that suggestion

seriously,  the  logical conclusion is  that  there  must  be

different flat prices for different families.  If you have  a

large  family,  you  have one price.  If  you  have  a  small

family,  you  have a different price.  Mr Ong Kian  Min,  for

example,  who,  I am told, has a larger than average  family,

would have to be given a higher subsidy in order to afford  a

HDB flat.  Is that not right?

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Let us take a three-child family.

In  addition  to the family income, let us take the  kind  of

expenditure  for  a  three-child family and  use  that  as  a

benchmark,  and  then purely using 40% of  household  income.

Because,  for  a young couple with no children  versus  three

children, it is going to mean different things when  we  talk

about affordability.  And that is the problem we face in  the

constituency when we tell constituents that the Minister says

it is affordable.  But the people with three kids say no.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> But that is precisely what I mean. The

families with five children would have to have a different

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>

price.   A family with six would have to have another  price.

That is exactly what I am talking about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would advise Singaporeans to purchase their flats

based  on their needs and on their affordability.  I  do  not

think  there  is  any  problem with  affordability.   As  the

statistics  and  the experience of HDB show  today,  the  40%

limit  that  is  used to compute the maximum loan  is  not  a

problem.   As  I  have explained earlier, the average  family

comes  in  way below the 40%.  So there is really no  problem

with affordability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises when family expenditures become

extremely  high, and not necessarily related to family  size.

There   are  many  families  whose  expenditures   have   got

absolutely no relationship to family size, and yet because of

their lifestyle, household expenditures are high.  So, if  we

were  to accede to that request, then I think HDB would  have

to  go and do a means test for every family, and look at  how

much  money they spend on  children, on tuition, whether they

have a car, whether they go on holidays, etc, etc.  So let us

not  get  into  that.  It is very messy.  The present  system

today works fine and let us leave it at that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked a very specific question about the

pricing of flats in his constituency.  I do not have all  the

details  at  hand,  but  suffice it to  say  that,  generally

speaking,  when  flats are priced, they are priced  based  on

several  factors, one of which, of course, is the  prevailing

market  price, because that is where the affordability  issue

comes  in.  At any point in time, in order to make the  price

affordable,  you  would  have to  benchmark  it  against  the

current  market price.  So, it may well be that the different

batches  of flats that were offered to his constituents  were

offered  at  times when prices were fluctuating very  wildly.

So there must have been a very sharp difference in the resale

prices   from  one  batch  to  another.   Hence,  the   sharp

difference in the prices offered by HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is how the pricing works. When resale prices

come down, HDB prices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>

follow.   And, similarly, when prices go up, HDB flat  prices

also  follow.  Those who have bought earlier at  high  prices

obviously  feel aggrieved.  But I do not think we can  accede

to  their  request to actually give them  a  refund.   If  we

wanted  to do that, then I think we would either have to  fix

all  prices the same irregardless of the time of year or when

it  is sold, or we would also have to ask those who have paid

lower prices to top up when the next batch comes in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is reasonable for the Member to make this

request on behalf of his constituents, but I hope the  Member

would also agree with me that he is really trying his luck on

this one.  Sir, I hate to disappoint him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also voiced concern about the role of

HDB  or the apparent move of HDB into better quality housing.

Mr Lew Syn Pau and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, among others, made these

comments,   expressing  reservations   about   HDB's   recent

announcement  of premium apartments.  First of  all,  let  me

state at the outset that I agree with Members that HDB should

focus on providing affordable public housing for the majority

of  Singaporeans.  This has and this will continue to be  the

mission of HDB.   There has been no change in housing  policy

or in the type of flats offered for sale by HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has all along provided two categories of flats for

sale  to  public  housing applicants. One,  is  the  standard

flats,  and these are flats which come with limited  finishes

for  applicants who prefer to put in their own finishes.  The

other  type  of  flat  is the so-called  design-and-build  or

design-plus  flat,  and  these flats  come  with  full  floor

finishes.   What HDB has done, in order to minimise confusion

that  flat applicants have over the different range of  flats

offered  for sale, it has grouped the design-and-build  flats

and  the design-plus flats into one category and called  them

premium   apartments.   This  is  purely  an   administrative

renaming  exercise.  There is no change  in  the  flat  type,

neither is there a change in the selling price.  And it does

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>

not in any way affect the affordability of HDB flats nor will

they  pose a competition nor indeed are they intended to pose

any   competition  to  Executive  Condominiums   or   private

properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim spoke about the problems faced by his

residents in Sengkang New Town.  I do sympathise with him  in

this regard and, in fact, this is the reason why we set up  a

special  committee  chaired  by Dr  Michael  Lim  called  the

Sengkang  Town  Steering Committee in order to  get  all  the

different   agencies  together  to  better   coordinate   the

provision  of  services.  All I can  say  is  that  HDB  will

provide  every support and do its best to help  the  Sengkang

Town  Steering  Committee to enhance coordination  among  the

various agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem every time HDB establishes a new town,

and  that  is the reason why there is a difference  in  price

between  mature  estates  and  non-mature  estates.    Mature

estates are like Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and so on.  All

the facilities are there.  Transportation facilities are more

than   adequate.    Marketing  facilities,  shops,   schools,

clinics,  etc, are all there.  They have all grown  with  the

town  over  the years.  Residents have moved in.   Businesses

are doing well.  Residents are happy.  That is the reason why

they  call  it  a  mature estate.  On  the  other  hand,  the

Sengkang town, Punggol 21 and so on are towns where residents

are only beginning to move in.  Facilities are also beginning

to  move  in.   Shopkeepers are trying to find and  establish

their  footing.  Not everybody wants to go and  build or  set

up a clinic there because they do not see the business there,

for  example.   And that is the reason why there  is  such  a

shortage of facilities.  But having said all that, I think we

should, as far as possible, get the various agencies together

and  make  sure that such facilities are provided as  quickly

and as conveniently as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to questions on HDB upgrading

programmes.   The  Main Upgrading Programme and  the  Interim

Upgrading Programme are programmes that were started 10 years

ago.  The purpose was to make sure that older

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>

estates do not degenerate, to rejuvenate and bring them up to

the standard of the newer estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December last year, the Prime Minister asked my

Ministry to review the MUP and IUP with a view to making them

more cost effective and relevant to residents' needs.  Sir, I

am  pleased  to  inform the House that the  review  has  been

completed.    In  this  review,  HDB  sought  feedback   from

residents and MPs, through surveys and dialogue sessions,  to

find  out what are the things that people want, what are  the

things  that  people value.  The HDB also spoke to  the  town

councils to find out what sort of problems they face in terms

of maintenance in upkeeping upgraded estates.  HDB internally

also  looked at its own work processes in order to streamline

work  flows,  in order to increase the cost effectiveness  of

the HDB upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB survey results show that the residents are

generally  most appreciative of improvement items  that  give

them  direct benefits.  I think this is not surprising.   But

what  kind of items?  This is what the surveys sought to find

out.   Based on this feedback, HDB has revised the  scope  of

the  upgrading  works to concentrate more on  the  functional

items.  The focus will shift from precinct and block works to

works  within  the flat.  Less functional and cost  effective

items  like amphitheatres and extensive landscaping  will  be

scaled  down, as they add to maintenance cost.  But  I  would

like  to  assure the House that HDB will continue to  provide

precinct and block works that yield tangible benefits to  the

residents, and I am talking about popular items like  covered

linkways, lift upgrading, etc.  And we will also ensure  that

the  upgrading  programme is obvious to  the  residents.   In

other words, that MUP blocks will be distinctive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the full range of internal works that are

currently  carried  out  within the  flats  today,  HDB  will

replace  the main entrance door and all windows in  the  flat

during  MUP.   This  is  in response to  many  requests  from

Members in the House on behalf of their residents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin, Mr Lew Syn Pau,

commented just now in this regard that Government should  not

be  too  involved inside the flat.  This seems to fly in  the

face  of his advice.  But let me say that I do agree that  we

should  just carry out only essential works within the  flat.

We  are  not  going  in to renovate the whole  flat  for  the

lessee.  Items such as space adding items, the replacement of

the  discharge stack in the bathrooms, these are massive  and

costly exercises.  No resident can do it on his own.  It  has

to  be done by HDB, and this is what the HDB will continue to

do.   But  other items that he can do himself, these we  will

leave to the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more cost effective upgrading package, the budget

for MUP and IUP will be rationalised.  The revised budget per

flat for MUP will be $37,600 and $58,300 for the standard and

standard-plus packages respectively, down from  the  original

$42,400 and $67,200 for standard and standard-plus.  For IUP,

the  two-tier  budget will be brought down from the  existing

$5,000 without full lift upgrading, and $8,000 with full lift

upgrading   per   flat,  to  $4,000  and  $7,000   per   flat

respectively.   With  these  revisions,  residents  can  look

forward  to  a  smaller  MUP  upgrading  bill,  better  value

improvement works that will benefit them more.  The IUP  will

continue  to  be  fully  funded by the Government  and  later

today,  HDB  will be issuing a press statement to  give  full

details of the revised programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan asked about the pace of the HDB upgrading

programme.   He  asked Government to speed up  the  upgrading

programme.   Sir,  with the revised MUP and IUP  budgets  and

with the recovery of the economy, I am pleased to inform  the

House that the Government will step up the upgrading schedule

this year.  We intend to announce 12 MUP precincts and 20 IUP

precincts for this year 2000, compared with 5 MUP and 18  IUP

precincts  last  year.  This means that the number  of  flats

which  will enjoy the benefits of upgrading will go up,  from

less  than  20,000  last year to something like  26,000  this

year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the actual precincts to be selected, I think this

is  always  a contentious point, and Mr Low Thia  Khiang  has

made  some comments on this.  Earlier, we also heard  Mr  Goh

Chee  Wee making exactly the same comment, that if we do  not

speed it up, his constituents will miss out.  I think we have

in  this  House  and outside clarified many  times  that  the

upgrading programme is a long term programme.  If you add  up

the  total number of flats, it is something close to  400,000

flats  that  are  eligible for upgrading even under  existing

criteria.   Reasonably speaking, you can  do  something  like

20,000,  maybe 26,000 this year if we speed it up.   At  that

rate, we are looking at a 15-20 year programme.  There is  no

way  that we can do all constituencies at one go, whether  it

is  Boon  Lay or Hougang.  Some must go first, and some  must

wait.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Boon Lay complains that some of the

old  flats in his constituency have not yet been selected for

MUP,  I  feel  very  sympathetic.  But he also  has  to  wait

because we have got many criteria to consider.  If we were to

just  go  on age alone (and I know Boon Lay has got many  old

flats),  there are many old flats in Queenstown,  Toa  Payoh,

Ang  Mo  Kio, Redhill, Hougang (not that old, but  reasonably

old), as the previous Minister has explained many times,  all

the  upgrading  is  going to be done in  Queenstown,  Tanjong

Pagar  and Redhill, and none would be done in Marine  Parade,

the Prime Minister's constituency, Bedok and Ang Mo Kio.   So

it  is  not just age alone.  Age is only one of the criteria.

We  have to ensure a good spread of the precincts across  the

various housing estates.  That is another criterion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not all, because we also have several other

criteria,  including the level of support and the cleanliness

of  the  estate  which is a proxy for the community   spirit.

Because  there are so many eligible precincts, and there  are

such strong demands for upgrading because of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>

benefits, it is difficult for the Ministry to just base it on

one  or  two criteria.  There are several criteria that  have

been spelt out.  Some are subjective, some are objective like

the age, some we will have to make a judgment, like the level

of support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have "level of support"? Mr Low Thia Khiang

mentioned that the Government is not fair because it does not

upgrade  flats in Hougang.  Let me put it this way.   If  you

have two MPs who are asking for upgrading, one MP goes around

explaining  to his constituents what is upgrading,  what  are

the  benefits of upgrading, how is it that the Government  is

able  to spend $500 million or more a year on upgrading.   It

is  because of the policies which generate surplus.   Without

the  policies that generate surplus, and without  a  surplus,

what  is  the point of talking about upgrading?  One MP  goes

around and explains to the people, yes, these policies  which

will  not be popular sometimes, these are policies which,  at

the  end  of  the  day,  help  the  Government  in  terms  of

generating a surplus, these are policies which reflect a very

prudent  financial  policy.  As a  result  of  these  prudent

financial  policies,  you  have  a  surplus.   He  tells  his

constituents to vote for this party because this is the party

that is able to generate surpluses and this is the party that

distributes  the  surpluses in the form of  upgrading,  among

other  things, and vote for him as an MP so that he can fight

for  upgrading, so that he can get upgrading earlier for  his

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have another candidate who goes around telling

his  constituents that the Government's policies  are  wrong,

that  Government  makes  money from   the  people,  that  the

Government  is  rich,  the people are poor.   The  Government

should  redistribute wealth through subsidies, that upgrading

is  a  joke.   If you were the Minister in charge of deciding

which constituency were to be upgraded first, which one would

you   choose?   The  one  who  supports  the  programme   and

encourages his residents to support the programme, or the one

who does not make any effort to support the programme and, on

top of that, runs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>

down  the  Government's policies which created  the  surplus,

which  allows  these  programmes to be implemented.   As  the

Americans  would call it, it is a "no brainer".  So  this  is

something  that we have always had to explain very carefully.

It  is  not  a  question of fairness.  It is  a  question  of

prioritisation.  It is a question of whether you support, not

just  upgrading, but the whole range of policies which allows

us to implement the upgrading programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A last point for Mr Low Thia Khiang's information, his

flats are not the oldest flats in Singapore.  There are  many

other  constituencies which have got flats  even  older  than

his,  who  are also in the queue  and who are also trying  to

jump  the  queue.  Potong Pasir is one, Toa Payoh is another,

Redhill, Tiong Bahru, Queenstown.  I have asked for the  list

because  I  wanted to be absolutely sure that HDB is  totally

fair and objective about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a few questions on lift upgrading. Mr

Seng  Han  Thong  has  asked  several  questions  about  lift

upgrading,  so has Mr Ang Mong Seng. There is no  doubt  that

lift upgrading is one of the most popular items under MUP and

IUP.  And with an ageing population, as Mr Ang Mong Seng very

graphically put it just now, lift upgrading is something that

we  should  seriously consider in order to meet the  mobility

needs of residents.  But let me try and convince Members that

lift upgrading is a very expensive proposition.  It does  not

come  cheap.   This  is the reason why in order  to  try  and

prioritise  the  flats which qualify for lift upgrading,  HDB

has  in  place a set of criteria, like how many people  would

benefit if we put in the lift, benefit per flat, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng requested that Government extends lift

upgrading  to all blocks under HDB.  Let me inform the  House

that HDB already allows full lift upgrading under IUP if  the

precincts  meet  the lift upgrading criteria  and  if  it  is

within  the IUP budget.  In fact, we have provided additional

funds for IUP, if the Member would like to upgrade his lifts.

The lift upgrading programme is a very massive programme.  It

involves major structural

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>

works  because  you  have to put in  new  lift  shafts,  link

bridges  and  so  on.  Generally speaking, I would  recommend

that  we  do lift upgrading only under MUP rather  than  IUP.

But those who want to do it under IUP, there is provision  to

do  so,  but  bear in mind that you would have  to  sacrifice

something else, and you must also meet the criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned, the blocks that do not

meet  the lift criteria are generally the so-called segmented

blocks.  I think he knows the blocks in question.  Basically,

these  are blocks which really require additional lift shafts

and new lifts to be added.  Where it is technically feasible,

HDB  is  prepared to be flexible and allows  such  blocks  to

undergo  full  lift upgrading under MUP.   But  the  cost  of

installation  will  mean a significantly increased  upgrading

bill for the residents.  Notwithstanding that it is co-shared

between  Government and the residents, with  this  particular

feature,  it is going to be much higher.  We  would  have  to

require from the residents a very firm indication.  In  other

words,  we  will have to go through a voting process  to  get

from the residents an indication whether they want to proceed

with  this  upgrading or not.  HDB is now  looking  into  the

details,  including  the  co-sharing  formula,  criteria  for

upgrading and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few other miscellaneous issues which I may quickly

round  off.  Executive Condominium housing,  Mr Lew  and  Mrs

Lim  asked about the relevance of the EC scheme.  All  of  us

would agree that EC housing has achieved its social objective

which  was,  at that time, to provide a category  of  private

housing  that  meets  the  need of the  so-called  sandwiched

class,  the young professional couples.  If you look  at  the

statistics  of the people who buy the EC, the majority,  more

than  three-quarters of them, are actually first-timers,  and

most  of these people are young couples, between the ages  of

25  and  35.   The EC scheme has worked and it  has  met  the

objective.   It has provided an alternative housing  type  to

these young families.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the mutual exchange of flats

scheme.   There is such a scheme but I am afraid that  it  is

not  exactly  very popular because of the constraints.   Only

about 20 flats are exchanged every year.  Having said that, I

must  also  point  out that there are many other  schemes  in

place  that  facilitate extended families living together  or

living  close  to  one another. There is the Joint  Selection

Scheme,  the Multi-tier Family Scheme, the Conversion Scheme,

and  of  course,  let  us not forget the  CPF  Housing  Grant

Scheme,  which  is  the grant of $40,000 to encourage  first-timers to buy resale flats near their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Jennifer Lee asked about whether we should

require industrial and commercial developers to provide child

care  facilities or elderly care facilities.   First of  all,

let me just point out that the development control guidelines

do not restrict the provision of such facilities.  Yes, there

is a cap on it, but they are able to provide such facilities.

But whether we should require them to provide the facilities,

that is another matter altogether.  I am reluctant to move to

that  stage  of being so prescriptive, but if the Member  has

got  a very strong case, I am prepared to listen in terms  of

how to convince the developers to provide such facilities.  I

would have thought that if it does help the developer to make

that  development  more attractive, they would  provide  such

facilities on their own volition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On flexibility in doing business, Mr Peh Chin Hua

suggested  that  we  should allow HDB flats  to  be  used  as

offices.   I  do  not  know whether  he  is  aware  that  the

Technopreneur  Home  Office Scheme has  already  kicked  off.

This  actually allows people to use their HDB flats as office

addresses  subject, of course, to certain conditions.   I  am

very  happy  to  tell him that HDB has to date  approved  150

applications from applicants to use their flats as registered

offices.  I do not see any problem at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the 30% retention policy. He is

correct in saying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>

that   this  was  introduced  in  1979  to  encourage  better

maintenance  and he feels that this ruling may no  longer  be

necessary.  I agree with him and I want to tell him that  URA

is  currently reviewing this retention policy, together  with

the BCA, with a view to removing it.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I see time is running short, I would just like

to  respond very quickly to Members' comments on Construction

21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen and Dr Teo Ho Pin commented on the

Construction  21  report.  Mr Kenneth  Chen,  in  particular,

expressed,  I  thought, some reservations about  whether  the

report can achieve its objectives.  Let me just tell him that

these  are targets.  The report was not prepared just by  the

officials alone.  They were prepared in conjunction with  the

professionals   in   the  industry.   There   was   extensive

consultation  among  different  Ministries  -   Ministry   of

Manpower,  my  Ministry, BCA, Professional  Engineers  Board,

Board of Architects, SCAL, REDAS, and so on and so forth.  So

I  think  all the possible stakeholders have been  consulted.

They have been involved in the deliberations.  The C21 report

took  a  while to cook and to finalise.  I think the  process

itself makes me optimistic, and so is the industry optimistic

that the targets are achievable.  So I would say, let us give

it a try, and let us work hard to make it work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as whether we should register contractors - I

think this was the other point he raised, that is, whether we

should   license  the  contractors,  this  is  one   of   the

recommendations in the report by the architects,  I  believe,

and  the developers.  Obviously the contractors were not  too

keen on this one.  But I think BCA is currently studying  the

feasibility and the effectiveness of this recommendation.  So

we would await their comments on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, I have covered most if not all of the

points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, may I have a point of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clarification?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Thank you, Sir. The Minister said

that  if  you consider family size, then how are we going  to

determine for one-child, two-child, three-child families.   I

think  we  have already in the pricing, looked  at  location,

floor level, and at the type and size of a flat.  So I do not

see why in terms of subsidy, we cannot have different scales,

ie, 1, 2, 3.  Suppose if this is not possible, then the other

simpler approach is to look at the 40% magic formula and  try

and  reduce  it to, say, 30% in light of some  of  these.   I

think  that will be a more simpler formula to look at.   That

is point one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point two is on land sales which I talked about. I did

not quite get an answer, maybe because my points did not come

out  across  clearly.   My  point is  that  we  need  a  more

transparent  and a more medium term planning so  that  prices

will  not  have  to fluctuate or go through a  roller-coaster

ride within a year.  It picks up before the announcement  and

then  comes  down after the announcement, or vice  versa.   I

think we need a more long-term and a more gradual increase in

prices,  and not 33% in one year and so on.  So we need  that

policy to be looked at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is HDB 2. I think some years ago

we  said  that MRT would be the monopoly, but today  we  have

competitors.  I hope at some point of time we will  have  HDB

2.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister says that he has

a comprehensive list of old flats, waiting to be upgraded, to

prove  that Hougang flats are not the oldest.  Would he  make

available  the  whole list to me or to make it  public?   And

would he estimate what is the time frame that my estate would

be upgraded?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second clarification, Sir. The Minister mentioned about

the criteria for the upgrading.  I want to ask him this.   By

tying  the  upgrading programme to political  support  level,

does  it  make any difference at all to pork barrel  politics

where  you use Government funds to dispense benefits to  your

supporters?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> First of all, let me answer Mr

Sinnakaruppan.   He was first in the queue; higher  priority.

I have to give face to my parliamentary colleague.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan is quite adamant that the family size

should be a factor in the setting of prices.  My point really

is  that  it is not HDB's ambit.  It is not HDB's mission  to

actually  vary  prices  according to family  size.   We  vary

prices  according  to location.  I think  that  is  eminently

suitable.  We vary prices according to floor, which floor  it

is  (low  floor or high floor).  I think that is also  easily

understood,  and no arguments.  Either you are  on  the  25th

floor  or you are on the 2nd floor.  We vary prices according

to  closeness  to MRT.  Again, no questions asked.   But  the

moment  you ask HDB to start to vary prices according to  how

many  children  you  have, HDB is going  to  have  a  lot  of

problems,  and I do not think this is something  we  want  to

commit  HDB  to doing.  So let us agree to disagree  on  this

one.  I do not think it is a good idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about release of land. The question of

release  of land is really a question of what do we  want  to

achieve.   His point is that we should be achieving stability

in price.  I think that is a very tall order for any Ministry

or  any  authority or any government to achieve.  To  achieve

stability in price, I think, requires you to monitor  and  to

find  out or to second guess what the market is going  to  be

like.   If you want to achieve that, you have got to  release

land  in  a  way that will help to soak up the demand.   Even

then, you may not be able to succeed.  So what do we do?   We

say, let us gauge what is the medium term demand.  These  are

the  numbers  of  new households that are being  formed,  the

number of young families that are coming into the market, the

people  who  are coming in from overseas, whether  employment

pass  holders, professionals or PRs, or whatever - let us  do

an  estimate on what is the medium term demand, what  is  the

trend.   In  the  Concept Plan review, you are talking  about

population  target of 5.5 million, what does that  entail  in

terms of number of units that are required.  And then we work

towards  that.  We release land such that the private  sector

and also the public sector, HDB,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>

can  provide the required number of units.  And I think  that

is what we will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term fluctuations from year to year depending on

the  stock market, depending on the external demand  -  these

are all short-term fluctuations which I think we are not in a

position to try and anticipate or second guess.  So,  as  far

as  possible, the policy is, let us release a steady flow  of

land  for a long term or medium term supply, and prices  will

fluctuate according to how the demand comes in.  But in  that

way, by making that clear and making that transparent, people

are  not  tempted to go and rush in if they do not  need  to.

People  are  not  tempted to try and chase prices  like  what

happened  during  the peak of the property boom.   They  know

that  the  supply  is  available;  it  is  coming  on-stream;

Government  land sales programme is this amount  every  year.

If  you  are  interested  in public  housing,  we  also  have

sufficient  public housing available for you.  You  join  the

queue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is a very clear cut, a very transparent and

a  very  fair policy which will help to ensure that there  is

stability in the supply and it will help to ensure  that  the

market in the long term is fairly well balanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made one last point about HDB 2. I think I have

given him an answer on that one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on Mr Low Thia Khiang's point - list of old flats

waiting to be upgraded.  He would like to have a list.  We do

not  give this list to anybody, even the PAP Members who ask.

I do not think we should give this list freely.  But you know

what  the flats are, you know the age of your flats  in  your

constituency.   And  I think, generally, people  do  know  in

those  areas that I mentioned just now - Redhill, Toa  Payoh,

Queenstown,  Tiong  Bahru.  I think if you  go  and  do  some

homework, you will be able to find out where these flats are.

It is not difficult.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the time frame, as I indicated earlier, this is a

very  long-term programme.  We are about half way through  or

maybe slightly more.  But I think it is very presumptuous  to

say  that  this is going to be the five-year time  frame  for

MUP.   For a start, how do we know that we are going to  have

surpluses  every  year  for  the next  five  years?  This  is

something that we should not forget - that we can only do  an

upgrading  if  we  have the surpluses.  Therefore,  I  cannot

provide any time frame for MUP programme.  We will take it on

a year-to-year basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tying upgrading to political support - what was your

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Pork barrel politics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> What is pork barrel politics?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Benefits based on political

support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> This is not distributing of benefits.

As  I  have explained earlier, everybody will have a  chance.

It is a question of who comes first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, we do not have much time. Make

your point quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Clarification from the Minister.

Does  he  distinguish  between party  politics  and  national

policies?  When a party is elected to be the government,  the

party acts nationally.  Am I correct?  It does not mean  that

if  I do not support you, you do not build the roads near  my

house.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I did not say that we do not apply

the policy.  I am just saying that there is a long list.  How

do  I decide?  How do I look my PAP MP in the face and say to

him  that,  "Oh,  I  have upgraded Hougang or  Potong  Pasir,

instead  of Boon Lay?"  I think Mr Goh Chee Wee is not  going

to forgive me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You can go by objective criteria and

not by MPs or what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>

party  they  belong  to.  I think when it comes  to  national

policies,  you have to judge them objectively,  how  are  you

going to carry them out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, we have listed out all our

criteria.  It is very clear, very transparent, and it  cannot

be more transparent than that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Chin is not here. Mrs Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, frequently after an Interim or

Main Upgrading Programme, estates are renamed by residents to

give  better sounding names or ones that reflect the  history

or  location.  For example, Serangoon North Avenue 1  becomes

Hwi Yoh Court.  If I recall correctly, Serangoon North was so

named  as  it  was an estate lying to the north of  Serangoon

Central.  Never mind the fact that many people still refer to

the place as the Jalan Hwi Yoh area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we used to name a whole estate to reflect the

history  or location.  For example, we adopted the series  of

Marine Terrace, Marine Drive, Marine Parade Central, etc, for

the  reclaimed  land  in the East Coast back  in  the  1970s.

Somehow  along  the way, it appears we got less  imaginative.

We  started naming streets, roads and avenues by numbers  and

sometimes  letters.  So we have typically an A, B,  C  avenue

series,  following  by  an A, B, C street  series.   We  even

classify  them  as Neighbourhoods 1, N1, N2, and  so  on,  as

depicted  by  a  web on a large signboard, as one  approaches

newer  estates, if one drives slow enough to take in all  the

details.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely we are not so devoid of imagination nor history

as to fall back on a somewhat scientific method of naming our

estates which get promptly renamed after upgrading.   We  are

not  like  typical US streets which run on a grid system  and

for  which  both  private  and public  housing  estates  have

evolved  over  time.   I  would therefore  like  to  ask  the

Minister to consider naming new estates which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>

more  reflective  of  the  history  or  significance  of  the

locality right from conception.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the two

main  problems  faced by HDB dwellers are  spalling  concrete

from  the ceiling and the leaking floor from the toilets  and

kitchen.  The issue of spalling concrete has been extensively

discussed  in  the newspapers and I shall not dwell  upon  it

here.   The  leaking  from  the  floor  concerns  the  family

upstairs  and  the family downstairs.  If it is not  properly

dealt with, it will certainly affect the relationship between

the two families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's common practice is to ask the two families, the

one  upstairs  and  the one downstairs,  to  co-pay  for  the

repair.   The  family downstairs felt that it is very  unfair

because they have to endure the inconvenience of having water

leaking  through  their ceiling and falling on  their  heads.

Yet,  they  are asked to pay part of the repair cost  despite

the  fact that this is in no way due to any fault of  theirs.

If  the people upstairs have changed the floor tiles and,  in

the  process, damaged the water-proof layer, then  of  course

they  are  liable to pay for it.  But if they have  not  done

anything  to  the  flooring, yet water is  leaking  from  the

floor, then who is responsible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's explanation is that the floor is a party-structure

belonging   to  both  the  people  upstairs  and  the  people

downstairs  and,  of  course, they have  to  co-pay  for  the

repair.  But this explanation is just overly simplistic.  The

question  is  whether this water-proof layer belongs  to  the

people upstairs, or the people upstairs and downstairs  share

the water-proof layer.  Of course, the people living upstairs

have  to  wash the floor in the bathroom and water will  leak

downstairs  if  the  floor is not waterproof.   In  order  to

prevent leaking, normally waterproof chemicals are used.   So

apparently,  this  water-proof layer  should  belong  to  the

people  upstairs. If there is a problem the  people  upstairs

should  pay for the repair.  Now, with this leak, the  people

downstairs are already inconvenienced and yet you  want  them

to pay for the repair.  It does seem to be very unfair.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an analogy - the forest fire in

Indonesia.   This  issue  which we  discussed  in  Parliament

earlier  today and the haze resulting from this  forest  fire

has  caused some problems to us.  Just imagine, if  Indonesia

says  that since we share this air space and in order to  get

rid  of  this haze, you will have to share the cost with  us.

This   explanation   is   apparently  farfetched   and   very

unconvincing.   Of  course, if the family upstairs  has  just

moved  in  not too long ago and there is a leakage  from  the

ceiling,  then  the  problem must lie with the  construction.

The contractor should be responsible and residents should not

be  asked to pay for it.  Of course, the leak from the  floor

is  not  a very major problem.  But with these flats  getting

older,  the problem would get more and more common.   I  hope

that  the  HDB can give them a very clear explanation  as  to

which  part  of the repair should be borne by the  residents,

otherwise,  there  will  be  a  lot  of  quarrels  among  the

residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, ongoing is a

spate  of en bloc sales which will bring with it a whole  new

set  of potential problems.  Kim Seng, being Districts 9  and

10,  has  its fair share of en bloc sales and some  residents

there have voiced their concerns and their "headaches" on the

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most frequent complaint is about the noise and dust

from  the redevelopment projects.  Other inconveniences, such

as obstructions, traffic snarls and increased numbers of non-residents  all  add  up to the stressful environment.   Worse

still, are situations where several projects are going on  in

the  same  area  simultaneously.  Since these areas  are  all

densely  populated,  the number of people  inconvenienced  is

considerable.   The  ill effects on these people  can  become

intolerable.   Sir,  what  can  the  Ministry   of   National

Development do to lessen the pain of these residents in their

predicament?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is usually an increased plot ratio granted in most

of these en bloc sales.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>

Many  new redevelopments can therefore have buildings as high

as  30  storeys or more.  I know the Government  is  allowing

this plot ratio change to optimise the land use in Singapore.

The  Minister  for National Development has, earlier  in  his

reply,  touched  on this subject with some assurance  on  the

plot  ratio  change.  My concern however is whether  we  have

indeed  allowed this increased plot ratio even  though  there

are  physical constraints.  For example, is it right to grant

a  plot  ratio  change when the site area is  small  and  the

access roads are tight and heavy with traffic?  Will we  have

a  situation where residents have to queue just to get out of

their own gates?  Sir, there is even an instance of three  en

bloc  redevelopments  with buildings to  go  as  high  as  30

storeys approved on sites with buildings of 10 storeys  on  a

short narrow road with definite constraints to road widening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Planning Act, it is a requirement for the

Development  Guide  Plan  to be exhibited  so  as  to  obtain

feedback from the residents and the general public.  Sir,  as

the  notice is usually placed in an advertisement, it is  not

satisfactory  because many people may not have read  or  paid

attention  to such notices.  We may perhaps improve  in  this

area  by  sending letters to the residents and allow them  an

opportunity to raise objections, when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister for National

Development to look into the abovementioned issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore is a

small nation.  We are only a little red dot on the map.  Just

now,  the  Minister  has  said that  our  population  is  3.5

million.  Yesterday, Senior Parliamentary Secretary  Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon encouraged our people to give birth  to  more

children so that our population may go up.  Bearing  in  mind

we  have very limited land for building houses and flats  for

our  people to live in, we must have some long term plans  on

our   land  use.   Consequent  to  this  consideration,   HDB

introduced  the  Selective   En  Bloc  Redevelopment   Scheme

(SERS).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme will benefit our HDB

residents.   They will have their new flats to replace  their

old  ones.   Most of these flats selected for SERS  are  more

than 25 years old.  But when the residents  move to their new

flats, they are given new 99-year leases.  The new flats will

not   have  such  problems  as  leaking  floors  or  spalling

concrete, as described by Dr Ker just now.   On top of  that,

the  residents will enjoy modern and better facilities,  such

as  lifts stopping at every floor for the residents.  It will

also  enhance the cohesiveness among the residents.  So  SERS

is a win-win situation for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I have a few suggestions to make. When HDB

announced  the  plans for the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment

Scheme,  they should give ample time and information  to  the

residents so that they can have a better understanding of the

details of the whole programme, such as terms of compensation

and   the  selling  price  of  their  new  flats,  etc.   The

Government  should also help the lower income  families  with

more favourable packages. The residents  should be shown  the

layout  plans,  and even models,  of the new flats.   Because

the  new development is to give the residents the opportunity

to upgrade themselves to modern and better-designed flats, so

long  as  the  residents  are well-informed  of  the  various

details  of  the  exercise, they are  bound  to  support  it.

Hillview Estate is a very good example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HDB announced the plans, the residents were given

only  10 days to reply whether or not they would support  the

project.   Before they were informed of the  details  of  the

plans,  they  were very unhappy.  The support rate  was  only

86%.   However, after the dialogue session conducted  by  the

grassroots   organisations  and   the   exhibition   of   the

development plan, the residents saw for themselves  what  was

in  store for them, they were very happy.  Accordingly,   the

support  rate  was raised from 86% to 95%.  I would  like  to

take  this  opportunity  to thank  Minister  Lim  Hng  Kiang,

Minister  Mah Bow Tan and Senior Parliamentary Secretary  Koo

Tsai Kee and all the staff

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>

of  HDB for the support and cooperation they have given to us

in  explaining  these plans to the residents, so  that  these

plans could be successfully implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since one of the objectives of this SERS programme is to

maintain the social bond among the residents in the  area,  I

would like to ask the Minister whether priority will be given

to  the children of the existing residents to purchase  flats

in  the  new  development so that they can  live  near  their

parents.   This is also in line with our Government's  policy

to encourage children to look after their parents.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.23 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to

add  my  weight  to Mr Ang Mong Seng's speech supporting  the

SERS   programme.    Judging  from  the   asset   enhancement

perspective,  I believe SERS is a better upgrading  programme

for  both the HDB and residents.  For those sites located  in

the  urban  areas, they unlock the land value through  better

plot  ratio.   For those in the outlying areas, such  as  the

Hillview Avenue project, mentioned by my friend, Mr Ang  Mong

Seng,  it  affords  a complete re-design  of  the  precincts.

Furthermore,  for estates built more than 20 years  ago,  the

population  is  rapidly ageing as younger and outward  mobile

families upgrade to newer estates.  As a result, in  many  of

these  estates,  surface car parks are  by  and  large  empty

because  the household profiles are very different  from  the

time when those flats were built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bukit Timah GRC, the precinct in Clementi Town

exemplifies  this  trend.   Sir,  by  bringing  back  younger

residents  it  will inject the redeveloped area with  renewed

vitalities.  Consequently, if we also provide the children of

those already living in the district a higher priority,  like

Mr  Ang has pointed out, we could make use of the opportunity

to  keep  multi-generation families closer  together  in  the

community.   This  goes a long way towards  promoting  multi-generation family concept in Singapore.  Now that the  budget

is healthy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>

once again, the Minister is likely to get the necessary funds

from the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to consider exploring

wider implementation of SERS to bring about faster renewal of

older estates in Singapore.  If he is looking for a candidate

site,  there are actually two in Clementi that will be  quite

suitable,   failing which, of course, maybe he would  include

that two precincts into the MUP programme he has announced in

Parliament just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I too find that the priority allocations of various

upgrading  projects  hard  to decipher.   Like  Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang,  the residents in the two precincts which I mentioned

have also waited all these years without seeing any upgrading

opportunity.    But  unlike  Mr  Low's  constituents,   these

residents living in the Bukit Timah precinct which was  still

a  single  Member  constituency in the general  election  had

voted  overwhelmingly for the PAP with a majority  vote  that

was within the top 10 in the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is not too smart for Mr Low to belabour

this  point in Parliament. Maybe I should mention Mr Ang Mong

Seng  as  an example. Many older PAP MPs envy Mr Ang  in  his

ability  to  bring  about  many  upgrading  projects  to  his

constituency.   As  I  look  at  Mr  Ang's  circumstances,  I

identified two relevant parameters. Firstly, Mr Ang Mong Seng

is  a  first  term  Member of Parliament.  Secondly,  he  was

returned  from  a ward that was formerly an Opposition  ward.

Judging  from the priority Mr Ang has managed to  obtain  for

his  residents  and given this fact, there is  a  possibility

that Mr Low Thia Khiang's constituents might wake up one  day

to the fact that the best thing they can do for themselves is

to vote for a PAP candidate in the next general elections.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, I would first like to take the cut by

Mrs  Lim  Hwee Hua.  Mrs Lim has proposed that we  should  be

more imaginative in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>

naming HDB estates, streets, precincts, neighbourhoods and so

on.   In  the earlier HDB towns, the road names were  derived

from  a  combination of town names and numbers based more  or

less  on  a  grid  system.   This  was  very  systematic  and

sequential  in  nature to facilitate an easy orientation  and

identification of roads. Based on feedback received, HDB  has

introduced  an  alternative approach to road  naming  and  to

enhance  the  identity of these towns and better reflect  the

historical   significance.  For  example,  Sengkang   has   a

historical  past  as a fishing village. Hence,  it  has  road

names  such  as Compassvale Street and Rivervale  Drive.  The

same  goes for Punggol 21, where road names like Punggol Dale

and  Punggol  Field  are based on the original  topographical

features   of   vast  tracts  of  farmland  and   vegetation.

Likewise,  different neigbourhoods in new  HDB  estates,  for

example Sengkang, will also be given names such as Rivervale,

Compassvale,  Anchorvale and Fernvale. HDB will  continue  to

name  roads  and  neighbourhoods  in  new  towns  using  this

alternative approach. I am pleased to inform Mrs Lim that  we

have made progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker asked who should pay for the repair of ceiling

leaks. To answer that question, it is very important to first

establish the principle.  The present rule uses the principle

of  establishing  the  ownership of the  party  structure  to

determine who should pay.  According to the Land Titles  Act,

the  party structure is owned jointly by the parties  sharing

the  use of it. So whether it is in public housing or private

housing, the practice is to require the households owning the

same structure to pay for the repair.  It is fair because  if

we  were  to  ask  the upper floor to pay,  the  upper  floor

household  would ask the same question, "Why should  I  pay?"

We  will  have problems in convincing them that  they  should

pay.   That is why we have all these disputes. But if we were

to  tell  them  that it is a party structure and  since  both

parties jointly own the structure and through wear and  tear,

there  are leaks, then there should be no argument that  both

parties  should share the cost of repairing the  leaks.  This

has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>

been  practised, both in the public and private housing.   It

is  fair if we continue with the practice, rather than,  say,

imposing on the upper floor to pay.  He would say, "I am just

using it normally and why should I pay for something which is

owned  by  both parties?".  In addition, we have to  bear  in

mind  that  the  lower floor unit will also  have  his  party

structure  below.  The law is thus very fair  and  we  should

keep it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Dr Lily Neo's point about the noise and

dust  created from redevelopment projects. Dr Neo asked  what

could  be  done to lessen the pain of residents  affected  by

noise, dust and traffic congestion of redevelopment projects.

When   developers  and  contractors  carry  out   development

projects,  they  have to comply with the  legal  requirements

under  the  Environmental (Pollution  Control)  Act  and  the

Environmental  (Pollution Control of  Noise  at  Construction

Sites) Regulations. These regulations have been drawn  up  to

protect  the  residents  from being affected  by  intolerable

levels of environmental pollution. Members of the public  can

alert  the  relevant  authorities  if  they  feel  that   the

developers have created an excessive level of noise, dust and

construction  traffic.  The relevant authorities  would  take

actions  against  the developers concerned if  investigations

show that the regulations have been violated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that Dr Neo raised is whether we

have  allowed development intensification, even though  there

are   physical  constraints.   In  the  preparation  of   the

Development  Guide  Plans  (DGPs),  the  Urban  Redevelopment

Authority  (URA) will study with various authorities  on  the

need  to  increase the provision of infrastructure, utilities

and  services  for  the  planning  areas  to  support  future

developments. For example, the Land Transport Authority would

study  a need to widen existing roads or to build new  roads.

At  the  detailed  planning stage,  LTA  will  determine  the

appropriate vehicular entries and exits of the development to

minimise the conflicts in traffic flow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Dr Neo asked whether letters could be sent to

residents to inform them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>

of  the DGP exhibitions. The DGPs were extensively publicised

at  the  exhibition  stage. Besides  using  advertisement  to

notify   the  public,  press  releases  were  issued.   These

exhibitions were held in convenient venues, such as community

centres, community clubs and shopping centres, etc, and  were

well  covered  by the print and the broadcast media.  Sending

letters  to  every resident is time-consuming and costly  and

since  there are already many avenues to publicise the  DGPs,

there is no need to send letters to every resident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Mr Ang Mong Seng's point. I am pleased to

inform  the  Member  that  HDB has  already  implemented  his

suggestion  for  SERS  sites  announced  from  October   1999

onwards. Since then, the model, the preliminary design layout

and  unit  floor  plans  of  the new  replacement  flats  are

displayed at the SERS exhibition, which is held over  a  one-week period immediately after the announcement.  HDB officers

are also available to answer questions from residents and HDB

would  also  conduct  a survey among the  affected  residents

after   the   SERS  announcement  and,  possibly  after   the

exhibition.   It would take into account residents'  feedback

before finalising the design layout and the actual flat  type

proportion of the replacement flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang also asked whether we could extend this SERS

privilege  to the children of residents who are  affected  by

SERS.   I  would like to inform him that we have a number  of

programmes  to  promote  extended families  and  parents  and

children to live near to each other, like the Joint Selection

Scheme,  Multi-Tier  Family  Scheme  and  so  on.   For  SERS

programme, it is substantial, in terms of benefits  given  to

the  affected residents. I would ask HDB to consider  whether

to  adopt  both  Dr Wang Kai Yuen's and Mr  Ang  Mong  Seng's

suggestion.  We have to balance it with the need to  be  also

fair  to other Singaporeans. Certainly, it is something worth

looking into and we will let them know in due course.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for supporting

the  SERS programme.  I agree with him that SERS is effective

in  rejuvenating the older HDB estates. When SERS  was  first

announced  in  1995, the original intention was  to  announce

about  six  sites  per  year.  In view  of  the  overwhelming

support  from the residents, we have, since 1997, accelerated

the  SERS programme. Altogether, we have announced 37  sites,

involving  14,700  units  of  sold  flats  under  SERS.   The

Government  will  continue to announce  more  SERS  sites.  A

critical  factor in the selection of sites for  SERS  is  the

financial  viability  of the proposed redevelopment.   As  Dr

Wang  mentioned, it must be a win-win proposal. If the  block

is  already well-developed, in terms of plot ratio  and  flat

size,  it may not be financially viable. The actual  pace  of

announcement would hence depend on the number of viable sites

identified and the availability of suitable replacement sites

to re-house the affected SERS residents.  As you know, one of

the  objectives  of  the  SERS  programme  is  to  allow  the

residents  to  live  in  the  same  area.   We  must  find  a

replacement site not too far away from the same area.  If  we

were  to  ask them to move very far away, then this objective

of  retaining the community bond will not be met.  These  are

all  the limitations.  Having said that, I know there  is  so

far  no SERS site announced in the Member's constituency  and

obviously,  he is lobbying very hard for it. In view  of  the

strong support from the residents in his constituency, I will

ask HDB to give me good reasons to support his request.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have decided to end the

discussion on the $100 amendments at 6.25 pm and move  on  to

discuss the $10 amendments thereafter.  Dr Ker.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, can I respond to the Minister of

State's answer just now before I go on to my cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> While I agree with the Minister of

State  that  it  was  an easy way out to settle  the  leaking

problem, by asking the parties living upstairs and downstairs

to  share the cost of repair, what I am asking is whether the

principle  is correct or not.  Which party is at  fault?  Who

owns  the  waterproof layer? I think we have  a  tendency  of

finding an easy way out, and we overlook to go a step further

to  see  which  party should be responsible  to  rectify  the

problem.   Let  me  take  another  example.   In  a   traffic

accident,  the  drivers of both cars involved  in  a  traffic

accident are presumed to be in the wrong if the car in  front

is  hit by a car from behind. But it could be that the driver

in  the car behind was waiting but the car in front reversed,

for  whatever reason, and hit it. Then, we will take it  that

both  parties are in the wrong.  Maybe we should  go  a  step

further, rather than just say it is an easy way out.  Why  do

we not just stick to the easy way and settle it?

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member

that  if it is established that it is due to negligence, say,

from  renovation and so on and so forth, then there is a case

to  ask the owner of the upper floor unit to pay.  But if  it

is  due  to wear and tear in the course of using the flat,  I

think  it  is  only fair to ask both sides  to  pay,  because

naturally the owner of the upper floor unit will not want  to

use  it such that he will have to pay for the leaks.  No  one

would  want to inflict the repair cost upon himself.  In  the

course  of using the unit normally, and if there is  a  leak,

because the structure is designed in such a way that  it  can

only  withstand a certain number of years of usage, then when

it  leaks because of wear and tear, the parties that own  the

structure jointly should repair the structure.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister of State for

his reply.  Sir, may I now go on to my next cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the upgrading of

commercial areas in town

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>

centres   and   shopping  precincts  have   met   with   many

difficulties.  The reason is that when these shops were  sold

to  the shopowners, they were sold under the Land Titles Act.

Under the Land Titles Act, the shopowners purchased only  the

space  inside  the shops.  The space outside the  shops,  eg,

corridors and other amenities, belongs to the HDB, and it  is

repaired  by the Town Council on behalf of the HDB.   Out  of

the  monthly  maintenance charges levied on  the  shopowners,

only  a small portion is used for renovation and repair work.

Therefore, there is no surplus fund to use for upgrading  the

common  area  outside the shops.   If they want  to  upgrade,

then  they  have  to co-pay for the cost of upgrading  or  to

raise funds themselves.  This has posed many difficulties for

them.   Even  if  the  majority of the  shopowners  agree  to

upgrade,  there  is always a minority of  them  who  are  not

willing to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shops were purchased, they were not given

strata  title.  Therefore, the open space outside  the  shops

does  not  belong  to  the shopowners.  They  cannot  form  a

management corporation, and they cannot compel the shopowners

to pay for the upgrading charges.  Therefore, if they are not

willing  to pay and simply sit tight and wait for  others  to

pay,  they  stand to benefit from whatever improvements  that

are made, or the upgrading programme cannot be carried out at

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shops were sold, the intention was that more

energetic young people would run the businesses, so that  the

commercial centres will be rejuvenated.  However,  many  shop

precincts and town centres have become shabby and old.  There

is no life or vibrancy apart from some coffeeshops and hawker

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the shops in the town centres, HDB also built

many  shopping  complexes, eg, Hong  Lim  Green,  Bras  Basah

Complex  and Rochore Centre, etc.  All these shopping centres

have flats on the upper floors and shops on the lower floors.

They  are  far  inferior to the private shopping  centres  in

design.   The  common  complaint  is  that  the  lighting  is

inadequate, the corridors are narrow, and open

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>

space  is limited.  These shopping centres certainly  do  not

appeal  to  the  young customers.  However, these  shops  are

located  in important urban areas.  If we leave them to  fend

for themselves, it would degenerate into a pit, and will be a

waste  of  land resources.  If these commercial  centres  are

upgraded, although they are not comparable to the new private

shopping  centres,  at  least we can change  their  image  to

increase the trade volume, so that they can have a chance  to

survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops at the Bras Basah Centre were sold under the

Land Titles Act.  Therefore, the maintenance comes from their

monthly conservancy fees.  There is no fund to carry  out  an

upgrading programme.  The shopkeepers plan to put a roof over

the  air  well, so that they are sheltered from the elements,

and it can be used for promotional activities.  But they have

to  pay  more than $700,000 as development charges,  and  the

total  amounts to $1.1 million, including construction  cost.

The shopowners are unable to afford such a big sum of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as time changes, the shops in the HDB estates are

not  able to cope with the expectation and demand of the  new

generation customers.  Therefore, we should upgrade them  and

inject  them with life, so that these places are not  wasted.

But  to  expect  them  to  pay for the  amelioration  of  the

surrounding  areas,  it is not possible  and  not  realistic.

Therefore, the only way is for Government to provide  funding

for  these shops to upgrade their commercial areas.  I  would

like to urge the HDB to accede to this request.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I shall be very brief on this

amendment  on  the  upgrading of private estates  as  we  are

running out of time.  This subject has been answered to  some

extent recently when my colleague, Mr Heng Chiang Meng, filed

a Question in Parliament last week.  I would just like to add

the  following questions.  What is the budget set  aside  for

this  purpose?   And is it all held under the budget  of  the

Ministry  of  National  Development?   How  would  the  pilot

projects  be  selected?  What criteria will be  used  in  the

selection?   Would  the MPs, with a lot  of  private  housing

estates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>

in their constituencies, have some influence in the selection

process?   How would the Government prioritise the  selection

of items to upgrade?  I would like to suggest that the age of

the  housing estates be one key factor that should  be  taken

into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I join Mr Lew's

call to upgrade our private estates and I also have a similar

question.   But  the issue I have is how  do  we  handle  the

upgrading  of  the private estates.  In the HDB estates,  the

town councils have the natural responsibility to maintain and

upgrade  these  estates.  And it is going to be  a  difficult

problem  for the private estates because we do not have  this

natural organisation.  I would like to suggest that maybe  it

is  about time that we considered extending the role of  town

councils  to cover the management of the private  estates  in

addition  to  the HDB estates, at least, for the  common  and

public  areas.   After  all, in each constituency,  the  town

constitutes both the HDB and the private estates.  As far  as

the MP is concerned, he has to manage all of it.  Maybe it is

about  time that we extended the role of town councils to  at

least  handle  the  upgrading as well as maintenance  of  the

estates effectively.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary for announcing last  week  that  the

private  estates  will  be  upgraded,  and  I  join  my   two

colleagues here to make a similar appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the point that the GPC Chairman, Mr Lew Syn

Pau,  made.  What is the benchmark budget per household?   Is

it  the IUP $4,000?  It should be at least the IUP amount  of

$4,000  per  unit.  The problem is this.  There  will  be  no

economies  of  scale because if we take my Novena  Estate  in

Kreta  Ayer-Tanglin GRC, for example, we have about 100  over

units  in  that  particular estate.  If we go by  $4,000  per

unit,  we  get slightly over $40,000.  This is hardly  enough

for a playground, let alone many other things.  The point  is

to try and pool together the budgets of LTA,

ENV  and other agencies, maybe NParks and so on, to get  more

money,  maybe  at  least $1/2 million to $1  million  for  an

estate  size  of 100-200 units, so that there  is  sufficient

money  to do at least the very basic minimum that is required

for  upgrading of an estate.  Otherwise, it will  be  a  half

measure  and  it will be counter productive, and the  private

estate  residents are going to be unhappy and it will reflect

in our votes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make is that RCs have meeting

rooms  in  the HDB estates.  What about the NCs?  Of  course,

the  People's Association will have to look into  it  jointly

with MND, but this is something that we need to look at.   We

cannot look forward to the lofty club house idea.  It will be

expensive, I am aware, but at least try and look at  the  old

schools  that are not being used for the time being, renovate

them  and  let  the  NCs use them until such  time  that  the

buildings are knocked down or an ultimate use is found.  This

will   really  help.   Otherwise,  maybe  use  the  community

centres,   allocate  some  rooms,  but   there   is   already

competition for rooms in the community centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is this. I think Mr Inderjit Singh asked

who would be the coordinating agency for these projects.   It

could   be   the  town  council,  but  I  think   there   are

considerations  that  we have to take into  account,  because

town  councils already embark on a number of other areas.   I

am  not  sure  whether  the  Town Councils  Act  allows  this

extension  of duties.  So do we have to find an agency?   And

it  has  to  be  balanced with the needs of the town  council

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is what Mr Lew Syn Pau also made. Who

would be in the pilot scheme?  It is not for us to say but  I

would like my constituency to be first and so on.  And if  we

take  the  HDB  pilot scheme for MUP, let me be very  careful

here,  it was the choice areas that were selected for a pilot

scheme.   But  I hope that when we consider the pilot  scheme

for  the  private estates, it should first have  geographical

distribution  and age, as Mr Lew Syn Pau has  mentioned,  but

please   also  consider  the  total  percentage  of   private

households

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>

as against the total households in a constituency.  And if it

is  more than 50% or if there is a high figure, give them the

priority,  because  we  really  need  your  help   in   this,

especially those areas like Mr Lew Syn Pau has got almost 90%

of private estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> 95%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> 95%. Definitely, he needs

consideration, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the moment, we

have  about 14% of the population or about 500,000 living  in

private housing estates.  These include terrace houses, semi-detached houses and condominiums.  All these people living in

private  residential estates, in proportion, pay more  income

tax  and  property tax.  In terms of national  revenue,  they

make   a   great  contribution.   The  Minister  has  already

announced  that  they  will  be  included  in  the  upgrading

programme.   But the Minister also said that only  about  two

neighbourhoods will be selected for upgrading.  I think it is

too few.  There are many private housing estates.  If we take

only two a year, how many decades do we need to complete  the

upgrading programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, there are 5,000 units of private

residence in 20 neighbourhoods.  If we take two a year,  then

it  will  take  10  years.  I would like to suggest  that  in

selecting private estates for upgrading, the criteria  should

be  for  those  which are more than 10 years  old.   We  must

encourage   the  residents  themselves  to  establish   their

neighbourhood  committees to help in the  implementation  and

consultation of upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that MND should also have a budget on

how  much  every  unit would have to pay for  the  upgrading.

Then  it  will  be  easier for our grassroots  organisations,

residents  committees and neighbourhood  committees  to  have

more effective planning.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I will just ask four questions under

this cut.  (1)  What is the basis of funding for upgrading of

private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>

estates?  (2)  Will the upgrading be administered through the

CCC?   (3)   Who  will  maintain  the  additional  facilities

provided  through  this upgrading programme?   (4)   Can  the

Ministry consider setting up a private estates upgrading unit

to coordinate the upgrading programme?

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, we discussed a number of ways to

improve the areas in private estates last year.  I would like

now  to identify another possibility for upgrading in private

estates,  ie,  to build a  new road or road extension  as  an

additional outlet in older estates if the required  space  is

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the growth in the last 20 years, private

estates have undergone many structural changes.  Many  single

storey  houses have been demolished and replaced  by  two  or

three storey houses.  Where planning regulations are allowed,

a  site  for a single house has been split into two or  three

terrace houses.  As a result, many new houses have been built

even   in  older  estates.   Consequently,  the  density   of

residence  has increased.  Also, many families  now  own  two

cars  instead  of one. There are more and more  cars.   As  a

consequence, roads in older estates are congested during peak

hours,  in  particular, the artery connecting the estate  and

the  main  road outside of the estate.  A way to  solve  this

problem is to open up a new road linking it to the main  road

to  alleviate the traffic congestion wherever possible.   And

this  will be an improvement which is badly needed in private

estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two estates in my constituency, namely, Charlton Park

and Tai Keng Gardens, will illustrate the above point.  There

are 600 units of terrace and semi-detached houses in Charlton

Park and the only major link road to the Upper Serangoon Road

is Charlton Road.  During peak hours motorists have to form a

long  queue  at  the  junction of  Charlton  Road  and  Upper

Serangoon Road.  Tai Keng Gardens also has a similar problem.

The only linkage from the estate to the main road, Upper Paya

Lebar,  is Jalan Kelichap.  There were 29 houses along  Jalan

Kelichap and 73

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>

new  houses have been added recently.  The traffic volume has

increased significantly and congestion is quite bad now.   If

a new road or road extension can be built, the congestion can

be substantially alleviated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must acknowledge that it is not easy to find suitable

space to build road extensions or new roads in mature estates

to  join with main roads.  However, it will be an improvement

highly  desired  by  the older estate residents  if  suitable

space can be found.  And I urge the Ministry to work with the

Land  Transport  Authority to identify  similar  problems  in

other  older  estates and to incorporate it  as  an  item  of

upgrading in private estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the recent

announcement on the upgrading of private estates has  brought

cheer to the hearts of many residents who have long felt that

they  are the forgotten children.  Having said that, I  think

there  are some questions that they would like to put to  the

Minister.   First, on the scope of the upgrading  of  private

estates  that  is  being  considered  -  playgrounds,  parks,

widening   of  footpaths  seem  terribly  unambitious.    The

question  really  is,  what more can be  done  or  should  be

considered.   I  will  put  two ideas  to  the  Minister  for

consideration.  The first is access to public  transport,  be

this in the form of additional bus routes, bus stops, or even

covered  footpaths linking to these facilities.  The  second,

in terms of general community facilities where private estate

residents can organise their activities, since this is indeed

one   of   the  objectives  of  organising  private  estates'

association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the pace of the project. Two projects in the

second half of this year, as a pilot phase, again seems  very

modest,  since the scope of work mainly contemplated is  very

basic.   Why do we need this pilot phase?  There is  lots  of

experience  out  there in terms of upgrading playgrounds  and

widening of footpaths.  So I would like to know why we cannot

accelerate  the  project  and  actually  have  several   more

occurring at the same time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>

in  order to broaden the Ministry's own experience  with this

novel venture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, my colleagues have already mentioned the

mechanism.  First, the criteria for selection of such estates

and,  second,  is there scope for additional projects  to  be

taken on a co-funding basis?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I take my two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, multi-storey car parks are provided

for  all  new  HDB estates instead of surface  car  parks  to

maximise land use.  But the design of multi-storey car  parks

does  not  provide adequate elderly-friendly  features.   Car

parks that are below 12.6 metre high or five storeys high are

usually  not  provided  with lift.  As  a  result,  residents

especially  senior  citizens may  encounter  difficulty  when

carrying things from their cars to their flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the height of the car park entrance is

restricted  to 2.15 metres.  As a result, owners  of  certain

lightweight vehicles are unable to park in these  car  parks.

These  residents do not have any other alternative car parks,

thus resulting in much inconvenience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make the following suggestions for

the Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increase the height of multi-storey car parks'

entrance to allow lightweight vehicles with height constraint

to park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Provide lift and ramps for all multi-storey car

parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Use solar energy to light up multi-storey car parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Increase the floor to ceiling height of multi-storey

car parks to allow better ventilation and daylighting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Install better fire safety features instead of fire

extinguishers  or fire sprinkler system for multi-storey  car

parks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on my second cut about park connectors. Park

connectors  have  proven to be a success in  providing  green

spaces for people to relax and keep fit.  But the progress of

park   connectors'   development  has   encountered   various

difficulties   such  as  obtaining  approvals  from   various

authorities   to   construct  park  connectors   over   their

respective  land parcels.  This has resulted  in  unnecessary

delay   of   park  connectors'  development  and   also   the

construction of disjointed park connectors, such as the  park

connector in Ulu Pandan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote healthy living and provide a quality

living  environment  for  Singaporeans,  I  would  urge   the

Ministry  to  give high priority to expedite the construction

of  park  connectors in Singapore.  Sir, I wish to  seek  the

following clarifications from the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the progress of park connectors in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can we provide more fitness facilities and toilets

along park connectors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Ministry accord higher priority to construct

park  connectors  within the housing estates?   For  example,

there are two neighbourhood parks in Bukit Panjang which  can

be  connected  by  a 1.2 km park connector.  This  connection

will   definitely  promote  healthy  living  and   strengthen

community bonding among the residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, National Parks has done a

wonderful  job developing all the little pockets of  greenery

all  over  the island that we Singaporeans and residents  and

our  families  can escape to in our free time, mainly  during

the weekends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The really popular parks however are the big ones with

facilities  that allow people the ability to get some  active

exercise  and  participate in a variety of  activities.   The

East Coast Park, for example, with its great long stretch  of

20  km  of parkway is a wonderful venue for walking, jogging,

in-line blading, and bicycling.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, I am obviously not the only one who thinks

so,  because  on most weekends, with good weather,  you  will

find  the  East Coast Park chock-a-block with people,  adults

and children, in typical Singaporean style generally in total

disregard  of  staying  within  the  appropriate  walking  or

cycling tracks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is very well to take a good humoured and easy

going  approach  to  this, the truth of the  matter  is  that

sometimes  it gets  dangerous because of the congestion,  and

particularly  with young  children who are totally  oblivious

to  the  chaos  they create swerving unsteadily  or  stopping

suddenly   dead  in  their  tracks  in  the   middle   of   a

thoroughfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearer signage and reminders to keep people to the

appropriate  tracks, simply to minimise accidents,  would  be

good.   Provisions  for in-line bladers, whose  population  I

have  watched grow by quantum leaps over the last  couple  of

years,  and who are caught in no-man's land between  cyclists

and strollers, need to be taken into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion, if space is not available to create wider

and  more  tracks  for different users, is  to  separate  the

traffic  going in opposite directions, that is, to have  dual

carriageways,  so to speak.  This will lessen  the  confusion

and  hazards  of  the variety of types of traffic  moving  in

different  directions.  In other words,  you  have  different

types of traffic but going in a single direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard particularly to facilities for in-line

bladers  and  skateboarders, may I make a plea specially  for

more facilities for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have seen some senior citizens happily

blading away, these two pastimes are a wonderful way  to  put

the  energies  of the group of young people,  with  what  you

might  call "attitude" to positive use.  I met a gentleman  a

couple of months ago who had trained a group of young bladers

for  the  National Day celebrations last year, and he  shared

with me the unstinting effort and enthusiasm these youngsters

put into months of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>

practice and the pride they took in the enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are restless young people with excess energy, and

the opportunity to occupy them in developing their skills and

taking  pride in this, and building self-esteem, is certainly

worth  some  investment  of physical  resources.   Currently,

there  are  very  few  of  the  parks  that  have  facilities

specifically for  in-line bladers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how park utilisation is measured, but I

would  like to suggest that measures of usage should  not  be

averaged  over  the week, unless and until we have  staggered

work   weeks,   as  currently  poor  stressed   out   working

Singaporeans, PRs, foreign talent, as well as foreign workers

of  other  categories, are all out there  on  Sundays,  using

every available open space that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take this into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Time is

running short and my answers will be brief.   I will  ask  my

officers  to follow up with Members' suggestions as  well  as

their  questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker asked about the problems faced by tenants of

commercial centres.  This is a problem that the town  council

must   resolve   with  the  commercial  centre's   management

association.  I will ask my HDB officers to also look at  the

many suggestions he has put forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Bras Basah Complex Merchants'

Association, I understand  that they have yet to approach the

City  Centre  Town Council.  I hope the advisor of  the  Bras

Basah Complex Merchants' Association will do so quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upgrading of private estates, Members have posed

various  questions  about what the Government  is  doing  for

private  residential estates and have made  some  suggestions

last Monday.  I was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>

unable  to  give specific answers to specific questions  last

Monday on a question filed by Mr Heng Chiang Meng because  my

Ministry  and  the Ministry of Finance were working  out  the

final  details.   I  am  happy to report  this  evening  that

Cabinet  has since approved a budget of $10 million  for  the

upgrading of private estates and this $10 million is over and

above the routine maintenance programme offered by  LTA,  ENV

and  NParks  and  so  forth.   Perhaps  Mr   Singh  would  be

convinced that this Government does work at web speed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$10 million is a global budget but for individual

precincts  the  funding level would be  $4,000  per  dwelling

unit.    Members would note, as Dr Ker has now very  cleverly

pointed  out,  that this level of funding is founded  on  the

same  basis as the IUP, in other words, the beneficiaries  of

the  private residential  dwelling estates do not need to co-pay for the improvement works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the questions posed by the various Members, I

hope  my  officers will come back to them.  I hope they  will

pardon  me  because  time is running  out.   There  are  many

speakers after this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question on the design guidelines with respect to

car  park usage by the elderly and disabled, their needs  are

taken  care  of by the code on barrier free accessibility  in

buildings.   In this code, the parking lots must be  provided

for  drivers and passengers with disability.  The  allocation

rate is one per 50 parking lots, but the first 100 lots,  and

one for every subsequent 200 parking lots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the overhead clearance which Dr Teo suggested, I

will ask my officers to look into his suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked us to speed up the implementation of

the  park  connectors network.  We will  do  so  in  the  new

budget.   He  may be happy to note that we will be proceeding

with  a connector that links the  Zhenghua Park and the  Pang

Sua Pond Park, which is within his estate, later in Year 2000

and  will incorporate a park connector from Zhenghua Park  to

the neighbourhood park (Pang Sua Pond).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>

This is in Dr Teo Ho Pin's constituency in Sembawang GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee gave very good suggestion on how to make

the East Coast Parkway, one of our jewels on the island, more

friendly  for everybody, from the young to the old,  even  to

the  disabled.   I  will  ask NParks to  look  into  all  her

suggestions.

6.l5 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Before the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

resumes  his seat, just a clarification.  Is the $10  million

allocation  for upgrading of private estates for a particular

duration  or  period?  And, secondly, when it  comes  to  the

implementation aspects of this, will the scope  be  broadened

and  will he be considering more than two pilot projects  for

this year?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The $10 million global

budget for this upgrading of private estates will be for next

year; in other words, for the financial year 2001/2002.   But

we  will start the programme in the later half of this  year.

Because if we start the programme this year, the payment will

be  made  next  year.  So the money will be  available  after

April next year, and we will pay the contractors after April.

We can start the project in the later half of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will start with two because we want to test out the

projects.   This is something that is new that we  are  going

in,  unlike the MUP and IUP which have gone on for  about  10

years  now.  The $10 million is over and above what the other

agencies  are  doing.  Next year, if the  budget  surplus  is

healthy,  we  will go to Finance Ministry and  ask  for  more

money  to  provide more upgrading projects for  more  private

estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> May I ask which are these two areas

that  will  be  in the pilot project?  Is it  appropriate  to

announce now?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> We want to invite Members of

the House to put in their nominations, and then we will rank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>

them  based on our criteria.  One of the important  criteria,

of  course, is age.  There will be other criteria like people

factor, cleanliness, etc.  On people factor, the people  must

want these upgrading projects in their private estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> What about the percentage of private

that a criterion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Dr Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UE 2100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given our limited land and the projected increase

in  population, the only way to optimise our land resource is

to  have higher density and taller buildings.  In the private

housing  market, I would like to suggest that the  Government

reduces  the land set aside for landed housing and allow  for

higher density condominiums.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>

While  I  fully  support the Government's long-term  plan  to

provide  a  greater variety of housing types and  allow  more

people  to own private housing, I believe this can be  better

achieved through more innovative designs for high rise,  high

density  housing rather than landed housing with smaller land

areas  and more storeys.  The typical new landed property  is

so  crammed  and has so many storeys that it is like  a  mini

high-rise building.  When you sit in your living room of your

landed  house  and  can only look out to  a  concrete  jungle

outside,  then  I  believe we are better off with  high-rise,

high  density  housing.   The Singaporean  family  may  still

aspire  to  own  a  landed property but this  preference  may

change in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, with the Government actively

pursuing  its  policy  to attract more  foreign  talents  and

workers,  I would like to ask the Minister if there  are  any

plans  in  place  to accommodate this influx  of  foreigners.

Will there be a surge in demand for housing that will distort

the housing market?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I agree with Dr Wan that high

density  housing such as condominiums would  lead  to  better

land  use  as compared to landed housing.  But this does  not

automatically  mean that we do away with all  landed  housing

and  set  aside land just for high density housing.  I  think

the  pleasant  fact  is that we do have sufficient  land  for

both.   In  the  first place, not every  piece  of  land  can

support  a  very  high  density housing  development.   As  I

indicated  earlier  in  my reply, there  are  many  parts  of

Singapore  where  there  are height  constraints  because  of

flight  paths,  and  so on.  Other areas,  there  are  safety

buffers   that  are  required  by  industries   for   utility

installations.  Then, over and above that, not every area can

support   the  high  density  housing  because  of   capacity

constraints of infrastructure and services.  By this, I  mean

roads.   I  think  earlier on Dr Lily Neo already  complained

that too

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>

much high-rise housing in her constituency has given rise  to

traffic jams.  So we have to take this into account.  We have

to  take  into account sewerage and drainage facilities.   So

all these prevent very high density housing from taking place

in the short term and in all areas.  What such constraints do

create,  of  course, is a mixture of buildings  of  different

heights.   And  I think that is not a bad thing,  because  it

does  result  in  varied and interesting landscapes  for  our

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is on the technical side. I think equally

important, if not more, is to recognise that Singaporeans  do

aspire   to  landed  housing.   There  is  a  percentage   of

Singaporeans who do aspire to landed housing and I  think  we

should  strive  as far as possible within the constraints  of

limited  land  that  we  have,  within  the  constraints   of

providing  for  other uses, within the planning  norms  of  a

higher  population, within all these things, we should  still

try to meet people's aspirations to the best of our ability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I think I cannot disagree with the

Member  when  he  says that this preference may  change  over

time.   It  is not fixed.  As I indicated earlier, all  these

planning norms really should not be cast in stone.   We  need

to  keep  a certain flexibility in our planning.  If people's

tastes  change and they decide that high-rise  housing  is  a

good  alternative  and  developers are  able  to  provide  an

attractive alternative to landed housing, then so be it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of housing mix between low density and

medium density or between medium density and high density  is

an  important issue, and this will be taken up in the current

Concept  Plan review that we are undertaking.  If the  Member

has any other suggestions or views, we will be very happy  to

take them in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question about accommodation for foreign

workers  and foreign talents, I think I did indicate  earlier

that we have set aside sufficient land at the moment for  the

higher population.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>

are many housing options readily open for the foreign workers

and  foreign talents in our midst.  If you are an  employment

pass  holder, you can rent or you can purchase houses through

the  private housing market.  Condominiums, you do  not  need

approval;  even  landed property, if you are  a  PR  and  you

apply,  you may be given approval.  Of course, you  can  rent

rooms in HDB estates; you can rent flats from JTC; or you can

be accommodated in dormitories or boarding houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are currently quite a lot of options available

for  these  workers  and the foreign talents.   But  we  will

monitor the demand.  As the Member indicated earlier, I think

this is something that cannot distort the housing market, and

therefore  we  will also study this as part  of  our  current

Concept Plan review, as I indicated in the earlier reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of GM foods has been raised by Mr Heng

Chiang Meng and Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay.  I would like  to

raise  it again because I think it is a very important issue.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, GM food is here to  stay.   GM

foods,  as  far as we have gathered and known, will certainly

bring  many  benefits to the world.  However,  there  is  the

important  issue that concerns our safety and the  safety  of

our  future generations.  In the longer term, who knows  what

will become of us after consuming these GM foods?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the emergence of genetically modified foods,

many  including  scientists  have  raised  concern  regarding

safety  of  consuming such foods.  They  are  also  concerned

about the long-term side effects

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>

of  GM  foods  on the future generations and the environment.

There have been cases of GM food gone wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the scientists' concerns are that these GM foods

could  cause unexpected adverse effects that could result  in

serious  damage to health and the environment.  Some  of  the

damaging  effects  on  health caused by  GM  foods  are  food

allergy, antibiotic resistance and introduction of new toxins

in the food.  In many cases, the problems are only discovered

after people get sick.  The new toxins and allergens in these

non-food  sources could cause serious damage to  us  and  our

children.   These are real concerns that we need to seriously

consider,  especially  in view of the  introduction  and  the

influx of these foods into Singapore consumer market.  Hence,

I would like to ask the Minister whether the foods introduced

into  the  Singapore  market are  safe  and  for  large-scale

consumption,  and  whether tests have  been  carried  out  to

ensure  that  these GM foods would not bring  ill  health  or

allergy or even trigger long-term side effects as a result of

prolonged continuous consumption.  I would also like to  know

whether there is an appropriate national regulatory framework

established  to ensure that strict bio-safety procedures  and

measures are observed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for the Environment in his reply had said

that  the  assessment had got to be rational.  I  agree  with

him.  But if we do not have facts about GM foods nor its long-term  effects,  how  can we be rational  in  our  assessment?

Under  the circumstances, I think it is better to err on  the

side  of  caution.  Perhaps, I still believe labelling  might

not  be  such  a bad idea and costs should not  be  the  main

concern.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Dr Wan raised the subject

of  GM  food.  GM food is not new but, of course, the concern

is  real.  GM food has been around for many years in the form

of  soya  beans, corn and canola oil.  Such GM food has  been

approved  for  sale  in major countries,  such  as  USA,  EU,

Australia,  Canada  and Japan, after extensive  toxicity  and

allergenicity tests as well as animal and field trials.  This

is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>

ensure that they are safe for consumption and have no adverse

impact on the environment.  In fact, GM food is generally put

under more stringent safety scrutiny than conventional non-GM

foods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, there is no evidence of adverse long-term

health  effects of consuming such approved GM food.  But  the

concern is still there of such a new kind of food and how  do

we  control their import and use.  To oversee and advise  the

Government  on  GM products, a Genetic Modification  Advisory

Committee,  or  GMAC,  has  been formed.   The  Committee  is

chaired  by Prof. Lim Pin who is the Vice-Chancellor  of  NUS

with  members from various agencies, including PPD,  ENV  and

Ministry of Health.  GMAC has established a set of bio-safety

guidelines on the release of agriculture related GM products.

However,  the  mechanism  to  regulate  GM  product  such  as

labelling and so on, has yet to be worked out.  While we  can

ban  GM  products that have been scientifically shown  to  be

unsafe  for  consumption or detrimental to  the  environment,

established  by the advanced countries, or even  by  our  own

tests,  the issue of mandatory declaration of all GM products

and  their  derivatives at import is complex as  it  involves

many    factors,    including    trade    implications    and

enforceability.   These issues have been clearly  debated  at

international  forums, but there has  yet  to  be  any  clear

international  direction.  GMAC is closely  monitoring  world

trends  on  the regulation of GM products before  making  its

recommendations to the Government.  So there  is  a  national

agency  that  is  looking after that.  In the  meantime,  any

produce found to be unsafe for consumption or harmful to  the

environment based on toxicity tests and allergenicity  tests,

and  so on, whether genetically modified, or otherwise, would

be banned from import or consumption.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Chiam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for

giving  me the opportunity to speak.  I was cut out the  last

time.  Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UI

5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take all the three cuts together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you may.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my first cut is on HDB resale

levy.  Sir, the HDB imposes a levy on the resale of flats  at

20%  or 22% depending on the size of the flats.  The levy can

sometimes amount to $20,000 or $30,000, which are large  sums

of  money.   Lessees of HDB flats who sell their flats  after

staying  in them for 10-20 years are angry that the HDB  also

wants  to  make part of the money.  HDB flats bought  in  the

early years have all greatly appreciated in prices.  A 3-room

flat bought at, say, $9,500 can be sold 20 years later for at

least  $130,000.  The HDB does not allow the seller  to  make

all  the money but imposes a 20% levy, which is about $26,000

for  the amount that I have just mentioned for the flat sold.

The  $26,000,  if  not deducted as a levy,  would  have  been

earned by the seller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the example given, the profit of $94,500 with

deduction  for levy seems a lot of money.  But it is  not  so

because  prices  of  HDB flats have risen  greatly  over  the

years.   In this case, if the seller wants to upgrade himself

to  buy  a 4-room flat, he probably has to pay half  of  that

amount  which he has earned as the required 20% down  payment

and  the  other  half  is used for renovation  of  the  newly

purchased flat.  The net result is that he makes no profit at

all.   All the profits, minus the levy, are paid back to  the

HDB when he buys a 4-room flat from the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the levy imposed by the HDB tantamounts to a

capital  gains tax.  Singapore has no capital  gains  tax  on

private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>

properties.  Why does the Government allow HDB to impose such

a  tax  in respect of the sale of the flat?  I know what  the

HDB  will  say.   HDB  will  say  that  the  flats  sold  are

subsidised  and it is right for them to impose  a  levy.   My

answer is that the levy is in effect a capital gains tax, and

it  has nothing to do with the subsidy.  If the HDB wants  to

claim that the flats are subsidised, then the levy should  be

based   on  the  original  subsidised  price,  and  not   the

appreciated selling price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on HDB's bias against the

Opposition.  When I was elected into Parliament in 1984, soon

after that, the HDB walled up a void deck space for me to use

it as my MP's office.  In the 1991 general election, a record

of  four  Opposition  MPs were elected.   Suddenly,  the  HDB

announced  that  it  was not going to provide  all  MPs  with

offices  in  their premises.  My MP's office at Potong  Pasir

was  demolished within half a day and the place was  restored

to  its  original condition, not a trace of  my  former  MP's

office  existed.   I had no room to hold my weekly  meet-the-people session.  I had no choice but to hold them at the void

deck in the open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind to meet my residents in the open if the

meeting  was just for a chit chat, or for a social gathering.

But  the  weekly meet-the-people sessions are for a  business

purpose,  ie,  the  business  of  the  residents.  They  have

problems which they need to tell their MP and for which  they

want their MP to help them on those problems.  Those problems

are  often  very  private  matters and  are  confidential  in

nature.   Therefore, there is a need for  privacy  when  such

matters are dealt with.  As it now stands, I have to meet the

residents  to hear their very private problems in  the  open.

The  only  thing I have is a cloth screen which is not  sound

proof.   I would like to request the HDB again to wall  up  a

space  for  me in the void deck so as to provide me  with  an

MP's office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last time I made the request it was refused. I

know  the  HDB has provided all PAP MPs with proper rooms  in

the void decks of HDB flats to be used as their MPs'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>

offices.  In the case of my constituency at Potong Pasir, the

HDB  has provided Andy Gan, the prospective PAP candidate who

is not even an MP.  He has a proper office, equipped with air

conditioning  and  computers,  to  hold  his  meet-the-people

sessions.  Whereas I, a duly elected MP, am left in the  open

to  hold my meet-the-people sessions.  I hope the HDB  should

immediately  stop  its discrimination and  bias  against  the

Opposition MPs and provide them the same facilities as  those

of the PAP MPs at the void decks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third cut is on change of HDB rules. The

frequent  change of rules by the HDB is well known.   Lessees

of  HDB  do  not mind the frequent changes if the changes  of

rules  do not affect them materially.  In one instance, HDB's

change  of  rules in regard to the residence period  affected

lessees materially.  At first, the HDB said that you have  to

stay  five years in a flat before you can sell it in the open

market.   Then suddenly, the HDB says, "No, you  cannot  sell

the  flat after staying for five years.  You have now to stay

for 10 years before you can sell the flat."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known of one case where this couple has

purchased a flat and hoping to stay there for five years  and

after that, to sell it so that they could upgrade to a bigger

flat.  But before the five years' residence period is up, the

HDB  changed its rule to make the waiting period to 10 years.

In  such  instances, the HDB, in my view, has  acted  in  bad

faith.   The  HDB, after making a representation  to  lessees

that they can sell their flats after staying in them for five

years,  is wrong in not allowing them to do so at the end  of

five  years.  Sir, I hope that in future, when HDB does  make

such  material change, it should give clear cut-off dates  so

that the existing lessees do not suffer.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I move this

amendment  to  highlight a problem that we encounter  at  our

meet-the people sessions.  A majority of our HDB dwellers get

along with each other pretty well.  However, occasionally, we

do  come across some HDB residents who are inconsiderate  and

they cause problems to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>

others.   I am sure you must have many instances of residents

coming  to your meet-the-people session to complain how  some

residents just throw the rubbish along the corridor right  in

front  of  somebody's flat, or making a big nuisance  in  the

evening when they come back at 11 pm and blast the radio very

loud.   There  are so many instances, and I do  not  want  to

quote all of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such complaints are received, usually the MPs, the

Residents'  Committees and even the police are all  involved.

They  will  try  to settle the dispute. Very  few  times,  we

succeed; most times, we fail.  I think it is not fair that we

should  allow  these  inconsiderate residents  to  even  stay

there.   I  am  sure HDB has a lot of rules  to  protect  the

interest  of  the majority.  I wonder whether  HDB  has  ever

evicted any resident who has been found guilty by a court, if

he  is caught for misconduct.  I want to find out whether HDB

has ever evicted such a resident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no such rules, is it not time for such a

ruling  to be imposed to ensure harmony in the neighbourhood?

I  know it is a very, very serious thing.  Perhaps, HDB could

buy  back the flat from the offender and bar him from  buying

or  renting  a HDB flat for perhaps five years.  I  think  we

should not allow all these inconsiderate residents to make  a

nuisance of themselves and make life very difficult  for  the

residents of HDB dwellers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam has come back

on  the  HDB resale levy a bit late because my colleague,  Dr

Vasoo, raised it some time ago, and I have convinced Dr Vasoo

to  look at the right picture and he agreed with me that  the

resale  levy  was  necessary.   But,  nevertheless,  I   will

reiterate the main points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-90s, many upgraders took advantage of the

bouyant property market to cash in on the existing HDB  flats

and  apply  to buy another subsidised flat from the  HDB,  in

other words, a second flat.  As a result, HDB's waiting  list

ballooned to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>

something  like 150,000 at the peak in 1997.  With  upgraders

making  up  52%  of the applicants, what this means  is  that

upgraders are depriving first-timers of an opportunity for  a

first flat.  Is this fair?  The answer must be "no".

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to address this problem, HDB implemented this

resale  levy.  But in doing so, HDB was mindful of  the  fact

that  families that live in smaller flats, ie,  3-room  flats

and   4-room   flats  should  not  be  unduly  disadvantaged.

Therefore,  we pitched the resale levy such that for  smaller

flats,  the resale levy is smaller. For example, for a 2-room

flat,  the resale levy is 15%; a 3-room flat, 20%;  a  4-room

flat,  22.5%, and a 5-room flat, we pitched it at  25%.   One

does not need to pay the resale levy unless one goes back  to

the  HDB  for a second subsidised flat.  This is fair because

the upgrader already has his first flat.  He has lived in the

first  flat  for some years. He has enjoyed the benefits.  He

has  now  cashed  in his capital gains, and  he  must  decide

whether  he  wants to pay the resale levy and  get  a  second

subsidised flat, or he can buy a resale flat with the capital

gains and still have some money in the pocket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam quoted the example of a 3-room flat which was

sold  by the HDB to the owner a long time ago at a low price.

For this owner, the resale levy is reasonable.  If I read him

correctly, Mr Chiam pointed out that for a person who  bought

a 3-room flat or a 4-room flat in the 1980s or even 1990s, he

or she may not find the resale levy acceptable because in the

1980s  and 1990s, HDB sold these flats at much higher  prices

than  the  flats  sold in the 1960s and  1970s.   I  have  an

example of a 4-room flat owner. The HDB sold this flat to a 4-room  flat  owner  in 1992 in Toa Payoh. At  that  time,  the

selling price was $160,000. Today, the resale price for  this

4-room flat or its equivalent in Toa Payoh is something  like

$375,000. If you factor in the resale levy of 22.5% for a  4-room  flat,  that  comes to $84,000.  If you  take  $375,000,

which  is the price of a resale flat today, minus the  resale

levy of $84,000, this resident has a profit of $290,000.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>

original selling price by HDB to this owner was $160,000,  so

he  has a capital gain of $130,000 which is tax-free. On this

count,  even  if he pays the resale levy upfront,  he  has  a

capital gain of $130,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose now he wants to upgrade and go for a direct

purchase of a HDB flat in the same locality in Toa Payoh, the

selling  price  of  a new 5-room flat now is  something  like

$347,000.   The  resale price of a 5-room equivalent  in  Toa

Payoh  is  today half a million dollars.  The market subsidy,

which  this owner will get if he were to go to HDB to  get  a

new  flat, is something like $125,000.  If he pays the resale

levy  of  $84,000, he still gets a second subsidy of  $41,000

which  is  substantial.  Either way is  a  win-win  for  this

owner.   When  he sells, he gets a capital gain, tax-free  of

$130,000.   He goes to the HDB, buys a new flat  and  gets  a

second market subsidy of $41,000, no doubt a reduced one.   I

do  not know how Mr Chiam See Tong has come to the conclusion

that the resale levy penalises Singaporeans.  It reduces  the

market  subsidy for the upgrader but it in no way takes  away

his second subsidy. I hope he is convinced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong claims that HDB provides PAP MPs with

free  meet-the-people  session  office.   This  is  factually

incorrect.   PAP MPs run their meet-the-people sessions  from

the  PCF education centres. The HDB rents the void deck space

to  the  PCF  at  a concession rate because PCF  is  doing  a

community service. Mr Chiam can also set up his own PCF if he

forms his own educational foundation under section 29 of  the

Companies  Act, and HDB will similarly rent him a  void  deck

space  and  his  political party can rent  a  room  from  his

education  centre, provided the education  foundation  has  a

paid-up capital of $5 million.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Could the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary  clarify what are the criteria for eligibility  for

concession from HDB?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I have just clarified

that. There is only one condition, that is, whoever can  form

an education

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>

centre with a paid up capital of $5 million, which in today's

context is not very big. In fact, this criterion was drawn up

in 1991. I have asked HDB whether we should revise it because

$5  million in the context of today's dot.com fever  is  very

small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Maybe $10 million.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Chiam has got it

factually  wrong.   Mr Chiam has got it factually  wrong  the

third  time when he quoted the example where a resident could

not sell his flat after five years of occupation in his flat.

No,  he can still sell the flat after five years' occupation,

but  he cannot go to HDB and register for a second new  flat.

He  can  only  do that if he has served up a ten-year  period

from the time he took possession of his first flat.  All  HDB

rules  are  fairly  applied across the board.   It  does  not

discriminate  between party, creed or race.  Mr Chiam  should

get his facts right before coming here again on these issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> On the point of the levy on HDB

flats,  did the HDB make known to the purchaser of HDB  flats

at  the  point of purchase by saying, "Look here, at a  later

date,  we  are going to impose a levy on you."  Did  they  do

that? That is my first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second part is: is PCF not an educational facility?

If  it is an educational facility, is it a charity?  If it is

a charity, the premises must be used for charitable purposes.

Can  you  say that PAP MPs are using those premises only  for

charitable  purposes?  The other point  is:  can  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary say for sure that if the  Opposition

do apply, the HDB will have its premises open to them if they

can raise $5 million? Can he assure that?

try to provide this service of mediating between families who

The Chinese has a saying, "jia jia you ben nan nian de jing".

It is very difficult for us to ascertain who is right and who

is  wrong.   But  HDB has done due diligence. Even  before  a

dispute  goes to court, HDB would normally visit  the  family

and  try  to settle the dispute amicably, failing which,  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P -

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head P - Ministry of Health. Amendment

No. (1), Mr Bernard Chen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of the Ministry's plan to form two

healthcare  delivery  networks  is  a  step  in   the   right

direction.   The  networks will achieve  better  coordination

between  the  acute  hospitals,  national  centres  and   the

polyclinics.   With  the  setting  up  of  so  many   medical

establishments,  it  makes sense to  try  to  coordinate  the

activities  for  these centres providing different  types  of

medical care.  I am, however, concerned with the six national

centres  which  have been established over the  years.  These

include

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>

the Eye Centre, Oncology and Heart Centres, and so on.  While

it is good that specialties be concentrated in these centres,

there are several perceived disadvantages.  The first is  the

coordination  with the acute hospitals. Patients,  especially

older ones, do not suffer from just one ailment.  They may be

afflicted with multiple illnesses. How do we ensure that  all

the  expertise  is brought to bear to effect total  treatment

without  having to refer to specialists residing in different

places or, worse still, refer the patients from hospitals  to

these national centres and vice versa?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the national centres, being new buildings, give

the  impression  that  they  are very  expensive  affairs.  I

understand  patients  referred to these  centres  by  private

practitioners have to pay "A" class charges. Some of them may

not  be  able to afford these charges because they  may  have

been  referred to by GPs in housing estates.  Even  with  the

public hospital network, there may be occasions when patients

are  levied  higher  charges had they  been  treated  in  the

hospitals themselves.  I hope that this is only a perception,

but there could be possibilities that eventually, the medical

cost will rise because of these increased charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the event that more national centres are to

be  set  up,  acute hospitals may be deprived of  the  entire

range of specialties to render total treatment. This will add

to  the so-called to-ing and fro-ing of patients between  the

hospitals  and  the  centres.   I  would  like  to  have  the

Minister's comments on these several areas of concern.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have got one minute left. I think we

can stop here.  Do I have the consent of Members that we stop

here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  I  beg to report that the Committee of  Supply  has

made further progress on the Estimates of Expenditure for the

financial  year  2000/2001,  and  ask  leave  to  sit   again

tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
