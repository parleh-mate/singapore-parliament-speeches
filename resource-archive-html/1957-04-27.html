<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question (26th April, 1957),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) takes note of the Report of the Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London  in

March  and  April,  1957,  as  contained  in

Sessional  Paper No. Misc. 2  of  1957,  and

approves  the points on which agreement  has

been reached; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) approves the stand of the All-Party

Delegation   in   not  accepting  the   condition

stipulated  in  paragraph 30 of the  Report."-(The

Chief Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  understand the Government opposes the amendment

which    seeks   to   call   for   the   immediate

implementation    of    this    unfortunate    new

constitution on the basis of granting the right to

vote  to  all  those  who  would  be  entitled  to

citizenship  by  virtue  of  residence  under  the

constitution. I was also informed by the Secretary

of  the P.A.P., the Member for Tanjong Pagar, that

the  P.A.P. opposes the amendment. Sir, this House

has  been  away from its electorate for more  than

two  years.  As  a result of a statement  of  mine

yesterday, I understand from the Press that  there

is  now  a  possibility of early  by-elections  in

Cairnhill and in Tanjong Pagar, by-elections to be

fought  on  the  simple issue as  to  whether  the

people   desire   this   constitution   and    its

implementation  on  the  date  indicated  by   the

motion, or whether they prefer my amendment.  Sir,

I  would  ask the Chief Minister, particularly  as

his  seat is not in jeopardy, nor are any  of  the

Government  seats in jeopardy - they can  listen  in

comfort  by the radio - whether he would  give  this

House -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> A point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If I may finish the question,

certainly,  Sir. I would ask the  Chief  Minister

whether he would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



permit   the   adjournment  of  the  voting - not

necessarily  of the debate, because others  should

naturally  be heard - on the amendment  until  after

the results of the by-elections. I do not ask this

House  to  accept the results of the by-elections,

but  they  can  take them into consideration  when

voting. I would ask the Chief Minister whether  he

is  prepared to do that, Sir,I am sitting down to

permit a reply, Sir, not to -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Chief Minister need not,

of  course,  reply at this stage if  he  does  not

choose  to.  He  will, I presume,  reply  when  he

replies to the whole debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir; it might have

changed the character of the debate. It would  not

require  any  delay in working out  the  Order  in

Council,  Sir. My amendment calls for  an  earlier

implementation of this constitution. Sir,  I  will

not deal further with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, I was on the subject of my main

disagreement  with  this constitution  because  of

paragraph  26 (ii) of the Report of the  Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London in  March

and  April,  1957.  It  deprives  the  people   of

Singapore  and  their elected  representatives  of

control  over internal security matters, since  it

gives  the Internal Security Council the functions

and  the powers "to maintain the efficiency of all

organs of the Singapore Government concerned  with

internal security". And paragraphs 27 (h), (i) and

(k),  which  compel  the Singapore  Government  to

accept  the  decision of this  seven-man  Council,

Sir.  Now, what is exactly the difference,  I  was

asked, and perhaps I have not made it clear, so  I

will  give two or three examples. Sir, if  we  had

accepted  last  year's constitution,  there  would

have  been  only an Advisory Defence and  Security

Council. There was nothing wrong with that.  As  I

have  repeatedly said, I am willing to learn  from

everybody and consult with everybody, but  it  was

reserved to Her Majesty in Council to make  powers

by Order in Council in matters of external affairs

and  external defence, but with a definition which

impinged on internal security to some extent. Sir,

what is the position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



today? As you say, we give away completely internal

security  to  this Council which is not responsible

to the people's elected representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, Sir, supposing under last

year's constitution the Assembly decides to appoint

a  Committee of Inquiry into allegations of  brutal

assaults by police officers on citizens. Now  under

last  year's  constitution, Sir, there  can  be  no

doubt  whatsoever but that the Defence and Security

Council   could  only  protest  to  the   Singapore

Government  and  advise  against  such  inadvisable

action  which would weaken the morale of the police

force; but it could not take any action, nor  could

Her  Majesty  in  Council take any action,  because

quite  obviously  an  inquiry into  allegations  of

police   brutality  is  not  external  affairs   or

external   defence.   But  what   about   the   new

constitution that is proposed to come into force in

the never never? Suppose under the new constitution

the  Assembly says it wants an inquiry into  police

brutality. "Ah," says somebody (whoever it may be),

"we  do  not like it." Then it goes to the Internal

Security  Council,  and  this  Council  has   three

British members on it who would naturally avoid any

suggestion of bringing this out into the open,  and

they  have  also - this  is the  improvement  in  the

machinery - the Minister for the Federation. But  let

us  assume that the Minister for the Federation - and

it  is fair to assume that, seeing that there is no

such  inquiry  in  the Federation and  perhaps  the

Federation would not like to start that kind  of  a

smell - decides     to    support     the     British

representatives. Then a perfectly legitimate desire

of  the  people  to  investigate brutality  by  the

police  is blocked - even that little thing is  taken

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing, Sir, we want to amend the Banishment

Ordinance.  Under the constitution  last  year  the

Defence  and  Security Council  could  say  to  the

Singapore Government: "It is very unwise of you  to

revise  this Ordinance even though it might  be  42

years old. It is very unwise." But it could not  do

more.  Her  Majesty in Council could not very  well

refuse us our amendment because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



it  has  no  power  in  those matters  in  blocking

legislation. This is purely an internal matter. But

under the new constitution you go ahead and ask for

a  revision  of the Banishment Ordinance,  and  the

police communicate with the High Commissioner,  and

the  High  Commissioner will call in  the  Internal

Security Council and they say, "Tut, tut, tut, tut,

a  lot of gangsters, you know. It is better not  to

touch  this Banishment Ordinance." Well,  then,  we

depend on the Minister for the Federation. But  the

Federation, Sir, has the same Banishment  Ordinance

as  ourselves and is not anxious to improve it.  So

can  you expect the Minister for the Federation  to

seek to be more progressive in Singapore than he is

in  the  Federation? So we find  that  a  perfectly

legitimate  desire on the part  of  the  people  of

Singapore, who  have  a very large  proportion  of

aliens, blocked on this simple matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see the differences, Sir? You see how much we

have  given  away  under the  new  constitution  as

compared to the old? Let us take another one,  much

nearer home, and of which so much is being made  by

the  P.A.P.  Supposing the new Assembly under  last

year's  constitution were to move a motion to  say,

"Let us release the Member for Bukit Timah. He  has

had  enough  of a holiday in the democratic  Changi

jail,  and  let us release Devan Nair." Of  course,

the  Defence and Security Council would say,  quite

naturally,  "Look  here, boys,  you  know  you  are

releasing  two  men who are confirmed subversives."

But  they  could  not do anything. Her  Majesty  in

Council  cannot interfere because, quite  patently,

even under their definition this is not a matter of

external  affairs and external defence.  But  under

the  new  constitution this will  come  immediately

before  the Internal Security Council. And  do  you

think  the  Federation Minister,  for  example,  is

going  to  vote in support of the Members here  for

release  of subversives when that is not  happening

in  the Federation? You see how much we have  given

away,  Sir. We had more than two-thirds of internal

security in our hands under the constitution  which

we  were  offered - not that we were  satisfied  with

it - but it was offered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



by  the British Government last year in Annexure L.

Today  we  have  given away the  whole  control  of

internal security. I say to you that these examples

indicate  that to suggest that the new constitution

provides for the status of a self-governing  State,

with  all the rights, privileges and powers thereto

appurtenant   in   internal   affairs   is   wholly

inaccurate, Sir, entirely false. What in  fact  the

new  constitution provides for when it  comes  into

effect  is the creation of a colonial State without

the ultimate control in every matter connected with

internal affairs. That is what you have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second objection indicated to you

yesterday  is  that  it is essentially  a  colonial

constitution  and I shall mention  briefly  why.  I

have  already indicated to you, Sir, that  internal

security  is  now completely out of  our  hands.  I

would  also point out that the Colonial  Office  is

still  in  charge of this colony under the  present

Rendel-Yew  Hock  Constitution and  under  the  new

Lennox-Boyd-Yew Hock Constitution. A symbol of this

colonial  position as compared to last  year,  when

they  were prepared to offer us more, is that  this

year  the  new  constitution will be  by  Order  in

Council and not by Act of Parliament, Sir, and if I

might  refer you to page 14, paragraph  52  of  the

Report  of  the Singapore Constitutional Conference

of this year, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Constitution itself would be contained in an

Order  of  Her Majesty in Council, supplemented  by

Royal Instructions."



<br><br>But  what  did they offer us last year, Sir?  If  I

might  refer  you to last year's Report,  Sessional

Paper  No.  Cmd.  31 of 1956 at  page  69,  at  the

bottom:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In implementation of the undertakings embodied

in   this   constitution  Her  Majesty's  Government

propose to introduce a State of Singapore Bill into

Parliament to provide for the surrender  of  powers

to  legislate  by Order in Council  (or  otherwise)

under the British Settlements Acts."



<br><br>So  we  were at least offered some sort of  an  Act

last year by the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as regards the date. Sir, why should I

bother about the date if, in fact, the constitution

is a bad one? Why should I worry if it comes into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



force? Why should I want for Singapore a tiga  suku

busoh merdeka? That is a fair question, and I think

the answer is a very simple one, Sir. The people of

Singapore,    through   the    hands    of    their

representatives, have now handed themselves,  bound

and  gagged, into the power of the Colonial Office.

This   Assembly  is  committed - I  know  the   Chief

Minister does not mind being committed and changing

his  mind - but  this  Assembly through  its  Merdeka

Mission  has committed itself to this constitution.

Nothing more can be expected from this Assembly.  I

think that is fair enough. The new constitution, if

it  is  brought into force, and the quicker  it  is

brought  into  force, then the quicker  it  can  be

destroyed.  It will have 51 Members as against  our

25  now.  It  will  have completely  newly  elected

people  more in touch with the people of Singapore,

and  they at least will not be bound - they  are  now

bound  by the action of their colleagues.  They  at

least  can  say, "No, we do not want this  horrible

fate  you have given us. Our predecessors have tied

us to it, but please, we would like to renegotiate,

and  renegotiate  forthwith." I  thought.  Sir,  of

moving  a  motion  in this Assembly  to  reject  it

completely, but where would I get? All the  Parties

are  in  it. At least I am hoping that the  Parties

will  agree to the early implementation so that  we

can  get  on with the job of cleaning up  the  mess

that they have made. That is why I am worried about

the date. Sir, I said what did we ask for by way of

date  last  year and what was agreed,  because  the

Chief  Minister gave an assurance to this House  he

would  accept  nothing less than what  was  offered

last year, and in fact it was the scandalous rumour-mongers  who suggested he would. If you will  look, Sir, at Annexure H of Command Paper 31 of 1956,  at

page 50:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though our draft Independence Act does not

specifically provide for the citizenship  proposals

incorporated in our original memorandum nor set out

a  date,  we  wish it to be clear that we  consider

April  1957, two years after the coming into  force

of the Rendel Constitution, would be an appropriate

date  for the inauguration of the new constitution.

Furthermore,   the   constitution,    which    must

necessarily follow any lndependence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



Act, should provide for citizenship  rights

in  accordance with the proposals incorporated  in

our original memorandum SCT. (56) 5 and agreed  to

by all Parties."



<br><br>We  asked for April 1957, and the Mission  knows - I

think  it  was made public that the Rt.  Hon. the

Secretary  of State for the Colonies  did  suggest

informally that perhaps if we were successful,  we

should  try  and keep in step with the  Federation

and   make  it  August,  and  the  delegation  was

generally  of the view, as an act of courtesy  and

goodwill towards our sister territory, that it was

quite  prepared to accept August 1957 for our  new

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after I resigned, and as a result of some

very  unpleasant rumours that were going round,  I

had  an  interview with the Chief Minister  and  I

wrote  him  a  letter on the 21st of  June,  1956,

somewhat prophetic in character. However, I  shall

spare  him  from  reading it  completely.  It  was

written,  Sir,  specifically for such  an  unhappy

occasion as this and with the intent that it might

be  published. I shall read to you,  Sir,  only  a

portion  and  if  the  Chief  Minister  wishes  to

correct anything that might be inaccurate, I shall

pass him a copy. I said in the third paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was glad to hear your repeated and earnest

assurance  that  there was  no  question  of  your

waiting  till  next  year  for  reopening  of  the

Merdeka talks and that you were at one with me  in

visualising the urgency of early reopening of  the

Constitutional Conference. I understood you to say

that   in   July  you  will  be  having   informal

discussions  with the Colonial Secretary  and  not

later than December or January next there will  be

a  full mission. I think it unwise to wait as late

as December or January, nor do I see it necessary.

It   seems  to  me  that  after  your  July  talks

September  can be the date on which the conference

can  be  resumed. However, the question of tactics

is  not one in which I seek to interfere, so  long

as  it  does  not  assume a vital character  which

would  destroy  or gravely prejudice  our  Party's

movement and the country's welfare."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came back, Sir, from a four-month trip abroad

made  mainly  in order to leave the  Government  a

free  hand and not to seem to be interfering,  and

in  order  to enable it to gain the confidence  of

the Colonial Office, which seems to treat me as  a

wild  animal.  When  I came back,  certain  events

transpired,   and  as  a  result  of   a   special

conference convened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



of  the  General Council of the Labour Front,  the

Chief Minister made a statement in this House. The

statement,  Sir, is in our Hansard of the  5th  of

November, 1956, at col. 421, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am therefore not yet in a position to name a

definite  date  for the resumption of  talks,  but

this Government has decided that if the talks  are

successful the new constitution should  come  into

being  in  August next year, with fresh elections.

The  new  constitution should come into  being  in

August next year with fresh elections."



<br><br>I  am  not repeating it, Sir. He actually repeated

that phrase twice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is in reply to the accusation of our

opponents  that  this  Government  is  anxious  to

remain in office."



<br><br>Sir,  I  followed that statement  of  his  with  a

question    so   that   there   should    be    no

misunderstanding - to  me it is  a  matter  of  some

vital  importance - and on the same column,  Sir,  I

asked:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, do I

understand  the Chief Minister to say that  it  is

the  firm intention of the Government to seek full

and  fresh elections, if the constitutional  talks

are   successful,  not  later  than  August  next,

irrespective of the date of the talks?"



<br><br>To this, the Chief Minister replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the hon. Member understands aright.'



<br><br>That   is   clear   enough - a  clear   and   formal

undertaking to this House that if the  talks  were

successful and agreement was reached, there  would

be  elections not later than August of this  year,

irrespective of the time when the talks were being

held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite this unequivocal promise, there were

still  ugly  rumours abroad, and  on  the  9th  of

January,  1957,  I asked a further question,  col.

1205:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure

that  both sides of the House and the country  are

happy   and  relieved  to  learn  of  the   bright

prospects for merdeka; but will the Chief Minister

inform  us of the exact date - I think it has  never

been made known to the House - for the conference to

be held, and reassure us that the holding of fresh

elections in August 1957 is not only a possibility

but  will,  in fact, if the talks are  successful,

take place?



<br><br>The Chief Minister, in reply, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The talks will reopen on the 11th of March,

which I understand is the Ides of March. As far as

the election goes, the Government is committed  to

holding elections in August this year."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



"committed",  Sir,  is  a  big  word.  It  is   a   firm

undertaking  and  it  means  that  irrespective  of  the

Opposition's  attitude, this is Government's  commitment

and  this  is what is going to happen; or if  Government

fails to carry it out, then it will resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 14th of February, 1957, two months ago, in

his  office  at about 6.30 p.m. on this subject  too,  I

drew  his attention again to certain rumours and he said

to me, "Everything is in the bag. The Colonial Office is

resigned  to  August,  but it  says  that  it  might  be

necessary  to have two or three weeks more for  the  new

Act." I said that was all right with me - early August  or

September we have waited. That was the 14th of February,

Sir,  whilst  I  was  a  member  of  the  constitutional

conference.  No  question  of postponement  at  all,  no

question  of postponement right through till  after  the

calling  of  this  Assembly which I  learned  of  on  my

return.  Sir, if Lennox-Boyd is resigned to  August  but

might  need  early September, the point is very  simple.

Since  there is no Act of Parliament necessary - in  fact,

we  can have it at any time, we can have it in July - the

question  of  giving the status to  our  citizens  is  a

matter   that  can  follow  afterwards.   It   is   very

interesting now, Sir, to know what he said on the 5th of

March,   1957,  despite  his  firm  committal   of   the

Government.  I  am reading from Hansard of  the  5th  of

March, col. 1459, the Chief Minister's speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was felt that the people affected should enjoy

these rights and exercise their votes in the choice of a

new  Government for the State of Singapore.  To  achieve

this, the conference fully realised that this would mean

that it would be impossible for the general elections to

take  place  in August this year to which the Government

is  committed. The British Nationality Act will  require

an amendment by the British Parliament. Citizenship laws

will  have  to be introduced in Singapore. A  reasonable

length  of  time of, say, one year should  be  given  to

persons  affected to make application if we really  mean

them  to  enjoy these rights. New electoral  rolls  will

have  to  be  prepared  under the  Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance. All these take time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he speaks truthfully.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told the All-Party Conference that I did not wish

to influence them on this matter-"



<br><br>Or  that  he was committed to August, and his Government

was  committed to August, he did not wish  to  influence

the All-Party Conference in this matter-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as I did not wish it to be said that the Government

was  seeking a way out of its promise to hold  elections

in  August this year. In view of the great importance of

the  matter, the All-Party Conference felt that the All-Party Mission should seek the views of this Assembly and

be  guided  accordingly.  I  would  therefore  ask  hon.

Members  to express their views to guide us on the  line

to  take  with  the Colonial Office on  our  citizenship

proposals. The Government does not intend to ignore  its

commitments, but is prepared to listen to the views  and

advice of hon. Members."



<br><br>But there was no substantive motion before the House  on

which   hon.  Members  could  give  their  views.   "The

Government  does  not intend to ignore its  commitments"

means Government either fulfils its promise or gets  out

if it cannot. Sir, we have a story more than 2,000 years

ago of a man called Pontius Pilate who was committed  to

do  justice  by  the  State of Rome  in  a  land  called

Jerusalem.  He  too washed his hands  and  said  to  the

people,  "I  am committed to doing things but  let  your

will be done."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have here a Government committed to a course

of action which they very readily surrendered. Now, Sir,

let us look at column 1461:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the concensus of view is for citizenship rights to

be  introduced ahead of the new Constitution,  then  the

responsibility for delaying the general elections should

rest  with this Assembly, and the Government should  not

be  blamed for postponing it. Under these circumstances,

the  date  of  coming into force of the new Constitution

will  have  to  be  synchronised with the  date  of  the

general elections."



<br><br>That  is  putting very neatly and ambiguously the  truth

that  if  you  want  this, you  will  have  to  postpone

merdeka, or at least what we thought was merdeka, now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then last of all. Sir, he said at column 1487:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that will come the preparation of the electoral

rolls.   But   before  these  can   be   prepared,   the

delimitation  of  boundaries has to  be  considered.  In

this,  I  think  we  would like  to  have  an  all-party

committee on the job as soon as possible."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



That  is  rather  interesting  because  the  Chief

Minister  knows and Party leaders know that  there

is a committee on delimitation of boundaries, that

the  committee has sat, Sir, and the committee has

made  its report for 51 divisions. Now, why is  it

necessary to have a new committee with members  of

the different Parties sitting on it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are told that there is suddenly

heartburning desire on the part of all Parties  to

see  that the 270,000 domiciled aliens should  get

citizenship and should vote. First, let us look at

the  principle. Even if it is true for  a  moment,

Sir, the principle enunciated is this and it is  a

very communal principle too, that 1,200,000 of the

population  of  Singapore  should  not  enjoy  any

improvement in their constitutional status for  an

indefinite period until a minority has achieved  a

right  to  vote  it is a sort of dog-in-the-manger

attitude:  'Whilst I cannot get it, you  will  not

get  it.'  But,  Sir, let us look  at  the  Rendel

Constitution.  Did  not the  Rendel  Constitution,

which  did not give the citizenship rights to  our

Chinese  domiciled aliens, benefit them by  giving

an  opportunity to their fellow human beings  (the

people  of  Singapore) to make their voice  heard?

Would   not   the   new  constitution   with   its

improvements of some kind be also to the advantage

of those who have not got the right to vote today?

Why   should   we   all  be  deprived   of   these

improvements  for  an indefinite period?  "Because

they  must  have the honour and the  privilege  of

being  the  first to vote," but, Sir, it  is  very

interesting to see this sudden earnest  desire  on

the  part  of  the Parties concerned to  give  the

citizenship  vote  or rights  to  these  domiciled

aliens.  I think you remember, Sir, that as  early

as I think June of 1955, some two years ago, there

were  all-community meetings  which  I  called  at

which I sought to obtain agreement on the need  to

grant  citizenship rights to our domiciled  aliens

but  U.M.N.O. and the P.A.P. strenuously  resisted

on  the ground that I would be creating two  types

of  citizens: one which was a British subject with

a  right to vote, and one a Singapore citizen with

a  right  to vote but an inferior citizen carrying

no national status. That was blocked. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



were  afraid  that if we passed it and  sacrificed

U.M.N.O.'s  part  in  the Coalition  we  would  be

vetoed by His Excellency the Governor. We went on,

Sir, to see Mr Lennox-Boyd in August 1955 on  the

subject.  We  pleaded with him then.  We  went  in

December,  Sir, to plead with him on  the  subject

and  I think it is pertinent to read a passage  as

to how this House took those citizenship proposals

which  it  is  now suggested are so  vital.  I  am

reading,   Sir,  from  the  proceedings   of   8th

February, 1956, at column 1419:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr Lim Choon Mong-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister if

he   will   state  how  far  the  Government   has

progressed  towards the definition of a  Singapore

citizen; and whether he will make a statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, my hon. Friend is aware

that  a Bill has been drafted embodying the  views

of  the Labour Front Members of the Government  on

this  question of granting citizenship  rights  to

our domiciled non-British communities."



<br><br>Then,  Sir,  I read from column 1441.  This  is  a

statement,  Sir, by me on 8th February,  1956,  as

regards our talk in London:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An important matter that was raised during the

talks  concerned  the question of citizenship  for

Singapore, it was represented by me and some of my

colleagues to the Secretary of State that, in  the

light of the comments he made in Singapore, it was

vital  that we should know whether the Citizenship

Bill   which   the  Labour  Front  Ministers   had

prepared, of which he was given a copy, would,  if

passed, be disallowed under the provisions of  the

Royal Letters of Instruction...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and colleague the Hon. the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing (Inche  Abdul

Hamid  bin  Haji  Jumat) made  it  clear  that  he

opposed   the   Bill,  that  his  colleagues   and

considerable  sections  of  the  population  drawn

along racial lines were opposed to the question of

two types of citizenship - one, a Singapore citizen,

and the other a British national. In the course of

the discussion that ensued, Sir, it was made quite

clear  by my hon. Friend on his own behalf and  on

behalf  of  U.M.N.O., and he assured  me  that  we

would  have the support of the people  he  had  in

mind who objected to the Citizenship Bill, that if

at   the   constitutional  conference   in   April

Singapore did achieve the status of an independent

territory  within the Commonwealth and could  then

create a single Singapore citizenship, he and  his

colleagues  would fully support a Bill to  provide

for a single Singapore citizenship, comprising all

true Malayans, both the British subjects domiciled

in  Singapore  and  the long domiciled  aliens  in

Singapore,  subject only to the conditions  of  an

oath  of  loyalty and an oath abjuring  any  other

national loyalty. Sir, in these circumstances, and

particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



realising during the course of the discussion that I was

placing  the  Secretary of State for the Colonies  in  a

very  invidious position of indicating whether he  would

waive in advance the rights of Her Majesty in Council in

respect  of  legislation coming under the provisions  of

Section  7 (1) of the Royal Letters of Instruction,  and

rather  than  embark  upon  a Bill  which  would  divide

Singapore, I decided that it would be preferable to wait

for  a  matter  of six months until the results  of  the

constitutional conference were known...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have it there that these citizenship

proposals  were already in a draft Bill, that  the  Bill

had  been  handed  to the Secretary  of  State  for  the

Colonies,  that the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon

Mong)  was aware of its contents, as in fact he was  (he

had a copy) and yet it was objected to. We failed at the

constitutional  talks and we could not create  a  single

citizenship  but  nobody  ever  raised  thereafter   the

question of granting citizenship rights to these people.

Now,  it  is  said that we must give them  these  rights

before we hold elections but what is this citizenship we

are  offering  them?  Is  it the  citizenship  that  was

rejected  by U.M.N.O. and P.A.P. in 1955? What  is  this

citizenship?  Not a word about it by the Chief  Minister

in  explanation! Is it, in fact, to give  Singapore  two

types  of subjects: one, a British subject with a  right

to  vote,  and one, a Singapore citizen with a right  to

vole which was what was intended by the last one because

we could not compel the British Government as we were  a

colony to give us any real dominion status? There is  no

answer  to that. Sir - no clarification at all - but  it  is

now  known in this document, Sir, the report at page  15

in  paragraphs 53 and 54 that our delegation  has  asked

for  the postponement of the implementation of this  new

constitution and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"54. It was the view of the Singapore Delegation that

elections  under  the  extended  franchise  which  would

result  from  their citizenship proposals set  forth  in

paragraph 50 must precede the coming into force  of  the

new Constitution. We therefore agreed that an exact date

for  the introduction of the new Constitution could  not

be  determined... It was agreed that the date  should  be

fixed  by  the  Governor after he was  satisfied,  after

considering  an  address from the Legislative  Assembly,

that  a  reasonable  period  for  the  registration,  as

provided  in  paragraph 50 of this  Report,  of  persons

eligible for Singapore citizenship had elapsed."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



Now, let us see what it means. It means that not all the

organisation  of  the Colonial Office and  not  all  the

organisation of the Singapore Government could ascertain

what was the period necessary to give an opportunity for

registration.  Do you believe this, Sir? Do  you  really

believe  that  it is beyond the powers and abilities  of

the Members of our Government and their staff and of the

Colonial Office and its staff to assess, with reasonable

accuracy,  how  long it would take for  this  period  to

elapse  of  giving  an  opportunity  to  the  people  to

register themselves? I do not believe it, Sir. Then look

at this other aspect of it and see how this disbelief is

confirmed. The period of implementation is not entrusted

to  this  Assembly. We who want and who asked  for  this

postponement  to give the rights to our people  to  vote

are not entrusted with saying when they are to have this

full  opportunity. All we can do is to present a  humble

address  to His Excellency the Governor and he  must  be

satisfied  in his discretion that, in fact, such  period

has  come.  Now,  Sir, why? Is this Assembly  afraid  of

itself?  Is  the  delegation afraid  that  it  might  be

stampeded  into  an earlier date by public  demand?  The

delegation insults the Assembly by refusing  us  even  a

sense of reasonableness and justice in implementing this

provision but refers to trust a colonial official.  This

is  how  the  Assembly and the people of  Singapore  are

treated  by  our delegation! So now we have  it:  it  is

agreed  by  all Parties that it is vital that we  should

have no improvements in our status until there is a  new

election. But, Sir, there are two ways of looking at it.

One   way   would  have  been  to  implement   the   new

constitution  since  they  are  so  satisfied  with   it

themselves rightaway. They know full well, according  to

the  Chief Minister in his Press interview, he  said  18

months  for implementation but, I think, and  time  will

prove  me  right, that it will take two years  before  a

full  opportunity is given for these people to vote.  We

could  have  had, Sir, the new constitution  implemented

rightaway  say, in July, for two years and therefore  we

could have the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



electorate  so that they are deprived  of  nothing

but  it is objected that nobody wants to stand for

election for two years. Well now, Sir, I have made

this  other  suggestion which is now contained  in

the  amendment I intend to move and let me clarify

it. We have an identity card register in Singapore

and all those who registered ten years ago or more

can  be  easily  traced. I, for example,  hold  an

identity  card of 1946, I think. [Interruption]  I

am  going  to have a look at it. Yes, 1948.  Well,

Sir,  that gives us nine years. We have a register

indicating   who  were  the  people  resident   in

Singapore  nine years ago. There will  be  nothing

easier  than  to  take  from  that  register   and

transfer  to the electoral roll the names  of  the

persons who are not on the electoral roll but  who

are  still in Singapore. It is a matter of  a  few

days'  work.  And  so if you want  to  give  these

domiciled  aliens the right to vote at  the  first

election,  if you really have faith  in  this  new

constitution and if you really want a new election

and  do  not want to stay in office, Sir,  we  can

amend  ourselves  our  own Election  Ordinance  in

order  to provide that those on the identity  card

register in 1948 shall be eligible to vote at  the

first  election. I say first election only because

after that it is, I think, proper that they should

take out citizenship papers in accordance with the

provisions  of the constitution but at least  they

will  be  given  the right to vote at  that  first

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think - at least it is my view - that on this

amendment,   there  will  be  many   excuses   for

attacking  it,  excuses which are not  reasons  at

all, for reasons which will not be made obvious to

this  House  but  which this  House  must  try  to

understand  between  the  lines.  Basically,   the

reasons  are  fear and political  manoeuvring  but

principally a fear and lack of faith in the people

of  Singapore  and in the power  of  democracy  to

maintain  itself  and to attract  loyalty  without

Machiavelian manoeuvres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next objection - the last one I

indicated - is  the question of the Head  of  State.

Last  year,  we provided, Sir, in Sessional  Paper

No. Cmd. 31 of 1956, at Annexure G, page 43:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Representative of Her Majesty in Singapore

shall be a Governor-General to be appointed for  a

period of 5 years by Her Majesty on the advice  of

the Government of Singapore."



<br><br>Now,  that  is the important part, gentlemen:  "on

the advice of the Government of Singapore", and  I

think  you  have it repeated here. The  intention,

Sir, was to have a person acceptable to all of  us

who  could  rouse  and coalesce a  common  loyalty

amongst  the  various races. This year's  mandate,

Sir, is to be found in the Report of the All-Party

Conference at page 3 (Sessional Paper No. Misc.  1

of 1957):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty's Representative shall be a

Malayan...".



<br><br>And also in the debate on 5th March in column 1458

in which the Chief Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are pressing for a Malayan Governor-General...".



<br><br>Now, Sir, what has been agreed? If you look at the

present Report before you, Sir, at pages 4,  5,  7

and 10, you will find at page 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . that the office of Governor should be

abolished,  and  that  a  Malayan-born   personage

should   be  appointed  to  act  as  the   Queen's

representative in Singapore...".



<br><br>Now, Sir, in paragraph 17 (ii), it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara should be appointed

by  the  Queen  on  the advice  of  Her  Majesty's

Government . . . Her Majesty's Government would  .

.  . consult the Singapore Government  concerning

the  individual  to be appointed,  who  should  be

Malayan born."



<br><br>Now, there is a vast difference between "acting on

the  advice"  and  "acting  on  the  advice  after

consultation with". We have had all this  thrashed

out  and  you  know the trouble we had  in  August

1955. In essence, it means that only Her Majesty's

Government - that is to say, the British Government:

in  fact, the Colonial Office - has the absolute say

as to who is to be our Head of State. This Head of

State  it will need in order to enforce by  decree

the decisions of the Internal Security Council. He

is  there  too for another purpose. He  also  must

enforce  by  decree the decisions  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Council. There again, he  is  there

too.  I  ask you, Sir, whether you really  believe

for a single moment that the Colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



Office  would appoint an Asian acceptable  to  the

people to this post or whether it would, in  fact,

appoint either a Malayan-born Englishman which  it

has  every right to do under this paragraph,  such

as  the President of the European Association - this

non-political   organisation   which   has    been

indulging  in such mischievous representations  to

undermine   our  efforts  to  obtain   independent

status? Why should it not appoint him? He was born

in  Singapore or it could appoint somebody who  is

deeply  imbued  with the imperialist,  colonialist

concept who is a good trusted capitalist - and there

are  many  of  them who are Asians who  have  done

extremely well under the colonial system  and  who

would  be very happy to take over as the Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara  and  to  enforce  the   Colonial

Office's will. I know that the Chief Minister  has

said,  "We  must  have faith in the  goodwill  and

honesty of the people with whom we deal." Goodwill

and  honesty of the Colonial Office fall ill  from

the  lips  of  a  representative of  the  colonial

people  but  let  us  ask ourselves  if  there  is

goodwill  and honesty in the Colonial Office?  Why

could  they  not entrust the Singapore  Government

with making the recommendation to Her Majesty? Why

should  he be appointed not at the request of  the

Singapore  Government but at the  request  of  the

British     Government - a    British     Government

appointment  in respect of a British colony?  That

is logical and we can understand it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to a very comic aspect of this

motion   before  the  House:  a  thing   that   is

completely minor and is virtually unimportant  but

it  has been blown up and blown up and blown up in

order   to  obscure  the  grave  defects  of   the

constitution  before  us  and  now  I   refer   to

paragraph 30 of the Report which bans subversives.

You  are  told  in this motion before  the  House - which you notice I have left untouched because, in

principle,  I  agree  that the British  Government

should not interfere internally, though as regards

the question of banning subversives I consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



it    a   normal,   intelligent   and   reasonable

precaution:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) approves the stand of the All-Party

Delegation  in  not accepting the  condition

stipulated in paragraph 30 of the Report."



<br><br>If  you  look at paragraph 12, as I said  earlier,

Sir, you will read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrangements upon which we have agreed are

set out in the following sections of this Report."



<br><br>So,  paragraph  30  is  one of  those  agreed.  In

paragraph  30, Sir, it is said that the  Singapore

delegation   does   not   accept   Her   Majesty's

Government's proposals and it takes note with deep

regret of Her Majesty's intention and then at  the

end  of  it,  it  is signed and I understand  that

there  is  a nice film of the signing by the  hon.

Members - it  seems that I must not  read  names - but

you  know  the names of the delegation. Now,  Sir,

what  would you think of an agreement with a clerk

in  which you say to him, "You shall work  on  the

following days: Christmas Day and Easter  Friday,"

and he were to add to that contract: "The party of

the  second  part does not accept this clause  and

notes it with regret," but he signs the agreement?

Is  the agreement valid or is it not valid?  Look,

let  us  be frank about it. Was this item  on  the

agenda?   Could  not  a  single  member   of   the

delegation  have said, "How dare  you,  Sir?  This

item  is not on the agenda and we will not discuss

it."  Could  nobody have said, "Look,  this  is  a

pretty  dirty trick, interfering in minor internal

matters.  We will not sign it." We are  told  that

the  Rt.  Hon. the  Secretary of  State  for  the

Colonies  introduced this at the very last  moment

and  you  are  asked  to believe,  Sir,  that  the

Secretary  of State for the Colonies was  prepared

to  jeopardise an agreement reached with Singapore

for  this  one  petty paragraph. We are  asked  to

believe  that  and that Singapore  protested  with

weeping,  wailing and gnashing of teeth  but  they

accepted  it. We are asked to believe that  nobody

could stand up and say, "We will not discuss  what

is  not  on the agenda. We will not accept  this,"

and called his bluff. We are asked to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



believe  that the British Government seeks - instead

of  using  its powers under the Internal  Security

Council  that  it  has, Sir, if it  really  wanted

it - to   put  in  the  constitution  this  ban   on

subversives.  Sir, I am irresistibly  reminded  of

the  story  I told you yesterday of how  Sir  John

Nicoll told us to go ahead and be popular with our

"mobs"  and  say that it is the big bad  Sir  John

Nicoll  who  has imposed the Emergency Regulations

and  we  did  not want it. I ask you  to  consider

whether  in this respect it was true that the  Rt.

Hon.  Alan Lennox-Boyd is the villain of the piece

or   is  he  acting  as  the  indulgent  host   to

skittering  mice  who  are taking  hospitality  a-hiding in his coat-tails. Sir, we are told - by  the

Liberal-Socialists too - that this  clause  is  very

undemocratic. Now, Sir, it has been said that I am

in  favour of this paragraph 30. I am in favour of

the   principle   of   banning  subversives   from

elections but I am not in favour of this paragraph

30. I would like to make my position clear, Sir. I

am not correcting anything I said in my very first

letter  on  the 12th of April to the President  of

the  Labour  Front Party, who is the Minister  for

Education  (Mr Chew Swee Kee) -in  fact,  on  the

very day that we learned the details, I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am ashamed that the Singapore Mission should

have  declared  its opposition to the  banning  of

known  subversives from standing for  election  on

the  ground  that this is a departure from  normal

democratic practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the British Government has no right

to impose its will in this matter on the people of

Singapore but it seems to me that it is  the  duty

of  the Singapore Government for the protection of

its  people  and of the democratic principle  that

this  provision  should be  included  in  any  new

election  Bill.  I deny the thesis that  democracy

includes the right to commit suicide. The right to

live does not include the right to die. No man has

a right to kill himself."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to be long. If three of our

judges  tell  me  that a man is  a  Communist,  or

working  for Communists, Sir, then it is my  duty,

for  the  sake  of the welfare of  the  people  of

Singapore, to prevent that man from spreading  his

poison. I know it is unpopular. Sir, we must  have

faith  somewhere. I do not have faith in our Chief

Secretary. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



do  not have faith in our police force; but I have

worked  for  20 years and more - and worked  with  a

critical  eye - with our judges, and I say  to  you,

Sir, that their traditions of integrity (and I  do

not  mean only our High Court Judges) are a  thing

of  beauty. They make mistakes, Sir, but they  are

honest. I have faith in them, and if three  judges

tell  me  this  man  seeks the  overthrow  of  the

Constitution  by  acts  of  violence  or  acts  of

dishonesty,  and  is a subversive,  this  is  good

enough for me. Sir, I would remind you that, under

our  present  elections law, we prevent  bankrupts

from  standing  for  nomination,  and  we  prevent

persons in prison from voting - we prevent all sorts

of  people from voting. Why should we not  prevent

from standing for election a person who, three  of

our  judges say, is a man who seeks to destroy the

democratic way of life we seek to establish?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that Members of the Opposition are

more  impressed by arguments that come from Peking

than  arguments that come from anywhere else,  and

if  you  will bear with me, I would say  that  the

best  argument I have heard in favour  of  banning

subversives   was  an  argument  that   I   heard,

ironically enough, in Peking. We were there,  Sir,

at  the  time when the Government of West  Germany

banned  the  Communist Party in West Germany,  and

the   newspapers   in   China,   Sir - and   I   had

translations of many of them daily - were in violent

outcry  against the undemocratic West Germans  for

banning the Communist Party and preventing it from

taking  part  in elections. So I said  to  a  very

senior  member of the Chinese Government; I  said.

"Look,   you  keep  saying  that  this   is   very

undemocratic, but supposing a Chinese who believed

in  parliamentary democracy were to come here  and

seek to establish a party - would you let him?"  And

he  said,  "But, Mr Marshall, you have  read  our

Constitution?"  I said, "Indeed, I  have."  "Well,

you  know,"  he  said,  "our  Constitution  is   a

democratic  dictatorship" - and, in fact,  Sir,  the

first  line  of  that Constitution  is  "that  the

Government of the People's Republic of China is  a

democratic dictatorship of the peasant and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



worker."  I  said,  "Yes,  I  know  that  it  is  a

democratic dictatorship. So what?" "Well," he said,

"if   anybody   seeks  to  establish  parliamentary

democracy, that is counter-revolutionary!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair enough. So, Sir, in a democratic

dictatorship,  you  can only  propagate  democratic

dictatorship.  Now  I say, Sir,  surely  the  logic

applies  also  that, in a democracy,  you  are  not

permitted to propagate anti-democracy; that freedom

does  not  mean you can pour poison into our  water

supply.  So,  Sir, I say, I will keep  maintaining,

however  unpopular that may be, that no responsible

government in this country which finds it necessary

to  put  a  man  in gaol because he is  subversive,

should  refrain from forbidding him  from  standing

for  election.  I  ask  you,  Sir,  which  is  more

undemocratic,  that  or to deprive  a  man  of  his

freedom of movement, to deprive him of his wife and

children, to deprive him of his employment and  his

normal  activities, to put him  in  the  democratic

Changi Gaol for his health? Is that democratic?  Is

that  less undemocratic than merely forbidding  him

to  stand for election? Only once in four years  in

the  normal  course,  Sir, does  a  man  stand  for

election:  once in four years. But to  put  him  in

gaol  is to deprive him for 24 hours every  day  of

the  freedom  of  movement  and  activities  of   a

citizen. Which is the more undemocratic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Chief Minister if he thinks it

undemocratic to forbid the Member for  Bukit  Timah

and  Mr Devan Nair from standing for election?  Is

it  more democratic to put them in gaol? If  it  is

undemocratic  to  prevent them  from  standing  for

election,  does he want them to stand for  election

in  Changi Gaol? Is that the Chief Minister's  idea

of  a  fair election, or is he going to be  logical

and  repeal  the  Preservation of  Public  Security

Ordinance and release these men he himself has  put

in  the  democratic Changi Gaol?  Is  he  going  to

release  them? It is undemocratic to  prevent  them

from  standing for election; surely then it is more

undemocratic to put them in gaol? If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



he  wants  them  to  stand for  election,  will  he

release them? Am I deemed unfair in asking a  chief

minister and a politician to be logical?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. says this is very undemocratic,

very  undemocratic. Ha! What has the  P.A.P. done,

Sir, to seek to release these subversives from gaol

and  to permit them to stand for election or pursue

normal  activities? I have not seen a single motion

from  the P.A.P. seeking to repeal the Preservation

of  Public Security Ordinance. Of course,  they  do

not  want to repeal it; of course they do not  want

those  men  out  of  gaol. The struggle  for  power

between  the right and left wings of the P.A.P. is

notorious. If the left wing comes out of gaol,  the

right  wing goes out of the window! I do  not  mind

that  struggle, Sir, so long as we are not involved

in  putting our hands to a manoeuvre that is, to my

mind, Sir, below the dignity and the proper conduct

of a Member of the Assembly and a representative of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., it is notorious, is extremely anxious

to deprive its left wing of the very people whom it

pretends to befriend. We kiss Devan Nair,  we  kiss

Devan Nair on both cheeks, and wait for Lennox-Boyd

to  hang  him  from the back! - that  is  the  P.A.P.

stand,  and that is the only explanation consistent

with the action taken in London. To suggest that  a

Minister  of Her Britannic Majesty's Government  is

going to meddle in this petty little thing and risk

a   whole   agreement  is  asking  more,  Sir,   of

credibility  than even the people of Singapore  can

stand, however eloquent the advocates of the P.A.P.

may  be.  I  would have preferred it, Sir,  if  the

P.A.P., or any Member of the Government or  of  the

Opposition,  were  to come straight  out  and  say,

"Those  who  have appealed against their  detention

and  whose  appeals have been dismissed, and  those

who  refuse  to  appeal  against  their  detention,

should  be  banned from standing for election,  and

should  be  banned from voting."  I  consider  that

democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amusing to see how this Merdeka Delegation,

Sir, has come under the influence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



of the double-talk of the Secretary of the

P.A.P.;  even the leader of the Liberal-Socialists

has  come  back  saying,  "Ah!  Let  us  have  the

Communists  fight us openly. We will give  them  a

good   licking."  It  reminds  me,  Sir,  of   the

advertisement  for  Tolley's Brandy,  of  a  mouse

which  has taken a few drops spilt from the bottle

and says, "Where'sh that cat?" [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been rather patient with

Please instruct accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I  am  very  unhappy  at  this  wording   of

paragraph 2 of the motion which seeks to save  the

face  of  the  Merdeka Mission. I had intended  to

amend it to say we regret to note that the Merdeka

Delegation   has   signed  a   Report   containing

paragraph 30, but my friend the Member for Changi,

who,  I  hope, is going to second this  amendment,

tells  me  that it is unnecessary to make  enemies

and we should strive and obtain some support for a

motion  that is necessary for the welfare  of  the

people. I therefore move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we leave out all words after "(1)" to the

end  of line 4, and insert "regretfully takes note

of  the  Report  of  the Singapore  Constitutional

Conference held in London in March and April 1957,

as  contained in Sessional Paper No.  Misc.  2  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approves the stand of the All-Party Delegation in

<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   yesterday  we  were  regaled  by  the   ex-Honourable  the  Chief Minister with  an  orgy  of

reminiscences. Today, I think he understands  that

when  serious charges of double-crossing,  charges

that  we  have  cheated the people,  most  of  the

people, most of the time, that we are climbing  on

the  backs  of  the  people to  power,  when  such

charges are made against the People's Action Party

and  not  just the Member for Tanjong Pagar - graver

issues have been raised. I do not wish to join him

in  his less honourable methods of attack. I  have

nothing  to say against him and his personal  life

though he had chosen yesterday to say a few things

not only of me but also of my wife.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Wife?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My family. "Oxford educated", he

said;  he is wrong - we are not Oxford-educated,  we

were  in  Cambridge, and, as imperial universities

go,  one of the best two. He said that we are,  or

were, fashionable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



nationalists, that now we have become  fashionable

collaborators of the colonialists. He said  a  lot

of  other  hard things and they will be tested  in

Tanjong  Pagar.  I  did not have  the  opportunity

yesterday  evening  to  tell  this  House  of   my

intentions, my Party's intentions, to  have  those

charges,  made so blithely and so freely  in  this

Chamber,  put before the voters in Tanjong  Pagar,

one   of   the   most  proletarian  divisions   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues are quite simple. The ex-Honourable

the Chief Minister has said that this Constitution

is  a fraud and that the P.A.P. was a party to the

fraud.  We shall prove that it is not a  fraud  on

the  people  of  Singapore. The ex-Honourable  the

Chief  Minister  said that this ban  is  good;  he

supports it in principle. He says that the  P.A.P.

is   just   making  a  noise  about  it,  shedding

crocodile tears. He can prove it again in  Tanjong

Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not waffling wobblers, Sir. We mean what

we  say.  Further, we never let our friends  down,

nor   do  we  stab  them  in  the  back,  whatever

differences there may have been. When the ex-Chief

Minister  condemned his Chief  Secretary  and  the

police force he may have been letting out official

secret information. But I am not giving him any of

my  inner  Party secrets. They were colleagues  of

mine and my Executive Committee, and my Party will

never  take  office as long as they are  in  gaol,

whatever our differences. If the ex-Chief Minister

understands  Asian standards of conduct,  he  will

understand that the P.A.P. can never say, like  he

has  said  of  his former colleague,  "This  great

Malayan,  Mr  Francis Thomas", and now  denigrate

him and all his former colleagues. That is not the

sort of thing we do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the theme was, "Do you remember, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, do you remember those halcyon  days

when  I  was king, and all the glorious  things  I

did?"  The theme should have been, "Can we forget,

can   we  forget  the  shameful,  the  humiliating

conduct  of  a  man  who was  entrusted  with  the

welfare of a people, a man who only yesterday said

he  would  have us made into a country  under  the

trusteeship of the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



Nations,  or with the headquarters of  the  United

Nations on it?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many of us, yesterday was a sad and solemn

day. We have all learnt in our two years what  all

this  is  about: but some political  babies  never

grow  up. This is a three-cornered fight - I repeat,

a  three-cornered fight - between the  British,  the

Communists and the Nationalists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Where are they?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The ex-Chief Minister has read

a  series of articles written by one Mr J. Lam in

the Suara Merdeka, a series of five articles which

set  out  an  analysis  of the  situation.  I  was

interested  to  read a letter which was  published

under  his name commending that analysis. Does  he

really imagine that a nationalist will collaborate

with   the  Colonial  Office?  Sir,  to  me,   the

Secretary  of  State  is  to  this  very  day  the

Secretary   of   State,  despite   Her   Majesty's

Government's   hospitality   to   two    Singapore

delegations.  I have never called  him,  "My  dear

Alan".  I  quote.  "30 Queen's House,  St.  James'

Court - 17th   May,   1956 - My   dear   Alan - Yours

sincerely, David Marshall". Says Alan Lennox-Boyd,

"My  dear  David - Yours sincerely, Alan". "My  dear

Alan - Yours  sincerely.  David".  "My  dear  David - Yours   ever,  John  Hare".  "My  dear  John - Yours

sincerely.  David". Sir, in these  little  things,

one discloses one's subconscious attitudes. But I,

I  hate  the British colonial system, and  I  will

hate  it  to my dying day! I do not make political

friends  of  those whom I consider  my  implacable

enemies.  In this triangular fight, my duty  as  a

nationalist is to see that an independent, united,

democratic,  non-Communist Malaya  survives!  When

the Member for Cairnhill understands this, he will

understand  the consistency of every move  of  the

P.A.P.  Then he will understand why we do what  we

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told that we sold the people of

Singapore when we signed that Report. Sir, I  know

the  Member for Cairnhill has a flair for  turning

this  Assembly into a court of law.  He  has  once

told  us that "may" means "must" and lots of other

things  besides  when  he was in  "constitutional"

difficulties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



Today,  he  is telling us that a report  means  an

agreement,  that  because paragraph  12  says  the

agreements are set out in the Report, therefore it

is  an agreement. There cannot be an agreement  to

agree and as a lawyer, he knows that! When we  say

under paragraph 30 that we disagree, it means  the

whole position is open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did we not refuse to sign the Report and

come back in anger?", he asks. Sir, let us have a

flash-back to Tuesday, 15th May, 1956.  There  are

eleven other Members in this House, besides the ex-Chief Minister and myself, who can bear witness to

what I said, to what I am saying now. I urged  the

ex-Chief  Minister:  "Go  back  to  the  Assembly,

debate  the  matter  and then  take  it  one  step

further;  do not just break up the talks there  on

your  initiative. Go back, sort it  out  with  the

Parties, decide the line, the correct policy." But

no.  For  him  the great drama, the Press  of  the

world  was  outside 10 Carlton House  Terrace.  He

flew  off  into  a rage. As loyal Members  of  the

delegation, we watched his rage in silence, but we

supported him by remaining quiet. He went over  to

No. 11 Carlton House Terrace. The world Press,  TV

and  radio were there; and he said, "This  is  the

saddest  moment  of my life. I am bankrupt;  I  am

finished."  And the TV man said, "Say that  again,

Mr Marshall" - he had missed it the first time. The

error  having  been made, we were prepared  to  go

through  with  it, to come back  to  a  much  more

militant  situation  with  a  possibility  of   an

organised clash with the colonial power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, we discovered - and it was

not  just I who made the discovery - that the Member

for  Cairnhill was not made of sterner stuff.  Was

it we who had no guts to go through with it? There

are  eleven silent witnesses in this Assembly  who

were  members of that delegation; there  were  two

others  who  were on study courses,  also  elected

Members,  present in London. Who  was  responsible

for that debacle?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want reminiscences, we shall have them

galore.  And I think I am duty bound, in  view  of

the electioneering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



nature of the ex-Chief Minister's speech yesterday

and  today,  to wash some dirty linen  in  public,

though  not his personal dirty linen.  I  have  no

skeletons in my cupboard. My private life can bear

closer   scrutiny  than  the  jibes  of  the   ex-Honourable the Chief Minister. I quote,  not  from

his   private   doings,  but   from   his   public

statements. He, more than any other Member in this

House, has made - and consistently made-, statements

which  contradict  whatever he  has  said  before.

Yesterday,   he   said - with   the   elections   in

mind - "Those  Chinese students  are  made  of  pure

gold!", relating the Kallang Rally incidents.  But

what  did he say at the time of the Kallang rally?

He  has a short memory, but we have not. We always

remember  what  has  gone before,  and  we  always

follow up what has gone before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19th March, the day after that memorable

occasion.  The  slimy English  language  Press  to

which he lent himself had this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riot at Kallang Rally; 50 hurt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says the P.A.P. Secretary, Mr Lee Kuan Yew:

'This meeting has been spoiled by gangsters.'"



<br><br>Said the police in a midnight interview:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A police spokesman said that the rioting was an

organised Communist demonstration. This, he  said,

was  proved  by  the Communist  songs  and  dances

performed by Chinese school boys and girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night Mr Marshall said he was distressed.

He  said, 'We know the enemy within our midst.  We

know  we  have  quite a few Communists  and  their

technique for climbing on the bandwagons of decent

movements   and  twisting  them  for  their   evil

purposes.  It  is  quite  notorious.  It  is  most

unfortunate  that  the wonderful  spirit  and  the

tremendous  friendly throng should  be  marred  by

vicious organised destructive elements.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be consistent. 20th March:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marshall pledges: 'I'll crush 'em. Yanko youths

are  not  true  decent people  of  Singapore.  The

Merdeka  riot at Kallang Airport on Sunday spurred

the  Singapore  Government on to an all-out  drive

against the Communists and Communism.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Chief Minister, Mr David

Marshall, asked the police for a full report  into

the  disorders. He said, 'I intend  crushing  them

before they get me.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has a persecution complex. The ex-Chief

Minister said that people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



are  always  getting at him. They always  want  to

torment him. I am told that in medical language it

is paranoia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Marshall said he would not hesitate to act.

He  said,  'Singapore  does  not  want  any  yanko

merdeka. We want to end colonialism...'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes sickening reading. Let us be consistent.

What  are  we  fighting for? What are  we  talking

about?  Or  are  we just living  for  the  moment,

hoping to get support for the moment? Have  we  no

principles? Do we not believe in this  one  united

democratic,  non-Communist Malaya? I  could  quote

him  ad nauseam. I do not propose to quote him  ad

nauseam, but I propose to go a fair length of  the

way.  He  and his Minister for Labour, the present

Chief  Minister - I am sorry for the both  of  them,

because we knew, as the ex-Chief Minister did not,

that  whoever  assumes  office  under  the  Rendel

Constitution  is  dead, because we  denounced  and

killed the constitution before it came into force.

The ex-Chief Minister thought otherwise. Now he is

trying  to  climb on the bandwagon  of  those  who

denounced him and is denouncing the present  Chief

Minister, his ex-Labour Minister. But let me quote

what  he  said  on 6th November,  1956,  from  the

Official Report, col. 506:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe the Chief Minister is the best man we

have today to bring home a decent constitution for

Singapore within the shortest possible time."



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I believed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes. The Member for Cairnhill

said that in the Assembly. He is a man whose whole

life  is a series of "I believe in wishing wells."

He  believed  yesterday that he could  make  these

scandalous charges against my Party officials  and

my  Party and get away with it. My Party Treasurer

is  not  a  Member of this Assembly and could  not

reply  to  him.  He will reply to the  Member  for

Cairnhill  in Tanjong Pagar. We never run  from  a

fight.  We  do  not go to Borneo  or  Batu  Pahat,

because  we  believe that he who fights  and  runs

away, lives to run away another day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us deal with the charges against this

Report. Says the ex-Chief Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



in  his letter of the 12th of April published

in all the Press:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) The Report indicates that the new

constitution will not be brought into force in all

probability  for two years or more,  during  which

time we will continue under colonial rule."



<br><br>Does  he  not  understand what it means - that  now,

because   he   has  stepped  out  of   the   Chief

Ministership, it is colonial rule; because he  had

said  when he was the Chief Minister that  it  was

not  colonial  rule.  Contradiction  one.  Has  he

forgotten those headlines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Your Government. We the people."</b>



<br><br>Does  he admit that for one year he carried on  as

the  stooge of the colonial administration, as  an

adjunct  of  the Colonial Office? We said  it  was

colonial rule. We never took office. He offered us

everything under the sun - and this is no  official

secret - he offered to make some of us Ministers for

Education; at one time he even thought  of  making

us Chief Secretaries. And now he says, "If we have

this  new  constitution, there will be an  end  to

colonial  rule."  That is the implication  of  the

words    "postponement   of   elections   prolongs

colonialism." If this second constitution which is

now  being proposed is colonial rule, then how can

its  implementation end it? Contradiction two. One

has  to  be  logical. If we say  today  that  this

Report  is against the interests of the people  of

Singapore,  not  only paragraph 30 on  subversion,

but  the  whole  Report, then there  is  only  one

decent  thing to do: to be logical we must  reject

the  whole Report and say, "No, we start all  over

again." This would be the only stand. One  has  to

be consistent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, says the ex-Chief Minister, "Why postpone

the  elections?" Sir, when he went  to  London  in

April  last  year to open the talks, the  deadline

for  the  new elections under the new constitution

was April this year - one year, because he knew, and

he   convinced  us  on  the  delegation,  that  it

required  one year to implement it. There  are  11

silent  witnesses in this Assembly.  He  ought  to

know  that  unless a miracle has happened  to  the

machinery  of  the  Singapore Government  and  the

machinery of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



British  Government, this constitution  cannot  be

brought  into  effect before the 1st  of  January,

1958.  Knowing  it,  he  now  says  we  can   hold

elections  in  July. There is only one  consistent

theme:  how to get a quick election, how  to  make

another bid for power. Oh for the glorious halcyon

days now past!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New ideas - every day he had a new idea in London.

We  know that. He has got a new idea now. But  the

trouble  with all his new ideas is that  they  are

never tested before they are put forward. He says,

"All  we  need  to  do is to amend  our  Elections

Ordinance,  look  up the identity cards,  register

everybody  who was resident here for  ten  years."

And he discovers, lo and behold, that his identity

card  did  not  begin till 1948, a fact  that  had

crossed  our mind when we read his amendment.  But

we were not consulted on this and we were under no

duty to point out the error of his ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he says, on the spur of the moment, another

new  idea, "Well, since it started in 1948 let  us

change  our citizenship laws and say nine  years."

Registration started in October, Sir, and not more

than 20 per cent would have registered before  the

end of 1948. Does he want to amend now and say let

all  those  who own identity cards, registered  in

1949,  go on the register? Do we want to improvise

as we go along or do we stand on principle?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the principle that the P.A.P. stands on.

We  did not tell the people last year, as the Hon.

the ex-Chief Minister did, "This is the end of the

road. When I get this, this is Merdeka." That  was

what  he did, although he knew it was not merdeka.

His  trick formula to produce a trick result which

he,  and only he wanted, was "100 per cent merdeka

to  me;  25 per cent external affairs and  defence

back  to  you. I am independent. This is a permanent

state   of   affairs.  I  can  attend  the   Prime

Ministers'  conference. I can  go  to  the  United

Nations."  We shall talk more plainly when  we  go

down to Tanjong

Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said in April 1956 before we left Paya Lebar

airport that this was only three-quarters and  not

the end of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



road.  But says the ex-Chief Minister, "I  am  not

Oliver Twist. I never come back and ask for  more.

I  want  to  settle  it once and  for  all.  I  am

satisfied  so long as we are called an independent

country,  so  long  as  I  can  go  to  the  Prime

Ministers'   conference  and  go  to  the   United

Nations. We will stay like this forever." We said:

"No." It was a lie to the people of Singapore, and

we  told him so in London. And he was angry again,

because  he thought we were persecuting him,  that

we  were trying to belittle the credit that he was

going  to  achieve  by  bringing  home  this   new

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I left for London this time, my Party

said  quite categorically that what we were asking

for was just 75 per cent with no trick formula. It

was an open honest transaction. We are getting  75

per cent, complete internal self-government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> We are not!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We shall come to that and

prove  it.  Says  the ex-Chief  Minister,  we  are

stooges  of the British. But he dare not meet  the

crucial point about the Internal Security Council.

Who  has  the  deciding vote? If we are  anybody's

stooge,  we  will be the stooge of the  Federation

Government; and if we are honest about joining the

Federation   as  a  member - 11  States   plus   us,

twelve - then the Federation must have the last word

over  Singapore. Either we are consistent and say,

"Yes,  if  we accept merger, that is our position.

Therefore  we  are  prepared now  to  accept  that

position."  Either that or we are not  consistent.

Some  would  like  merger but  in  the  indefinite

future  because  if it happens  in  the  immediate

present,  nobody  can go to the  Prime  Ministers'

conference  except the Federation Prime  Minister,

nor  can  anybody  go to the United  Nations  from

Singapore.  So  let  us  postpone  this   to   the

indefinite   future.  The  P.A.P. has   no   such

ambitions,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  We  do  not  whip

ourselves  into a frenzy, impatiently groping  for

some  way  to  fulfil our personal  ambitions.  We

believe in what we believe in and are prepared  to

die for it. We do not waver.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose now to go through the

points about the constitution taken up by the  ex-Chief Minister paragraph by paragraph. A few  more

words   about   the  date  of  implementation - this

formula  in  paragraph 54. What I signed,  Sir,  I

defend. What the P.A.P. signs, it defends.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Including paragraph 30?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Including paragraph 30 that we

did  not  accept and will not accept. Let us  read

paragraph 54:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was agreed that the date should be fixed by

the   Governor  after  he  was  satisfied,   after

considering   an  address  from  the   Legislative

Assembly,  that  a  reasonable  period   for   the

registration, as provided in paragraph 50 of  this

Report,   of   persons  eligible   for   Singapore

citizenship had elapsed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why the 1st of January, 1958?" Because

administratively   it  would  be   impossible   to

implement  the new constitution before  then,  and

the  ex-Chief Minister knows that. He told  us  it

took  one year - April 1956 to April 1957.  We  have

reduced it to eight months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this date left open?" Because we wanted

to  decide  the registration period,  because  the

Parties   have  no  mandate  on  the  period   for

registration.  We  decide on principle  that  they

will go on the register. We now decide how long  a

period  we are going to afford them to get on  the

register. Malicious distortions known to be untrue

have been put on this particular section. The  ex-Chief  Minister knows that if we allow - as we  hope

to  reach  All-Party agreement on this - a six-month

period  for  registration, this constitution  will

come into force with general elections in one year

from  now - six months for the preparation  and  all

the  other administrative work and six months  for

the actual registration of those new applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for all this talk about our wanting to

perpetuate our seats in this Assembly. Does the ex-Chief  Minister imagine that he could  make  these

charges against the P.A.P. and expect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. to  take it lying down? We know him  well,

and have reason to know him well. By lunch-time it

was  quite obvious that sooner or later the Member

for   Cairnhill  was  going  to  issue  a  general

challenge: "Let us have a fight. Come out and have

it out with me." So we quietly went to the library

and  looked up the Legislative Assembly  Elections

Ordinance in the Singapore Order in Council, 1954,

and we discovered that under section 47 (3) (h), a

Member can resign by writing under his hand to the

Speaker.  By  the  Legislative Assembly  Elections

Ordinance,  sections 25 and 34, by-election  writs

will  be issued, Nomination Day fixed, and Polling

Day  settled.  I hope the Governor  will  do  this

expeditiously.  It  is  in the  interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore not to have  more  malicious

falsehoods said about (1) the new constitution and

paragraph  30 of the Report, and (2) the  People's

Action Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In using the expression

"malicious falsehoods", does the hon. Member refer

to the remarks by the Member for Cairnhill in this

Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would be dishonest if I

said  that  it  did  not include  the  Member  for

Cairnhill, but it was primarily intended for those

remarks made outside the Assembly not only by  the

Member  for  Cairnhill but by a  number  of  other

persons for reasons of their own.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If that expression has reference to

the remarks made by the Member for Cairnhill, then

it must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In so far as that remark refers

to the Member for Cairnhill, I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that the elections can be held

next  year  and  that  the  moment  this  Assembly

decides that the time has come for it, the  Rendel

Constitution comes to an end. Once we vote to  end

it,   if  the  Governor  does  not  call  for  new

elections, everybody in this House can resign  and

that is an end to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



the  matter.  But of course the ex-Chief  Minister

must  find some way to pursue his argument to  its

absurd conclusion. The absurd conclusion to  which

he comes is that probably with the connivance both

of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party and the  People's

Action Party, for the benefit of preserving a $500

per   month   seat,  we  will  allow  these   fine

gentlemen - as he once referred to them - to remain in

office  and even extend it by Order in Council  to

beyond 1959. Does he really believe that? Does  he

expect  anybody  to  believe  that?  Does  he  not

understand what this is all about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the distortions about the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara,  I  note  that he has not  said  that  the

change  of name from the Governor-General  to  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara is a departure  from  the

mandate  of  the  Assembly.  There  has  been   no

departure. Last year he attempted to prove to us,

quoting  legal authorities that when the  Governor

has  to consult him, the ex-Chief Minister, he  is

bound  to  carry out the Chief Minister's  advice.

And  on  no better authority than the one  he  has

established - we  were  prepared  to   accept   this

formula:  that the Singapore Government will  tell

Her  Majesty's Government who this Yang di-Pertuan

Negara is to be and Her Majesty's Government  will

tell the Queen. In the first place, we do not want

to  have anything to do with the Queen. We want to

be part of one Malaya and we will have a Sultan or

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Besar or the Yang di-Pertuan

Agong.  But  we know that we are in an  in-between

stage. We do not really care whether or not he  is

the  representative of the Queen. We want to focus

our  loyalty on a Malayan person and that  Malayan

person  will  be  decided by the Singapore  Govern

ment.  If  the ex-Chief Minister does  not  agree,

then  he will be proved wrong when the time  comes

in April or May next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Singapore Delegation not put it down

that  the  Singapore Government shall  advise  Her

Majesty the Queen? He is a lawyer, Sir, and  ought

to know the endless argument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



we had on the last delegation when I asked him who

was the sovereign power in Singapore under his new

proposed constitution. He wriggled and waffled and

wobbled.  He could not give an answer  because  in

international law the sovereign power must rest in

someone     who     represents    that     country

internationally.  If  we want  to  represent  this

country  internationally we have to  get  complete

independence. That is a fundamental  principle  of

international  law.  An  international   juridical

person  must  be a sovereign power,  not  a  semi-sovereign  power.  Therefore  the  Government   of

Singapore  is  not in a position  to  have  direct

access  to  the  Queen. Nor are we  interested  in

having  direct access to the Queen. The  Queen  is

advised  by  her  independent governments  in  the

Commonwealth   and  in  Britain,  not   by   semi-independent countries or States like Singapore. We

are  interested in the substance and  not  in  the

form. It is agreed that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

should  be  Malayan-born. Now that the Member  for

Cairnhill  is  no  longer in  office  and  is  not

responsible  for Government Bills, he spends  more

time studying them. In two nights of hard work  he

discovered  a  series of flaws which  he  did  not

discover  in one year of office as Chief Minister.

Had we put down just "Malayan"? Must we not define

"Malayan"? A definition becomes necessary. We have

restricted  it to the narrowest class,  not  those

who  are  naturalised Malayans, but those who  are

Malayan-born. In other words, birth either in  one

of the two territories now known as the Federation

of  Malaya or the Colony of Singapore. If a  Party

is  returned to office under this constitution and

chooses  to appoint the President of the  European

Association as Yang di-Pertuan Negara  and  thinks

it can get away with it, let it try.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we told the ex-Chief Minister that if he

nominated  a white man, Mr Francis Thomas,  first

into  the  Assembly, and then made him a Minister,

he  was  bound  to  incur a good  deal  of  odium-because  people  will  not  understand  that   Mr

Francis   Thomas,   according  to   the   ex-Chief

Minister's definition, was a Malayan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let him not forget, when he wallowed in all

these  flashbacks to 1956, that the  mass  of  the

crowd  at  Kallang  were waving P.A.P. flags.  He

knows  that. He scooted from the platform when  it

collapsed.  We  stayed behind on a  van  and  sang

songs with them. Let me just remind him of what he

said then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the London talks fail, I cannot think of the

repercussions.  In  Whitehall  there  are  Colonel

Blimps  and  in Singapore we have Colonel  Blimps,

but  I  am  certain  the common decent  people  of

Britain are behind our demand for merdeka."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonsense, Mr Speaker, Sir, the common decent

people  of  Great Britain are more  interested  in

their T.V. sets than in Singapore. They have never

heard  of Singapore. "You should not judge Britain

by  the  Britons we have here. Rather,"  said  he,

"you  should judge them by some of the Britons  we

have  here,  men  like  Dr  Garlick  of  S.A.T.A.

Another  good example is Mr Francis Thomas"  (now

in disgrace). Alas, I warned him that this was not

a  passenger he could carry, however good he  was.

We think of him-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> In so far as I protest against

distortions of my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Is it a point of

order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The point of order is that the hon.

Member  is distorting my speech, because I  should

then like to mention the distortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order, but the

hon.  Member can of course get up on  a  point  of

clarification and if the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

gives way, he can speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I ask no indulgence from him, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let me clarify for the ex-Chief

Minister, Sir. Mr Francis Thomas, this white man,

and I called him a white man and I will still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



call him a white man; and his Royal Flying Club is

not settled yet because the new trainees are

nearly all Europeans -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see how that is

relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir, that was just an

aside. But was Mr Francis Thomas appointed by the

Governor against the strenuous opposition  of  the

ex-Chief Minister who resisted the appointment  as

a  good nationalist leader? Was he not responsible

for  Mr  Francis Thomas? We know he was appointed

by  the Governor but was it not on the advice  and

recommendation of the ex-Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He knows full well he did.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He did?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Then he has got to stand by Mr

Thomas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I am.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I know it is very unfortunate

being reminded of these things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Unfortunate distortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that if the

Member  for Cairnhill wishes to intervene, he  can

stand  up and I have no doubt that the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar will concede.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, I am afraid I

will not be able to confirm the fact that you need

not  doubt.  But I shall try to be fairer  to  the

Member  for Cairnhill than he was to the  People's

Action  Party  yesterday when he spoke  till  four

o'clock on very little.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three summits of power under this

constitution. If the ex-Chief Minister were not so

addicted  to  pictures and thinking  in  terms  of

pictures  only, we might be able  to  get  him  to

understand  things  beyond the picture  stage.  In

abstract concepts there are three summits of power

under the new constitution:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Yang di-Pertuan Negara - purely formal

Head of the State;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Prime Minister and his Cabinet;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The British Commissioner, as Chairman of the

Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara acts either on the

advice  of the Prime Minister or on the advice  of

the  United Kingdom Commissioner. In all  internal

matters  except those where a conflict has  arisen

and goes to the Internal Security Council, he acts

on the advice of the Prime Minister. When there is

a  conflict  between the Singapore Government  and

the  British  Government, it goes to the  Internal

Security Council where a Federation Minister  sits

in  judgment.  Let  me  tell  the  Chief  Minister

this - the  ex-Chief Minister, Sir, I am sorry.  The

difficulty is that he conducts himself  as  if  he

were still one and he would insist on sitting with

the  Government, it does confuse  Members  on  the

Opposition.  In  his forlorn and lonesome  way  he

knows that having denigrated the gentlemen who now

sit  on the opposite benches, he finds it a little

difficult,  in this comedy of musical  chairs,  to

find  a place in this Assembly where he could have

safe associates.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

should try to be a little more relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I shall try to be more relevant

than the ex-Chief Minister, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is that a reflection on the

Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir, certainly not. That is

a  failing  for  which we cannot  hold  the  Chair

responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most important of all," said he, "the kernel of

internal self-government is internal security  and

this,  under the new constitution, is out  of  the

hands of the Singapore Government. This is what we

strongly and bitterly fought against last year and

now  we swallow it sugarcoated. The merdeka  which

the  mission  is  bringing back  is  a  pockmarked

beauty shrouded in chloroform."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



Last year, Sir, I remember the same gentleman  who

wrote  this statement running around with a bottle

of  chloroform  chasing a more pockmarked  beauty.

The chloroform did not work, and he came back here

a very sad man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we given away? Last year the Internal

Security Council could only discuss matters  which

Her   Majesty's  Government  considers   are   not

external.  If Her Majesty's Government says,  this

is  external, then it is outside the  province  of

the   Singapore  Government  or  the  Defence  and

Security  Council. Oh yes, let  him  read  it.  If

there  is  any  disagreement, it is Her  Majesty's

Government  in  the Security Council  who  decides

whether  it is internal or external. That was  why

the  issue  arose as to this Federation  Minister,

why  we  were  prepared to put our fate  into  the

hands  of  the Federation and not the British.  We

wanted  the Federation Minister to decide  whether

it  is  internal or external. And if the  ex-Chief

Minister  will look at paragraph 27  (i)  he  will

know  that  in  sober language,  to  which  he  is

unaccustomed, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there was disagreement as to whether a

particular   matter  was  a  matter  of   internal

security,  and therefore within the  functions  of

the  Council,  the matter should be discussed  and

decided by the Council."



<br><br>In  other words, we have won now the right to have

any  matter,  whether it be external or  internal,

decided by the Federation Minister who can say, "I

agree  with the Singapore Government that although

this  is  external,  it affects  internal  affairs

sufficiently to make it an internal matter  and  I

am  voting with the Singapore Government." And  we

will   win.  The  trouble  with  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  is  that every time he  thinks  of  the

Federation  Government, he  envisaged  himself  in

opposition to it. "I am not against the Tunku. But

oh,  why must everybody crawl up to him?"  We  are

accused of crawling on our bellies, and God  knows

what else people see in their nightmares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be general elections in the Federation

in  1959. With elections there will be a new phase

and  a  new atmosphere and it is our fervent  hope

that this constitution, this tiga suku merdeka - the

Member for Cairnhill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



calls   it  "busok"  merdeka - if  this  tiga   suku

meredeka is busok, what he was trying to sell  the

people  of  Singapore  last year  as  a  permanent

settlement  was  tipu  merdeka,  tiga  suku  palsu

merdeka. It was never merdeka and he knew  it.  It

was  a fraud on the people of Singapore and he was

angered at me because I said so in London. He said

then,  "I am not Oliver Twist." I am told that  he

went to London shortly after the Prime Minister of

Burma, and the Prime Minister of Burma at a  Press

luncheon  at the Commonwealth Press Club said,  "I

am not Oliver Twist", and that phrase struck him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am prepared to stake not only my judgment, but

the judgment of my Party on this matter, that this

constitution is a right step towards merger,  that

it  is  a  right decision to put our fate together

with  the Federation's fate. If Singapore and  the

Federation  agree, as we hope they  will,  if  not

now,   probably  after  1959,  then  the   British

Government is out-voted every time in the Internal

Security  Council. Does the ex-Chief Minister  not

understand  that?  That four  to  three  does  not

necessarily  mean Singapore in opposition  to  the

Federation  Government? If he starts  off  on  the

major  premise that he is superior to  the  Tunku,

and  therefore the Tunku should listen to what  he

says,  then there is bound to be a clash, as there

was, as everybody knows there was. Everybody knows

what  happened in Baling. But the less said  about

these things the better. When we think in terms of

the  Federation Minister, we think in terms of the

representative of 11 States, of which we  want  to

be  an  additional member. The fate  of  Singapore

will  be  decided  by the fate of the  Federation.

These  are sombre political facts which  no  trick

formula  can  get us out of. Economically  we  are

bound:  politically we are controlled:  militarily

we  are confined. The road to merdeka is the  road

to  merger. The ex-Chief Minister is not a man who

thinks  in  terms of five years or  ten  years.  A

friend of mine had a discussion with him the other

day  and  asked  him, "What would happen  in  five

years?" He said, "I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



interested  in five years or ten years. I am  a  man

who  lives for the moment." And he is, and we will

prove  him  catastrophically wrong  to  take  that

attitude  towards merger. Does he  not  understand

that  this  desire  for unity is something  bigger

than  the Tunku, or any of his Ministers? Does  he

not understand this concept of one Malaya is alive

in   the   minds   of   all  the   young   Malayan

intellectuals  both  here  in  the  University  of

Malaya  and in England and elsewhere? Does he  not

understand that ideas persist long after  the  men

who  have  espoused these ideas  have  gone?  With

Party  Ra'ayat  and the Pan-Malayan Islamic  Party

openly saying that they want merger, does the  ex-Chief  Minister not understand how public  opinion

influences  the leadership and how the  leadership

in  turn  influences public opinion? Does  he  not

know   that  when  the  Chief  Minister   of   the

Federation told an audience of Malayans in  London

that  there  would be no merger, there  was  acute

disappointment?  And  that  the   students   still

believe    in   merger?   And   they    are    the

administrators,  the D.O.'s, the magistrates,  and

the future political leaders of Malaya?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not striving to work out some trick

formula  so  that we can enjoy the  "sensation  of

freedom"  for the present. We are not carrying  on

in  this Assembly till May next year just for  the

sake  of  having the joy of seeing the Member  for

Cairnhill disgrace his former colleagues.  We  are

here  for a political purpose, and when May comes,

he will understand what that political purpose is.

Although  other Members in this Assembly have  not

really  understood it, they are at least beginning

to see the light; whereas the Member for Cairnhill

imagines  that all that he has got  to  do  is  to

shout and he gets what he wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say once again that the Internal Security

Council  is  a practical solution to the  internal

security problem. Let us face facts. There is only

one  way  in  which  the  political  situation  in

Singapore  can change radically. If  you  want  to

have free and open competition of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



political  beliefs in a peaceful and democratic  manner,

including the Communists if they compete peacefully  and

constitutionally to work the democratic system,  if  you

accept that as a major premise-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> You accept the Communists -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I prefer to see the Indian experiment

work  itself out to its logical conclusion. Let us  face

facts.  If a people have lost faith completely in  their

democratic institutions, because they cannot find men of

calibre to run them, then, however good that system,  it

perishes.  Ultimately it is the men who run  the  system

who make it come to life. And if you insist, in spite of

the  fact  that  the  people have lost  faith  in  those

institutions, you have got to do it like South  Vietnam,

or  perhaps  Thailand  where a state  of  emergency  was

declared  after  the election. I postulate  this - and  we

have not moved from that position - that if the Communists

are prepared to compete peacefully and democratically to

work the democratic system, then they should be entitled

to do so; but if they are going to use force at the same

time  as  peaceful competition, then we  shall  have  to

fight. I have said that before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever government that comes into office in Singapore

under  any  constitution - even the kind  of  constitution

which    the    ex-Chief   Minister    envisaged    last

year - representation on the United Nations and the  Prime

Ministers'  conference, foreign affairs and  defence  in

the  hands of Britain - and it is Communist, what happens?

The  constitution  will be suspended.  In  the  ultimate

resort,  it  is  a conflict of forces. I thought  I  had

explained  it  all once to this House about  how  a  new

society,  according to a great Chinese theoretician,  is

born  out of the rifle barrel. Where there is a  joinder

of  basic  issues,  as  there  is  between  the  Western

countries  and  the  Russians, even in  a  country  like

Jordan just trying to make friends with the Russians,  a

coup  takes  place, force manipulates the situation.  So

what is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



all  this cry over the Internal Security Council  about?

Does   the   Member  for  Cairnhill  imagine  that   the

Federation  Government is going to sit back quietly  and

watch   Singapore  allow  the  M.C.P. to  set  up   its

headquarters  just opposite the Johore  Bahru  causeway?

And  are the British going to stand idly back? Those are

facts  which  must be faced. The situation in  Singapore

can only be changed when the situation in the Federation

changes. And for that reason we are prepared to put  our

fate together with the Federation. That I am prepared to

defend.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think this is an appropriate time

to suspend?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I will take the Chair again at half-past two.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 2.30 p.m.</i></div>





<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

unfounded  allegations made against the People's  Action

Party was that we have changed our stand on citizenship,

that  in 1956 we supported U.M.N.O. in saying that there

should  be  only  one  citizenship  for  the  whole   of

Singapore  and  that there should not  be  both  British

nationality  and  concurrent Singapore citizenship.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill said that  we  have  altered  our

stand.  Sir,  if  he  will refer to  the  Constitutional

Report,  he will see that there is only one citizenship,

namely, Singapore citizenship. The people who are to  be

Singapore  citizens  automatically  are  those  born  in

Singapore:   all  others,  including  British   subjects

wherever born, must register. It is for us a question of

principle.  We  are therefore unable to  see  any  merit

whatsoever  in the completely unprincipled,  opportunist

proposal  of  the Member for Cairnhill that  one  should

take the identity cards of those registered at random in

1948 as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



the  qualification for voting rights.  The  Member

for  Cairnhill  is  a man who  is  very  agile  at

picking up new ideas. The last time he picked up a

new   idea,  it  led  to  disastrous  results  for

himself.  The  people of Singapore have  got  more

solid   common  sense  than  to  listen   to   his

ridiculous  suggestion that  principle  should  be

thrown  to the winds because some people  want  to

satisfy  their personal ambitions immediately  and

not eight months after August.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I have

listened   with  patience  to  attacks   upon   me

personally  to  which the Chair is  silent  and  I

would  ask  the  Chair whether  it  is  proper  to

suggest improper motives on my part in respect  of

the  amendment  I moved because I  have  refrained

from  making any personal suggestions myself, much

as I would like to?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the honourable Member indicate

a specific personal allusion so that I can rule on

it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He said that my suggestion was

ridiculous  and that the people of Singapore  knew

better  than  to support an amendment because  the

person  wished  to  achieve personal  glory  eight

months earlier than he otherwise would.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot see anything

unparliamentary about the word "ridiculous," and I

understood  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  to  make

reference not to the Member for Cairnhill when  he

spoke about people who were seeking their personal

glory  but  to those 260,000 voters whom  we  have

been talking about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

speaking of a class of people. I leave it  to  the

Member  for Cairnhill whether or not he  considers

himself  eligible to qualify under that  class.  I

venture  no suggestion on it whatsoever but  I  do

suggest  that  the  stand of the  People's  Action

Party  on  the date of the implementation  of  the

elections and on citizenship is based on  a  sound

principle  which  can  be  defended  and  will  be

defended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall) once

called the ex-Member for Cairnhill (Mr C. C. Tan)

the  lizard  of  Cairnhill. I was discussing  this

matter  with a zoologist. He said that a chameleon

came  within  the species, lizard. I hate  to  say

that  there  could  be in place  of  a  lizard  of

Cairnhill a chameleon of Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is suggested that we have got less than last

year.  I would like to refer the ex-Hon. the Chief

Minister to the demand of the All-Party Delegation

that expatriate judges should be removed. It is  a

matter  of  principle to which  he  did  not  give

vigorous  support last year. As  he  will  see  in

Annexure  L,  page 68, clause (18),  part  of  Her

Majesty's  Government's  proposals  which  he  was

prepared  to accept provided they agreed  to  this

business of the Order in Council being laid before

the House of Commons was that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief Justice and other Judges of the

Supreme  Court  appointed before the  coming  into

force  of  the new constitution to continue  their

offices."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To continue their offices" indefinitely until

they  sought  to  retire  themselves!  Now,  under

paragraph 46 (c), we have reached agreement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special arrangements regarding Supreme Court

Judges not of local origin: In accordance with the

Singapore  Government's plans for  Malayanisation,

arrangements  have been made to  provide  for  the

retirement on compensation terms of members of the

judiciary not of local origin."



<br><br>Similarly  with police officers. He will  remember

that,  last  year, he was prepared to  accept  Her

Majesty's  Government's position as  expressed  in

paragraph  54 of Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.  31  of

1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Secretary of State confirmed that Her

Majesty's Government attached great importance  to

the retention of the right to control appointments

of  Commissioner of Police, Deputy Commissioner of

Police and Director of Special Branch."



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> We have accepted that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let me come to that by and by

when  I remind him of what took place when he went

crawling back on his belly to see his dear  friend

Alan to try and reopen the talks. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



police  officers however high up  come  under  the

Public  Services  Commission with  only  this  one

check - not  even  a safeguard but  only  one  minor

obstacle - that  there could be a  reference  back

once  by  the Internal Security Council. Paragraph

29  of  the  Report of the Singapore  Constitution

Conference (Sessional Paper No. Misc. 2  of  1957)

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior Police Appointments



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. With regard to the three Senior Police

Officers,  i.e. the Commissioner of  Police,  the

Deputy Commissioner of Police and the Director  of

the   Special   Branch,  we  agreed   that   these

appointments  should  be  manifestly   free   from

political  influence, and should therefore  remain

within   the   sphere   of  the   Public   Service

Commission.  In view however of the importance  of

these  posts  to  internal  security,  opportunity

should  be provided for either Government to  make

representations or call for reconsideration before

a recommendation put forward by the Public Service

Commission    was   approved   by   the    Queen's

representative.  We  agreed,  therefore,  that  it

should  be  provided that these three appointments

should  be  made by the Queen's representative  on

the   recommendation   of   the   Public   Service

Commission, and that the Internal Security Council

should be informed of the recommendation before it

was submitted to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara."



<br><br>And these are the operative words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Council might refer the recommendation back

to  the  Public Service Commission  once;  but  if

repeated   it  [i.e. the  recommendation]   would

stand."

<br><br>Where  therefore  lies this  charge  that  he  was

offered more last year than what we obtained  this

year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again as to the Internal Security Council, he

said last year that this Internal Security Council

would be under the control and supervision of  the

House of Commons - the British people in whom he had

great  faith.  The  recommendation  of  the   High

Commissioner who not only is the Chairman but  has

the   decisive  vote  on  this  Internal  Security

Council, could result in an Order in Council  from

the  Queen.  Surely, he could not  have  forgotten

that  that was the shameful compromise with  which

he  ran  back  to the Colonial Secretary?  Let  me

remind him of it from the news reports. On Friday,

May  18,  the  Daily Telegraph, a good  right-wing

newspaper, gave the Member for Cairnhill  a  great

deal of cover in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



the days when he was banging the colonial gong for

the British:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Lennox-Boyd had told him that he would give

serious consideration to the new proposals only if

they  had the support of the Delegation.  He  [Mr

David  Marshall] had gone to the Minister's  house

in   Chapel   Street - Belgravia - for  an   informal

meeting  to explain his 'new idea', following  the

breakdown talks on independence for the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lennox-Boyd previously rejected Mr Marshall's three-year time limit for the special

powers  on  internal  security  on  which  Britain

insists   as   a   safeguard   against   Communist

subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, Mr Marshall still would not

disclose  the nature of his new plan. He explained

that he had written a letter containing details of

the  new approach to Mr Lennox-Boyd and would not

publish  it  until he had received the  Minister's

formal reply."



<br><br>Let  us  see  this new proposal. This was  in  the

exchange  of letters which you will remember,  Mr

Speaker, always began with loving endearments:



<br><br>"17th May, 1956.



<br><br>My dear Alan,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the breakdown of the Conference on Tuesday

an  idea for a new approach to our differences has

occurred   to   me.  I  am  putting  forward   the

suggestion contained in this letter entirely on my

own  initiative and responsibility. You are  aware

how  repugnant  the whole principle of  overriding

powers of legislation is to me personally and  how

dangerous I consider the existence of such  powers

is  to the principle I seek to establish of stable

and  friendly  relations with the United  Kingdom.

These  Imperial powers of legislation (as  defined

by  you)  are  far outside the scope  of  what  is

normally   understood  by  the  phrase   'external

defence'... The suggestion is this: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the overriding powers of legislation

by   Orders   in   Council   and   Emergency

Regulations sought by you, in the Context of

your  proposal  for the Composition  of  the

Defence and Security Council [i.e. a British

Chairman  with a casting vote, Sir],  should

be  subject to affirmative resolution of the

House  of Commons (such approval to be prior

or subsequent as the Circumstances require);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in order to meet the very real need of the

people  of  Singapore for an end of  colonial

rule,  the  relationship  of  the  State   of

Singapore  with the United Kingdom should  be

outside the scope of the Colonial Office  and

in   any   other   Ministry   as   may   seem

appropriate;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that there should be a representative of

Her  Majesty in Singapore as the Head of  the

State  in Singapore through whom the  loyalty

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



people  of this nascent state would  find  a

means of coalescing...".



<br><br>What was the suggestion? He was prepared to accept

Her   Majesty's  Government's  proposal  that  the

British  High Commissioner should be the  Chairman

with  a casting vote on that Security Council with

powers  to make or recommend Emergency Regulations

and  Orders  in  Council provided  they  are  laid

before the House of Commons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> In external affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And in internal affairs. We are

prepared  to  put  our  fate  together  with   the

Federation, which the Member for Cairnhill is  not

prepared  to  do,  because  if  we  go  with   the

Federation, there will be only one Prime  Minister

for  the two territories. Let me remind him of the

reception  of this "new idea" amongst  Members  of

his  own  delegation, lest we  forget  those  last

famous  days  at St. James' Court, like  the  last

days  of Hitler in his bunker: New idea after  new

idea,  hour  by  hour, emergency conference  after

emergency  conference, and the delegation  trooped

in  just like Hitler's generals trooped in! But as

impending  doom came nearer and nearer,  less  and

less  generals  attended these  conferences  until

finally,  at  that  famous  tea  party  in  Chapel

Street - Belgravia - only two field-marshals turned up

for  him - the Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga)

of  whom  he must be justly proud and the Minister

for  Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock) of whom

he  was  very  proud.  Has  he  forgotten  why  he

forfeited the respect of the whole delegation? Let

me read to him what the News Chronicle reported as

the  curtain  dropped in London - Act  V,  Scene  V!

Friday,  May  the 18th, "Marshall  Fails  in  Last

Talk":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door of Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd's Belgravia

House  shut  silently on Mr David  Marshall  last

night  and  Singapore's usually tempestuous  Chief

Minister  was left standing glumly on the doorstep

twiddling a red camelia in his fingers. Apart from

the  flower,  he came away empty-handed  from  his

eleventh-hour  attempt  to persuade  the  Colonial

Secretary  to reopen negotiations on the political

future of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dejected Mr Marshall said that it was the end.

He  would fly back on Monday and resign. He  would

not  say  whether  he would stand  for  Parliament

again.  For  an  hour  over the  teacups,  he  had

persevered  with his forlorn hope. He promised  to

accept  all  that  Mr  Lennox-Boyd  had  demanded

subject  only to one condition. This was that  the

British  House of Commons should approve the  acts

of the Island's Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talks to give Singapore's 1,200,000 people

self-government broke down on Tuesday because  Mr

Marshall  refused  to accept a  British  dominated

Council  with  overriding powers to  interfere  in

domestic affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged on by British Labour leaders, Mr Marshall

swallowed  his  objections  to  the  Council   and

resolved on one last try at a compromise. Only two

of  his  twelve  delegates backed  him;  they  are

fellow Ministers in the Cabinet."



<br><br>Says the footnote: "That Camelia":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"During tea, Mr Marshall commented that he had

never  before seen such a red one. Mr Lennox-Boyd

cut a bloom and gave it to him."



<br><br>Sir, we gave him all the loyalty that any leader

of any delegation could have asked for -

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> That is all you know about

loyalty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> -and he forfeited that right.

Has  he forgotten the Member for Tiong Bahru  (Mr

William  Tan),  when he was told on  that  fateful

evening  of  this  new idea - at  one  of  the  last

meetings when the generals attended - he said,  "How

can,  man?"  There  are other  witnesses  in  this

Assembly  other than the eleven silent  ones.  The

former  Secretary of the delegation would remember

it  with a vividness which, I am sure, could never

be  erased from his memory. We have had enough and

we  are  not going to have any more nonsense  from

the   Member   for  Cairnhill - the   chameleon   of

Cairnhill. We stand by principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot have the use of the

word "nonsense".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We will resist any jockeying,

any  manoeuvring, not because we want to  persecute

that  poor  man who thinks he is being  persecuted

because it is fashionable. He is irrelevant  as  a

private  person but if he chooses to  raise  grave

issues  and  join  them with the  People's  Action

Party, then he must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



expect the People's Action Party to join issues with

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end of this motion when

the  votes  have  been taken, I  shall  tender  my

resignation as Member for Tanjong Pagar.  I  shall

be  standing  in the Tanjong Pagar by-election  as

the  P.A.P. candidate for Tanjong Pagar. I am sure

that the ex-Chief Minister-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Although that has some

bearing  on  the motion, I cannot see  how  it  is

strictly relevant. I have ruled out the Member for

Cairnhill as being irrelevant when he referred  to

a challenge to a by-election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is relevant to this extent,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in that it is said that  we  do

not  represent the views of the people when we say

that  elections should be held on a day after  the

1st of January, 1958, as we shall decide depending

upon the period for registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the constitution is a fraud on

the people of Singapore and that the P.A.P. was  a

party  to this fraud. That will be tested.  It  is

also   said  that  the  anti-subversion   ban   of

paragraph 30 is a matter which the people support.

But we say, "This is an acceptable constitution at

this  point,  that it is a halfway house  to  full

independence  with merger with the  Federation  of

Malaya."  but that paragraph 30 cannot be defended

on  principle and must be removed before  the  new

constitution comes into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill's amendment seeks an

immediate   implementation   of   this    colonial

constitution, as he calls it, with  this  ban.  He

said  that  he wanted to justify his view  at  the

elections. So it shall be. The fight is not  over.

This  Report is a Report. If it were an agreement,

there  will  be no more fight. But we shall  carry

this  fight  into the constituency, back  to  this

Chamber  and  back to London, when  necessary.  My

Party  took its stand on this Report and  we  will

justify it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-Chief Minister wants to have it both

ways:   first,  he  says,  "Ban  and   block   the

extremists,"  and  second,  he  says,  "But  these

wicked people have used the Preservation of Public

Security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance."  Who passed it? The ex-Chef  Minister!

Who  resisted?  We  did. On  principle,  we  still

oppose   the   Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance. He can laugh but let me tell him  this,

that  we understand the full implications of every

one  of  our  public  declarations.  What  we  say

publicly,  we  honour publicly. That is  something

which he, I am sure, will never understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has said that we have abandoned our

colleagues.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, only  he  who  has

those  low standards of moral conduct would  think

that others would do what he would. These men whom

he once referred to in glowing terms: "Today (22nd

March,  1956)  I  am  proud of  my  collection  of

Singaporeans whom you elected to run the country,"

and  Members  will remember that he  turned  round

particularly  and said, "What a wonderful  crew  I

have  got,  now  that  I have  got  rid  of  these

horrible  types  over  there."  Now,  we  are  all

horrible  men.  Everybody  is  out  of  step.   He

represents the spirit of the Labour Front which is

now  dead. Everybody has got a left foot  forward,

he  has  got  a right foot forward.  Now  he  will

understand  that  there are certain  standards  of

conduct  which  unless adhered to leave  some  men

isolated  and  abhorred.  We  will  fight  him  on

principle  not  because we want to  destroy  David

Saul Marshall - ex-Hon. Chief Minister, ex-President

of  the Labour Front Party and ex-Senior Committee

Member  of  the Labour Front Party.  His  personal

life,  his personal history and his future  career

do  not  interest  us. But if  he  challenges  the

policy of the People's Action Party which has been

forged  in  the  best interest of  the  people  of

Singapore and Malaya, then he must be prepared  to

justify  it.  It is a fight of consistency  versus

confusion,  of  collective leadership  versus  the

personality  cult,  of the People's  Action  Party

versus the chameleon of Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to know that certain

Members object to this debate going on beyond four

o'clock. If I occupy too much of the time of  this

House,  I might deprive other Members from getting

some  space in tomorrow's papers and getting their

views known. I therefore propose to try to sum  up

my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



arguments  in order that there would be  time  for

Members  both of the Government and of  the  other

Opposition Party to put forward their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight over the agreed proposals in the

Report.   We   will  justify  the  date   of   the

implementation - some day after the 1st of  January,

1958 - after  a  reasonable period has  elapsed.  We

propose  six months as that reasonable period.  An

Address  will  be made from this Assembly  to  the

Governor.  If  the People's Action Party  says  it

will  have an election on the date recommended  by

this Assembly, it will fight for that date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Now he is fighting for his

colleagues!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Second, the Internal Security

Council  is a sound and practical proposition.  We

believe  in  merger  with the  Federation  as  our

proper  destiny and the only hope of our  survival

as  an  independent democratic State in South-East

Asia. We say that whoever says that that is a sell-out is not only anti-merger but is anti-Malayan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the agreed parts of this Report, as

distinct from paragraph 30 which is not an  agreed

part  of  the Report, should be accepted but  that

paragraph 30 should be rejected in toto. We do not

want  a  constitution  with  paragraph  30  in  it

whether  put in by the Colonial Office  or  by  an

elected  Government, if the Member  for  Cairnhill

wins  the by-election and if that is the  wish  of

the  people,  then he can put in paragraph  30.  I

believe that the people of Singapore, whatever the

view of the Member for Cairnhill, will not support

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is to be

appointed by the Singapore Government advising Her

Majesty's Government to advise the Queen and  that

is  the  meaning of "after consultation with".  To

suggest  that  Her  Majesty's Government  appoints

this  Malayan-born who could be an  expatriate  is

fantasy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the Member for

Cairnhill's  approach  to  this  problem  and   my

Party's approach is this. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



far  as  the Member for Cairnhill is concerned,  a

new constitution should be the end of the road. He

is  satisfied  either if he has got  merdeka  with

foreign  affairs  and defence permanently  in  the

hands  of  the British or if Singapore  becomes  a

United Nations' Asian Headquarters, something like

Shanghai   was,   with  everybody  having   extra-territorial rights, a prostitute to be ravished by

every  sinner in the world. That was his objective

but  because  he knows the feeling for  merger  is

strong,  lip  service is paid  to  merger  in  the

indefinite  future.  Our  attitude  is  that  this

constitution will bring the Federation closer with

Singapore,  that  this  is  a  constitution  which

recognises the hard facts-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The prostitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> To the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is a step in the right

direction - a half-way house - from which  we  go  to

freedom  with the Federation. Let us  face  facts,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, whatever happens, we shall campaign for

this  constitution as a half-way house and  if  we

can get this constitution without paragraph 30, we

will  have  advanced a step forward in  the  right

direction - in  the direction of one  State,  United

Malaya. That is my Party stand. That is the  issue

on which we shall fight in Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the amendment in the

name of the Member for Cairhill.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday,  all  of  us  were

treated to a play to the Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Only the Straits Times can say

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister has

started  off  on  the wrong foot. Will  he  please

withdraw that expression?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> As you please, Sir, I withdraw

that,  Mr  Speaker. For one moment  yesterday,  I

thought that this House was turned into a court of

law,  a jury with all the Assemblymen sitting down

and   with  a  prosecutor  prosecuting  some  poor

unknown accused person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill referred to the stony

silence  that  greeted the Merdeka  Mission  which

came  back  from London. Yes, he referred  to  the

boos  and  to the cries of "Merdeka!", dubbed  in.

The  boos were directed at me. At least, I had the

courage  to  face them. Where was the  Member  for

Cairnhill? Had he the courage to stand  up  before

them and receive the boos? No. He was away in Batu

Pahat   doing  duty  to  some  Malayans   in   the

Federation  of Malaya. He objected  to  shouts  of

"Merdeka!" being dubbed in because it happened  to

be the voice of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, he referred to the good Chinese school

students of Singapore. He referred to them  as  "a

pot of gold" or words to that effect. Members will

remember  that in this very House, he referred  to

those  students as children sick with chicken-pox.

They are now no more sick! They are pure gold now!

But  at  least I am consistent. I have been saying

that  I forbid pupils from taking part in politics

and  I  do  say it now. Even with any election  in

front  of me. I will still be consistent  and  say

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also said that we could

have  elections  in July this year.  Now,  I  will

refer  to  a  portion of his speech made  on  10th

March at the Kong Hwa School, a place which is not

suitable for political activities or for political

speeches. Here is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The proposed new constitution provides for 51

elected  Members and the creation of the State  of

Singapore. For the constitution to come into force

putting  an  end  to  colonial  rule  in  internal

affairs  there  must be therefore a newly  elected

Assembly.  We cannot create citizens in the  State

of  Singapore until the State of Singapore  is  in

being.  Therefore, to give voting rights  to  non-domiciled aliens before the new constitution comes

into  force  means  to create  what  U.M.N.O. and

P.A.P. call "second-class citizens" under the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



law  which was rejected in 1955.  It  means

that there must be an oath of exclusive loyalty to

the colony of Singapore and not to the independent

State of Singapore."



<br><br>Further:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the objection to elections in 1959? The

objection  is  simply this,  that  until  the  new

elections take place, the new constitution  cannot

take  effect  and  the postponement  of  elections

therefore  means quite simply the postponement  of

merdeka, new life for the Rendel Constitution  and

the  present  Assembly  and  the  prolongation  of

colonial rule for a further two years."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are told that we can have elections in

July   1957.   Now,   Sir,   we   can   see   what

contradictions the Member for Cairnhill has made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> You only see. You do not

understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I

listened  for  more than two and a half  hours  in

silence to the wonderful speech of the Member  for

Cairnhill and I think that there should be  enough

decorum and dignity in this House for me to expect

the same treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also said that the

Chief  Minister  had to apply  the  Whip  on  this

national matter. I am not coming to the aid of the

Chief Minister in this matter but I wish to inform

the  House  of  the fact that when I received  the

letter   of   resignation  from  the  Member   for

Cairnhill, I did not consult the Chief Minister. I

brought it to the Central Committee and it  was  a

unanimous vote, with not one dissenting voice,  to

accept the resignation. So, the Chief Minister did

not,  in  fairness to him, apply the  Whip  either

through me or through the Party and as a matter of

fact, the application of the Whip should have been

decided  not by the Party of the Labour Front  but

by a Parliamentary Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the Member for Tanjong Pagar has

torn  to  bits the suggestion that we can register

the  prospective citizens in about six  weeks  and

that another six weeks may be required to put  the

names  on  the electoral rolls and for objections,

etc. I think that the Hon. the Chief Minister will

explain  and  prove  that  this  is  just  wishful

thinking and impossible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the subversion paragraph, we signed

the Report in opposition to that paragraph because

then we had no mandate from our Party. None of  us

had a mandate and we thought that we were right in

opposing  that  condition. That condition  was  an

imposition on us. Her Majesty's Government has the

power   still  to  impose  such  a  condition   on

Singapore and we intended to come back to get  our

Party  stand on this matter. We did not  rush  out

and  make our plans without consultation with  the

Party.  We  came  back  and  at  least  I  had   a

consultation with my Party. Our stand is this:  We

oppose  it because we think that we can fight  the

subversive elements ourselves. The Labour Front at

least  has demonstrated that it will not  hesitate

to  take  action against any subversive  elements.

That  is  shown in our action in October 1956  and

therefore  we  say we oppose it because  we  think

that  without falling back on the Colonial  Office

we  can  fight the subversive elements in our  own

way and in our time.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we have been treated to nearly four hours  of

a  very long speech by the Member for Cairnhill on

this  motion. When we reflect on all that he  said

in  those  four hours and try to get the substance

of  what he said, I think we shall find that there

is  very  little  of any value  in  what  he  said

yesterday and this morning and that is because  he

has looked upon the whole subject with a jaundiced

eye.  He has always been very prone in his  nature

to  look  on one side of the problem and when  his

heart  or mind is taken up by a subject or by  the

complaints of a certain class of people, he is apt

only  to  concentrate on that class of people  and

forget  the  rest of Singapore. The way  he  spoke

would  be admirable in a court of law when  he  is

defending a man who might lose his life, but it is

absolutely  useless to speak in such an  emotional

manner in this House where the primary duty is not

for  interest of one section of the people - it  may

be  a very small section of the people - but for all

the  people  as  a whole and for  the  benefit  of

Singapore in particular.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claims to have been speaking for the "people

of  Singapore"; which people? To us, he is a  lone

voice. "Where were the people to shout and welcome

the  delegates  home  when they  came  back?  Only

silence  and cold contempt." Whom do we  represent

in  this  House, all the Parties? And the  various

Parties,  I  think,  do  represent  quite  a  good

proportion  of  the  people of Singapore.  Yet  we

count for nothing! He was not there, he was not in

the procession to see what reception the delegates

received;  yet  he  could  spend  half   an   hour

describing  the "cold contempt" that was  accorded

to this delegation!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, happiness or satisfaction can be expressed

in  two  ways: one, with jubilation or unnecessary

emotion, as the ex-Chief Minister has always done;

the   other  is  to  feel  calm  satisfaction  and

contentment, which is the way we want  the  people

of  Singapore to accept the new constitution which

has  been  granted  to  us.  For  the  Member  for

Cairnhill, what difference does it make if  a  few

windows get broken, a few heads get broken, and  a

few   lives  are  lost,  so  long  as   there   is

jubilation,   there  are  shouts  of   "Merdeka!"?

Nothing!  We  have seen that; we have  experienced

that.  As  I said, at the last meeting in  London,

all the delegates to the conference agreed amongst

themselves  that  there  should  be  no  rally  in

Singapore  because  it  might  lead  to  incidents

again.  However, if our demands were not satisfied

that  time,  then  we  would support  a  rally  of

protest.  Well, that is the reason for  the  "cold

and stony silence".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the question of the allegation of

the Member for Cairnhill that our Mission has been

an  absolute failure, the agreement a sell-out  of

the  people of Singapore. We will have to go  into

some  detail and I shall prove that he  is  wrong,

completely wrong, that you can only regard it as a

failure   if  you  look  upon  every  act,   every

sentence,  every paragraph in this  document  with

fear,  suspicion,  prejudice and  contempt.  After

all,   what  did  we  achieve?  We  have  achieved

everything which we set out to get. We  knew  what

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



wanted and we knew what we could get. What we  got

this  time is more than what the ex-Chief Minister

would  have got if the Secretary of State for  the

Colonies had agreed to reopen the talks after  the

talks had failed the previous time. I do not think

anyone  in this House, or any other Member of  the

previous  delegation, did more than I  to  try  to

hold  the  previous  talks and prevent  them  from

failing.  At  the very last moment, when  the  ex-Chief Minister had refused to accept the terms  of

the British Government, I got up and said, "Do not

let us take any step which will make it impossible

to discuss this matter again. Let us sleep over it

tonight."  But I was brushed aside. Then,  on  the

way out, in a moment of vexation, he issued a very

venomous   release   to  the  world   Press.   Yet

immediately  after that, when we had  returned  to

our  hotel, he again summoned us down; we were all

asked  to get together again to try to reopen  the

talks. Sir, there are certain things which one can

do,  but there are certain things which cannot  be

done - after  the  venomous attacks on  the  British

Government,  not one of us in the delegation  felt

that  we could be humiliating enough to crawl back

and  ask for the talks to be reopened. Even if the

talks  had been reopened, I am quite sure we could

never have got more than what is contained in this

Paper today. The principal reason why the previous

talks  broke  down  was  because  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  would not accept a British chairman  of

the Internal Security Council with a casting vote.

If  we  had  gone back that day and the talks  had

been  reopened, would we have got any  more?  That

was the very point which was not acceptable to us;

but here, we have overcome it, we have accepted  a

compromise  whereby  the deciding  member  is  our

friend a Minister from the Federation. And we  are

happy  to leave this very important matter in  his

hands  because, being a neighbouring  country,  we

are  as  one, if not legally, then as a matter  of

contact; and we are quite sure that, when it comes

to  a show-down, the Minister of the Federation on

this  Council  will  take  our  side,  unless  our

demands are impossible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under paragraph 24, we have been given

complete assurance that Her Majesty's Government's

intention  is  that  the new  constitution  should

confer     upon    Singapore    Ministers     full

responsibility  for maintaining internal  law  and

order, and preventing subversion. That is an over-riding  paragraph. Then, under  paragraph  26,  we

have,  what the Member for Cairnhill has  alleged,

given  back  everything to the British Government,

because sub-paragraph (ii) states that one of  the

functions  of  the  Council  is  to  maintain  the

efficiency   of   all  organs  of  the   Singapore

Government  concerned with internal security.  But

surely  this paragraph must be read in conjunction

with  paragraph  24; we are given overall  powers,

and  paragraph  26 deals with the  powers  of  the

Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Read paragraph 25.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member for Paya

Lebar please continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> That is if you choose to read

things  in their context without a jaundiced  eye.

Now, there is also the complaint on paragraph  40,

under  which if we went against the wishes of  the

British  Government. Her Majesty's  representative

here could tell the Yang di-Pertuan Negara what to

do, and it should be carried out. Well, that is  a

step  which  could and would be  taken  only  when

Singapore  is  in  extremis,  when  there  is   an

absolute  danger of chaos. By this  paragraph,  we

are giving a chance to Her Majesty's Government to

advise  us  what to do, and to try to  prevent  us

from  having our constitution being revoked. I  do

not think that that is too big a sacrifice for  us

to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the demand of the Member for

Cairnhill for immediate elections. There is a good

saying  about doing things in haste and  repenting

at  leisure. Apparently experience of this  nature

has  not  benefited the Member for  Cairnhill.  We

should  not  jump into an election by  just  using

identity  cards  (with all  the  mistakes  in  the

system) for registering voters, and without  being

more   adequately  prepared.  We  know  that   the

identity card system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



is  not perfect, that it needs many amendments. If

we   are  to  use  that  system  as  a  basis  for

elections, checks and cross-checks will have to be

made,  and  the  time taken to  do  this  to  hold

elections  in the manner suggested by  the  Member

for Cairnhill will only be a few months within the

time  needed to prepare for elections in a regular

and  proper  way, in the way all Parties  in  this

House are agreed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what harm electioneering can do to

Singapore if it is whipped up by emotionalism  and

political  opportunism. We have  already  suffered

enough.  What the public in Singapore wants  is  a

few more months or a year of steady government and

orderly  progress leading towards the introduction

of  the new constitution, not the jumping into  an

election at the demand and whim of the Member  for

Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one thing with which I do agree

with  the  Member for Cairnhill - and  that  is  his

stand  that  those  who  are  detained  under  the

Preservation  of Public Security Ordinance  should

not be allowed to fight an election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Bravo!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> With that I agree. I say that

detained  people who have been given a  chance  to

appeal  to  a tribunal of three judges  should  be

debarred from causing any more trouble. After all,

they  are in the position of persons who have been

sentenced by a court, for although they  have  not

been  tried  publicly, their detention orders  and

papers  have been vetted very carefully  by  three

judges.  What more can they want? If  we  were  to

allow  them to take part in elections, this  would

in  some respect reflect on the integrity and  the

trust  we have put on the judges. To that  extent,

and  to  that extent only, I agree with the Member

for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point of whether we should accept

the  ban imposed by the Secretary of State for the

Colonies.  I stand firm with the other Members  of

this House. I say that the ban is unacceptable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



to  us because it is undemocratic.  It

was  imposed upon us at the last moment. We  could

not have proper consultations with the Assembly in

Singapore.  Are  we  going  then  to   blame   our

delegates  for reserving the right to  refer  that

ban,  that  demand, to us, to this House,  to  say

whether  we  accept  or  reject  the  demand   and

condition of Her Majesty's Government that no  one

detained   under  the  Public  Security  Ordinance

should be allowed to contest an election?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no hesitation whatever in opposing

the   amendment   proposed  by  the   Member   for

Cairnhill.  I  say to our delegates on  what  they

have  brought back to us from London:  Well  done,

and thanks!



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think it is wrong for the seconder of an amendment

to  keep silent and see the debate develop into  a

wrong angle. During these few days, the Press  and

social circles have said there is a big row in the

Assembly, with one lone voice, that of the  Member

for  Cairnhill, raised against the motion. He  has

moved an amendment reading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"regretfully takes note of the Report of the

Singapore Constitutional Conference held in London

in March and April 1957, as contained in Sessional

Paper  No. Misc. 2 of 1957; and nevertheless calls

for   the  immediate  implementation  of  the  new

Constitution  on  the  basis  that   all   persons

qualified  by residence for citizenship  shall  be

entitled to vote at the first elections".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is there anything wrong in principle with

this  amendment? If the Member for  Cairnhill  had

moved   it   without  so  much  emotionalism   and

bitterness, would not the amendment be  considered

a    reasonable   one,   especially   the   second

part - "nevertheless   calls   for   the   immediate

implementation  of  the  new  Constitution"?   The

Government Parties and also the P.A.P and Liberal-Socialists  have stated they are for early - though

not   immediate - implementation   of   the   new

Constitution.  The only difference, therefore,  is

in  the  words  "immediate" and "early";  yet  the

amendment of the Member for Cairnhill led to  such

bitter argument.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the amendment "regrets". To

many  outsiders  who  are not  interested  in  the

welfare   of   Singapore,  the   debate   may   be

fascinating and dramatical. But to me, it is  most

regrettable. I regretted the situation as far back

as last year in London, when, at the most critical

moment in the talks, I moved an adjournment to let

the  Singapore Delegation withdraw, to give  it  a

last  chance  to  find a way  out.  Sir,  I  still

remember   that  I  said,  "Let  us   accept   the

offer - under protest. We have nothing with which to

fight  the strength of the United Kingdom. Let  us

take whatever is offered, even though it is 'half-baked'," as the ex-Chief Minister said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As citizens of this commercial entrepot, we are

bound  to  possess a bit of the practical business

spirit. We therefore say that something is  better

than  nothing.  Why  cannot  we  face  facts?  The

British Crown adorns this House, looks on Members.

Do  we forget that our status is that of a colony?

A few days back, the Member for Sembawang was very

worried   about   the  Admiralty  beginning   mass

dismissals of local civilian workers at the  Naval

Base. This caused alarm to the Services Unions, as

many  people might become jobless. Yet, Sir, on  a

political principle, is it not a very happy  event

for  us  if  the British Admiralty cuts  down  its

base,  as  it  would then mean a  decline  of  the

dominant imperial power? However, we cannot afford

to  lose  the income provided by the British  base

here;  we  ask that Britain send more  battleships

here,  to  provide  employment  for  Singaporeans.

Without  the British Navy, where will be the  rice

bowl for many thousands of Singapore workers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are all plain facts in front of us; yet

we  argue about shadows. Supreme power still  lies

in London. Britain not only has over-riding powers

now,  but even has the right to interfere  in  our

internal  affairs  to maintain internal  security.

This is clear, yet the challenge of the Member for

Cairnhill is criticised and the agreement  appears

to be happily received.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was absent from the party to welcome home

the  Merdeka  Mission. I put up a  personal  one-man

protest; I repeated my stand of last year. How can

one  be  happy  in a nationalist  struggle  if  an

agreement is reached leaving external defence  and

external  affairs  still  in  the  hands  of   the

controlling  power, of the enemy we are  fighting?

Britain imposed an unreasonable condition  at  the

last   minute - the  ban  on  subversive   elements

standing  for elections. Britain could be  clearly

shown  to  be unreasonable for trying to interfere

in our internal administration. Whether subversive

elements  should be allowed to stand for elections

or  not  is  our  business.  Britain  has  clearly

promised to grant Singapore complete internal self-government.  Sir, I  know  my  knowledge  of  the

English  language  is poor,  but  I  do  know  the

meaning that "complete" means "full". Yet  we  are

to  have  an Internal Security Council,  although,

with  the  help  of  Allah, a  Minister  from  the

Federation with a casting vote will sit on  it  to

safeguard  us.  We  conceded  powers  of  external

defence   and  external  affairs,  but  we   never

promised  Britain control over internal  security,

we  never asked the British to be our saviours. We

say,  on  matters connected with external  defence

and  external  affairs, we do not mind  that  they

have  a  say;  but  we  are  against  a  permanent

arrangement   on  an  internal  security   council

whereby  the  British should  interfere  in  every

detail  of our internal administration. So why  do

we  not  take this opportunity to stir up, and  to

educate our masses to have strong nationalism  and

make a more realistic approach to our struggle  in

future?  The most important point we  can  say  is

that  we regretfully accept the agreement. If  the

Secretary  of  State  for  the  Colonies  had  not

imposed   that  ban  at  the  last   moment,   the

atmosphere   would   have  been   very   friendly,

Britain's  attitude very sincere. But  it  is  not

sincere: it is not very co-operative. The ban  was

unreasonable, undemocratic; yet when the All-Party

Delegation protested, the Secretary of State  said

we  had  to sign although we could make a note  of

our opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there is a lot of cause

to  say that we can only regretfully take note  of

the  agreement.  The Hon. the Chief  Minister  has

told  the House that we have achieved our mission.

I  remember I also heard the Hon. the Minister for

Education  say  the same thing in Hokkien  at  the

padang  rally. But we will still be a colony  with

no  hope  of  reaching dominion status.  Yet,  the

Ministers very happily tell us, "We have got  what

we want. We have achieved everything." Sir, we can

take  note  of what we have achieved but,  at  the

same time, express regret at what we have not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reason why we should express regret is

entirely  different from that of  the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  who  spoke  of  "bitter  failure"  and

"stony   silence".  I  have  my  own  reason   for

supporting  the amendment. The first  is  that  we

must  not  sell  out our national aspirations.  We

must  not create a false impression in our  people

that  we  have already got what we want,  that  we

will be happy and contented with what we have  and

that there need be no further struggle. The second

reason  is  that we lost a chance of winning  over

the sympathy of our brothers in the Federation. We

find Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Chief Minister of the

Federation, very co-operative. Why cannot we  have

more  faith  in  our brothers and sisters  in  the

Federation?  They support a merger,  as  has  been

mentioned  by  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar;  at

least  the Party Ra'ayat supports a merger. So  if

we  can  create the impression that the  Singapore

Delegation only regretfully accepts the agreement,

we  can  win the sympathy of our brothers  in  the

Federation; for we then indicate that we have only

one  aim, one hope - to be independent we must merge

with  the  Federation.  At present,  most  of  the

leaders in the Federation are against merger  (but

not  the people of the Federation). By taking  the

agreement  in such a very happy way, we have  lost

the  chance  of  winning over the  Federation,  to

create a good impression on our neighbours. As one

Indian  paper  said, the people of Singapore  seem

satisfied with what they have, so why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



should  anybody try to help them to achieve  their

national aspirations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I have my own reason for supporting the

amendment.  It is simple and reasonable;  it  will

render  high and valuable service to this  country

if accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entirely disagree with the Member for

Cairnhill's reason for condemning the agreement. I

maintain  my  stand  last year - that  something  is

better than nothing, but we should always remember

to  keep alive our national aspirations among  the

people and try to win more sympathisers across the

Causeway and in other South-East Asian countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek permission to refer to today's Free

Press news on a by-election contest between the ex-Chief  Minister,  Mr  Marshall,  and  the  P.A.P.

leader, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, Mr Lee Kuan

Yew, stating that it may have very significant  if

not dangerous repercussions according to political

circles.  To  me,  this  situation  has  developed

because of the amendment. When the House adjourned

yesterday,  I spoke to a few Members,  asked  them

how  such  a  thing could come about. Did  anybody

think of the consequences? I have three reasons to

oppose the by-election-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not debating the by-election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I thought

the  question of the by-election is connected with

my  comment  on the amendment. Such a  by-election

would  appear to have resulted from the moving  of

the  amendment. Are we prepared to lose one of our

brilliant Members, when there are so few  in  this

Assembly? This morning, I told a Member that  this

Assembly  could lose hundreds of Lim  Cher  Khengs

but  could  not  afford to  lose  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  or the Member for Cairnhill.  They

are useful and we are proud of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thought of the repercussions of a by-election arising from the introduction of the

amendment.  The  main  motion  is  backed  by  all

Parties,  including  the  P.A.P. and  the  Labour

Front. If the Member for Tanjong Pagar should lose

the  by-election - brought about by the amendment

to the motion - it would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



mean that, indirectly, the people of Singapore had

censured the Government, and the Government should

resign. What will be the repercussions after that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I seek your permission to convey my

appeal  to the Member for Cairnhill and the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar to withdraw the challenges they

have made. I also plead that especially the Trades

Union Congress should try to do something to  stop

this great harm being done to the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Can I speak on the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

another  six  minutes to go before the  moment  of

interruption and I had hoped that Standing  Orders

would  be  exempted to enable this  debate  to  be

concluded  today, as the Member for Cairnhill  has

said that this is a very important motion-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> And should be given time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It was not a Government

motion, Sir; it was a motion I put in as leader of

the  delegation  and it could not take  precedence

over Government motions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi speaks eloquently in

support of the amendment. He says that he supports

it  to the extent that he "regretfully" takes note

of  the  Report. I am sure he will  remember  that

before  the All-Party Delegation left for  London,

we  received  a mandate from all Members  in  this

Assembly,  including him. We went;  we  discharged

the  mandate; we came back with what he wanted - and

he  told  us  he "regretfully" takes note  of  the

agreement we reached. Perhaps, Sir, it is  because

of  his own confessed inability to express himself

in  the  English  language, which  I  am  sure  is

foreign to him just as it is foreign to me-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point for explanation? If the Chief

Minister gives way, yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Has not the Hon. the Chief

Minister   announced  in  this  House   that   the

delegation failed to achieve two points?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is what I say, Sir, his

self-confessed  inability to  express  himself  of

course  makes one also feel that he has difficulty

in  understanding what is expressed. I pointed out

to him, Sir, in my main speech, that, in so far as

that  demand  is concerned, we should  remove  the

control  from the Colonial Office to that  of  the

Commonwealth  Relations Office; I pointed  out  to

him  that  in  the  All-Party Conference,  it  was

decided  that the All-Party Delegation should  not

press for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I did not know that.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We were asked that we should

try  to get what we could, but should not make  an

issue   of   it.  The  All-Party  Delegation   has

therefore discharged its duties towards  the  All-Party  Conference.  What more  can  the  All-Party

Delegation do?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the other point, the question of equal

rates  of  pay and conditions of employment for civilian

workers  in  the Services, I pointed out  in  my  speech

yesterday  that it could not be a constitutional  issue,

that  it was put in by the All-Party Conference in order

to  enable  the  All-Party Delegation to  bring  up  the

subject in London and hope for the best. And I also said

yesterday that the Government is very interested in this

particular  issue  and  will do all  it  can  to  render

assistance to the workers' organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this debate has taken a turn which makes me most

unhappy, in the sense that I have been criticised  quite

a  lot  by the Member for Cairnhill. I do not mind that,

but now that he has issued a challenge to the Member for

Tanjong Pagar to hold a by-election, I find that I am in

a very difficult position, in that if I were to reply to

all  the  personal attacks on me, I might prejudice  his

chances at the polls-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do not worry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> But that if I were not to reply to

him,  it  would  not be fair because he  has  levelled,

shall we say, unreasonable and unfair criticism not only

at   me,  but  also  at  my  colleagues  (who  were  his

colleagues  not  so  long ago). The Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  has replied to many points raised by him,  and  I

will  therefore not recount the same things.  But  there

are  many  other points raised by the Member for  Cairnhill  in  his  very lengthy attack yesterday  and  today

which  remain to be answered. He went to the  extent  of

referring to the "Sir Rendel-Yew Hock Constitution"  and

the  "Lennox-Boyd-Yew Hock Constitution". Sir, may I say

this,  that  I do not claim credit for any constitution.

The constitution - if we get it -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



is one negotiated by the All-Party Delegation of which I

am happy and proud to have been the leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Mission, the Member for Cairnhill was

rather  touched by my loyalty. He went to the extent  of

saying, "Here is this man who was most loyal to me." And

I   thereby  pledged  my  loyalty  to  him.  Expressions

sometimes mean one thing, Sir, deeds mean another. Now I

am  to  be,  shall  we  say, held  up  to  ridicule  for

discharging  a job which I had been entrusted  to  do - no

more than that. I did not go to London to do what I felt

was good for the people of Singapore by trying to change

my  mind  from day to day, trying to think of new  ideas

from hour to hour. I went there with a mandate from this

Assembly, leading an All-Party Delegation, and  an  All-Party Delegation that was really united.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption. Further

consideration, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Monday, 29th April, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining items on the Order Paper read, and set down

for Monday, 29th April.
