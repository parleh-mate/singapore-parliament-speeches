<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>EMERGENCY (AMENDMENT No. 2) REGULATIONS, 1955</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>(RE-INTRODUCTION OF CURFEW)</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is a sad and an anxious  occasion.

It  is  barely  three weeks since this  new  Assembly,

mainly  composed  of  elected representatives  of  the

people  of  Singapore,  was formally  opened  and  the

Government of the majority party stated its  programme

for  the  coming year. We had then many fine  speeches

and keen cut and thrust in debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, less than three weeks later, it has been the

unfortunate duty of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



Government to call this second sitting as an emergency

sitting in order that this House may have a chance  of

considering matters of the most grievous importance to

the  future of Singapore. So it is, Sir, with  sadness

and anxiety that I rise to move the motion standing in

my name on the Order Paper today,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection (4)

of  section  4 of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance,

1948  (No.  17  of 1948), as amended by the  Emergency

Regulations  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1948  (No.  39  of

1948)   and   the  Emergency  Regulations  (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1951  (No. 9 of 1951)  resolves  that  the

Emergency (Amendment No. 2) Regulations, 1955, made on

the   13th   day  of  May,  1955,  and  published   as

Notification  No. S 143 in the Gazette Supplement  No.

38  of 13th May, 1955, as contained in Sessional Paper

No. S.L. 10 of 1955, shall continue in force until the

expiration or revocation of any Proclamation extending

the  period of the Proclamation of Emergency published

as  Notification  No. S 219 in the Gazette  Supplement

No. 50 of 26th July, 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That motion seeks the approval of this Assembly to

the Emergency Regulation restoring to the Commissioner

of  Police power to impose a curfew in such areas  and

at such times as he thinks necessary. It is only three

weeks,  Sir,  since that Regulation was revoked  at  a

time  when  we, on this side of the House, hoped  that

the  situation  in  Singapore and the  development  of

responsible leadership was such that we could, without

harm to the safety of Singapore, consider relaxing and

repealing the Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then we have had a night of terror in the

streets  of Singapore - a night of rioting and bloodshed

and  killing by wild mobs - a night which demanded  that

the  power to impose an immediate curfew to clear  the

streets   should  be  restored.  The  Government   the

following  day by administrative order gave back  this

power  to  the  Commissioner of Police, and  now  this

morning  we seek the full and wholehearted support  of

this  House in taking that additional emergency  power

and  in  supporting us in every measure which  we  may

have to take in order to keep the peace in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the last few days have shown the horror

and the hatred that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



can  be  created  by  irresponsible political  leaders

working  on  crowds  of  normally  decent  law-abiding

workers.  We have suffered disgrace to the  reputation

of Singapore throughout the world, and particularly in

that  great  and friendly democracy which  has  always

shown  its  full  sympathy to peoples  moving  towards

independence - one of whose citizens has  been  savagely

beaten to death by a mob of Singapore people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a ghastly setback to Singapore's claim to

responsibility  and maturity, to the  claim  that  the

people  of  Singapore  and the  political  leaders  of

Singapore are ready and capable of managing their  own

affairs.  We  are  met together today  at  the  second

sitting of this newly-elected Assembly that has had to

be  called  urgently to consider maintaining  law  and

order in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of these terrible days have been fully

reported  in the Press, though I am sorry to  have  to

say  that certain Chinese newspapers have still failed

to  give  any support to the side of law and order.  I

hope  and  I  appeal  to them to  see  their  duty  as

responsible citizens. I think, Sir, that hon.  Members

of  this  House will wish me to give a  clear  and  an

accurate  account  of the events  leading  up  to  the

disorders and of the terrible events on the  night  of

Thursday,  May  12.  I think, too,  Sir,  that  it  is

important that such a statement should be accurate and

correct  as to timings of the various events. I  have,

therefore,  had  prepared a  report  of  the  security

situation and how the trouble developed, and with your

indulgence, Sir, and that of the House, I should  like

to read that report to the House so that we may all be

well aware of the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mornings of the 25th and 26th April, 1955,

strikers  of the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus  Company  at

Alexandra  Road  attempted  to  stop  the  buses  from

leaving  the Depot by sitting on the ground completely

blocking the main gate with a human barrier with  arms

and  legs  interlocked. The management of the  Company

appealed to the Police to obtain their right  of  free

passage in and out of the Depot. On both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



these   mornings,   the  arrival  of   strong   Police

formations  persuaded the strikers to  give  up  their

attempt to stop the buses, and no force was necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the 27th April, about 150 strikers

again formed their human barrier in front of the  main

gate  and, despite exhortations to move by the Police,

and despite repeated warnings that they were offending

against  the law by physically preventing  freedom  of

movement  to  the  buses, they stubbornly  refused  to

move. The Police first attempted to move them by using

divisional  Police  to pull them  away.  The  strikers

resisted strongly, and the Police efforts to move them

in this manner proved unavailing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squad of Police from the reserve unit, who are

specially trained in unarmed combat to deal with  this

type  of  incident, was then instructed  to  move  the

strikers  away from the gate. This they  succeeded  in

doing  quickly and efficiently without any undue force

being  used,  and  the buses were  able  to  move  out

unmolested.  Stones were thrown at the  Police  during

this operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the strikers who had been manhandled away

from  the gate feigned injury, and two of them lay  on

the  ground  near the gate, being tended  by  friends,

complaining   that  they  were  seriously   hurt.   An

ambulance   was  immediately  called,  whereupon   the

injured  men made themselves scarce and could  not  be

found when the ambulance arrived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the rest of the day there were large

congregations of strikers, sympathisers  and  students

outside  the  Bus Company Depot; fiery  speeches  were

made  through loud-speakers inciting the  strikers  to

further  opposition to the Police, and condemning  the

so-called  Police brutality. The action taken  by  the

Police  was  grossly exaggerated by the agitators  and

their  student  sympathisers.  Fifteen  strikers  were

reported to have been brutally assaulted, whereas,  in

fact, no single striker suffered anything more serious

than  superficial bruises, although  they  had  to  be

forcibly   separated  from  each  other  and  resisted

stubbornly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indignation meetings, supported by large groups

of  students  and addressed continuously by  agitators

through  loud-speakers, continued  for  several  days,

deliberately designed to whip up hatred and  hostility

towards  the Police Force as a whole. Throughout  this

period  of  growing tension, the Police did everything

in their power to prevent any incident occurring which

might  provoke a clash, and thereby nullify the  great

efforts  being  made  by the Chief  Minister  and  the

Minister   for   Labour  to  reach  a  settlement   by

negotiation.  The  forces of evil, through  agitation,

false allegations, intimidation, and deliberate rabble-rousing methods continued to fan the flames of  hatred

against  the Police, who stood by with admirable  calm

and suffered abuse and jeers from crowds of up to five

and seven thousand workers, sympathisers and students,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly two weeks of constant efforts to obtain

a  settlement,  the negotiations broke down,  and  the

Police  were  ordered by the Government to  take  such

action as was necessary to ensure the right of passage

of buses which the Company was prepared to operate. On

the  morning  of Tuesday, 10th May, 1955 the  strikers

again  resorted to their manoeuvre of forming a  human

barrier in front the gate. The Commissioner of  Police

himself, accompanied by two Magistrates, exhausted all

means  of  peacefully persuading  them  to  move.  The

Magistrates  ordered the Police to  disperse  them  as

they  were an unlawful assembly within the meaning  of

the  Penal  Code. The Commissioner of Police dispersed

them  by  means of hoses from trailer pumps. The  buses

were  then  able to resume service to the public.  Ten

persons   complained  of  injuries  in   this   Police

operation,  and eight were carried into ambulances  on

stretchers.  On arrival at the General Hospital  these

eight  stretcher  cases were treated,  and  it  is  of

interest  that the medical report received  two  hours

later  stated:  Except for one man who  was  suffering

from   mild   concussion,  the  remainder  had   minor

abrasions  or  contusions and  were  treated  as  out-patients. One had no apparent injuries whatsoever.  So

much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



for  the  stretcher cases carried into ambulances  and

taken  to the General Hospital, alleged to be severely

injured  by  the  brutal  Police,  to  which  so  much

publicity  was given by the extremists, and which  has

been  used  as a weapon to fan further hatred  against

the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, 11th May, although the strikers got

into  position again to block the gate,  they  changed

their minds when the Police arrived on the scene,  and

the buses were able to come out. A further twenty-four

hours of more meetings outside the Depot, addressed by

agitators   condemning  the  Police  and   threatening

concerted  action by all labour if the  Police  should

again interfere, succeeded in stiffening the morale of

the  strikers  who again attempted to stop  the  buses

coming out on the morning of Thursday, 12th May.  Once

again,  the  efforts  of senior  Police  officers  and

Magistrates failed to persuade them to obey  the  law;

once  more  the Police were ordered by the Magistrates

to  disperse them by force. They were again  dispersed

with  water,  but on this occasion the crowd  gathered

round and bricks and stones were hurled at the Police.

One  officer  was  injured in  the  face,  and  others

received minor injuries. The buses came out, but three

of them were damaged by stones hurled by the crowd and

had  to  return. Throughout the morning of  the  12th,

there was widespread propaganda against the Police  by

agitators addressing students and workers, and efforts

were made to call out other labour unions to strike in

sympathy with the men of the Hock Lee Bus Company  who

had been so brutally treated by the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 1.45 p.m. a Hock Lee bus was attacked by a

gang  of  hooligans,  and the Commissioner  of  Police

immediately ordered a full stand-by of all  Police  in

the  island,  as he rightly feared that this  incident

might  develop into general rioting. During  the  next

three  hours there were two further attacks  on  buses

which  had  stones  thrown at them,  and  the  drivers

sought  Police  protection. By 3  p.m. the  remaining

drivers  of  the buses were intimidated into  stopping

the service and large crowds of workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>

strikers  and students converged in growing  numbers

in  the  area  in  which the Hock Lee Bus  Company  is

located.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 3 o'clock it was clear to the Commissioner that

very  large numbers of workers and students were being

organised throughout the island and were converging on

the  Alexandra  Road  area by  bus  and  by  lorry.  A

comprehensive   system  of  Police   road-blocks   was

immediately  established  throughout  Singapore,   and

wherever  lorries  or buses were encountered  carrying

students  or workers, they were stopped by the  Police

and  ordered back. Some refused to obey, and  in  such

cases  the  vehicles were immobilised  by  the  Police

removing the rotor-arms in the distributors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile a tight Police cordon of road-blocks was

thrown  round  the  danger  area  bounded  by  Gillman

Circus,  Alexandra Circus, Tanglin Road  junction  of

Jervois  Road,  Delta Road junction of  Jervois  Road,

River  Valley  Road, junction of  Kim  Seng  Road  and

Havelock Road, right down to Outram Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These road-blocks were designed to make it virtually

impossible for any person to enter the danger area  by

road   without   being  stopped.  They  also   stopped

organised  bodies of students and workers  in  lorries

from swelling the hostile crowds, but there were large

numbers of students and others who infiltrated on foot

through  the  surrounding open  country,  particularly

after  dark. From 5 o'clock onwards Radio  Malaya  and

Rediffusion, at the request of the Police, interrupted

programmes  to  give frequent warnings to  law-abiding

citizens  that the area described above was  dangerous

and asking motorists and others to avoid entering it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police plan to protect life and property was to

prevent  reinforcements from  arriving  to  swell  the

crowds,  by  these methods to cordon  the  area  where

trouble  was  likely to occur, to prevent  law-abiding

citizens  from  going  into  danger  unwittingly,   to

maintain a powerful Police guard round the main target

of  the  rioters, which was the Hock Lee Bus Depot  in

Alexandra Road, and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



use  mobile  Police squads within the danger  area  to

deal with individual attacks on property. At this time

the  General  Officer Commanding was  alerted  to  put

troops  in readiness to come to the aid of the  Police

if required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. there were incidents of

stones  and bottles being thrown at Police on duty  in

the  danger area; and on three occasions hostile  mobs

of  up  to  1,000  people attacking  the  Police  were

dispersed  by tear smoke. Some arrests were made,  but

as  was expected, it was not until after dark that the

mobs  made determined efforts to attack Police  posts,

road-blocks,  individual policemen  and  Radio  Patrol

cars.  By  this time the Police had completely  sealed

off  the  area by road-blocks, had stopped lorry-loads

of  students  and  workers from reinforcing,  and  had

strong  guards  in  the Bus Depot  and  mobile  Police

reserves within the danger area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police were hampered by the darkness and the

nature  of  the  terrain from effecting  arrests,  and

throughout  the  night  up to  3  a.m. on  the  13th,

repeated  hit-and-run  attacks were  made  on  Police,

while  the liberal use of tear smoke by mobile  Police

patrols succeeded in keeping the mobs on the move  and

prevented  them  from concentrating in  any  organised

attempt  to overwhelm the Police by weight of numbers.

The   greatest  restraint  was  shown  by  all  Police

personnel on duty, including the Volunteer Police  who

worked  side  by side with the regulars  in  a  manner

which  deserved the highest praise and thanks  of  the

public.  Throughout  this night of confused  fighting,

hit-and-run  attacks on the Police, attacks  on  road-blocks, setting up of street barricades by the mobs to

prevent  Police mobility, there was only one  occasion

on  which  a  Police  officer was forced  to  use  his

revolver,  and  on one occasion the commander  of  the

reserve unit troop fired a round of buckshot. The case

of  the  Police officer who used his revolver to  save

his   life   is  typical  of  the  high   morale   and

determination  of every man not to cause  more  damage

than  was  absolutely necessary. About  10.35  p.m. a

Police  Radio Patrol car "Peter One-One" was  cornered

in Prince Philip Avenue by a large mob



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



carrying  poles  and  sticks and  hurling  stones  and

bottles. "Peter One-One" with Police Lieutenant Harris

and  three  constables, one of whom was  a  volunteer,

radioed  to Control for urgent assistance. The nearest

unengaged  troop  of the reserve unit was  immediately

warned to race to the help of "Peter One-One". It  was

hindered  by  large  bricks and rocks  strewn  on  the

roadway to prevent its progress. Meanwhile "Peter One-

One"  was systematically being smashed up and the mobs

were  advancing closer and closer on Police Lieutenant

Harris  and  his  three men who were reporting  calmly

back  to Control that their Radio car was smashed  up,

that they were about to be overrun, that they had used

up  all their tear smoke and as they put it to Control

over  the  air,  "It  looks as if  we  have  had  it."

Meanwhile the reserve unit was forcing its way through

to  their rescue. The last message received from Radio

car  "Peter One-One" was "They are on us. I fired four

shots  from my revolver, but not at the mob." At  that

moment the reserve unit arrived at the scene, the  mob

scattered and disappeared in all directions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 3 o'clock on the morning of the 13th May the

rioting died down and the mobs had dispersed, although

large numbers were still lurking in groups of ten  and

twenty in the darkness of the surrounding grounds  and

buildings,  throwing stones and bricks at  the  Police

clearing  the  roads of obstruction  and  towing  away

damaged vehicles. By 6 o'clock in the morning  it  was

found that in addition to the numerous Police officers

who  had suffered minor injuries from bottles,  sticks

and  stones,  and  who refused to go to  hospital  for

treatment, the casualty list included:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One policeman killed; one so seriously injured that

he  has  since  died  in hospital;  ten  other  Police

officers  injured  of  whom  two  are  still  on   the

dangerously  ill  list; and from the Police  point  of

view,  the  most  tragic death  of  all,  an  innocent

civilian killed in the riots who was Mr Gene  Symonds

of  the  United Press. The cause of his death will  be

the  subject of a Coroner's inquest, but it  is  quite

clear that he was killed by the mob.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evening the only revolver

shots  fired  so  far known by the Police  were  those

fired by Police Lieutenant Harris, but the body  of  a

young  Chinese was brought to the General Hospital  at 1.10  a.m. with a gunshot wound in the region  of  his heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Teo, a Volunteer Special Constable in uniform,

was  set upon by a mob at 8.50 p.m. on the 12th  while

driving  along Alexandra Road. He was beaten to  death

by  the  mob  and  the car overturned and  burnt.  His

companion, Volunteer Sergeant Kenneth Koh, was rescued

by  the arrival of the reserve unit and suffered  head

injuries only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Inspector Teoh and three Detective Police

officers were set upon at the same time and place, and

the  car  in which they were travelling was overturned

and  burnt.  Detective  Corporal  Yuen  was  so  badly

injured  and  burnt  that he has  since  died  of  his

injuries.  The arrival of the reserve unit  saved  the

others.  All  were  armed but they  did  not  fire.  A

bystander  picked  up  the  revolver  of  the  wounded

Detective  Corporal while the mob was being dispersed,

and  shortly afterwards handed it in to Tanjong  Pagar

Police Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Corporal Ho on a motorcycle was intercepted

by a mob at 9.20 p.m. in Leng Kee Road just behind the

Thye Hone Factory and was beaten up by the crowd.  His

revolver  was stolen and he was left unconscious.  The

reserve unit dispersed the mob and picked him  up.  He

did not fire his revolver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteer Police Lance-Corporal Simon was on duty at

Police  road-blocks at Pulau Saigon at 9.45 p.m. with

four  other Volunteer policemen and two regulars. They

were  attacked and overrun by a screaming mob of  over

200. They did not open fire. Lance-Corporal Simon  was

left  unconscious with multiple head  injuries  and  a

dislocated shoulder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Chinese who was shot was aged 16, a student

living at 799-D Havelock Road. When he was brought to

hospital  at  1.10  a.m. on the  13th  he  was  dead,

suffering from a gunshot wound



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



which was alleged to have been fired between 9.30  and 10.30   p.m.   The  young  Chinese  was   not   killed

instantaneously but was carried around the  town  from

Alexandra  Road, and possibly as far as  Middle  Road,

before being sent to hospital hours later when he  was

dead. The bullet had pierced the lung, and it is quite

possible  his life might have been saved if  his  body

had not been used for propaganda purposes for hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the shot which wounded this young

Chinese  was  one  of the four shots fired  by  Police

Lieutenant Harris at 10.35 p.m. above the heads of the

mob  which  attacked him, but this has  not  yet  been

established.  In  addition to the 16  Police  officers

killed  or  injured, there were two cases of civilians

being  injured.  In  one case  a  European  lady  and

gentleman driving a car down Henderson Road  at  about 12.15 a.m. were set on by a mob of twenty Chinese,  armed with sticks, stones and bottles. They managed  to

run  into a nearby flat where they were harboured  and

later  sent to hospital. The lady was unhurt  but  the

gentleman   was  slightly  injured.  The  other   case

concerned two Chinese who received pellet wounds  from

the  reserve  unit  shotgun loaded with  the  smallest

gauge of buckshot. Both were treated as out-patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except, therefore, for the death of Mr Symonds and

the  Chinese  student, the injuries  caused  to  other

civilians were slight both in numbers and severity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, May 13, was quieter. There were large

numbers  of  strikers moving about in the city,  their

numbers  greatly swollen by an almost complete  strike

of  bus  workers throughout the island.  There  was  a

minor  incident  in Penang Road; but,  throughout  the

day,  there  was  less  organised  violence.  It   is,

perhaps,  significant that on that day, Friday,  there

were  no organised parties of Chinese students in  the

town.  Individual Police were subjected to booing  and

stoning, and there were bands of young hooligans going

round  the town throwing stones and slashing  motorcar

tyres.  In the evening two cars belonging to Europeans

up toward Changi were set on fire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Saturday, was again a day of tension

and  uncertainty. There was a clear possibility  of  a

dangerous demonstration over the funeral of the  young

Chinese student, but thanks to tactful handling,  this

passed  off  without incident. That evening,  as  hon.

Members  know,  my  hon.  Friend  the  Chief  Minister

succeeded  in  getting a settlement of  the  Hock  Lee

strike, and yesterday there was a marked lessening  of

tension,  and transport returned to work. We  are  now

left,  I think, with only a comparatively small number

of genuine industrial disputes. The tension has eased,

but  I  want  all  Members of this  House  to  realise

clearly and to face the hard fact that we still have a

potentially dangerous situation which at any time  may

require  the firmest possible measures to support  law

and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all Members of this House will wish me to

express  our  deep  regret that men should  have  been

killed by a Singapore mob, and to express our full and

sincere sympathy with the families of those killed, in

their  tragic loss. In particular, we grieve  for  the

loss  of  those two Police officers and the journalist

who  were killed doing no more than their duty. I hope

that  others who were injured may have a speedy return

to full strength and health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want also to pay tribute to the courage and

discipline and training of our Police Force. Not  once

during  that  long  night  of hysterical  burning  and

killing  did their courage or their discipline falter.

All the men were armed but you have heard that on only

two  occasions did they fire; and you have  heard  the

price   they  paid  for  that  discipline   and   that

restraint.  Two  men killed; others  still  critically

ill,  and  many more injured. These are the men,  Sir,

who saved Singapore from the devil on the night of May

12.  It  was  they  who restored order  without  doing

damage -  with  only one death not known to  have  been

caused by the mob.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, May 12, is a black day in Singapore's

history, but it has, in some measure, been relieved by

the behaviour, the gallantry and the competence of our

Police Force of whom every one of us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



should  be  proud and to whom everyone of us  owes  an

immeasurable debt of gratitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded, Sir, of words of comfort spoken last

Saturday afternoon at the funeral of Volunteer Special

Constable Andrew Teo. The words were spoken  by  Canon

Adams,  the Headmaster of his old school. Canon  Adams

told us so wisely that afternoon that we should temper

our  grief  at a young life cruelly cut off by  giving

thanks  to  God,  giving thanks to God that  Singapore

produced  young men like Andrew Teo, and I do suggest,

Sir, that we should all take hope and courage from the

fact  that, thank God, there are hundreds of men  and,

indeed,  women  in Singapore like Andrew  Teo - men  and

women  who do not seek wealth, who do not seek  power,

who  do not seek fame - they only seek to serve,  to  do

their  duty  to  their  fellow-citizens,  to  help  to

maintain  all  that is honourable and  decent  in  our

lives.  Thank  God we can find them. We find  them  as

youngsters in the Boy Scouts and the Boys Brigade.  We

find  them when they grow up in the Singapore Military

Forces,  in the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve,

in  the  Malayan  Auxiliary Air  Force;  and  we  find

them - thank  God - in  our  Police  Force.  It  is  these

men - regulars and volunteers - in our Police Force who do

their  duty under training and discipline even  if  it

means giving their lives for us. It is to them that we

owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude. Yet it is these

men  who are still today being lyingly slandered;  who

are  being maliciously attacked; who are being  stoned

in  the streets; who are being booed at and jeered  at

by misguided students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the main features of this grim story? First

of  all,  on  the Government side, we have been  faced

with  many  strikes - not all of them unreasonable,  but

they  have  been  timed and fomented by  irresponsible

leaders  in order that those leaders could demonstrate

their   power   and  could  challenge   the   lawfully

constituted Government. I do not intend, Sir, to dwell

on  the  issues involved in these industrial  disputes

except  to  say that, given responsible leadership,  I

know of no reason why those disputes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



should  not  be  settled  fairly  and  justly  without

disorder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. Friend the Minister for Labour has worked

untiringly  every day and a good part of  every  night

since  this  House  last  met,  using  his  skill  and

experience  in  industrial  matters  and   his   known

sympathy  for  the  cause of  unions  and  workers  in

attempts   to  promote  negotiations  and   to   reach

settlements.  He  has  been constantly  frustrated  by

individuals who clearly do not want grievances  to  be

removed, but are out to maintain unrest and are out to

exploit  the genuine grievances of decent workers  for

their own evil ends. We have used, Sir, every possible

endeavour to secure settlement through peaceful means.

As  soon as the gravity of the Hock Lee dispute became

evident,  my  hon.  Friend appointed  a  Committee  of

Inquiry  to  search  out the facts  and  find  a  just

solution,   but  these  attempts  have   always   been

thwarted.  It  was our object and hope that  we  could

prove  to the workers that genuine grievances  can  be

settled   in   the  proper  way  by  negotiation   and

arbitration  and  with  the  full  assistance  of  the

Ministry  of  Labour. We wanted to  win  these  decent

workers  from those who were urging them into  general

strikes and violence and who were out to exploit  them

in  ways which could do nothing but harm both  to  the

unions  and to the workers. The Police, while carrying

out their essential task of maintaining law and order,

did  their  utmost  to  avoid  any  serious  clash  or

physical violence which would inflame tempers and  add

dangers  to the situation, and how magnificently  they

carried  out their task - despite incessant provocation,

despite jeering and stone throwing, despite the  abuse

of  schoolgirls, and despite the grim perils of  being

overrun!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the other side? On the other side, Sir, I

maintain  there  was  a deliberate  and  a  successful

attempt   to   prevent  settlements  and  to   provoke

disorder. There has been a vicious campaign of calumny

and   hatred  against  the  Police.  There  have  been

repeated attempts to incite a clash against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their lust for their own power the People's Action

Party  and  their  covert  Communist  supporters   and

backseat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



drivers  wanted violence and bloodshed and  industrial

unrest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b>Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary:</b> They saw that they would be

discredited  if the Government succeeded  in  settling

these  strikes  without disorder. Then too  late  they

realised what horror they had engineered, and some  of

them - still  only  some  of  them - hastened  to  deplore

violence and to disclaim responsibility for what  they

had  done. Four people have been killed - three of  them

by  the brutality of a mob intoxicated by the speeches

of  those  who would exploit workers and  exploit  the

excitement of Chinese students. I hope that the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) will explain his

part  in this business. He has already stated publicly

that  he  prefers Communism to colonialism. I  say  to

him, Sir, that he has no such easy choice. His choice,

and  the choice of all the people of Singapore, is not

between  Communism  and  colonialism.  It  is  between

Communism and democratic self-government. If the  hon.

Member believes in orderly progress to democratic self-government, then he must be against Communism; and  if

he  is, let him say so loud and clear, with no quibble

and  no  clever  sophistry. He has  deplored  violence

after  hell was let loose and men were killed.  I  ask

him:  What  did  he do to prevent violence  before  it

happened? What did he think was likely to happen when,

at  a  May Day rally organised by his Party under  the

chairmanship  of the hon. Member who sits  behind  him

(Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong), Mr Fong Swee  Suan  of  the

Singapore  Bus Workers' Union, after speaking  of  the

brutal  force  of the Police against  the  workers  on

April 27 - we heard the force used - went on to say,  "All

workers must unite and should not hesitate to organise

themselves into trade unions to struggle for their own

welfare. Workers must know that there is bound  to  be

some  bloodshed in the course of a revolution and they

must rise and unite."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the Member for Tanjong Pagar think that

would lead to? He was, as far as I know still is,  the

legal adviser to the Singapore Bus Workers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



Union,  or to the Hock Lee Bus strikers. What,  I  ask

him,  did  he  do on May 11 and May 12 to stop  decent

workers  being turned into murderous rioters?  Did  he

make  any attempt to stop the extremists in his  Party

staging this night of horror? Is his conscience clear?

Or  did he lose control to the Member for Bukit  Timah

who sits behind him and drives the Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, too, that the Member for Bukit Timah will

declare his position openly before this House and  the

people  of  Singapore.  He has great  power  over  the

Singapore  Factory  and Shop Workers'  Union.  He  has

great power over the Singapore Bus Workers' Union. Did

he or did he not deliberately organise as many strikes

as  he  could during the last few days? Is his concept

of  democracy - government by  general  strike  and  mob

violence - or  does  he stand for peaceful  and  orderly

democracy?  I  ask him to declare his stand  in  these

fateful days for the future of Singapore. Is he for or

against Communism? Is he for or against violence?  And

if he is against violence - and I hope he is - what did he

do to stop those whom he controls from rioting? Did he

go down to Alexandra Road on May 12 and stop this hell

from  breaking loose? He must have known that violence

was  building up. Did he try to stop it? If  not,  why

not? As I have said, the Member for Bukit Timah is the

Secretary  of the Singapore Factory and Shop  Workers'

Union. I ask him whether, in his capacity as Secretary

of  that  Union,  he  approved?  Did  he  approve  the

publication in a manifesto of that Union on 1st May of

the  following verse? I read a translation,  which  of

course  may not be fully accurate. I give it for  what

it  is  worth,  and if any Member wishes  to  see  the

original, he can do so. This verse is called  "A  Land

of Hardship and Suffering".

<pre>

 "Beloved fellow-workers, our Fatherland

    the Great Malaya,

  Has been invaded and occupied by the

    enemy for a very long time already!

  Look! Our brethren have been taken

    away by the enemy to serve as cannon fodder!

  Our sisters have been raped and ruined

    by the enemy!

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

  Now the bloody enemy even wants our

    very bodies!

  Look! The despotic acts of the enemy

    have been displayed!

  Our beloved striking fellow-workers have

    been dragged, pulled, squeezed, beaten

    up and kicked!

  Ah! The workers' bodies of steel are

    unafraid of the enemy's despotic acts!

  Just listen! In the midst of darkness

    the resonant voice is singing which re-

    echoes to the very sky!

  We are thus enabled to secure a unity

    even stronger than steel!

  Nevertheless, the enemy's bloody acts of

    violence have again started!

  Our fresh blood has flowed bespattering

    the ground which has turned crimson

    with our blood!

  The great struggle, the glorious sacrifice,

    our blood has turned Malaya into

    crimson!

  Our fresh crimson blood is turning

    Malaya into even more lurid crimson

    than before!

  Ah! The struggle banner, the blood-red

    banner, the victory banner fluttering

    in the Malayan sky!"

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Member for Bukit Timah approve and consent to

putting that out to the workers on 1st May? And if  he

did,  what  did he think would happen? If he  did  not

think  before, at least let him now be a wiser  and  a

sadder man. What is his attitude to the Police? Has he

or has he not deliberately aroused the workers against

the   Police   by  accusing  them  of  brutality   and

oppression? Sir, there has been a conscious calculated

effort  to stir up hatred against our Police Force  so

that the Police are booed and stoned and jeered at; so

that  the individual constable on traffic duty can  be

ringed   around  by  hooligans  jeering  and  throwing

stones. This is an organised attempt to undermine  the

ability   of  the  Police  Force  to  keep  peace   in

Singapore. And it is still going on. It was  going  on

yesterday, and I expect it is going on today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Member for Bukit Timah support that campaign

or  will  he  condemn it in clear and decisive  terms?

Does he stand for riots and violence, or does he stand

for  peaceful  orderly progress? Will he  support  the

Police in maintaining law and order and peace in  this

island?  Will he support the Police in enabling  women

and  children to sleep quietly in their beds at night,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



not to lie cowering from the terrifying noises of mobs

surging up and down our streets?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the students in Chinese schools? As I have

already  stated,  large numbers of students  from  the

Chinese High School, the Chung Cheng School, the Chung

Hwa Girls' School, the Nan-yang Girls' School, and the

Nan  Chiau Girls' School visited the Hock Lee strikers

day  after  day.  They have also been  visiting  other

strikers.  They  arrived  in lorries,  regimented  and

organised.  They  have given large sums  of  money  to

workers.  They have made speeches. They  have  danced,

and  they  have sung inflammatory songs. And this  has

been  happening  day  after  day.  Students  from  the

Chinese High School and Chung Cheng School have stayed

overnight with Hock Lee strikers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st May several hundred students drove up and down

Alexandra Road in lorries for about an hour,  shouting

"Pom-pah,  down  with  rascals!  Pom-pah,  down   with

cowards!"  They  shouted abuse at the Police,  calling

them "running dogs". They have been round - strikers and

other  crowds - demonstrating and inciting and  singing

Communist songs. I give you the words of some of their

songs.  They are not as horrific as that put forth  by

the  Union  controlled by the Member for Bukit  Timah.

These are the songs they have been singing:

<pre>

  "I love my Malaya, Malaya is my country!

   Japanese time was not free!

   Recently we suffer more!

   After the dogs have gone, the monkeys come!

   Malaya is a hell!

   Brothers and my dear sisters, do not wait any more!

   After the dogs have gone, the monkeys come!

   We lose happiness!

   All the people must wake up to fight for freedom!"

</pre>

Another:

<pre>

  "Ting, tong, ting; ting, tong, ting!

   Hock Lee employers are lunatics!

   They are maltreating the workers heartlessly!

   The students and workers are with one heart!

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

   They have turned the employers into lunatics!

   One, two, three; three, two, one!

   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

   We do not care!

   Seven by three makes twenty-one!

   The monkeys must leave us at once!

   Then we can have our independence!"

</pre>

Another one:

<pre>

  "The mata-mata beating up the fellow-workers!

   Let all listen to me!

   The fellow-workers are suffering!

   On April 27 the mata-mata beat up the fellow workers!

   People say the workers are innocent!

   We, the fellow-workers, want rice to eat; we want jobs to do!

   We won't be oppressed by others!"

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear, Sir, that in certain Chinese

schools  the  students have been highly  organised  to

take  part  in these disputes and to incite  violence.

Lorries  have  been ordered to the schools  and  large

numbers  of  students have been persuaded to  go  into

them  and have then been transported to the scenes  of

strikes and recently to riots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 12, immediately before the situation became

extremely   dangerous,  17  lorry-loads  of   students

arrived down Alexandra Road. They were stopped by  the

Police,  but,  nevertheless, one  lorry  attempted  to

drive  through  the  Police round the  block.  It  was

stopped  and  the students were taken off  the  lorry;

but, of course, we could not stop them flooding across

the  fields through the houses to join in the dispute,

and  it  was at that time that hell began  to  be  let

loose down there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I say, Sir, the students of these Chinese

schools  who  have  done  much  to  cause  hatred  and

bloodshed  in Singapore. Neither the school principals

nor the school committees have done anything to put  a

stop to this subversion of the youth of Singapore. The

principals are frightened. They are frightened that if

they  thwart the Malayan Communist Party they will  be

assassinated. And until the Police took the heart  out

of the Communist killer gangs, they had good reason to

be  frightened.  That is Singapore.  That  is  Chinese

schools. The management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



committees refuse to take a strong line. They seem  to

be, if anything, frightened of the students, and their

one   endeavour  is  to  hand  the  problem   to   the

Government.  The  situation in  these  Chinese  middle

schools  is  the  most  serious  problem  that   faces

Singapore.  Youth in those schools is being  corrupted

and  perverted,  through the skilful  use  of  Chinese

nationalism  and  propaganda, into a dangerous  weapon

for the Malayan Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government has been tolerant and

sympathetic  towards Chinese students. We  offered  to

register  their Middle School Union if they, on  their

side, would undertake to keep clear of politics.  This

offer was rejected with insolence. We did not - perhaps

wrongly - prevent  Chinese  students  moving  about   in

lorries to public meetings and demonstrations  and  to

strikes.  This freedom had been abused until  we  were

faced  with large numbers of Chinese students inciting

violence and themselves mixed up in rioting. Our duty,

Sir, is clear. If no one else will stop these boys and

girls from being worked up, intimidated and regimented

at  their  schools  by a fanatical  few,  loaded  into

lorries,  taken  down to industrial disputes,  pitched

into the middle of riots where men are being killed - if

no  one else will stop them, then the Government must.

We  have a paramount duty to the parents of these boys

and  girls  to protect their children from corruption,

from   injury,  and  possibly  from  death.  We  have,

therefore,  as the House knows, had the  Chinese  High

School  and  the Chung Cheng School closed down  until

further  notice. I am glad to say this of the  Chinese

High  School, that this order was obeyed in an orderly

fashion.  At  the Chung Cheng High  School,  on  the

first  morning, several hundred students were in  open

revolt  against  the  school authorities  closing  the

school. Drastic measures must be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attribute the rioting on Thursday night to

irresponsible   political  leaders  and   to   Chinese

students. It was they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



who  had  deliberately provoked widespread  industrial

unrest  and, by a vicious emotional campaign,  aroused

the workers against the Police. Thus they succeeded in

creating  an  acute  state  of  emergency - a  state  of

emergency  that was contained and ended  only  by  the

discipline  and the steadiness of the Police.  It  was

they  who  paid  the price for saving  Singapore  from

disaster. No doubt the enemies of the Government - both

open and secret - are well content. What could be better

calculated  to  prevent this Government,  this  newly-elected   Government,  carrying   out   its   election

programme - its  programme  for  social   and   economic

progress  in  Singapore -  and thus  consolidating  its

support  from the people? There are those who  do  not

want this Government to succeed. They want it to fail.

They  want  to  create  chaos in  Singapore,  so  that

Communism  may spring out of the ruins and establish  its

ruthless  dictatorship. So they  have  exploited  the

workers,   inflaming  them  against  the  Police   and

inciting  them  to violence. That is not  the  way  to

better  things,  to better working  conditions,  to  a

higher  share in the country's wealth for the workers,

better   housing   and  health   and   schooling,   to

responsible self-government and independence. That  is

the  way to chaos and ruin and Communism. I only  hope

that  the  awful events of these last  few  days  have

opened the eyes of the workers of Singapore that these

leaders  of the extreme Left are leading them  not  to

better things, but to disaster and Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House, Sir, believe that our

ways are true ways, but we cannot go along it if there

is  no  peace in the land, if Singapore is kept  in  a

state  of continued emergency. We hope that this House

will  unanimously  support us in our determination  to

stop  violence  and disorder, and will  give  us  such

emergency powers as are or may be needed to keep peace

and  order -  for keep the peace we must and  will.  If

stern  measures have to be taken, they will be  taken;

and those who persist in inciting peaceful citizens to

become murderous rioters will be dealt with.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approving this motion, I ask all Members of this

House  to declare themselves wholeheartedly behind  us

in  our  task  to  proving that  democracy  and  self-government can work in Singapore. We on this  side  of

the  House, as the Government, are responsible to this

Assembly.  All of us in this Assembly are  responsible

to the people of Singapore for its peace, for its wise

government,   and  for  its  progress  towards   self-government and independence. It is the primary task of

each  and  every one of us in this House to  see  that

peace  is maintained here and that we progress  in  an

orderly manner. He who is not with us in this task  is

against  us,  and  is against the  true  interests  of

Singapore, and if any there be here who do not believe

in peace and democracy, let him now declare it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House to treat my motion this morning as a

vote of confidence in the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Southern Islands):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the

motion moved by the Hon. the Chief Secretary. Sir, the

reason  for  my  seconding the  motion  is  that  this

country needs the security and safety of the lives and

property of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No one wishes to speak? I will put the

Question. The Question is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ede.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to address

this House in full consciousness of the fact that  the

good  of  the  country at this juncture  can  only  be

assured  if  we  are  willing  to  rise  above   party

considerations to the highest interests of the  State;

that  is  to say, to the safety and welfare  of  every

man,  woman and child on this island who breathes  the

spirit  of  Singapore,  or in other  words,  the  vast

majority  of  the  population. Unfortunately,  I  feel

bound to say that the Government, in its short term of

office,  took  too long to rise above  the  level  of

party rivalry, and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



have  been watching with growing concern the  struggle

between  the  Labour  Front - the ruling  Party - and  the

People's Action Party for the control of trade  unions

for  political ends, failing dismally to  see  what  a

dangerous  game  they  were playing.  The  Progressive

Party   members  of  this  House  will,  nevertheless,

support   the  Government's  determination  today   to

maintain law and order, provided that they turn  their

faces away from thoughts of political advantage to the

hard  and  not  necessarily  unrewarding  business  of

government.  Let us remind ourselves  that  the  wound

which  has eaten deeply into the vitals of this island

is stemmed and not healed, and unless it is cauterized

firmly and effectively, it will fester and poison  the

whole  body politic. The worst of a serious crisis  is

over, we hope, but the causes of that crisis have  yet

to  be removed, lest we drift into another, and proper

remedies can only be applied when the causes have been

thoroughly diagnosed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking into some of these causes, I hope I may

have  your  permission, Sir, to look just a short  way

back into past history, because while we know only too

well  where the true enemy lies, the Government cannot

be exonerated from all blame for these tragic events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front threw itself into the recent

election  campaign  with  an Opposition  mentality,  a

platform  which in some respects, to say the least  of

it,  was  disingenuous, and an orgy of hatred  of  the

Progressive Party, which was labelled as the  opponent

of     Labour's     twin    bogeys - colonialism     and

capitalism - conveniently overlooking the fact that  the

Progressive  Party had done more than any other  Party

to   send  colonialism  on  its  way  out,  and   that

capitalism is to be found in Soviet Russia as much  as

in  the  United  States or Britain.  However,  by  the

strange process of democratic arithmetic that afflicts

elections  when there are a number of parties  in  the

field, 42,000 votes out of 150,000 put into power  the

very  Party which had conditioned itself to  years  of

happy    irresponsibility   in    opposition.    Their

extravagance  of outlook, pardonable  in  an  election

campaign,  has  taken  longer to  wear  off  than  the

country can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



afford,  and the rhetoric in which the Chief  Minister

indulged at the first sitting of this Assembly must, I

fear, be regarded as, to some extent, responsible  for

the  disasters of last week. Can one use the following

words in this House -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the labourer thrown on the slag-heap of our

gold-mining town who made our prosperity and fortunes.

The  smouldering  embers of this slag-heap  threw  out

poisonous  fumes of hatred so bitter  that  it  cannot

distinguish between the system and the rulers,"



- can  one, I say, use these words and then three  days

later  go  down  in person to solve a strike  and  not

expect  to  get  a snub from workers whose  "poisonous

fumes of bitter hatred" one has oneself aggravated and

at  a  time  when the situation was still not  out  of

control?  Even  in  his broadcast  to  the  people  of

Singapore  last  Thursday, my hon.  Friend  could  not

resist the flamboyant ring of "the dreadful effects of

more   than   a  century  of  Colonialism  and   cruel

uninhibited  Capitalism".  Was  there  need  for  such

verbal  dramatics, when even at that moment the drama,

the  tragic  stark  drama, was being  enacted  of  the

"cruel,  uninhibited" battering to  death  of  men  in

Alexandra  Road?  And  surely  by  thundering  against

Colonialism, which is so far on its way to  extinction

that  even the Bandoeng conference could not  take  it

seriously, and by inveighing against the wickedness of

Capitalism, these two "Isms", dressed up by the Labour

Front  in  the  guise  of virulent and  uncontrollable

monsters,  the  livelihood of  the  masses  which  you

desire  to protect was at once endangered. You  cannot

have  workers, Sir, without employers. Both must  work

together in increasing harmony for the country's good.

Admonish  the employer if he is unreasonable,  but  do

not  hold  him  up to contempt with such  terms  as  a

cruel,  uninhibited  capitalist, as  such  intemperate

language can only breed hatred and destroy the harmony

which is so necessary if we are determined to rid  our

country  of  the present evils that beset it.  If  you

undermine   confidence  in  the  future,   you   choke

expansion in industrial and commercial enterprise; and

if  you  do  that,  there will be less  factories  and

shops,  less  employment, and less wages.  Competition

and  full  employment borne on the wings  of  security

alone will bring better living for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



workers of this country. Our interpretation of  events

is,  therefore, this - that Government was too  obsessed

with  the  need to honour impossible election  pledges

and, alas, too blind to what the People's Action Party

really  stood  for to take serious enough  account  of

what happened as early as the 25th April.  I refer to

the  appearance of those misguided singing and dancing

Chinese  middle school students as strike sympathisers

for  the first time on an organised basis, which  from

that  moment  made it impossible for  the  workers  to

exercise  their  free  will  in  deciding  their   own

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warnings were not heeded, and the growing

challenge of the next two and a half weeks against law

and  order was not taken up strongly enough  to  avoid

the  disasters of last Thursday, as they  should  have

been avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of force is an action which all of us would

ponder  deeply  before adopting, but the  worst  thing

still  was to show weakness in the face of a  ruthless

enemy  whose "pattern of action followed the Communist

technique" - to use the Chief Minister's own words.  But

the  truth of the matter is that the Government failed

to  act responsibly at the first signs of trouble when

that  very "pattern of action" began to unfold itself.

They  wanted,  if  possible,  to  avoid  the  risk  of

unpopularity which taking stern action always  brings,

hoping  that,  by  waiting, the  dispute  would  solve

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet "the forces of chaos" which the Chief Minister

only  announced  for the first time on Thursday  night

were  there plain for all to see - well over a fortnight

ago. And in our view it was Government's plain duty at

that  early  stage  to have made a  clear  distinction

between  the  innocent  and the  guilty;  between  the

ordinary  and  legitimate striker and  the  subversive

agent  and  agitator; between the boy  and  girl  with

their  books  and  the  bands of  regimented  student-

provocateurs.  They  failed to  act  on  these  lines;

hesitant  to submerge party interests in the  national

interests;  still  vying for votes among  the  workers

with  the People's Action Party, and taking the chance

that  the  affair would blow over and that they  could

claim a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



victory  in  which both the innocent  and  the  guilty

would then be found on their side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what happened? The sinister forces of evil were

fortified by the realisation that the Government would

bend over backwards rather than take a firm line.  The

gangsters,  the hooligans moved in behind  the  strike

agitators; and the Chinese students danced and chanted

with increasing defiance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So matters moved to the inevitable climax, and the

bloody  blows  began to fall, with the Chief  Minister

still  trying  to  cloak their hideousness  behind  an

announcement  about  Professor  Arthur  Lewis  of  the

University of Manchester.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the three Chinese schools which are now

closed, so that innocent children must be deprived  of

their   education   along  with  the   guilty,   whose

activities demonstrate that they are not fit to be  in

these  schools?  Two  weeks  ago,  in  our  view,  the

Government  had the chance to separate the sheep  from

the  goats; those who stayed in schools from those who

went off in their lorries in clearly defined groups to

mingle with the strikers. But no action was taken.  If

this  student insubordination had been tackled at  the

right time, the schools might well be open today,  and

law-abiding children would be carrying on  with  their

lessons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the innocent students, like the innocent

strikers, had to suffer with the guilty, because  the

Government would not do the right thing at  the  right

time,  and  because previously they  had  in  indecent

haste begun to tear down the barriers put up long  ago

against  the forces of chaos, by revoking a number  of

Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this part of the House recognise the need, the

imperative   need,   for  the  reimposition   of   the

Regulation  which is before us today. We  welcome  the

declaration  of the Government that they are  resolved

to  govern henceforth with the utmost firmness; and in

view  of  what  has  been said this  morning,  in  the

national  interests, we will side with  them  in  this

time  of  crisis to strengthen and support  them  with

equal resolution. We are confident that not only the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



38,000 who voted Progressive at the elections, but all

those  who have seen the Red lights of warning in  the

Singapore sky will expect us to do our duty to support

the  Government  above  all party  considerations  and

affiliations.  In  doing  so,  we  shall   be   gladly

available  for  consultation  should  they  want   our

counsel.  We  shall  ask them to re-examine  with  the

greatest  care  any new legislation to  be  introduced

which could again open the doors and let in the forces

of  evil.  And we shall forego the thoughts  of  party

advantage   if   the  Government,  in   the   national

interests,  have  to go back on part  of  their  party

programme, as we trust they will. Let us never  forget

in  this  Chamber, where traditions are still  in  the

making,  that  Singapore  is greater  than  ourselves,

greater than any political party, and that freedom has

no meaning if there is no security.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr, Speaker, Sir,

I  have not come this day with prepared speeches, with

long reports and long narratives of things I wish  the

people to listen to without having to prove them. I am

glad that it is to two Englishmen that I rise to reply

on  behalf of the People's Action Party. I would  have

preferred the vile accusations that have been slung at

us  today by the Hon. the Chief Secretary to come from

the Hon. the Chief Minister (Mr Marshall). I think he

would have weighed his words with more care, with more

circumspection,  and  with more understanding  of  the

difficulties  and the dangers of the  situation;  with

more understanding of the hopes, fears and aspirations

of  people who think alike with him, but who  disagree

with  him  that the Labour Front is a vehicle  through

which such hopes and aspirations can be achieved. I am

relieved that it is to a colonial official and  to  an

expatriate who has resided here for seven out  of  the

last ten years -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> We cannot hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to the hon.

Member. I take it that no one in the Progressive Party

had  the courage to say the things that the Member for

Tanglin (Mr John Ede)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



with  4,000  expatriate votes had the courage  to  say

this  morning. But I would like today to  meet,  apart

from  Parliamentary levity, the full charge  that  has

been  levied  against the People's Action  Party.  The

Chief  Secretary would wish to put the People's Action

Party  and its leaders on trial on the floor  of  this

House.  We  stand accused because he has recited  this

narrative,  and  in  this narrative  no  one  but  the

People's  Action Party comes out as the devil  of  the

piece.  Let me tell him that we have not come here  as

prisoners  to  be  accused, or as prisoners  who  must

discharge the burden of their guilt. We have come here

as  representatives of the people, and we shall  speak

as  such. The Chief Secretary has said that the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar should declare what he stands  for,

apart from clever sophistry. I think, Sir, I have been

accused  of  many things in my life, but not  even  my

worst  enemy  has ever accused me of being  afraid  to

speak  my mind. What I say now is on my behalf and  on

behalf  of  the  People's Action Party.  The  People's

Action  Party  cannot be responsible for every  single

member of the Party, but let me say here and now  what

the  People's  Action Party stands for.  If  what  the

Chief  Secretary  said was true, then  he  would  have

found   the  People's  Action  Party  completely   and

wholeheartedly with him. We have said  time  and  time

again   that   we  stand  for  a  free,   independent,

democratic,  non-Communist  Malaya,  and  I   say   it

today - now.  The Chief Secretary wants to know  what  I

would  say,  without  quibble,  about  Communism   and

colonialism. But it is not sophistry, Sir; it  is  an

honesty which transcends temporary expediency  when  I

say  that  I  will  not  fight  Communism  to  support

colonialism. Not all the riots will make me do it. But

I  say  here and now that if I had the choice  between

democracy - an    independent,    democratic    Malaya - a

Communist  Malaya, and a colonial Malaya,  I  have  no

hesitation  in  choosing  and  in  fighting   for   an

independent, democratic Malaya. There is no  sophistry

in that choice. And the Chief Secretary may wonder why

it was -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> It takes two people to fight!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would fight for it against

anyone!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We must have order. No interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged for

your   kindness,  but  I  am  not  a  person  to  seek

protection from those who hope that, perhaps, a  happy

word  here  and there might disrupt what is absolutely

true.  We  will  not  fight the  Communists  or  other

Fascists  to  preserve the colonial  system.  Let  the

Colonial Office officials here take note that that  is

the   feeling  of  a  vast  majority  of  the  people,

particularly  the younger people of this country.  But

we  will  fight, if we have something worth  while  to

fight for. It is no use for the Member for Tanglin  to

say,  "Self-government is bound to  come."  They  have

been  telling us that for months, for years and years.

Give  it to us now and we will fight Communism or  any

other  ideology that seeks to destroy an  independent,

democratic  Malaya.  That is the first  stand  of  the

People's  Action Party, and let there be no  sophistry

construed upon that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second stand of the People's Action Party is

equally unequivocal and clear. We seek to destroy  the

colonial system and we seek to do so by methods of non-violence.  We abjure violence as a method of achieving

political ends. We have said that before, and  we  say

that  now,  that we are opposed to any group,  or  any

quarter from which violence comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the two grave doubts which the Chief

Secretary has sought to cloud over the People's Action

Party. Having made clear those two stands - and as I say

I speak for myself and for the Party I represent - I can

now  proceed to answer his account, his conclusive and

decisive  judgment, on what were  the  causes  of  the

unhappy events of the 12th May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief Secretary would like to

have  me  to  answer for my clients. I  am  the  legal

adviser to the Singapore Bus Workers' Union. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



am  the legal adviser to the Preparatory Committee  of

the  Chinese Students Union. Therefore, I am the devil

of the piece. Therefore the People's Action Party, and

myself  in  particular, were the people who  fomented,

who  instigated, who fed the flames that finally broke

out into the rioting of the 12th May. It is simple. It

is  easy.  But it is a pity that if what he  said  was

true, he did not have the courage to get his Attorney-General, who is today absent, to take those things to

a  court  of  law  and prove them. He  has  made  very

serious  charges against several of my colleagues.  In

so  far  as  they are personal charges, my  colleagues

will   answer  them.  But  in  so  far  as  they   are

allegations against the People's Action Party, I  will

deal with them now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first, to get these things in perspective,

give   another  account -  another  viewpoint - of  these

facts, of these events, which led to the riots of  the

12th  May. To the Chief Secretary it was a case  quite

simply of unreasonable workers who linked arms and sat

on the floor and blocked the gates of a bus depot; who

were  gently  and  gingerly, with as little  force  as

possible,  removed.  And  then  there  descended  like

locusts  hordes  of  agitators,  out  to  exploit  the

situation, to fan the flames of bitterness and  hatred

that  finally  blew up on the 12th May!  It  is  quite

simple - there  were  the workers,  unreasonable;  there

were  these hidden enemies who came and fomented them;

there  were  the  students  who  fed,  instigated  and

stiffened their morale for worse and worse things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should proceed, first, with how the

dispute  was  solved. For it was  not  his  firm,  his

efficient Police Force that resolved this dispute.  It

was not even the Emergency Regulation for which he now

seeks the approval of the House. It was, if I may  say

so  with great respect, the patient handling, the firm

understanding  of the Chief Minister which  led  to  a

solution  of  what  was  a very  important  industrial

dispute, which involved a basic trade union principle,

and which so bestirred the workers of this colony that

they were prepared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



go  on  a  general strike to establish this principle.

Had  it  been  the Member for Tanglin and his  friends

who, together with the colonial officials, had to deal

with  such  a  situation, I can assure them  that  all

their threats of use of force would not have been  any

use  at  all  in solving something which was  a  human

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, 250 out of the 300 workers in

the  Hock  Lee  Bus Company joined the  Singapore  Bus

Workers' Union. Sir, before I proceed, as a matter  of

formality,  I  should declare that I  acted  as  their

counsel at the Commission of Inquiry - but what  I  have

to  say  I  will say regardless of whether  I  had  an

interest to declare. On the formation of this Union on

the  24th  February,  the employer  announced  in  the

Chinese  Press the formation of another union  in  the

same company. He announced also that since he expected

industrial  unrest,  he  was recruiting,  and  he  had

recruited, 200 workers to meet any trouble.  Six  days

before the formation of that Union, to prove his  good

faith   in  trade  unionism,  he  dismissed  the   two

organisers of this branch union. Needless to say, when

the  Union  was  formed,  the first  dispute  was  the

reinstatement  of  these  two  men.  Eventually   they

succeeded  in  obtaining  the  reinstatement  of  one,

through  arbitrators - but  not  before  very  strenuous

attempts  had been made to buy the man off. A  company

director  offered the man who was dismissed, in  order

to  get  him  to  go away, to forget all  about  trade

unionism - offered him for this three months'  pay  from

the  company  and three months from his  own  personal

pocket  and  if  he  should wish  to  go  for  further

studies, all expenses for further studies would be met

by  him  personally. The offer was spurned. The worker

was reinstated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the company systematically recruited redundant

workers  into  a spare pool and put all these  workers

into  a union which he formed with a few old employees

who did not join the Singapore Bus Workers' Union. And

thus was created a second union in the company. It was

this  that  bedevilled the whole of  the  relationship

between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



employees  of  the  Bus  Company  and  the  Hock   Lee

Amalgamated Bus Company Limited. It was this that made

any  settlement  in  good faith  between  the  parties

almost  an impossibility. It would still have been  an

impossibility  were  it  not for  the  fact  that  the

employer finally conceded that their union was  bogus.

He  repudiated  the  union, and the  union  agreed  to

dissolve itself. That is the background of the dispute

which,  so  far as the Chief Secretary was  concerned,

was  not  a  matter of relevance. But  so  far  as  my

clients were concerned, it was a constant irritant  in

the whole dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first series of disputes was settled by an

agreement  between the company and the  Singapore  Bus

Workers' Union on the 4th April, but that was  just  a

temporary lull because the employer was, then, not yet

ready  with  his  full force to take over  when  there

should  be  a  strike or, as it turned  out,  when  he

dismissed the lot of them. Recruitment went  on  apace

into  this  spare  pool.  He even  departed  from  his

customary practice of not paying anything to the  band

of   drivers  and  conductors  waiting  for  permanent

employment  should  there  be  a  vacancy,  by  paying

persons  in this spare pool $2 a day per person.  They

were   forced  to  join  his  union.  They   paid   no

subscription fees, no entrance fees; they  were  given

badges.  They were no more than 'black legs', all  the

time  waiting on the side-lines ready for  the  moment

when  the  employer was ready to take  over.  In  that

situation  no  real  goodwill  was  possible   between

employer and employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minor dispute arose about the interpretation of

two clauses in that agreement. The employer refused to

give any increment to nine people whom he had promised

increment by agreement. The employer refused to put on

the  permanent establishment two of the spare  workers

who were most senior and who ought to have been put on

because  one  term of the agreement  said  that  spare

workers  should be put on the permanent  establishment

according  to seniority. They were minor things  which

would  have  fizzled  out with a bit  of  goodwill  on

either  side, but because of this real fight between  a

union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



fighting  for survival against an employer  determined

to  break the union, the untiring efforts of the Chief

Minister did not meet with any success for quite  some

time - because  the  company would not  admit  that  it

could not break this union by forming its own 'yellow'

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister - I beg his pardon - the Chief

Secretary - (the Chief Minister has not  accused  me  of

anything yet; in fact, in a moment, I hope it was  not

alone, of elation, he complimented counsel involved in

the  case for their civic consciousness and said a few

other  kind things.) And I am glad that it is  not  he

who  has  pointed the accusing finger at me and  said,

"What  have you done, you scoundrel!" Let me  say  now

that  if it were not for the constant efforts of those

whom  he would believe to be the forces of evil, there

would have been a great deal more trouble for the Hon.

the Chief Secretary and his friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was called into the dispute on the morning of the

27th April, when this House was sitting for the second

day.  At  6.15 that morning I was summoned by the  Bus

Workers'  Union to go down to the garage at  Alexandra

Road where there had been - as the Chief Secretary would

put  it - a very gentle and restrained effort to  remove

workers  who were obstructing the gates of the garage.

The  Chief Secretary would have us believe that  there

were  two  who  feigned injuries, lay on  the  ground,

moaned away, and disappeared when the ambulance  came!

Sir, I had this one advantage over the Chief Secretary

in  that  I  was  there  at a quarter  past  six  that

morning,  and he was not. I have no desire, either  in

this  House  or outside, to exacerbate or in  any  way

irritate  the feelings of mobs or workers against  the

Police  or  against  the Government.  And  I  have  no

desire,  therefore,  to describe  the  somewhat  lurid

scene which I witnessed that morning. But let me  tell

him  that  it was not as he was informed. In my  whole

life I have never seen Chinese workers emotional  and

distraught;  but  at that moment I found  drivers  and

conductors, ordinary workers, literally sobbing their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



hearts  out with pain, frustration and bitterness.  It

was a scene which I hope I will never witness again as

long as the Chief Minister is in office. I came to the

Assembly that day and I never - I could have if I wanted

to,  as the Chief Secretary would have us believe - made

political  capital  out of this. I could  have  raised

this  quite easily to the embarrassment of  the  Chief

Minister and his colleagues, who did not know what had

happened that morning. I congratulated them when,  the

moment  they  came to know of what had happened,  they

appointed  a Commission of Inquiry into the facts  and

circumstances of the dispute, and a little while later

appointed  a commission to inquire into the force,  or

alleged force, that was used that day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Secretary would have us believe that

on that little bit of very restrained police action  a

crowd  of  agitators  and hate-mongers  were  able  to

foment  and blow up a great deal of bitterness,  anger

and  emotions which finally overcame them on 12th May.

I do not know if he has ever tried to go to a crowd of

people,  such as clerical servants in the Secretariat,

and  tried  to excite them over things which  are  not

true.  I  could also, if I were given time  and  given

notice,  write a seven-page manuscript closely  typed,

giving  a full recital of what took place from another

point  of  view,  but  I think it serves  very  little

purpose  unless we are to have the whole  matter  once

again  before the public eye, and before tempers  have

died down. To my personal knowledge there were several

cases  where  more than just the necessary  force  was

used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step in the dispute in which the Chief

Secretary  would  have us believe  that  the  People's

Action Party deliberately frustrated every attempt  at

settlement,   was  when  after  considerable   effort,

despite very strong, very bitter feelings on the  part

of  the workers against the management, I was able to

convince  and persuade the Secretary of the Union  and

the Committee of the Branch to go to the Commission of

Inquiry, to place their case before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



Commission  and settle the dispute in a  peaceful  and

orderly fashion. I say once more I am glad that it was

not  the  Chief Minister who has accused the  People's

Action  Party of these things, because  if  he  had  I

think  he  would  find  it very  uncomfortable  to  be

reminded of certain negotiations in which both he  and

I  were  involved. But, no doubt, his Chief  Secretary

has no knowledge of these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, after the award was given in Court, it

was  found  that the Secretary of the  Union  and  the

Branch Committee had misjudged the temper of the  men,

that   they   were   more  bitter,   more   frustrated

[Interruption.] and it was not until the  early  hours

of the next morning that the Secretary and myself were

able  to  persuade and reason with the men to do  what

was  the  right  thing. There was so much  bitterness,

distrust and suspicion from the employees towards  the

employer. At four o'clock in the morning the employees

told  me that the employer was out to trick them,  and

would  make them sign a form when they went  back,  to

register   individually  for   employment.   If   that

happened, they would not go back to work. To forestall

any  such hitch, any such difficulty, I called at,  at

four  o'clock in the morning, the residence of counsel

for  the  Hock  Lee  Bus Company, woke  him  from  his

slumber,   after  considerable  difficulty  with   his

Alsatian dog, and informed him that everything was all

right,  but that he was to warn his client not  to  do

anything  which he should not do, such  as  requesting

his employees to sign forms, which they had never done

before.  In  my  presence he rang up his  client,  the

Manager  of  the Company. At first he  allowed  me  to

speak  to  his  client, which I did.  I  informed  his

client that the men would be ready to go back to  work

at  quarter past five, and that they would be glad  if

he   would  lend  us  transport  to  collect  all  the

necessary paraphernalia of their work - punches,  ticket

pads,  arm badges - and I warned him not to ask them  to

sign any forms. I then passed the telephone to his own

counsel who, in my presence, told him:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



"Now,  do not do anything foolish! Do not ask them  to

sign  anything new!" I went home, and went to  what  I

thought was a well-earned rest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was awakened at nine and informed that the Union

was  told  by  the men that they were  asked  to  sign

forms,  and the men walked out. All the buses  stopped

and  they  refused  to  go on.  The  employer  had  an

explanation,  and it was, for reasonable  people  like

his  lawyers, a very good explanation. He did not want

anything  that would prejudice the employees.  All  he

wanted  of  them  was to sign a piece of  paper  which

said: - this is my name, this is my badge number,  this

is  the bus I am on; information which he had, and had

never asked for before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that little device to have a psychological

victory  over his employees made further  attempts  to

bring  the  parties together before the real  core  of

dispute  was got rid of, an impossible task.  Sir,  we

went  on  with  the Inquiry hoping that  the  employer

would  see  sense.  We  invited  him  to  have  direct

negotiations and settle this dispute. He  refused.  He

was  going  to have it out. He was going to  fight  it

out.  He was a very brave man, but a very foolish one,

because  he  was not only fighting the  Hock  Lee  Bus

Company  employees, but he was fighting the  whole  of

the trade union movement in Singapore, including a lot

of  the  trade unions which the Chief Secretary  knows

are  strong supporters of the Labour Front.  They,  as

much   as  any  other  union,  were  angered  by   the

disreputable   and  contemptible  methods   of   their

employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Secretary has complained about the

attitude  of  some  sections of the Chinese  Press  in

their  presentation of the events of the last week.  I

do  not  have any complaint. I just wish to  record  a

fact - that  we  are really living in different  worlds:

those  who read the English Press, those who read  the

Chinese  Press,  those who read the Malay  Press,  and

those who read the Indian Press. In the Chinese Press,

in the Malay Press and the Indian Press, everyday, was

published



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



the  evidence  presented  before  the  Commission   of

Inquiry, the evidence of how the workers were cajoled,

were   coerced,  to  join  the  employer's  union   on

recruitment.  Evidence was heard of how  the  employer

tried  to  buy trade union leaders over with  rewards,

and  of  all  the  other  disreputable  tactics  which

readers of the English Press were so happily spared. I

do  not  wish to have it said that the People's Action

Party is against the English Press or any other Press.

They  own the newspapers. Subject to what the general

law  has  to say, they have the right to publish  what

they  wish.  But it was this clear divergence  between

the actions of the English and the Chinese Press which

explains  the complete difference of two  sections  of

public  opinion. In every coffee-shop in town - I  think

the Chief Secretary's very efficient C.I.D. could have

told him this - the Chinese-speaking people were talking

about the Hock Lee Bus workers. They knew the Hock Lee

Bus  Company.  They knew what was happening,  and  the

thing was before their eyes everyday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English-speaking people only knew about counsel for

the  employer asking whether my clients and  witnesses

support  the  Chinese People's Government  in  Peking.

This  has nothing to do with the case. But it was very

good.  It  created  the sort of  atmosphere  in  which

genuine trade unionists become subversive elements  of

this  vast Communist conspiracy which spreads out from

Peking.  That  was what got reported one  day  in  one

English paper. And so it was that when the thing  blew

up  we  found ourselves in Singapore in two completely

different segments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the trade union world was concerned, there

was  no doubt - I think the Chief Minister would be  the

first to acknowledge it - that all trade unionists  were

solidly behind the fight for survival of the Singapore

Bus  Workers'  Union's Branch  in  the  Hock  Lee  Bus

Company,  Limited, It was a straight fight between  an

employer who had decided, the day the union was formed

in his company, that he was going to crush it, and who

then systematically set out to recruit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



redundant  workers whom he fed at two dollars  a  day,

whom he forced into his own union. He just waited  for

the  time  which he knew was coming when  wage  claims

would  be made, and an industrial dispute would arise,

and  either they would go on strike, in which case  he

would  just carry on with his new workers; or he would

dismiss  them, which was what he did. It was  a  plain

straight fight for survival. That was the basic  cause

of  the  bitterness, the hostility, the anger  in  the

dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary hinted - I cannot say that he did

more  than  hint - that there were other  genuine  trade

disputes in town. But this one was not. This  one  was

subversive.   But   there  are  about   30,000   trade

unionists,  I  think, who knew better, men  with  very

good   credentials  who  know  that  what  the   Chief

Secretary hinted at is completely untrue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the solution. Was it the Emergency

Regulation?  Was it the firm and tactful  handling  of

the  Police which resolved, which averted  a  wave  of

industrial  unrest throughout Singapore and  in  which

many unions which supported the Government Benches  on

the  other  side  were going to be  involved?  If  the

Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede) and his crowd  had  been

in,  I  have no doubt whatsoever that they would  have

dealt  with  it  as  good  employers  deal  with  good

employees. I am quite sure that they would have  dealt

with  them  in  a  suitably firm and decisive  manner.

Whether  their firm and decisive handling  would  have

solved  the dispute with less bitterness and  violence

and unhappiness is quite another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in the habit of giving unnecessary

compliments to my opponents, Mr Speaker, Sir. But  if

I  may  mention what I consider to have  been  a  very

strong influence in bringing about a solution, it  was

the  untiring patience of the Chief Minister  and  his

determined spirit to get a peaceful settlement. Even I

nearly  gave  up trying for a peaceful  settlement.  A

vicious   employer  should  have  it  out   with   his

employees, and that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



is  the way trade unionism has grown up in other parts

of  the  world. But he was determined.  "Let  us  have

peace!"   In  fact,  his  flamboyance,  his  colourful

rhetoric  was  able, where the workers were  not  able

earlier,  to  make the employer see the  stupidity  of

going  on  with  his  policy of  repression  of  trade

unions.  The moment that point was conceded, that  the

employer recognised the Singapore Bus Workers'  Union,

and  would  dissolve - he did not want  to  dissolve  it

because he kept up the fiction to the end; he said: "I

cannot  dissolve the Union since I am not an  official

of the Union, but I would cease to recognize it, and I

shall  get the Union officials to dissolve the  Union;

and the Union officials have obliged me and said 'Yes,

we  will sign on the dotted line, and we will dissolve

ourselves'  " - the moment that happened,  there  was  a

complete  transformation. The tension died  down.  The

whole   dispute   settled  into  an  ordinary   normal

industrial  dispute,  with no  extra  bitterness.  But

before  that  point was conceded, it was a  fight  for

survival,  and one in which I could not have prevented

the  workers from fighting for existence. I think  the

Chief Secretary was careful throughout his seven pages

of  narrative never to have, at any single time,  held

his  finger  at  the  strikers for violence.  Not  one

single  striker to my knowledge, and I  think  to  the

knowledge  of  the Chief Secretary, has been  arrested

for  having  done anything which involved the  use  of

force.  They  did squat on the ground; they  did  link

arms. It was passive resistance in the best traditions

of  another  struggle elsewhere.  They  did  it  as  a

gesture of protest against the men inside, the  `black

legs',  150 to 200 of them. They showed to the  others

inside what their jobs meant to them, what their union

meant  for them. They could have gone back and  signed

individually, and their employer would have taken them

back,  giving  them back their jobs but without  their

union. But they did it as a gesture of protest to show

the  employer and the 'black legs' that this  is  what

they  think  of  themselves, of their jobs  and  their

union. I find myself in agreement with that policy  of

passive resistance of people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



who  are determined to stand for what is right. But  I

am  in complete disagreement when any force is used to

oppose  what must inevitably come, a forcible  removal

of  the  workers. To my knowledge there was never  any

resistance - no   force  was  ever  used   against   any

policeman who ejected them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always stood against the use of force or

violence in any form, whether as a method of resolving

a trade dispute, or as a method of achieving political

objectives.  We  have  said  so  openly.   The   Chief

Secretary would wish to know what the leaders  of  the

People's  Action Party were doing when the riots  were

on. The police had given out messages, saying: "Do not

go  out into the area!" If the leaders of the People's

Action  Party  had turned up in the  area,  they  were

likely  to have been involved in a skirmish  with  the

police, who would have been quite convinced that  they

had gone there to stir up the mob. But let me tell the

Chief Secretary this - and I had no intention of telling

this earlier, even though it has been distorted in  an

English newspaper. This English newspaper said that  I

asked  for police protection to go down and  speak  to

the  rioters.  Sir,  I  have never  asked  for  police

protection,  and I did not ask for police  protection.

But  I  did suggest to the police that if we would  be

allowed  to go into the area, we would be prepared  to

meet  the  mob.  We are not people who run  away  from

trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when you fight a colonial system,

there  are bound to be a lot of side-eddies and cross-currents.  We  are not frightened or intimidated  just

because  something untoward happened and the mobs  got

out  of hand. I was prepared to go down there,  and  I

was  quite prepared to face that mob and tell them  to

disperse, if I had any power with them at all. Even if

I had not, I would have tried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, of course the Chief Secretary would want

us  to  believe that we engineered this whole  bag  of

tricks just to terrify the Labour Front, just to break

the  Chief Minister and his colleagues. I think, other

than the Chief Minister, no one worked harder than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



myself  to  see that his Government and its policy  of

firm  but  understanding  handling  of  the  situation

succeeded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said before that if I went into all the lurid

details  of  what took place and gave it from  another

point of view, there would be further trouble. But  if

the  Press would refrain from publishing some  of  the

things  which I think I must mention just in passing - I

would say that if there was no force used, in the  way

in  which  some people alleged was used in  the  later

stages - I  was not there myself - but if it was not  used

in that way, it would have been impossible to get that

degree  of animosity and hostility. It is a difficulty

of  people from other countries of never understanding

the   Asian   mind,  and  they  try  to   hide   their

embarrassment behind a sneer. There is a great deal of

uneasiness  at the moment because the four people  who

carried  the  dead body to the General  Hospital  were

detained, released, detained - arrested at 1.30 a.m. on

the  morning  of  the 13th when they appeared  at  the

General  Hospital, released at 4 p.m. in the afternoon

of  the 13th, re-arrested on the 14th, released in the

afternoon   of  the  14th,  recalled  to  the   C.I.D.

yesterday  afternoon. Sir, some of the matters  cannot

be  referred  to in this place, but one  of  the  four

persons  is now, I am reliably informed, very  gravely

ill  in  the General Hospital, with internal  injuries

which  he did not have at the time he took the  corpse

to the General Hospital. I witnessed a scene yesterday

with the mother wailing beside her son in obvious pain

lying  on a lorry. A new storm was gathering,  and  we

the  trouble-makers, we got someone into the lorry and

whipped the man off to the General Hospital before the

crowd got too big.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Chief Secretary must have his theory, and he

must justify some of these things he would wish to do.

What better opportunity than this one to justify every

Emergency  Regulation,  every  strong,  firm  colonial

action? Before it was just colonial. Now, in the  name

of  Democracy  he  can do all these things.  "Give  us

those  powers." They were quite unnecessary. I do  not

blame



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



the  Chief Secretary, or the Chief Minister  for  that

matter,  for  having  acceded to the  request  of  his

police  officers  for  stronger  powers,  because  the

colonial police have different traditions from that of

other  police  forces  in independent  countries  like

Britain for instance. Whenever they are faced  with  a

new  situation other than the arresting of hawkers and

the  taking down of traffic offences - anything  out  of

the ordinary - "Let us have new powers. Let us deal with

them,  but we cannot deal with them under the ordinary

law."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sections in the Penal Code which deal with

an  unlawful  assembly, and there are  other  sections

which  deal  with  many other offences  which  may  be

committed by an unlawful assembly. If it is true, what

the  Chief Secretary said about these vicious speeches

being  made on the picket line, then I say it is wrong

of  the police not to have proceeded under the law  as

they  had  the  right to do. Anyone fomenting  unrest,

anyone deliberately provoking hatred to a point  where

it  is bound to break out into violence, must be  held

responsible  for  his  words.  He  should  have   been

apprehended and charged, and the police would have the

full support of the People's Action Party. But what we

object to now, and what we have always objected to, is

this  insinuation, this smear of evil  forces  working

behind  the  scenes, behind the People's Action  Party

and its leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have never said one word, either before the

election,  during the election or after the  election,

which  I  wish now to retract. I have been misreported

on  one  occasion. I have corrected that Press report,

and I do not retract any word that I said then. It  is

no  use,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, to tell the people:  "You

cannot  have  Democracy. You are not fit for  it.  You

will be devoured by the Communists. Let us first fight

the  Communists." It does not work. It does not strike

one  bell  anywhere  in the hearts  of  any  patriotic

Malayan   who   would  wish  to  see  an  independent,

democratic, non-Communist Malaya. We are not  prepared

to fight to perpetuate or to prolong the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



colonial  system. But give us our rights and  we  will

fight  the  Communists or any others who threaten  the

existence of an independent, democratic, non-Communist

Malaya.  It is one of those difficult things,  because

when you are under tutelage, your masters say: "Let me

measure  your  fitness for independence.  Let  me  see

whether   you  have  sufficient  numbers  of  literate

people,    sufficient   civil   servants,   sufficient

scientists, doctors, lawyers, sufficient good, mature,

old,  steady  political leaders. If you  satisfy  this

nebulous  test, which I have not published beforehand,

then  you shall have your independence. You shall have

your freedom."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the worst things about violence is that it so

very  often  succeeds - and that is the real tragedy  of

Malaya.  You  never  can have,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a

Malayan  who  really believes that the  British  would

release  their hold without our creating  a  situation

which  makes  it  wise  and  cogent  for  the  British

Government as benign governors and rulers to give  us

and  concede us our independence. It is only when such

conditions  existed that the British  left  India  and

said:   "We   knew   the  Indians   were   ripe   for

independence.  We quitted. So did we leave  Burma;  so

did  we  leave  Ceylon.  But we cannot  leave  Malaya.

Malaya  is not ready for independence." But the  whole

world does not challenge the right of the Siamese  to

govern  themselves. By any of the tests, either  posed

by  Sir  Anthony Eden or by any colonial  governor  or

colonial  official, I think this island in  comparison

with  Siam - perhaps I should put it the  other  way  in

case I should offend the Consul General for Siam - but I

would  say  with great respect that we  have  as  many

educated people as the Siamese, that we have  as  many

able leaders as the Siamese, that we have less changes

of  government, we have less violence with changes  of

government. But there the Americans are determined  to

defend  the  rights of the Siamese to self-government,

to  independence. Arms, ammunition, men - I do not know;

I  am  told by the Press very few men - are being poured

into it, to make sure that that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



country  remains  an  independent,  sovereign   state.

Everybody says: "Look, what has happened in Indonesia.

Chaos,  violence,  corruption, disaster."  But  nobody

challenges  the  right  of the  Indonesians  to  their

sovereign   right,  their  divine   right   of   self-determination, and nobody says that the  Dutch  should

go  back  and tell their former pupils that they  have

misjudged the maturity of the Indonesians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it once before, badly reported, and I have

corrected it, and I will say here and now that if  you

want  an  independent,  democratic  and  non-Communist

Malaya,  then  let us have something  worth  while  to

fight  for at once. Give us something worth  while  to

defend. Give us proof that you will not fight us.  But

I  can  say  here  and now: it is impossible  for  any

person, any political party, to fight the British  and

fight  the Communists. It is not possible, and of  the

two,  the  British are in control, so  you  fight  the

British  alone. But give us our rights, and  we  shall

fight  anyone - anyone as Mr Thomas said,  the  present

Minister  for  Transport, and for a  short  while  the

Minister  for Housing - we will fight the Communists  or

anybody else to defend our freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I believe in, and that is what my Party

believes in, but you will not get the People's  Action

Party  to  join the colonial band-wagon on this  anti-Communist  hysteria.  I  have  said  before  in   this

Assembly  that it is not a simple matter of  evil  men

out to destroy good. If it were so simple, the problem

would  not he so difficult throughout the world as  it

is.  It is a question of men who want to do good,  but

men  who  find frustrations, impossibilities, who  then

slowly decide that this particular system is a way  of

resolving a bad situation which they dislike. I myself

am not convinced that the Communist revolution and its

technique  is  the  only way or is the  right  way  to

resolve colonialism in Malaya. It is because I believe

that  the  British  may be sensible enough  sooner  or

later, and I hope it is sooner, that if you want  this

Malaya to be democratic, to be independent, to be part

of the free world, then - I will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



invoke  God for this - but I would say: "Do it  quickly,

whether  it  is  for God's sake, or for  the  sake  of

Malaya - for  the sake of their political beliefs  which

they  have preached, whether they believe in  them  or

not  at the time they preached them, but for the  sake

of   those  political  beliefs  which  sometimes  have

sparked  the  hopes, the ideals of some of  those  who

came within their system."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what I have to say may, in view of the drama  of

this   morning's  debate,  sound  rather   pedestrian,

something in the nature of an intermezzo, but in  view

of  the  importance of trade in this Colony,  I  hope,

Sir,  that  you  will regard it as relevant.  This  is

surely  the  time  when  anything  that  can  be  said

publicly to promote confidence and faith in the future

of this country and of this Government should be said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports of flight of capital have been circulating

in  Singapore. Some of them indicate that  the  exodus

has  been on a colossal scale. A figure of 150 million

dollars   has   been  mentioned,  17�  million   pound

sterling. Sir, I speak with some authority when I  say

from  my knowledge as a banker that these reports  are

utter  nonsense.  The remittance of such  a  vast  sum

could  only  be  made in two ways. It  could  be  made

through the Commissioners of Currency by the remitters

drawing the money from the banks and paying it to  the

Board  of  Commissioners of Currency, thus causing  an

acute shortage of the circulating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



medium  and,  indeed, creating a minor crisis;  or  it

could  actually be remitted through the banks. But  if

it  were  remitted through the banks, it would  create

such  a  demand for sterling that we should  know  all

about  it. Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been  no  such

disturbing factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that no capital has left this country.

After all, there are some people who have regarded the

recent  victory  of  the  Labour  Front  as  a   major

cataclysm. Such people have indeed attempted  to  sell

their  excellent securities and try to get  the  money

safely  out of the country. What folly! However,  such

flight  of  capital could take place, particularly  by

withdrawals by overseas investors if they thought that

the  sinister and evil forces which exist in  strength

in this Colony, whose symbol is the clenched fist, and

who  have thus far so successfully poisoned the minds,

the   exceedingly   susceptible   minds   of   Chinese

adolescents,  were  to gain the  ascendant.  This,  of

course, is the root of the matter, as has already been

said this morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With half of our population under 21, what a fruitful

field  for the sowing of dragon's teeth. Would it  not

be  possible for Government to investigate the case of

the  "old" students one hears so much about? Could not

one place an age limit at which students must withdraw

from schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be more mundane, Sir, but equally realistic, such

a  flight  of  capital as was rumoured to  have  taken

place  would  take  place if the  public  feared  that

restrictions might be placed on movements of  resident

sterling.  I mean that if restrictions were placed  on

the  free  remittance of funds from  this  country  to

other points in the sterling area. The public would, I

think, respond well to an assurance by Government that

no  such legislation - and it would take legislation, of

course,  to  impose such restrictions - is contemplated,

or likely to be contemplated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment the Governments of India and the

United  States  are  reported  to  be  considering  an

agreement designed to encourage private American



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



investments in India. The agreement would provide  for

guarantees   against   expropriation   and   for   the

remittance of profits in convertible currency. And how

necessary these provisions are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen and investors are not altruists but in

business  to  make profit. Here in Singapore  a  great

deal   of   nonsense  is  talked  about  profits   and

dividends.  It  is true that on the existing  paid-up

capital  of companies sometimes three-figure dividends

are  paid, but it takes no account whatsoever  of  the

enormous reserves belonging to the shareholders  which

are  in these companies, and which are employed in the

business.  By  the simple process of  tidying  up  the

balance sheet and transferring these reserves  in  the

shape  of  bonus shares to the shareholders, the  same

amount  of  money would be available for  distribution

and  dividends would become more normal. There  is,  I

submit,   Sir,  nothing  ignoble  about  trading   for

legitimate  profit, and I state solemnly that  capital

will  not  flow  to  any country  where  controls  and

regulations are introduced to reduce the profit  below

what is expected in other parts of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would say that if the use of the

Emergency  Regulations is one  of  the  means  whereby

confidence can be restored to this country,  then  let

them be used resolutely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  events of the past week have  caused  grave

concern  to the citizens of Singapore, and  I  do  not

propose  retracing any of the ground  which  has  been

covered  by the other Members this morning.  My  Party

was  concerned with the dispute between the  Singapore

Bus  Workers' Union and the management of Hock Lee Bus

Company. We disapprove of the way in which the company

was using the Hock Lee Employees' Union, a union which

the  company had organised to break the unity  of  the

workers  in  the  Singapore Bus Workers'  Union.  This

action of the company we deplore as it endangered  the

whole  trade union movement in Singapore. The sympathy

my  Party showed in this dispute was the same sort  of

sympathy  which  all responsible trade  unions  showed

towards the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



Bus  Workers' Union in this dispute. We were  all  not

going  to  stand  aside  and  to  be  idle,  while   a

responsible union was in danger of being gulped by the

irresponsible behaviour of the management of the  Hock

Lee Bus Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party, Sir, accepts responsibility throughout this

dispute.   When  feelings  were  high  and  when   the

situation worsened, my Party clearly stood opposed  to

violence, for resort to violence would not be  in  the

interest of the workers themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the motion before the Assembly this morning the

Government is seeking power to impose a curfew to deal

with  a  situation  which the  citizens  of  Singapore

witnessed a few days ago. As such my Party is  opposed

to  the  principle  of governing by way  of  Emergency

Regulations.  As  this motion is to  be  a  motion  of

confidence  in  the  Government, my  Party  will  not,

because  of  the events of a few days ago, oppose  the

motion.  I do hope sincerely that the Government  will

never  have the occasion to invoke this Regulation  in

the  Assembly, and peaceable settlement of  industrial

disputes  will  be  so accepted and practised  by  all

organised  workers as to make it never again necessary

for  this Assembly to meet again to consider the  need

of  re-introducing Emergency Regulations which we  all

deplore.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

every  responsible  citizen in  Singapore  must  abhor

violence, and nobody could look back to the black days

of  May the 12th and May the 13th without feeling that

something is essentially wrong with the present  state

of  affairs, that riots should have taken place. Every

resident in Singapore can discourse by the hour on the

horrors and the violence which swept our city for  two

terrifying days last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are for lawful unionism to protect and secure the

genuine  welfare  and interests of  the  workers,  and

unionism built on healthy lines working within law and

order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very much against any group who will take the

law  into  their  own hands and resort  to  force  and

violence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



in  order  to attain their aims. No decent people  can

tolerate unlawful actions and beastly violence, and in

Singapore these will be serious obstacles in our  path

to self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government must be firm against such force and

violence  so that they may not happen again.  To  this

end,  my Party urge that all Parties should sink their

differences  and  give  all  encouragement   and   co-operation they can.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, despite my ill-health, I feel it is my bounden duty to say a few

words on this occasion. The motion which was moved  by

the  Hon. the  Chief Secretary merely  asks  for  the

imposition  of  a  certain  clause  in  the  Emergency

Regulations imposing a curfew, and I thought  probably

he  would  deal with the reasons as to  why  that  was

necessary.  But I find, in the course of  the  speech,

that several points were brought out which should  not

have  been  brought  out  in this  debate  at  all.  A

description of the events which took place  was  read

out   to  this  sitting,  and  I  felt  that  a   very

controversial debate would take place.  We  are  aware

that a Commission of Inquiry has been instituted,  and

at  this  juncture  it would be  wrong  to  state  the

reasons  or  the implications of the dispute  and  the

police action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been alleged that the influence of the

People's Action Party had created the situation. Well,

I,  as  a  trade unionist, have understood  the  whole

position and would suggest that that allegation should

not  have  been brought up at all at this debate,  but

since  it  was  brought  up,  may  I  suggest  to  the

Government that this Commission of Inquiry  should  be

extended  to  make  it a public inquiry  so  that  the

public  will  be  able to judge who were  involved  in

this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a trade unionist, I believe that the trouble

started because of a very unhealthy situation  in  the

trade  union  movement. In Singapore, the trade  union

movement has taken very strong roots ever since  1945,

and  although we have organisations of various  kinds

we  have  yet  to  realize the real  dreams  of  trade

unionism. People have been active in the trade unions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



some of them sincerely, and some of them just for  the

fancy  of  it.  The  result today  is  that  even  the

Singapore  Trades  Union  Congress  cannot  say   very

vehemently  that  it has helped the movement  to  grow

steadily  and  in the manner in which it  should  have

grown.  It has no department to deal with organisation

of trade unions. It has no research department to find

out how and where the movement went wrong. Therefore I

would  say that there has been something wrong in  the

organisation of the trade union movement in Singapore.

Sir,   ever  since  1945,  there  have  been  splinter

organisations in the trade union movement, and  I  see

with  satisfaction that a certain amount of  sincerity

in  the  movement has come into being  in  Singapore's

trade  unionism today. They have realised that  it  is

only by a sincere and honest trade union movement that

the  workers  will be able to better their  prospects,

and  I  think they felt that a splinter union  in  the

Hock Lee Bus Company was very undesirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the observations which I have made, the

dispute  was, up to a certain stage, a dispute  purely

involving   the  tussle  between  the  Singapore   Bus

Workers'  Union  and  the  Hock  Lee  Amalgamated  Bus

Workers'  Union.  But at a later date  the  fight  for

establishing  the union's right became involved  in  a

very  serious  one in which a riot took  place.  As  a

trade unionist I have to condemn violence in any  form

in  a  trade union movement like we have in Singapore.

But let us not say that we move this motion, adopt it

and  sit on it. What I would like to see is that there

should be some sort of a body to reorganise the  whole

trade union movement into a very strong and beneficial

one to the people of Singapore in which they will have

a  fair share in the management of the trade union and

the  benefit of experience which other people  may  be

able to give them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe, Sir, that any action such as the

closure  of  schools  would be  able  to  curtail  the

movement of the Chinese students. I have observed  all

these    years the action taken by the Government  to

make the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



students realize their role as students and as members

of  the community, but I have found that at all  times

either  the children have been expelled or the schools

have  been closed, and I should like to know what  the

Government policy would be in the future to handle the

situation. For myself, I believe that they should  not

enter  into politics at this stage. They should be  at

school,  and  I feel that they should be  educated  to

become  useful citizens of Singapore. May I ask  which

school  in  Singapore today has a scheme of  educating

its students to become useful citizens? We have yet to

open a new charter for the students of Singapore.  You

may have a course in civics or something of that kind,

but  there  is no specific form of education  for  the

students  to  become useful citizens of  Singapore.  I

would suggest to the Government, Sir, that the working

period  of  schools  be shifted  from  the  present  8

o'clock to ten; ten to four or ten to five like  that,

so  that  the students will be able to concentrate  on

their  studies properly, go home and have the time  to

do  their  homework, rather than having more  time  to

indulge  in various other activities. This may  be  an

idea  which you all may feel not very applicable here,

but  I  do suggest for your consideration at least  to

try and see whether this will work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about the other matters in the Chief

Secretary's speech, I regret that certain parts of his

speech  have  been  very provocative.  It  is  no  use

pointing  out to somebody and saying: "You are  wrong,

and I am right." What we all have to emphasize is what

is  right and what is wrong. By pointing out to me and

saying  I  am wrong or he is wrong, I do not think  we

will  be able to get anywhere, and particularly  in  a

debate  like this. Government should try and  win  the

confidence  of other opposition Parties by  diplomatic

means. I think certain statements made have been  very

provocative,  and  I believe that in  future  measures

affecting the national interests of the people  should

be  handled in an entirely different way, rather  than

in a provocative and antagonistic exchange of words.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   should   like  to  say  that  I  am   an   elected

representative  of  the people.  As  such,  I  am  not

answerable for my actions to a colonial official. I am

only  answerable to the people. Secondly, as a  member

of  the  People's Action Party, I stand  for  a  free,

democratic  Malaya through peaceful  and  non-violent

methods,   but  I  should  not  support  the  colonial

officials in spreading the negative hysteria of  anti-Communism.  There is nothing which I can  add  to  the

stand  of the People's Action Party which was  defined

by the Secretary of my Party this morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

listening to a number of dramatic and solemn speeches,

I  think  I have come to the conclusion that  in  this

House all of us condemn violence, and I am sure all of

us want to keep law and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point I would want to say about the

closure  of the Chinese schools. We are not  convinced

that   just  by  closing  the  three  Chinese  schools

Government would have accomplished their objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to raise a further question on the

Government's   education   policy   in   general   and

especially in respect of Chinese education.  It  is  a

fact  that  there are a few people carrying  on  evil-minded  activity in the Chinese schools, and  that  it

has  caused the spreading of irresponsible propaganda,

teaching  and misleading many of the innocent  Chinese

youths.  But  one  basic  fact  is  that  our  present

Government,  the  Government elected  by  the  people,

forget  to remind us that this Government is  entirely

different  from the previous colonial government,  and

on  this  point  this  Government  should  assure  the

peoples  of Singapore, especially the Chinese-speaking

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Government is aware of the

dissatisfaction among the Chinese community  regarding

the  so-called  Ten-Year Education  Plan,  the  Frisby

Supplementary Plan and the White Paper. I  heard  what

the  Hon. the Chief Secretary said this morning  about

the rioting and that the Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



school committees should do something about it. But he

is never aware of or understands what the feelings are

these  days among the Chinese school children, as  well

as  the  parents, the school teachers and  the  school

management   committees.  They  have  been   patiently

waiting  for  the  Government  to  change  their  most

unpopular education policy. I think that is the  basis

to  clear away the so-called dissatisfaction which  is

in the Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the closure of these three schools, we find

from reports that in the Hock Lee Bus strike, not only

students  from  the Chung Cheng High  School  and  the

Chinese   High  School  are  involved,  but   also   a

considerable number of girl students and a good number

of  the  onlookers were also involved. It  is  a  most

important fact that the student who was killed  during

the riot was identified as not belonging to either  of

these two above-mentioned schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize that the activities carried

out  by students outside their schools are beyond  the

jurisdiction of the school authority, and we therefore

find  little justification in Government's  action  in

closing  the three Chinese schools. We therefore  feel

that  unless there are good and valid reasons  unknown

to  us  to  justify  the action, the  Government  must

forthwith  lift  the closure order in respect  of  the

three schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I am sure the House will share my grief

and  condolence in the deaths during this rioting, and

I am sure their blood will not have flowed in vain.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate up to

now  I  have  found there is one very  relevant  point

raised  by  the  Member for Tiong Bahru  (Mr  William

Tan),  and  that  is  when  he  said  that  there  was

something wrong somewhere. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  think

we  have  come to the crux of the problem  if  we  can

answer what is wrong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all regret very much the violence we have seen in

the  last few days in Singapore, but now having  taken

stock  of the situation, what is more important to  us

is  that  we  should see that such violence  does  not

occur again, and the key to that, I think, is to  find

out what is wrong with Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if anybody who professes himself to be a

politician, anybody who professes himself to represent

the  people, who has gone out to the people, seen them

and  met  them, who really knows the problems  of  the

people,  he will be able to tell the answer.  Probably

some  who  are in this House may not know the  answer,

because  they have not met the people in the way  they

should have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have found the answer to that question and

that  is that the whole trouble is because of our  bad

and  outmoded social system in Singapore. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Hon. the Chief Minister was not  flaunting

high-sounding phrases over the radio on Thursday night

when  he blamed the past colonial system. Sir, whoever

may  be  to blame for the lack of social services,  it

should  be  apparent that in a society where  children

who have grown to school age cannot find admission  to

schools,  in  a  society where  the  sick  cannot  get

medical attention as they should, Sir, in that society

breed  the germs of discontent, and it is up  to  this

House - to  the  representatives of the people  sitting

here - to find the causes and to try to remove them  and

find  the  solutions to the causes. That is  why,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think the Labour Front has appealed to

the  sense of the people, and that is why I think  the

Labour  Front is the answer to the needs of Singapore,

and  I think it is up to all right-minded citizens  of

Singapore,  who  have the interests  of  Singapore  at

heart,  to  support the Government to eradicate  those

evils  in our society so that we may be able to get  a

contented people in Singapore, who would not  then  be

subjected to the propaganda of those who try  to  make

use of them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  are all sad and sick of the recent outbursts

of violence in this Colony. The workers of this Colony

and their trade unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



were  concerned  over the fact that  an  employer  was

intending  to break the organisation of the  Singapore

Bus  Workers'  Union by trying to  foster  a  'yellow'

union.  This  fact had united the workers against  the

employer.  The firm measures that the Chief  Secretary

would have liked to use could only have led to further

bitterness and violence. It is therefore the  mark  of

great wisdom as shown by the Chief Minister with great

patience  and  understanding in  seeking  to  reach  a

settlement. Great credit is due to the Chief  Minister

in the understanding he displayed under very difficult

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Piah Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Piah Teng (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

has  been said by some people that a Nominated  Member

of  this  House  only  represents himself  and  nobody

else.  After careful consideration, I am inclined  to

agree  with  such  remarks, because when  a  Nominated

Member  speaks he does not claim to carry  or  aim  at

carrying  with  him a number of followers.  He  speaks

without  prejudice or favour. He speaks  according  to

his conscience, and according to what he thinks is  in

the best interest of the country and its people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think anybody who has such interest at heart will

agree  that  the grave events which have  taken  place

during the last few days have done an unlimited amount

of  harm  to the interests and welfare of this country

and  its  people, no matter whether they are employees

or  employers. Since the grave events leading  to  the

loss of many lives and property, there has followed an

atmosphere of uneasy quietness. I do hope that this is

the  sign of being wiser after the event. But how much

better  it  would be for one to be more  cautious  and

wise before the event?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government has definitely promised us to

carry out a number of measures aimed at improving  the

lot  of  the workers of this country, and it  is  only

fair  to  give it a chance to put these measures  into

execution. All things cannot be done at once. It  must

be  given  time.  But  if in the meanwhile  particular

sections  of  workers  feel that they  have  immediate

grievances  in  their conditions of  employment,  then

there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



are  procedures  by  which such  grievances  could  be

brought  out  to light and measures for  putting  them

right  be discussed and negotiated, and if it is  felt

that  the law governing the procedures is not fair  to

one  side  or  the other, such points  could  also  be

brought to this House and discussed, and, if they  are

really  unfair, could be amended. But in the  meantime

law  and order must be maintained. Innocent people and

their  property must have protection and,  above  all,

the  welfare  of  the country and its people  must  be

safeguarded, for otherwise there will be  chaos  which

will benefit no one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when a jockey has chosen a horse to ride during

a  race, he certainly appears to have a better  chance

to  win, but if that horse is over-whipped and,  worse

still, given an overdose of stimulant, the chances are

that  that  horse will run wild. The able jockey  will

then lose control of his ride, with the result that he

will either be thrown off half way round the track, or

be  carried at a suicidal speed far beyond the winning

post he aimed at - and perhaps over the precipice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

many  of  the  speakers previously have  covered  much

ground.  Some of them have given a history leading  to

the  violence  and thereafter. I feel that  the  price

that  Singapore  has had to pay to  settle  one  trade

dispute is too high, with four lives lost and so  many

people injured. I feel that that sort of way to settle

a  dispute is not the right way. Indeed, when you come

to  think  about  the ways the leaders start  settling

disputes  by a show of force, I feel that it  is  only

right that decent people should come forward and voice

their  opinion  and  help the workers  to  make  their

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as an example I quote you - trade unions have

been  established since the war. There have been  many

people  who claim to be their leaders. There are  many

who  would say that they care for the welfare  of  the

workers,  but  I am not too sure about  it.  Are  they

making  use of these trade unions as tools  for  their

political ends, or are they really willing tools to be

made  use of by those trade unions and the workers  to

better their conditions?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few days the Chief Minister has

tried,  and  tried  very hard,  to  solve  a  dispute.

However, that solution was forced out of him with a 24-hour   ultimatum.  Should  that  settlement   be   not

effected, we had been told that there would be greater

disorder or a bigger strike. Now, those are forces  we

are  faced  with in this world - and are  their  demands

right?  Can  we  withstand  such  forces?  Or  do   we

capitulate  before such forces? I  can  see  that  the

Chief  Minister has virtually capitulated, or if  that

is not so, he has made another party capitulate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the negotiations in a trade dispute I feel that

the  spirit  should not be for the  strong  to  demand

everything  from  the other side. I believe  that  the

essence should be compromise. Again, I feel, too, that

in Singapore the weapon of strike has been used rather

too  often. I feel that more opportunities  should  be

given  to  negotiations before any  such  weapons  are

used.  Perhaps it is said that we are fighting  for  a

cause. Perhaps that cause is most worthy, but a  cause

that has caused riots is not going to be one that will

be  supported by the people. Furthermore, I feel  that

workers  during  such strikes led by  their  so-called

leaders  have  inflicted more pain on  themselves  and

more loss on themselves. During such strikes there are

such  things  as a few arrests and injuries.  The  so-called  leaders are free from such injury. The leaders

have  suffered  no loss of wages, which  I  think  the

workers themselves have suffered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, trade unionism, I believe, is going to foster

better employer-employee relationship. I find that  if

this  strike weapon is used all along, if we find that

to  support a small section, the whole lot of the  bus

workers  should go out on strike, are  they  not  only

punishing the one they call a defaulting employer  but

also those who take no part and with whom they have no

grouse  or grievance? I feel the strike weapon  should

be used very discreetly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, workers, I believe, should think of the

inconvenience  they will cause to fellow  workers  who

are dependent on their services. It is not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



employer  class  that is going to suffer,  but  indeed

they  are inflicting suffering on the workers who  are

dependent on them for their services and the  children

who have got to go to school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wise leaders, I believe, have not been too wise.

The  present  strike that has been settled,  I  should

say, has not created a sense of peace in the minds  of

many  people.  Indeed, to me and to  a  lot  of  other

people  in Singapore it seems to be only a truce,  and

that truce might be broken up. When trouble will start

nobody  knows. Singapore seems to be expectant  as  to

when the next crop of trouble will start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to this, we have had strikes, genuine trade

disputes  coming up by single unions, but at  present,

just  these  few  weeks,  there  have  been  crops  of

strikes. What is behind all this? Government  has  put

forward one or two points. Government probably will do

its best. We trust that the Government will do all  it

could to preserve peace and order, without which it is

difficult to work - even for the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  debate from the opposite side of the  House

opened with very statesmanlike remarks from the Member

for  Tanglin (Mr Ede) that in this moment of  tragedy

no  Party  should seek to take advantage for political

purposes  of  the existing situation. I  must  confess

that  the  pleasure  which those words  gave  me,  the

intimation of a sense of responsibility which seems to

have  come  anew to the hon. Gentlemen  opposite,  was

immediately destroyed, because the hon. Member  belied

his  own  statement  by making the most  extraordinary

political  recriminations, in which he accused  me  of

being  guilty  of the murder of these four  dead  men,

because  I  condemned,  as I condemn  again,  colonial

capital exploitation of this territory. He accused  us

of  so organising our handling of the situation as  to

try to get votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is complete freedom of speech in this

place,  freedom  to be as cheap as a human  being  can

descend  to.  We have had an example of  it  today.  I

would like it to be made clear, Sir, in this stress of

tragedy through which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



we  have  passed, at a moment when we do  not  require

votes  as we are in power, that my Government is  very

conscious of the extremely weak position of the worker

of  this territory, and so long as it exists, it  will

work unflinchingly with the greatest possible emphasis

on  the  welfare of the worker. Hon. Members  opposite

can  speak  of capitulation. They can speak what  they

will.  That is our position, and I think it is proper,

Sir,  at  this juncture that the hon. Members of  this

House should be aware of a manoeuvre which has come to

my  notice:  according  to my information,  the  Party

which  the Member for Tanglin represents has  indulged

in  active behind-the-scenes negotiations with Members

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I can understand the alarm which

the hon. Member feels at what is going to be stated

publicly, and I will now repeat it: that the Party

represented by those gentlemen, now silent, entered

into negotiations with Members across the floor and

Members on my side of the House with a view to

utilizing the present tragedy and the present

opportunity to bring down my Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please, Mr Chief Minister. I

think,  Mr Chief Minister, that you will probably  be

imputing  improper motives to other  Members  of  this

House, and I think if you leave it at that, you are in

order. If you continue, I might have to pull you up.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> With respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  finished,  and  I can but  regret  a  rebuke  in

anticipation of what I do not understand. There is  no

question of impropriety. They seek power, and that  is

proper. That they should seek power in this fashion is

improper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin made the suggestion that

Government  could have acted swifter  and  quicker.  I

would  remind  him, Sir, that in a democracy  one  can

only  act in harmony with public opinion, and  it  can

only act in opposition to public opinion in moments of

urgent stress, and not otherwise. That moment was  not

reached in Singapore before Thursday, the 12th of May,

and  we are a democracy, whatever the hon. Members for

the  P.A.P. may think. The time had not come for  the

use  of the bullet and the Emergency Regulations.  Had

we,  prior  to the 13th, sought to use the bullet  and

the  Emergency Regulations as a means of  establishing

order,   we  would  have  destroyed  the  concept   of

democracy  and its value in this territory completely.

We would have identified ourselves with a system which

we  ourselves abhor. It was important that  we  should

not   act  in  a  fashion  which  would  destroy,  not

ourselves,  which  does not matter,  but  which  would

destroy  those  ideals for which  I  trust  the  great

majority  of  the  hon.  Members  of  this  House  are

striving - the  ideals  of  the democratic  process.  We

would have given magnificent propaganda value to those

who say that this constitution is unworkable, and that

it  is  not  democratic in utilizing, when  it  seemed

unnecessary from surface symptoms, methods which  were

too drastic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 13th, Sir, representations were made to us by

the  Police - and this in answer to the hon. Member  who

asked why the curfew was re-introduced - representations

were made to us that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



re-introduction of the curfew regulation itself  would

give an indication that Government intended to take  a

very  firm  stand against violence, and that  if  that

indication  was  not  respected, it  might  well  have

become  necessary for the curfew to be  imposed.  Hon.

Members across the floor will realize that that curfew

emergency regulation was, in fact, not used. In answer

to  the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) as

to why we should require Emergency Regulations in this

territory,  when  in other territories  they  seem  to

quell  riots without them, I would remind him that  in

India, for example - perhaps he knows well - the power  of

the Police to impose curfew regulations is part of the

Penal  Code. We have not that power here. The question

that  is before you is whether we were right at  that

time  to re-impose that curfew regulation. Even  more,

Sir,  is the question whether Government was right  in

the  way it handled the situation and wherein  is  the

root of the causes of that day of terror.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar spoke with a

persuasiveness that, to those who are not in the know,

completely obliterated his glaring omissions, masterly

omissions.  I have been today the object  of  bouquets

from  hon.  Gentlemen opposite, and I find  them  very

flattering, for which I am very grateful and  which  I

believe  are  sincere. But I would be  failing  in  my

duty,  Sir,  if I permitted my appreciation  of  those

acts of courtesy to deter me from giving the House the

facts as I believe them. The story that you have heard

is  that  this  violence arose out of a dispute  of  a

vital  nature  essential for  the  survival  of  trade

unionism.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar and every  one

of  his colleagues know the facts. Although originally

so,  the dispute did not, in fact, pursue those  lines

as   it  developed,  and  although,  I  believe,   the

grievances   of  the  dismissed  men  were  legitimate

grievances,  as  indicated by  my  action  in  forcing

through   a   solution   very  favourable   to   their

grievances,  their  act in parking themselves  outside

the  gates  and  giving physical  obstruction  to  the

passage of the buses was knowingly a criminal act, and

the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



when  he  says  that,  "I am in  agreement  with  this

passive  resistance," is, in fact, suggesting that  he

is  in  agreement with processes which  he  knows  are

contrary to the law. That is important in so far as he

is  concerned, Sir, but not in so far as  the  workers

are  concerned. The workers' interests, when they vary

with the law - they do not always understand the law - but

I think it should be appreciated at this juncture that

we  were  in this Chamber on the 27th when  there  was

that  charge, without our knowledge, that  morning  at

the  gates of Hock Lee Bus Company in pursuance of the

request of the management to clear the gates and allow

their  buses their lawful right to proceed;  that,  on

the  27th,  Sir, a court of inquiry was  appointed  to

inquire  into  all  the  matters  in  dispute  between

management  and  labour,  and that  responsible  trade

unionists  and  responsible workers with  a  sense  of

civic  consciousness, who are aware of their  duty  to

the  public  as  well as to the trade union  movement,

would  have  abided  in patience the  result  of  that

inquiry. And I have not the slightest doubt, Sir, that

the man we have appointed, whom the workers themselves

respect,  may  have come to some similar  solution  to

that  which I, under the pressure of the tragedy which

had  occurred, had to bulldoze through in  four  hours

with  the  assistance  of the counsel  for  the  three

parties  concerned, including the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar.  But that was a procedure which, as the  leader

of  the Progressive Party put it, short-circuited  the

law  and  short-circuited the due process of the  law,

and  a  procedure which every responsible  person  and

every responsible trade unionist should deplore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from appointing a court of inquiry, Sir,

perhaps  wrongly I went down myself seeking, with  the

assistance  of my colleague the Hon. the Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock), some solution,

and the workers' statement was, "We know it is against

the  law,  but  it  is  not fair  that  we  should  be

prohibited from working and earning our living, whilst

they  are  allowed to make profits." Sir, I have  said

that  seemed logical enough, although the law did  not

support it. But let us say this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



for  the management that has been attacked repeatedly,

and  I do not say attacked without justice - but let  us

say   this   for   the  management  which   co-operated

valiantly,    with   considerable   restraint,    with

Government  in  its  efforts  to  maintain  law.   The

management  said, "Very well, we will reinstate  these

men,  without prejudice, and pay them in  full,  until

the  recommendations  and findings  of  the  court  of

inquiry are made." So, Sir, from that moment when they

were to be reinstated, without prejudice, their salary

to  be  paid, their grievances looked into by a court,

there  did  not  any longer exist any question  of  an

industrial  character, let alone a question  vital  to

trade unionism which required the continuation of that

physical obstruction contrary to the law. Let  us  get

that  straight,  everyone of us.  The  hon.  Gentleman

opposite, Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  has  one

thing  in common with Lord Nelson. It is said of  Lord

Nelson, Sir, that at a certain naval battle his  staff

captain  said,  "The  Admiral  is  ordering   you   to

retreat,"  and Nelson put his telescope to  his  blind

eye and said, "I cannot see that signal. Proceed!" The

hon.  Member opposite has an extraordinary capacity - an

extraordinary capacity, I repeat - for turning  a  blind

eye to unpleasant facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was ingenuously quite shaken by the refusal of the

Bus Workers' Union to accept this reinstatement, their

grim  dislike of the idea of a settlement; and then  I

realised,  Sir,  that we were on the 29th  April,  and

from   various  other  items  of  information  at   my

disposal,  this  was obviously the  hard  core  of  an

attempt  to  work  up  a  demonstration - a  test  of  a

political  party's own strength for the time  when  it

may  have  to  use  it - an intention  to  have  a  mass

demonstration so successful in character that it would

snowball  its  own membership campaign. And  this  was

confirmed  by  strikes that grew like  mushrooms,  all

under  the  control of individuals within  the  P.A.P.

camp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fairness, I would like to say this openly as

an  individual. I personally accept unhesitatingly the

assurance  of  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  opposite

that  he  is  not a Communist. I accept  that  without

reservation. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



also  accept  the assurance that he is working  for  a

democratic,  non-Communist Malaya. And I say,  Sir,  I

say   with   respect   to   him - he   is   a   man   of

intelligence - that  he is allowing himself  to  be  the

cat's-paw of forces which he knows to be evil. He,  in

his  hunger for popularity, in his desire to  maintain

intact this organisation which he has helped to build,

in  his  desire to destroy colonialism - he  is  working

with forces that he knows are evil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had these remarks about Government seeking to

stir up anti-Communist hysteria. This is not hysteria.

These  are  facts. Singapore is a political  balancing

point  of Asia today. I love Malaya, Sir, as  much  as

any  man in this House, and I am working for a  Malaya

that  will  not be a satellite of England  or  of  any

other  nation in the world. And I am appealing now  to

persons  who  are honest, to persons who are  genuine,

and to persons who are able, to open their eyes to the

evils within their own camp. You cannot have one  foot

in  the  Communist camp and one foot in the democratic

camp. You must come out frankly, and this is the  time

to  come  out because, Sir, they must be conscious - the

gentlemen  across the floor - that they  did,  in  fact,

permit their organisation to be utilised fully for the

purposes  of  manoeuvrings workers into  an  emotional

demonstration for 1st May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dismissed workers at Hock Lee Bus Company taunted

and  provoked  the police day after day. The  students

passing  police  stations were most insulting  to  the

police  in  the hope that there would be at least  one

incident  out of which capital could be  made  on  1st

May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One newspaper editorial said that they were tired of

hearing about commendable restraint. They may be,  but

I   will  repeat  it - it  is  because  of  Government's

restraint that the tragedies which we saw on Thursday,

12th May, did not occur on May 1. It was then planned,

Sir,  to  test  this strength which may ultimately  be

used    for    the   overthrow   of   the   democratic

Government - and the cat's-paws, I will name  them:  the

People's  Action Party, the poor workers of  Singapore

whose legitimate grievances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



have  been  exploited; and I will show you  how.  Hon.

Members   opposite -   trade   unionists   and    legal

advisers - were deluding this House into believing  that

it  is  a  vital question of 'yellow' unions that  has

brought  about  this dispute. Let  me  read  to  you  a

statement  by  a  gentleman  whom  the  P.A.P. should

recognise, in a paper published yesterday.  Sir,  Fong

Swee Suan, whom I think the P.A.P. knows very well - one

of  its men - as Secretary of the Singapore Bus Workers'

Union, published in the Nanyang Siang Pao and the Sin

Chew' Jit Pao of yesterday's date - what does he say was

the  cause of this trouble? Would the P.A.P. take  his

word for it? He is one of their apostles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We would like to point out" - this release is in the

name  of  the  Singapore Bus Workers  Union - after  the

settlement, Sir, when they had gained

so much -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We would like to point out that the bloodshed and

rioting resulting from the present case was occasioned

entirely by acts of violence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the principle of right to collective bargaining,

not  the  principle  that 'yellow'  unions  cannot  be

tolerated in a healthy trade union movement, but "acts

of violence" - just imagine!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Instead of showing sympathy for the Hock Lee Bus

workers,  who were dismissed on pretext for no  reason

by   their   employer,  the  authorities,  under   the

protection   of   the  unreasonable   Trade   Disputes

Ordinance,  applied  corporal  punishment  thrice   on

utterly defence - less workers peacefully seeking their

own survival."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that is false, but that is exactly how the

emotions  of  the workers were roused by hon.  Members

opposite  and  their colleagues, and  by  those  other

cat's-paws - our  deluded  and idealistic  students.  Is

this  true? Is it? Were they peaceful strikers seeking

their own survival? Could they not wait one week until

the  court  of inquiry had made its findings?  Was  it

essential that four should die? Was it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that violence should be held

responsible - violence - and that is the plea,  Sir,  that

no striker can resist. The workers of this country are

responsible people, but they are mainly illiterate  in

any language - I will not speak of English only - and when

you go to them and you say, "Solidarity of the workers

de-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



mands  that  you  stand up and spit at Government  for

violently  attacking  peaceful workers  seeking  their

survival," naturally they rise in anger. Only you know

that  that was not true; that Government did  not  use

violence  against  peaceful  strikers  seeking   their

survival. That was not true. But that is how  emotions

were worked up and ultimately, Sir, the incident which

was sought was capitalised for this other day, which I

understand  in  the Communist calendar  is  known  as

"Five  One Three" - the 13th of May, the Day of  Chinese

Student  Heroes. That was what it was being worked  up

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received from trade unions under the control

of  the P.A.P. insulting ultimata which no responsible

person, no honest trade unionist could tolerate.  They

know - the people may not know

- that they have placed at strategic points in many  of

these  trade unions men who are not workers, and  have

never been workers in the sense that they work in  the

unions,  in  the  work  which  those  unions  seek  to

protect.  They  have placed students and outsiders - who

now  control them - not for the welfare of the  workers,

but  working  through the welfare of  the  workers  at

times, with but one object - utilisation of those people

for political ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the hon. Gentleman for Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua) statesmanlike words

today,  about how he regrets this violence and how  it

is  unhealthy for all labour - and he is very right. We

must  all be conscious, Sir, that the events  of  the,

past few days have meant a tremendous setback to many

of  our aspirations, have destroyed to a large extent

the goodwill we had with the Federation, and the hopes

we  had  of  union with the Federation. Their  present

attitude  is - and  let  us get it  clear - "We  are  glad

Singapore is no part of us. Singapore is going to be a

Red  enclave, and we are well rid of it." That is what

has been achieved, and I think the P.A.P. - with respect

to my friends and thanks for their courtesy - the P.A.P.

in  its  defence today in omitting the truth, glossing

over  certain facts and presenting them to you on  the

basis that this was noth-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



ing but a perfectly legitimate dispute in respect of a

vital trade union matter, have proved their own guilt.

I  do not know, Sir, whether you have noticed in those

masterly  omissions  from the hon. Gentlemen  opposite

how  careful  they have been to avoid  mentioning  the

schools  and the part that the students of the  middle

schools played in this tragedy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a newspaper editorial today, Sir, I read these

words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The threat of the middle school students is to the

security  of  Singapore.  Their  capacity  to  provoke

violence  and their obvious subservience to disruptive

forces has become evident in the riots."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it must have been evident to the hon. Gentlemen

opposite, so closely related with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while representatives of labour and management

and  Government  achieved a  solution  with  the  full

co-operation  on  Saturday of the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  and  the hon. Member behind him (Mr Lim  Ching

Siong),  let us remember that, Sir, it was  not  in  a

moment  of  elation that I thanked them for their  co-operation  that day, but because I have at  all  times

been  prone to gratitude for that which is helpful  at

the moment, whatever the reason that has inspired that

help.  Although we recognise that, we must  not  blind

ourselves  to the fact that there is in this territory

a  small  group  of  people who seek  to  destroy  the

democratic process by, shall we put it in the words of

the  hon.  Gentleman  opposite,  "seeking  to  destroy

colonialism",  and  have found ready  tools  in  these

gentlemen,  and  through  them  in  the  schools,  and

through the schools in the Chinese newspapers,  for  a

procedure  which would not bring about self-government

for  this  territory, but which would forever  destroy

any  hopes of independence. The hon. Member  says,  "I

have no faith in the Labour Front as a vehicle of  its

platform." Fair enough, Sir. He says, "I have no  faith

in the British and do not believe they will keep their

promise until we compel them to." Very good, Sir.  But

he  forgets, when he says, "I will not - " - what are  his

words? - "I  will  not  fight Communism  to  preserve  a

colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



Malaya." If he permits, or co-operates with the  blind

Nelsonian eye in Communism's fight to control  Malaya,

he  will  never, ever, have the chance  of  having  an

independent Malaya. Many people and many nations which

have  been satellites of England are now independent.

I  ask  hon. Members opposite to try and think of  one

single  nation  which,  having  been  a  satellite  of

Communism, has managed to escape those clutches.  One!

Name  me  one! If we allow this territory, because  of

your  desire to destroy colonialism, if we  co-operate

with Communism, once we are in their clutches, we  are

not  merely  out of the frying pan, we are right  into

the fire. Is that what they want?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P., which consists of responsible, decent,

honest men - many of them - if they would purge themselves

of the Communists and fellow-travellers that they know

they   have,   if   they   would   face   their    own

responsibility,  they could be the  organisation  that

they  hope to be that would one day lead this  country

to  win its independence. But along the road that they

have  so  far  chosen lies chaos and  misery  for  the

people, and they should face it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of - I must say a few words, Sir, on the

subject of Chinese schools. Others may avoid it, but I

must say a few words even though the division is at  4

o'clock, and it is this: That this Government believes

in  the decency and the worth of the great mass of our

youth  and  their potential; that we  believe  a  tiny

group,  which  does  not stop  at  murder,  has  given

Singapore and the Chinese schools of Singapore  a  bad

name throughout the world. This small group has struck

at  the heart of Chinese education. Students have been

intimidated,  coerced; and so have their  parents  and

their  principals  and their teachers.  Students  have

been  driven from class-rooms to the streets.  Parents

fear for their children's safety and for their own, if

they  seek  to deter their children from participation

in these vicious activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our primary duty as a Government to protect

Chinese  education in Singapore, and we intend  to  do

it,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



whether you cry destruction of Chinese culture or  no.

I  am not an expert on Chinese culture, I admit to the

hon.  Gentleman for Bukit Timah, but I know this  much

about Chinese culture; the little that I know of it is

its    exquisite   courtesy   and   reasonableness - not

thuggery,   which  is  responsible  for  a  tremendous

influence  in  these  middle schools  today.  We  have

closed  these, Sir, it has been said, two schools.  We

have  not  closed  them. We have  indicated  to  their

trustees  that we are extremely dissatisfied with  the

existing position, and suggested that they be  closed.

That suggestion has been accepted, and the question is

now  for us, Sir, quite frankly if they do not  accept

that  suggestion, there are methods of procedure  that

we  can employ, and will employ. We will not evade our

responsibilities. Now we are in process  of  examining

to what extent it is necessary to reorganise either or

both  of  those  schools, so that the schools  may  be

returned     to     their    primary     object     of

education - education  in  the  arts  of  life,  not  in

thuggery and intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I close, I, who have been known for many

years  as a violent antagonist of the Police Force  of

this  colony - and  I  say now I think  with  right  and

justice every time I attacked them - I would like to say

this:  that  from  all reports at my  disposal,  I  am

amazed   and   deeply  impressed  by   the   wonderful

discipline  and the magnificent manner in  which  they

performed their duty in a ghastly time. I regret, Sir,

that time requires now that I should -

great  pain  to have to be put into this  position  to

which  I  can now say is completely false and  without

any foundation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered the Chamber after the adjournment,

just before half-past two, I had a few words with  the

Chief  Minister, and he gave me an indication of  what

was coming. That was why I was very anxious to stop it

before  he  made statements which had been maliciously

put  to him to discredit our Party, and I must put  it

to  the  great  stress that he must have been  working

under  during the last few weeks, that he has  chosen,

in  all  his wisdom and experience at the Bar, not  to

give me the benefit of the doubt when I told him,  "Do

not raise the question now, I can satisfy you."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can safely say, Sir, that throughout these last few

days,  the most remote idea in our heads was to topple

his  Government.  We  know his  Government  is  in  an

unassailable  position today. They have  a  tremendous

majority,

and  I,  for  one, can swear that I have  never  acted

against  him or his Party; nor did any member  of  our

Party - I  can  safely  say - try to work  to  unseat  his

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this time of crisis only criminals will do such a

thing. Our only thoughts were for the safety, security

and  happiness of Singapore, and we would  never  have

added  to  all  the  uncertainties and  commotion  of

having to change a government during these troublesome

times  when death was in the streets just a few nights

ago, and we know that the trouble may not yet be over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were on the point of issuing to the Press a denial

that  there  was such an approach, and it is  a  great

pity  that  the Chief Minister has chosen  to  believe

lies  before he has made proper inquiries. I would  at

this  moment ask him to name the persons whom we  have

approached, either on this side of the House or on his

side  of the House, to join us to form a coalition  to

topple his Government. I do not want to belabour  this

point,  Sir. If  there was any  doubt  in  the  Chief

Minister's  mind, this doubt should have been  removed

this  morning when our spokesman for the  day  assured

him  that  our Party would stand by the Government  in

its  efforts  to  maintain public  order  and  we  are

willing not to taunt him any more if he does not carry

out some of the impossible promises his Party made  in

their election platform.
