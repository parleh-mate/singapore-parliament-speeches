<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, I rise to move the motion standing  in  my

name as it appears in item 2 of the Order Paper.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of section 79 of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, resolves that the remuneration of the Chairman

and Members of the Public Service Commission established under section 76 of the

aforementioned Order shall be as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for the Chairman, an inclusive salary of $2,000 per month;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for the Deputy Chairman, a retainer of $750 per month and in addition, $30

per day on which he attends a meeting of the Commission with a maximum of 20 days

in any one month; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for other Members, a retainer of $500 per month and in addition, $30 per

day on which they attend a meeting of the Commission with a maximum of 20 days

in any one month.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Assembly will know that under

section  79  (2)  of  the Singapore  (Constitution)

Order  in  Council, 1958, the terms of  service  of

Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



of the Public Service Commission shall either -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be prescribed by or under any law made under this

Order; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in so far as they are not prescribed by or under any such law) be prescribed by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara.



<br><br>Further, section 79 subsection (3)-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of service of any member shall not be

altered  to his disadvantage during his continuance

in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the salary structure of the

Government service, we have allowed a provision  of

$2,000  per  month for the Chairman, $750  for  the

Deputy  Chairman,  and $500  for  the  three  other

Members  of the Commission. In arriving at the  sum

of $2,000, we took into consideration the fact that

the predecessor of the office had a total emolument

of $2,300.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members of the Assembly remember what

happened to the variable allowances. And pan  passu

with  these cuts in variable allowances, the salary

of the Chairman of the Public Service Commission is

now  fixed  at $2,000 per month. As for the  Deputy

Chairman  and other Members, they have remained  as

before - at $750 and $500 - the only alteration  being

the  drop in the allowance from $50 per meeting  to

$30 per meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

Section 79 of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in

Council,  1958,  resolves that the remuneration  of

<div align="center"><b>AUDIT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that at the last sitting of

the  Assembly,  the  Financial Procedure  Bill  was

passed  to  fill in the general framework  for  the

control   of  public  expenditure  established   in

sections  95 to 100 of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order  in Council. Sections 101 to 103 of the Order

in  Council  similarly provide a skeleton  for  the

audit  of public accounts by the Director of Audit.

The present Audit Bill is intended to give flesh to

those bones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement has set out in full the

nature  of the clauses of the Bill and I  need  not

therefore  say  more than that, together  with  the

Financial  Procedure Bill, it is so  designed  that

the  finances  of  the State will be  subjected  to

proper  accounting procedure and regulations which,

under  the  watchful eye of the Director of  Audit,

will be meticulously followed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factories Ordinance provides for the

regulation  and supervision of health,  safety  and

welfare of persons employed in factories and  other

workplaces.  An amendment to section 6,  subsection

(4)  of  this Ordinance is now considered necessary

to provide that small factories employing less than

ten   persons  will  only  be  exempted  from   the

provisions of the Ordinance if no mechanical power,

steam boiler, steam container, steam receiver, cast

iron    underfired   vulcaniser,   air    receiver,

refrigerating plant pressure receiver, or gas plant

is  used, or where no highly inflammable or noxious

substance is manipulated, used or created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Ordinance stands, no

legal  action can be taken against a small  factory

employing less than ten persons even though it uses

the  kind of machinery mentioned above. It has been

found  that  there are a large number of  factories

having  less  than  ten persons  using  out-of-date

machinery  which  did  not originally  have  safety

guards  incorporated, or where they have had safety

guards, these could easily be removed, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is merely seeking power to take

preventive action against serious accidents to life

and limb in small factories employing less than ten

persons  where  dangerous  machinery  of  the  type

mentioned above is used, and which are now excluded

from the Factories Ordinance, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, a locally assembled grinding

machine burst its grinding wheel, a piece of  which

hit   the   operator  in  the  face,  killing   him

instantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendment to the Factories Ordinance

is   designed  to  enable  proper  control  to   be

exercised  in  respect  of  such  activities  where

dangerous  machinery  is used  in  small  factories

employing less than ten persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that the

original  Factories Bill provided that premises  in

which there were less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



than  six  employees should be  exempted  from  the

provisions  of the Ordinance. This Bill  was  later

referred  to a Select Committee of the  House,  and

was  discussed  in  Select Committee  on  the  15th

September,  1958.  It  was first  proposed  to  the

Select  Committee  that  the  exemption  should  be

extended to premises in which there were less  than

16  employees, and the Chief Minister, Tun Lim  Yew

Hock, agreed to a compromise by which premises with

less  than  ten employees were to be exempted  from

the  provisions of the Factories Ordinance. It  was

thought  that  such  an  exemption  would  make  it

unnecessary for a lot of small businesses to comply

with the onerous provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of confusion of thought as to

what  the Bill was designed to do when it was  last

before  this House. Members who spoke in the Select

Committee  mentioned that great hardship  would  be

caused  to  small businesses, in which no machinery

was  used,  if  they  were not  exempted  from  the

provisions of the Ordinance. I would refer you, Mr

Speaker,  to the proceedings of the 15th September,

1958,   in  Select  Committee,  and  I  will  quote

extracts  from  speeches which were  made  by  hon.

Members at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what one hon. Member had to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is bringing in, for the first time,

certain trades within the definition of "factory",

trades which do not use any mechanical devices or

machinery.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, all factories use mechanical devices or

machinery, Sir. For instance, this is what the same

Member said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shoe makers and garment manufacturers have,

on   analysis,  more  than  six  workers  in  their

premises.  With the trades which are not using  any

mechanical   or  electrical  machinery,   what   is

important  are  the conditions  of  work  from  the

health  point of view of the workers, and I do  not

think  the original intention of this Bill  was  to

bring   these   trades   within   its   provisions.

Consequently,  I think an increase  to  the  number

would  automatically exempt most  of  these  trades

from the provisions of the Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not realised at the time that premises

using the type of machinery mentioned in the

Ordinance would be just as dangerous to safety even

if a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



single  workman was employed to tend the machinery.

I  have  just  mentioned the case of  the  grinding

machine  which burst its grinding wheel, and  which

instantaneously killed the person operating it.  It

is  therefore  considered essential that  factories

employing  less  than  ten persons  and  which  are

operated  by mechanical power or which  use  highly

inflammable, or noxious substances should  also  be

brought  under  the  provisions  of  the  Factories

Ordinance  for  the  reasons which  I  have  stated

above. I do move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a short and simple Bill, the urgency of

which  is  due  to the fact that the  life  of  the

current  Hotels  Licensing Board  expired  on  10th

August,  1959, and new appointments are  necessary.

In  accordance with the provisions of the  existing

section 3 of the Hotels Ordinance, 1959, this Board

consisted  of a Chairman appointed by the  Governor

in Council and not less than six members elected by

the Justices of the Peace from among themselves and

appointed by the Governor in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Government considers, however, that in

view  of  the new constitutional changes, it  would

now be more appropriate for the Minister to appoint

the Chairman and members of the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will also enable to Minister to

choose  from  a  wider field of selection  suitable

persons  for  appointment  as  members  who   could

reflect  the  new Government's attitude  on  social

vices.  It  is a logical step to expect that  after

the  closure  of  pin-tables  and  juke  boxes  and

gambling  dens, the Government should now pay  very

close   attention  to  bawdy  houses  and  brothels

disguised as; legitimate hotels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill, therefore, amends section

3  of  the  Hotels Ordinance, 1954, to reconstitute

the Board on the lines which I have mentioned. Sir,

I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to make

provision for the invalidation of certain acts  and

proceedings  of the so-called Tang Peng Yeu-Vasagar

City  Council in the six weeks between 18th  April,

1959  and  5th  June, 1959. The  people  know  that

during  this short period of six weeks,  many  acts

and decisions were passed by this rump City Council

depleted  of any mandate or any authority to  carry

on.  It made important decisions which affected the

interests  of the nation for a long time,  in  some

cases raising fundamental issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the question of tariff charges

for  electricity supplied to cinemas. Mr  Speaker,

during the ten years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



when  the Member for Farrer Park was in sole charge

of the City Council, we the people of Singapore had

to  pay  20  cents  a unit for electricity  charges

while  cinema-owners had to pay only three to  four

cents  a  unit  for their lighting. That  had  been

going  on  for nearly ten years until we  found  it

out.  The case they put up was to masquerade  under

the  so-called maximum demand tariff that,  without

these  cinemas, the electricity being  churned  out

from  the  Pasir  Panjang Power  Station  would  be

thrown into the sea. We know that this was far from

true. We raised the cinema rates from three or four

cents  to  20  cents per Unit. But during  the  six

weeks that the watch-dogs of the nation were not in

the Council, the rump City Council of Tang Peng Yeu

Vasagar  rescinded  our  decision  and  decided  to

conclude   an   agreement  with  the  cinema-owners

providing for a substantial reduction in the  rates

payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have in front of me a so-called agreement signed between the parties. This deed of

compromise  was made on the 29th day of May,  1959.

There  are  a  few  significant  features  in  this

agreement.  One was that although it was  purported

to  be  the  29th  of May, 1959, and  even  if  the

accepted  date is truly the 29th day  of  May,  the

stamp is on the 1st of June, 1959. The fact is that

the  29th of May, 1959, is a date which we call the

eve  of  a beautiful funeral. Because on the  30th,

the   electorate   condemned  the   Parties   whose

representatives had signed this agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second significant feature in this agreement

was  that  in the more than 100 years of  Municipal

history,  as  I  have  been  told,  never  had   an

agreement been concluded on duplicating paper.  All

agreements  were printed and properly sealed.  That

was the first time in Municipal history that a very

important  document  had been stencilled  on  cheap

printing paper, and with many typing mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just to give an instance of the typing mistakes. This deed of compromise made

between  the City Council of the one part, and  the

companies  and  persons - 25 in number - of  the  other

part;  the "25" was changed in handwriting to "17".

Apparently eight of them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



might  have had cold feet, knowing very  well  that

when we came in we would rescind it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 19th of April, 1959, the Chairman of my Party made this important

announcement.  This  is contained  in  the  Straits

Times of the 19th April, 1959:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Toh also warned that the C.A.O. and the Minister for Local Government, Dato Abdul Hamid Bin

Haji  Jumat,  would be held personally  responsible

"for  any acts committed in this interregnum  which

is detrimental to the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Government will rescind and reverse any

decision  or  action which is not in  the  people's

interest,".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we gave due warning to all persons concerned who had dealings with this rump City

Council  that their actions could be re-opened  and

subject   to   review.  And  we  have  here   eight

enlightened cinema-owners who understood that  this

document  was  a  document which was  going  to  be

perpetrated  against the interests of the  country.

They  thus  refused to sign and, as a  result,  the

"25"  had  been corrected in pencil to "17".  There

are  also the initials of Mr P. C. Marcus  as  the

C.A.O.,  Mr G. B. Armstrong, as a City Councillor,

and one member representing the theatre and cinema-owners who initialled just behind the pencil mark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill seeks to rectify, by legislation, this most unsatisfactory situation, by

giving powers to the Minister to invalidate any act

or  proceedings of this rump City Council which  is

not  considered to be in the public  interest,  and

also  to  render  null and void all  contracts  and

agreements  entered into on the authority  of  such

acts  and proceedings. The people pay 20 cents  per

unit for electricity. The cinema-owners should  not

pay only six cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, provision has also been made in the Bill for compensation to be awarded in cases where

hardships may arise as a result of the invalidation

action  taken.  I wish to make some explanation  on

this. There has been a contract on certain sewerage

works  of  the  City Council. The  lowest  tenderer

withdrew  for no reason whatsoever. In  the  normal

practice in the City Council, they always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



re-tender.   But  in  this  case,  the   Committee,

consisting  of  the  residual  of  the  rump   City

Council,  decided to give it to the  second  lowest

tenderer and it cost a quarter of a million dollars

more.  After  we had been elected  in  as  the  new

Government,  I received certain letters  explaining

to  me  why  the  first tenderer withdrew  and  the

reasons which they considered motivated the  giving

of  the tender to the second lowest tenderer.  This

action  was  against all previous  precedents.  Mr

Speaker,  we  have taken action on  this.  We  have

frozen  the contract - luckily the contract  was  not

signed yet. We were fast enough to take action and,

although  the contract was not signed,  the  second

lowest  tenderer  had  done  some  spade-work   and

perhaps,  in  such cases, it might be necessary  to

pay a little bit of compensation to the contractor,

although  it was not the fault of the City  Council

that he had proceeded with the work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, there are many more instances

of  actions  taken by this rump City Council  which

are  against the interests of the country and which

have to be invalidated. This Bill will provide  for

such powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister for National Development  paid  me  a

compliment by saying that I was in sole  charge  of

the  City Council for the ten years previous to his

advent  there. Now, if the Minister means  what  he

says - that  is,  that I was in sole  charge - then  he

must  necessarily imply that I was controlling  the

City  Council and what I said then went in the City

Council, in the same way that when he was the Mayor

what  he said in the City Council went. Fortunately

or unfortunately for me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that was

not  my  position. I was not in sole charge of  the

City Council. I was only one of the members of  the

Board  of Commissioners to begin with, and latterly

one  of the members of the City Council. I had  not

the powers that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



ex-Mayor  had  when  he  was  there.  However,  the

purpose  of  this debate, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is  to

discuss  not who was in charge of the City Council,

but  the merits or demerits of the Bill now  before

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for National Development

started  off his speech by saying this Bill  raises

fundamental issues. Mr Speaker, Sir, to  my  mind,

it   also   raises  fundamental  issues,   but   my

understanding of the fundamental issues  raised  is

not the same as that of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not known a Bill seeking

to  do what this Bill is seeking to do. I have  not

known any legislation such as this enacted and  put

on  any statute book. This is something unique, and

if  this Bill goes through this House, as I  expect

it  will, I hope that this will be the last of such

Bills in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Speaker, Sir, the present

Government in its policy speech said that the prime

task  for  Singapore is to build up  a  climate  of

confidence - confidence of such a nature that  people

will  have faith in this country and come here  and

invest  their money and carry on their business.  I

venture to suggest, Mr Speaker, that Bills of this

nature must surely destroy that confidence. If  one

government  disagrees  with  the  actions  of   the

previous   government,  surely  in   a   democratic

country,  Mr  Speaker,  the  answer  is   not   to

legislate  to  annul such actions of  the  previous

government  and this more so especially in  matters

in  respect of which private citizens had  acquired

rights.  If  our Government is going to  take  this

sort  of  action,  then it  is  going  to  be  very

difficult for private individuals to carry on their

business with any sense of confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill proposes to cancel off all

contracts entered into by the City Council during a

certain  period. No doubt the Mayor and  his  group

were not in the City Council then, but that did not

make  the  City Council an illegal institution.  It

was  a perfectly legal institution carrying out its

duties in a perfectly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



constitutional manner, possibly not in the way that

the  Mayor and his group would have done, but still

carrying  out their duties in a proper  and  lawful

way; and if contracts were entered into as a result

of those lawful acts, is it moral Mr Speaker, that

the  present government should come along and upset

what  was perfectly right, proper and legal at  the

time of decision?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more disturbing than that, Mr Speaker, is

this. Clause 4 of the Bill says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no court shall entertain any claim to

compensation  damages  in  respect  of   any   such

contract or agreement."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bill goes on to say that the Minister, if

he  so  desires, may award compensation.  Why  this

attempt to oust the court of its rightful sphere of

action? If compensation should be paid, why  should

not  the  court  decide  it,  and  why  should  the

Minister  be  allowed to decide it?  Have  we  lost

faith in our courts that we must go to the Minister

every  time? It may be that the Minister may decide

to  cancel  a  contract. Certain legal rights  will

arise  on  work done, on a quantum merit.  Is  that

person  to  be  denied access to  the  courts?  And

should  he  be  left to the tender mercies  of  the

Minister in charge?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that

this  Bill  is  not  the proper Bill  to  create  a

climate  of  confidence;  in  fact,  it  is  highly

improper.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, and fellow Members-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member need not address the

Members of the House. He addresses the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I am sorry. Mr

Speaker,  in  support  of the  Bill  moved  by  the

Minister  for  National Development just  now,  and

which has caused concern to the Opposition Members,

I   can  be  quite  frank  to  say  here,  for  the

information of the Members of the Opposition,  that

it  is  in the interest of the people and State  of

Singapore as a whole. This Bill is not aimed at any

individual, as had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



practised by the Member for Farrer Park when he was

in  the  City Council previously. If we  go  deeply

into  the  matter as to how this Bill  was  brought

about resulting in it being moved today, I think it

will take a long time. However, I wish to reply  to

his queries one by one in order to satisfy him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has stated that it is not proper for the former City Council

to discriminate against the people of Singapore who

pay  16  cents for a unit of electricity, and  that

there  was  no  reason why businessmen  or  cinema-owners  should pay only 6 cents per unit or even  a

lower rate than that. I think this is not fair.  In

my  opinion,  there  must have been  some  ulterior

motive behind that decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park stated just now that

this Bill will create an unhealthy climate for  the

Government  of Singapore, that it will go  to  show

that its administration is not so perfect, and that

it will result in the loss of confidence of cinema-owners in the Government of Singapore. I feel  that

the  loss of confidence will not be as a result  of

this Bill. The loss of confidence resulted from the

attitude  of the City Council during the  past  ten

years for its generous charge of six cents per unit

of  electricity to cinema-owners, or even  a  lower

rate than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly if we increase the charge to more than

six  cents,  or  18 cents a Unit, the cinema-owners

will be surprised, as they are paying six cents per

unit now. Therefore, the loss of confidence was due

to  the fact that the rate had been increased  from

six  cents to 18 cents per unit to bring it at  par

with the rate paid by the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park said that he was not

in sole control of the City Council. But he was one

of  those  responsible for the running of the  City

Council during the past ten years. He played a  big

part  in the City Council and he had powers.  As  a

member  of  the  City Council, I also  had  certain

powers.  When we, the P.A.P., won the elections  to

the  City  Council and we checked the books,  there

was nothing to show that the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



for  Farrer Park opposed the low rate of six  cents

per  unit  of  electricity levied  on  the  cinema-owners.  This  should  be a  guide  to  the  Member

concerned.  I am quite sure that he is fully  aware

that  the loss of confidence is not as a result  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other examples which can be quoted

here.  For instance, the Victoria Theatre, and  the

Murnane  Reservoir, but if I do  that,  I  will  be

running away from the subject of the debate today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, among other things mentioned in this Bill are that the decisions of the previous City

Council of Messrs. "Vasagar/Tang Peng Yeu" would be

considered  unconstitutional and would  be  invalid

and  rescinded. The reason why I support this  Bill

is  that since members of the P.A.P. left the  City

Council, the Opposition Members acted like  thieves

and  robbers  to satisfy their lust  and  ambitions

which  were  opposed by the members of  the  P.A.P.

when they were in the City Council. As mentioned by

the Minister for National Development, normally  an

agreement  is  signed on a standard type  of  paper

according  to  proper procedure but  the  agreement

signed  by  the  City Council of  Mr  Vasagar  and

Messrs. Tang Peng Yeu and company were not so. This

is  the  attitude I was referring to when I  talked

about  thieves  and robbers. There are  many  other

acts  committed  by  them  which  are  not  in  the

interest of the State of Singapore. The reason  for

their perpetuating these acts to satisfy their lust

was   prompted  by  the  support  of  the  previous

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing.

Mr  Speaker,  the  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands and Housing, who is Dato Abdul Hamid bin Haji

Jumat who-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the previous Minister

for  Local Government is now a Member of the  House

and, therefore, he must not be referred to by name.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

tender my apologies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this encouragement came from the previous

Minister. How did he give that encouragement? There

might  be  many other reasons. The powers which  he

had delegated to himself was not in accordance with

the   Local   Government   Ordinance.   With   such

encouragement,  the  ex-City Councillors  committed

many  acts, and made decisions at their  whims  and

fancies.  That  is  the reason  why  this  Bill  is

introduced today - so that the decisions taken  since

the  P.A.P.  City Councillors left, and which  were

not in the interest of the people and of the State,

could be made null and void.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Mr Speaker, I wish to say that this

Bill  has  been formulated in the interest  of  the

people of Singapore, and should be supported by all

here.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member for Anson said

that  when I was the Minister for Local Government,

Lands   and   Housing,  I  encouraged   all   these

commitments,  these unconstitutional  acts  in  the

City Council. This is completely untrue. I wish  to

emphasise  here  that  when I  was  a  Minister,  I

carried out my duties constitutionally. The actions

which   I   took  were  in  accordance   with   the

Constitution of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Member for Anson about the

electricity  agreement signed between  the  cinema-owners,  and the City Council, the present Minister

said  just now that the agreement was made  on  the

1st of June, 1959, i.e. after the elections. So  it

is therefore not true to say that I was responsible

for  or  that  I  encouraged  acts  which  were  in

violation of the Constitution of Singapore.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise just to clarify a few points. This question of

electricity rates has been confusing the  minds  of

the  electorate for some time, and I must say  that

my  mind  is  confused too. I have heard  divergent

views  on  these  electricity  rates.  Perhaps  the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



will  be  able to clear up, once and for all,  this

doubt  in  my mind and in the minds of  many  other

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says, I think, why should it be right and proper that cinema-owners should be

charged a lower rate than what the public is called

upon  to  pay to the City Council? I too have  been

paying  the  City Council rates for electricity.  I

pay  a  rate  for lighting, which is 20  cents  per

unit, and I pay rates for power for my ironing,  my

refrigerator,  and  for  my air-conditioner.  If  I

remember  rightly - I do not have  the  City  Council

bill  with me - for my air-conditioning plant, I  pay

power  at 6 cents per unit. Therefore, if such  are

the proper rates, where then is the right to charge

that cinema-owners are paying lower rates? In fact,

by  this  Bill,  the Minister now proposes  to  re-assess the rates for cinemas and to call upon  them

to pay more. Sir, it is confusing. As I do not have

the  City  Council  bill with me,  I  do  not  know

whether it is right or wrong. But as far as I know,

power  rates are at 6 cents per unit, and  lighting

is  at  20  cents. May I repeat again,  Sir,  if  I

remember  rightly,  the rate  for  air-conditioning

plant is the same as for power; therefore, it is  6

cents - I do not know, I stand subject to correction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point raised by the Member for Farrer

Park, Sir, is not whether the City Councillors, who

remained  at  their posts after the resignation  of

the P.A.P Councillors, did right or wrong. That  is

not  the  question.  The  question  is:  they  were

legally  constituted; they were  discharging  their

duties  in a legal way; and since that is  so,  any

act   that  they  did  was  done  legally.  If  the

Government  was not satisfied with  the  manner  in

which  the  City  Councillors who had  remained  in

office  conducted their business, it is a  question

of  dissatisfaction.  I do not  think  it  is  good

public policy for any incoming government to try to

upset the decisions of a previous government.  That

would create a feeling of uncertainty. As the  hon.

Member  for Farrer Park has pointed out,  the  most

important thing in Singapore today is - and this  is

even admitted by the Government - to create a feeling

of confidence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore.  And  the only way  to  create  such

confidence  is  for the Government  to  create  the

confidence of others in itself. But if such matters

are  allowed to go on without any challenge,  where

then  is  that confidence? Moreover, it seems  that

this  is an important matter, and yet it is brought

up on a Certificate of Urgency. We do not know what

other  forms of contracts or what other actions  of

the  ex-City Councilors come within the  provisions

of  this Bill. If we had time, we might be able  to

know  more  about  it. Apart  from  the  merits  or

demerits  of  the actions of those City Councillors

who  remained in office, I share strongly the  same

view  as  expressed by the hon. Member  for  Farrer

Park, that this is an immoral Bill.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel that this Bill,

introduced    by   the   Minister   for    National

Development, is clear and specific for the  reasons

stated  therein. Mr Speaker, we know that  certain

acts  committed  by certain City Councillors  after

the  resignation  of the P.A.P.  Councillors,  were

done  with the ulterior motive of safeguarding  the

interests  of vested interests. This is made  clear

by  the  instances quoted by the Hon. the  Minister

concerning  the agreements which were signed  in  a

haphazard way. I think, Mr Speaker, there  may  be

many  other reasons; for instance, they  knew  that

their  powers  in  the  City Council  would  cease,

because  it  was clear, from the manifesto  of  the

P.A.P., that if the P.A.P. was returned to power it

would  dissolve the City Council. For this  reason,

they  knew that their fate was written on the wall.

Therefore,  they resorted to unconstitutional  acts

in the interest of vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the present Government of the people will not hesitate to act to safeguard the interest

of the people as a whole. As has been stated by the

Member for Farrer Park, it appeared that he did not

have  power  in the City Council, but  that  was  a

different  matter.  He said that  this  Bill  would

cause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



doubts  in the minds of those people who  think  of

investing  capital in this country, and  that  this

would  create a policy of discrimination.  I  think

the  question  of investment will not be  affected.

There  is  no  need to fear that in this  Bill.  No

policy  of discrimination has been enacted  by  the

Government.  The previous Government in  power  fed

their  cats  with meat, when actually  they  should

have  fed them with vegetables and rice. This means

that certain sections of the people during the last

regime - and   this  also  happened   in   the   City

Council - received  more benefits than  the  ordinary

people.  The  Member also denied that  the  actions

taken  by  the City Councillors who remained  after

the P.A.P. Councilors had left were illegal. We did

not  say that the actions were illegal, but we said

that   their  actions  were  detrimental   to   the

interests  of  the people, and for that  reason  we

oppose.  Mr Speaker, there is no need to carry  on

this  debate at length. It is a waste of  time.  We

know  that this Bill, if approved, will give a fair

deal to all the people in Singapore.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park  has  just  now  accused  the  Government   of

bringing in an unprecedented Bill. He says that, as

far  as  he knows, no such Bill has ever found  its

way  into the legislature of this territory and  no

such   Bill   has  ever  found  a  place   in   the

legislatures of other territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has been

introduced  by  Government  to  deal  with  a  very

unprecedented  situation in  the  history  of  this

territory.  We all can recall what did  take  place

just a few months ago, when the former Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing stealthily - for

the    last    Government    always    acted     in

stealth - emasculated  the City Council,  and  tried,

within  the  short  while that they  were  able  to

exercise some authority, to set aside all the  very

good work that was done by the former Mayor and his

colleagues against the united opposition  of  those

who have very recently been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



completely  rejected  by the people  of  Singapore.

They  set aside everything that was good,  and  now

the  relics  that  appear before us  have  got  the

audacity to suggest-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Hon.

Minister  is  referring to  hon.  Members  in  this

House. If he is, I think calling them "relics", and

suggesting that they have the audacity to speak  in

this  Assembly  is completely unparliamentary.  The

Minister  will  probaby pull himself together,  and

get on with the merits of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that I have

not  unduly alarmed the hon. Members who are seated

before me. I must say, Sir, that with your majestic

intervention, I have lost the trend of my thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is very improper for

Members  here  present, who were clearly  connected

with the former Government, to come here today  and

suggest that this Government is behaving in a  most

improper manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, we all know that during the

election  campaign,  when the  Opposition  were  in

power in the City Council, our Prime Minister  gave

a   clear  warning  to  all  those  who  were  then

exercising authority in the City Council  that,  if

they proceeded to set aside all decisions made when

there  was  a  full  and fully representative  City

Council, and if the tables turned, they would  have

to  be prepared for a situation when the Government

that  took over from the previous Government  would

set   aside  everything  that  they  did   in   the

interregnum. That is what we are proceeding  to  do

today,  so that it would be most improper for  them

now  to  suggest  that  they  who  themselves  have

behaved  improperly before should now say  that  we

are behaving improperly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never interfered with anything that was

done  by  the  previous Government bona  fide.  But

where anything is done mala fide, where anything is

done improperly, the Opposition can be sure that we

will seek to put those matters right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, while hearing the hon. Member for Farrer Park,

I can just recall the day before the 30th May, when

the  other Parties said that if the P.A.P. came  to

power  the  business community would run away,  and

the same old slogan is being repeated here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to rescind the contracts which

were  given by the Councillors who remained in  the

City   Council  after  the  Mayor  and  the  P.A.P.

Councillors left. The Cinema Owners Association was

made  to pay increased electricity charges. The  32

Councillors  with a majority passed the  Bill.  Mr

Speaker, the people of Singapore are quite aware of

the  repercussions. A big noise  was  made  by  the

Opposition,   or   what  we  call   the   Rightwing

reactionary   partisans   in   the   Council,    in

collaboration  with  the  capitalists  and   vested

interest people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cinema-owners stopped their air conditioning

plants,  saying that the P.A.P. had  increased  the

charges, and that they were running at a loss.  The

City  Council then told them plainly that  if  they

could  produce  their accounts for  the  last  five

years to the court and prove that they were running

at  a  loss,  then  the P.A.P. Councillors  or  the

P.A.P.  Mayor  would  be  willing  to  rescind  the

decision they took in the Council. As you know, Mr

Speaker,  when once this matter goes to the  court,

all their propaganda will be exposed to the public.

They knew this, and they did not dare do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? The Opposition Councillors who had

no  majority to push through waited for a chance to

see  when they could help their blue-eyed  boys  or

their   Western  counterparts.  They   took   their

opportunity  when  the P.A.P. Councillors  resigned

from the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> No, Sir, it is not necessary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Even when the Councillors left, we

told them frankly that whatever decisions they were

going to rescind, we would see to it that when  the

P.A.P. came  back  to  power,  all  contracts  and

agreements  made by them would be  null  and  void.

Even  at  the  election meeting, our  Party  leader

plainly   told   the  Opposition  Councillors   who

remained  in  the  City Council that  if  they  did

anything  to please their counterparts,  then  they

would  be  taking  a risk. And  that  is  the  main

purpose of introducing this Bill today, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even just now, the Member for Cairnhill, I

believe - because   he   has   got   so   many    ex-wards - mentioned that he has got an air-conditioner,

a  refrigerator and some other things. We  are  not

interested whether the Member of the Opposition has

got  an  air-conditioner  or  a  refrigerator,   or

whether  he  uses gas or electricity,  charcoal  or

kerosene.  We are not interested in this.  When  we

introduce  this Bill we are thinking of the  people

of   the  country  as  a  whole,  and  not  of  any

individual. If he thinks he is being charged on his

air-conditioner at six cents, I hope he will  write

to  the  City Council to increase it to  20  or  30

cents,  so that they can make money out of him.  If

this Bill is passed, and according to the Minister,

we  are  going  to increase all the air-conditioner

plants,  then I think the hon. Member will have  to

decide  whether  he  might want  to  have  an  air-conditioner or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a system of giving contracts in the

City  Council.  While we were in the City  Council,

the  principle  we  adopted  was  that  the  lowest

tenderer would be given the contract, according  to

specifications. And even there are certain  tenders

which  ought  not  to be revealed. And  Councillors

like Tang Peng Yeu and Vasagar made a big noise - the

hero  or champion of the workers of Singapore! When

the  P.A.P. were there, they shed crocodile  tears

and said that what the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



was doing was not good for the people of Singapore.

It would only be helpful to certain P.A.P. chaps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. resigned, they knew that even if

all the Right-wing reactionary group lined up to go

and  fight the P.A.P. in the general election,  the

P.A.P. would  come to power, and  afterwards  they

would not be able to sit in the City Council.  They

knew  that  their only chance was  during  the  two

months' time when they could do whatever they liked

in  the  name of democracy, in the interest of  the

people,  and even in the name of God. And  that  is

what  they  did.  They expected  this  because  the

P.A.P. had clearly stated its policy that whatever

decisions  made by the remaining Councillors  would

be  rescinded by the P.A.P. if they formed the next

Government.  We  will see that  all  contracts  and

agreements  which they made and which went  against

the  P.A.P.'s decision are rescinded. And this Bill

is  particularly  aimed  at  those  agreements  and

contracts.



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, my point of view concerning this Bill

is this. We positively support this Bill. There are

two  important points in this Bill. When the P.A.P.

Councillors  were  not  in the  City  Council,  the

Opposition  Councillors used  their  time  to  make

irresponsible  contracts. Mr Speaker,  politically

and  socially, it may be different. In the  present

society, according to the P.A.P. point of view,  we

should  do  some just and fair work. Some  previous

Councillors  in  the  City Council  had  their  own

political  points of view which are different  from

ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Government was responsible for the rich

people to become richer and for the poor people  to

become  poorer.  This  kind  of  society  and  this

phenomenon  have been the same for the past  years.

But   our  Party  wants  to  reform  this  society.

Therefore, I say we want to rescind the actions and

contracts made by the previous Councillors or  made

with  the  capitalists.  For  example,  about   the

electricity charges paid by the cinema owners.  The

poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



people  have to pay 20 cents per unit. But for  the

capitalists,   the  rich  people,   who   use   the

electricity to earn money, they get lower  charges.

Is this reasonable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, therefore, I say that a Party which is for the welfare of the poor people should

rescind  the  previous contracts made by  the  non-P.A.P.  Councillors. This is what we P.A.P. should

do.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, I wish all

hon. Members will stretch their imagination back to

the  six weeks of the circus in the Tang Peng  Yeu-Vasagar  Council  when it was at  its  full  swing.

Imagine  there  was a roster system of  work  among

these  ex-Councillors and each one  took  turns  to

sign as Chairman of the City Council! They occupied

the  former  Mayor's room, did full time  work  and

signed as Chairman of the Council, instructing  the

former Mayor's staff and behaving exactly like  the

Mayor!  Mr  Speaker,  this is  to  show  that  the

remnants  of this Council in those six  weeks  were

not  acting bona fide. They were not acting in good

faith.  We are not going to rescind those decisions

which  in  the  usual course of events  go  to  the

Council  and the Committees for approval and  which

have  nothing to do with these Councillors. We  are

going to consider only those decisions taken by the

Council  which were either made for party  politics

or  in  which  vested interests were involved.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill has mentioned  just  now  in

passing  (not in discussing the Bill but in raising

certain queries) electricity tariffs. For the  past

many years - during which the Member for Farrer Park,

I regret to say, was not in full charge, but he was

abetting  the decadent old Council - the old  Council

had been charging the ordinary consumer 20 cents  a

unit for lighting and 6 cents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



per  unit  for power. The cinema magnates  obtained

between  three  and four cents per  unit  both  for

lighting and for power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill was, like any other

consumer, paying 20 cents a unit for lighting and 6

cents   a   unit   for   his  air-conditioner   and

refrigerator. But not so the cinema magnates.  They

pay  between three and five cents, depending  on  a

certain formula per unit both for lighting and  for

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we went to the polls during the City Council

elections, we explained to the people the principle

of discriminatory tariff. The old decadent Council,

of which the Member for Farrer Park was not in full

charge  but  was only a symbol, had also  practised

the  principle of discriminatory tariff.  The  poor

pay  more  and the rich pay less. We also  believe,

Mr  Speaker,  in  the principle of  discriminatory

tariff. We believe the rich should pay more and the

poor should pay less. So as a start we reduced  the

electricity tariff for those poor people  consuming

electricity under 20 units per month from 20  cents

to  12 cents, and later those over 20 units from 20

cents  to  18  cents. This was to help the  150,000

consumers  in Singapore. But, Mr Speaker,  on  the

other hand, we do not only rectify the anomalies in

the  case of the big cinema magnates by making them

pay  the  same as the 150,000 other consumers  pay,

but  we  admit the fact that we have made them  pay

much  more than the ordinary consumer who  pays  18

cents, some 12 cents for lighting, while they  have

to  pay  20 cents. The ordinary consumer  like  the

Member  for Cairnhill pays six cents for  his  air-conditioner  and refrigerator, while they  have  to

pay  20  cents. Mr Speaker, every economist agrees

that  taxation  must be based on the  principle  of

ability  to pay, and since the old Council did  not

negate  the principle of discriminatory  tariff  by

exploiting  the poor to benefit the rich,  we  also

did  not negate the principle of taxing the rich  a

little  bit more in order to benefit the poor.  And

so in October



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



1958,  we decided to charge the cinema magnates  20

cents a unit both for lighting and for power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have done some costing. All this is a little irrelevant to the Bill, but since the

Member  for Cairnhill has brought it up, I think  I

should reply. We have done some costing and it only

costs  the  cinema magnate an extra five  cents  in

cost  for a $3 seat, leaving him $2.95 to  pay  for

the  rest  of his expenses. We think this  is  very

fair. Now, Mr Speaker, what this Bill purports  to

deal  today  is  with this particular  instance  of

cinema  tariffs;  to  restore the  status  quo,  to

revert  back to the position which we think  is  of

benefit to the people. In this particular case,  it

amounts  to  this.  In  the  other  case  which   I

mentioned  just  now, it was only to  prevent,  for

instance,  the  loss  of a  quarter  of  a  million

dollars   in   public  funds  perhaps  going   into

somebody's pockets. Now, Mr Speaker, the role of a

good, honest and efficient government is to restore

all those things which are beneficial to the nation

as  a  whole.  And  in  this particular  case,  the

Chairman of our Party has given due warning. In The

Sunday  Standard  of the 19th  of  April  in  block

letters, Dr Toh said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We like to remind the Chief Administrative

Officer and the Minister for Local Government, Dato

Abdul  Hamid,  that  they will be  held  personally

responsible   for   any  act  committed   in   this

interregnum  which  is detrimental  to  the  public

interest."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also warned that the next Government would

"rescind  and reverse any decision or action  which

is not in the people's interest".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have given due warning. In a company when most of the members of the Board of

Directors  have for some reason or other gone,  and

have  given due warning that anybody who buys goods

stolen   by  the  store-keepers  could  have   full

restitution  in  Court, then,  Mr  Speaker,  those

persons  who  buy stolen beer or stolen  cigarettes

could have their benefits restituted, and the Board

of Directors who represent the shareholders (and in

this  case  represent the people) could have  every

right  to  seek  restitution.  This  is  fully   in

conformity  with justice and the theory of  British

laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Ong Eng Guan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read the Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CINEMATOGRAPH FILMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the explanatory statement to this Bill shows,

the purpose of this Bill is three-fold. Clause 2 of

the  Bill  merely seeks to regularise what  is  the

present  procedure of the Board of Film Censors  in

the  matter of censoring duplicate films. The Board

has,  since the war, been regarding 16 m.m. and  8

m.m. copies of censored 35 m.m. films and  8  m.m.

copies  of 16 m.m. censored films as duplicates  in

this  respect and has authorised screening of these

duplicates  without  viewing  by  the  Board.  This

practice,  however, is not strictly in accord  with

section  16  of  the  Ordinance  which  requires  a

duplicate to be identical in detail, subject matter

and  footage. A 16 m.m. film is, however, only one-third the length of an otherwise identical 35  m.m.

film,   and  an  8  m.m. film  is  proportionately

shorter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, therefore, repeals and re-enacts section

16  of  the Cinematograph Films Ordinance to enable

copies  of  different  sizes  to  be  regarded   as

duplicates     for    purposes    of    censorship.

Administrative arrangements preclude the chances of

evading censorship of duplicate films. Mr Speaker,

you  will note also that a proviso is added to this

clause which prohibits a larger size



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



copy  to  be regarded as a duplicate of  a  smaller

size  censored film. The reason is obvious  and  is

meant  to  prevent the evasion of proper censorship

fees which are based on footage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second object of this Bill is to reconstitute

the Committee of Appeal and this is provided for in

clause 3 of the Bill. The Committee of Appeal of 17

members, as constituted by the existing section  21

of  the Ordinance, hardly exists at the moment  and

this  is  the main reason for the urgency  of  this

Bill.  There have been a number of vacancies  since

7th  January this year. The abolition of  the  City

Council,  which  appoints three  members,  and  the

Rural  Board, which appoints one member, has  added

to  the  number of vacancies. In the light  of  new

constitutional  changes, this Government  considers

that  the composition of this Committee should  now

be  revised  and that it would be more  appropriate

that  all appointments to this Committee should  be

made  by  the Minister. Clause 3 therefore proposes

that  there should be a Committee of Appeal of nine

members, including a Chairman and Vice-Chairman  to

be  appointed  by  the  Minister  annually.  It  is

unnecessary and unwieldy to have a large  Committee

like  the previous one. A small Committee  will  be

more   effective  in  carrying  out   the   present

Government's  policy  on film censorship  which  is

part and parcel of the anti-yellow culture movement

initiated by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice in the past to permit

exhibition of films whose underlying purpose is  to

impress  on  the subject peoples their  inferiority

and  inadequacy. Films such as "The Four  Feathers"

and  the numerous westerns showing the massacre  of

the  Red  Indians  by  the white  men  are  typical

examples. The P.A.P. Government has no wish to  see

its  people conditioned to enjoy films which depict

their  degradation. Hence early last month,  a  new

directive  was issued to the Board of Film  Censors

that   all  films  whose  primary  intent  is   the

glorification or justification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



colonialism or which are calculated to bring Asians

and   so-called  coloured  peoples  generally  into

contempt, ridicule and hatred should be banned.  In

these   days   of   national   awakening,   it   is

particularly important for the Government to  bring

to our people a new sense of dignity and work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, over the last few years, there have been an alarming increase in sex crimes, assaults,

extortions  and  murders. The well-informed  public

and  the  law officers have repeatedly pointed  out

the  evil  influences  of  publications  and  films

exhorting violence and sex in its debased  form  on

the young population. The colonial governments, and

particularly the Government led by the  Member  for

Cairnhill opposite me, have completely ignored  the

warnings  of  the  public. No  one  can  deny  that

widespread publications and the screening of  films

which emphasise sex, brutality and gangsterism over

the   years  have  left  a  lasting  mark  on   the

impressionable  youth  of today  and  the  mounting

waves  of crime lately involving a large number  of

teen-age youths are a clear indication of the evils

of   yellow  culture.  The  new  Government  cannot

tolerate  this state of affairs to continue.  While

the  Board  of  Film  Censors is  well  advised  to

implement the directives of the Government on  film

censorship,  a  properly  constituted  Film  Appeal

Committee could assist tremendously in interpreting

the  policy of the Government. It is expected  that

as film censorship is tightened in the interests of

the  people, there will be many appeals before  the

Committee.  Further,  the  reconstituted  Committee

will  have  to review many of the films  that  have

been  passed  before. A shorter term of  office  as

proposed  would  also  enable more  public-spirited

persons   to  become  members  of  this   Committee

although  annual appointment does not preclude  re-appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third object of the Bill is contained in

clause 4 which gives power to the Minister to  make

regulations which include especially the  power  to

impose  film  quotas requiring or  restricting  the

showing of certain specified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



classes  of films or films originating from certain

specified countries of origin. The introduction  of

this  provision  makes it possible  to  repeal  the

British Cinematograph Films Proclamation No. 54  of

1946  (which  is  still and is the  last  remaining

British Military Administration Proclamation to  be

in  force)  and which prescribes, inter alia,  that

all  first  and second run cinemas showing  English

language  films for more than 50 per cent of  their

screening time should devote ten per cent of  their

time to British made films. Although clauses 4  and

5 provide for the power to make regulations and the

repeal  of the Proclamation, the intention is  that

these  clauses will not be brought into force until

the Government has considered in greater detail the

question  of quotas, the requirements of the  local

film   industry  and  the  regulations  which   are

required.  As the House will observe, Mr  Speaker,

clause  1  provides for different sections  of  the

Bill to be brought into force separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr  Speaker,  my colleague, the Hon. Minister  for

Home  Affairs, has already indicated to  the  House

the  desirability that certain amendments  must  be

made  to the exhibition of films in public. I would

like to add this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can amuse oneself either in the home or

outside  the home. In Singapore in particular,  the

sources  of  entertainment and amusement  are  very

limited and the cinema forms an important source of

entertainment  for  the public;  but  it  would  be

foolish  for us to consider the cinema purely  from

the  entertainment  point  of  view.  We  all  must

acknowledge  that  among  the  powerful  media   of

propaganda we have besides the newspapers and other

literature,  the  cinema  too  constitutes  a  very

effective medium of propaganda - in fact, I would say

a very important medium for conditioning. Memory or

ability to remember things depends on what we hear,

see  and feel. It is on these three sensations that

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



remember  our  surroundings and also through  these

three different stimuli that it is possible for  us

to  be  conditioned  to adopt  certain  behavioural

attitudes. Our exhibitors should note in particular

clause  4  of the Bill which the Minister for  Home

Affairs is introducing today, and that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that all cinemas or any class of cinema shall

show  not  less  than  the prescribed  number  or

prescribed  proportion of films  of  a  specified

class...",



<br><br>and  here I come to the very point which I wish  to

bring out before the House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or from a specified country of origin;".



<br><br>You  must admit that a very large proportion of the

films  that are exhibited in public come  from  the

United  States - Hollywood in particular.  Some  of

these films have a certain educational value in the

sense that they tend to bring out the background of

the  social life in the United States. On the other

hand,  a large number of films too have very little

to teach the sociologists, because many of them are

based  on impossible events, romance, and so on.  I

do   not  say  that  all  those  who  go  to   seek

entertainment are those who go to the cinemas to be

educated.  I do not claim that we must be  prudish;

we  should acknowledge that when a film is suitably

presented  it is not wise that it should be  banned

or forbidden from screening purely because it comes

from some particular country. What I would like  to

say  is  this - that we all know that 50 per cent  of

our population today are 19 years and under and  if

we  were  to  make a poll of those who  go  to  the

cinemas, it would not be surprising to find that  a

large  number of the cinema audience come from  the

teenagers.  In  fact,  our cinema  exhibitors  have

exploited this point so that you have day shows not

only  during the weekends but also during weekdays,

particularly during school holidays. When films are

screened  at such times, the audience  is  not  the

adult  working  population but it is  the  youthful

population  who have left school and  who  have  no

other  alternative to occupy themselves. So  it  is

important, Mr Speaker, that what our youth see  or

hear  should  be  such  that  they  should  not  be

conditioned to imitate characters that are depicted

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



these  films. In the past, or even recently,  quite

considerable  glorification has been  built  around

youthful film stars like the late James Dean and so

on and so forth. They depicted the youth as heroes,

although  many of these heroes have, in the  films,

taken  on  the  role of an anti-social  element.  I

would  say, Mr Speaker, that part of the  reaction

which  we see among our youth today derives  partly

from  what  they  see in the films.  For  instance,

there  is the feeling among our youth that,  unless

he challenges his companion to be brave, to carry a

dagger, or to perform some villainous deed, he is a

chicken.  That,  Mr Speaker  is  not  apt  in  our

society;  it is quite contrary to our cultures  and

our customs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this purpose that the Minister for Home

Affairs   is  giving  fair  warning  to  our   film

exhibitors  in  Singapore - that  while  they  cannot

purely  exhibit films solely for profit, they  must

consider the effects of such films on our youth; in

other words, cinemas have a very important function

to play in our lives and our exhibitors should take

an  important note that cinemas form  not  only  an

important   medium  for  propaganda  but   a   very

important stimulus for conditioning. We would  then

advise  our exhibitors not to confine the screening

of  films  only  to those which are exclusively  or

very largely made in one country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, next to sight, we have sound as a very important stimulus for conditioning. In these

days of talkie films, the dialogue that we hear  in

a cinema is equally important to the senses. In the

old  days when we had silent films, we were  solely

dependent on vision and the ability to read, and to

understand  what  was going on. But  with  dialogue

being  introduced into films, it is important  that

what  is  said should come under the close scrutiny

of the censors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, I would like to add that it

is  not  the  intention of our Government  that  we

should  act  as prudes, or that we wish to  control

the  thought  of our people. On the other  hand,  I

would   say  that  democracy  or  the  liberty   in

screening films would be totally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



abused  if  there  were also no discipline  imposed

upon this liberty.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was listening to the Deputy Prime

Minister with great interest, but it seemed  to  me

that  possibly he was going a little far away  from

the  Bill itself. I allowed him to continue because

it  seemed to me that he was detailing the  reasons

which  prompted  the Government to  introduce  this

Bill.  I  do not intend that to be taken as meaning

that  I  will  give a licence for a debate  on  the

whole film industry! I do ask hon. Members from now

on to concentrate on the merits of the Bill as they

see  it.  The Minister for Home Affairs did digress

as  well,  but  he  did point out  what  the  three

principles involved are in the Bill.



<br><br>4.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I  wholly  support this  Bill.  The  film

industry  is important for the country's education.

In   Singapore  in  the  past,  our  cinemas   were

controlled  by  the  colonialists.  In  a  colonial

country,  the people were subjected to the thoughts

and  emotions  of the rulers. But  in  our  country

today  this new Government has appointed  the  Film

Appeal Committee for the purpose of controlling the

film  industry, as against the Board  appointed  by

the Government previously. The film industry should

be  controlled  by the Ministers  of  the  people's

Government, and this amending Bill is to meet  that

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that films have an educational

value for the people of Singapore. We know that the

past  colonial rulers colonialised us  through  the

medium of films - conditioned our thoughts so that we

were  without  self-respect, like colonial  people.

Under  the  old Government, we saw that  the  films

exhibited  in Singapore were imported  from  Japan,

Hongkong or America. Those films were yellow films,

sensational,  and  they  also  depicted  forms   of

slavery,  shall we say. The present Government  has

decided  that  it should control the film  industry

for  the sake of the people in Singapore. The  film

industry should not be controlled by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



foreigners.  We  should not lose our  self-respect.

Therefore,  we  now  have this Cinematograph  Films

(Amendment) Bill, and I fully support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although

there  has  been  some digression,  nevertheless  I

think it is still relevant to the point in that  we

hope  that the Film Appeal Committee in future will

be  strict  and  fair  on  the  standard  that  the

Government hopes to achieve. And also that in their

deliberation on appeals submitted before them, they

will  give every due consideration in the  interest

of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara which

outlined  the  policy of this  Government,  it  was

stated   that  the  Government  would  also  cancel

registration  of splinter and yellow  unions  after

due investigation. Mr Speaker, Sir, this statement

of  policy merely repeats the stand of the People's

Action Party on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



labour  and trade unions, which was stated  to  the

people  of Singapore in a speech delivered  by  the

Prime Minister at a mass rally at Geylang Serai  on

the  1st  March this year. In his speech the  Prime

Minister said (I will quote him):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No legislation for minimum wages or benefits or

working   conditions  can  be  as   effective   and

efficient   in   protecting   the   workers    from

exploitation by bad employers as a good  union.  It

is   the  right  of  the  workers  to  protect  and

strengthen  their position by organising themselves

into  unions. And a P.A.P. government will  do  its

utmost   to  facilitate  the  workers  to  organise

themselves  into  unions.  The  primary  burden  of

pressing the just claims of workers must be  that

of  the unions. In this they will receive the  full

help of the machinery of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall legislate regarding the compulsory

recognition   of   unions,  the   cancellation   of

registration   of   yellow   unions    after    due

investigation  to  establish  the  truth  or  after

secret  ballot  has shown that a  majority  of  the

workers  support or oppose, as the case may  be,  a

union in their sector of employment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stated, Mr Speaker, Sir, the methods

that  we will use in no uncertain terms. This  Bill

seeks  to  implement  the declared  policy  of  the

Government.  It will, as stated in the  Explanatory

Statement, enable the Registrar of Trade Unions  to

cancel  the  registration of  yellow  and  splinter

unions, and also to refuse to register such unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my duty now to point out

the trends which appear to have been overlooked  by

the previous Government. For years there has been a

continuous  increase in the number of small  unions

of employees or rival unions of employees, with the

result  that we have reached an unhealthy state  of

affairs: too many small unions of employees in this

small  island State of Singapore. Whilst the number

of   small   unions  was  increasing,   the   total

membership was decreasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now refer to extracts

from  the  Labour  Department  Reports  which  were

published  year  by year from 1955 to  1958.  These

reports  were published by the previous Government,

and  it  appears to me, as I shall show later,  Mr

Speaker,   that  the  same  Government   that   was

producing  these reports never took the trouble  to

know what they contained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the position as given in the 1954 Report was

that  there  were 136 unions in that  year  with  a

total  membership of 76,452. If we turn to page  10

of  the 1955 Labour Department Report, we see  this

reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The growth of trade unions in the Colony during

the  year  was marked in the number of  unions,  in

union  membership  and  in union  activities.  More

small  unions of clerical as well as manual workers

came  into  existence to heighten  further  rivalry

among themselves and with general unions."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to that report, the number of

registered  unions  of  employees  in   that   year

increased  from 136 to 187, while their  membership

increased  from 76,452 to 139,317.  Table  XXXI  of

that same report shows the breakdown. There were 20

unions in 1955 with a membership of under 50. There

were  71  unions with a membership ranging from  50

and  under  250; 68 with a membership ranging  from

250  and  under 1,000; 25 with a membership ranging

from  1,000  and  under 5,000;  one  union  with  a

membership ranging from 5,000 and under 10,000; and

2  unions with a membership ranging from 10,000  or

more, making the total for 1955, 187 unions with  a

membership of 139,317, an increase over the figures

for 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we turn to pages 12 and 13 of the Labour

Department Report for 1956, we see this note:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general tendency to form small unions

continued  to  prevail. All the  unions  registered

during  the  year, with one exception,  were  small

unions with memberships ranging from 10 to 250. The

move  to federate by the bus workers' unions proved

abortive and the attempt at amalgamation by certain

Harbour Board unions had yet to materialise."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that year, the number of registered unions

of  employees  increased from 187 to 205,  and  the

membership rose from 139,317 to 157,216.  On  Table

XXXII  of  that report the breakdown is  shown:  22

unions  in 1956 with a membership of under  50;  75

with a membership ranging from 50 to 250; 73 with a

membership  ranging from 250 to 1,000;  32  with  a

membership ranging from 1,000 to 5,000; one with  a

membership of over 5,000 and under 10,000,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



and  2  unions  with a membership of  over  10,000,

making the total - 205 unions with a total membership

of more than 157,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me refer you, Sir, to the 1957 Labour

Department Report, at pages 17 and 18. This is what

the report says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of small unions in Singapore

continued  to  rise. The general pattern  of  union

development  closely  followed  that  of   previous

years.  Most  of the newly established unions  were

small  ones, and no serious moves were made towards

either  forming  larger unions or merging  existing

ones. The attempts at amalgamation begun in 1956 by

the  bus  and Harbour Board workers unions  fizzled

out during that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employees unions in that year rose

from  205 to 216, but the aggregate membership fell

from 157,216 to 140,710."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table XXXIV of the 1957 Report gives the

breakdown  for that year: 20 unions with  under  50

(there  were  22  in the previous  year);  81  with

memberships  ranging  from  50  to  250;  85   with

memberships  ranging from 250  to  1,000;  27  with

memberships  ranging from 1,000 to  5,000;  2  with

memberships  ranging from 5,000 and  under  10,000;

and  one with a membership ranging from 10,000  and

above, so that the position was: 216 unions with  a

membership  of 140,710. That means a membership  of

17,000 less than the year before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to refer you now to the 1958 Labour Department Annual Report, at pages 17

and 18:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tendency to form small unions continued in

1958.  Out of the 18 unions of employees registered

during the year, 11 had a membership of 50 or less,

while  the  rest varied from 68 to  350.  One  more

union  of  general employees came  into  existence,

thereby increasing the number of such unions  to  6

in the Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were reports that several unions

were  considering amalgamation, by the end  of  the

year  only one application for amalgamation of  two

unions was received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that year the number of unions of employees

increased  from  216  to 218, but  their  aggregate

membership fell from 140,710 to 129,159."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see the drop, Mr Speaker, Sir. From 157,000

to  140,000  to 129,000 and the numbers  of  unions

increased from. 205 to 216 to 218.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown is also given for that year: 24

unions  with  a membership of under 50;  84  unions

with a membership ranging from 50 to 250; 83 unions

with  a  membership ranging from 250 to  1,000;  24

unions  with  a  membership ranging from  1,000  to

5,000;  2  unions  with a membership  ranging  from

5,000  to  10,000; and one union with a  membership

ranging from 10,000 and more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to 1959. According to the Labour

Department  monthly  report  there  were   on   the

register  on the 31st May this year, 226 unions  of

employees,  with  a  total membership  of  134,650.

There  were  also in the hands of the Registrar  of

Trade  Unions  as  on the 31st May  this  year,  11

applications for the registration of new unions  of

employees as on that date. Of these, one has  since

withdrawn its application. The membership  of  each

of  the  remaining  10 unions as  stated  in  their

respective  applications is as follows:  one  union

claimed  a  membership  of 10  members;  one  union

claimed a membership of 11 members; two unions said

they  had not more than 30 members each; one  union

had a membership of 32; one claimed a membership of

45   members;  one  a  membership  of  50,  one   a

membership  of  80,  and  two  unions  said   their

membership did not exceed 154 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given you a very

detailed  statement regarding the position  in  all

these   unions.  This  information  gives  a  clear

picture   based  on  figures  and  facts   of   the

continuous growth of the number of small unions  of

employees  during  the  last  4�  years,  causing

rivalry  among  the registered unions  and  acting,

therefore,   against  the  general   interest   of

workmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now, Mr Speaker, Sir, come to the case of

splinter  unions.  I shall now  proceed  to  prove,

again  giving  figures and stating  facts,  that  a

large  number of these unions are splinter  unions,

i.e. the unions that I have just been referring to.

Let me give the House a few illustrations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1947, there has been in existence a

registered trade union which caters for coffee-shop

employees. At the beginning of 1956, a small  union

also  claiming  to  cater for employees  of  coffee

shops   suddenly  sprang  into  existence.  It   is

interesting  to note that the title  of  the  small

union  closely  followed  that  of  the  employers'

association,   which   the  coffee-shop   employers

themselves  had  just  formed  less  than  a  month

before.  Among  the  seven  persons  who  made  the

application for registration of the small union was

the  ex-president  of  the  registered  coffee-shop

union.  At the time of its registration, the  small

union  claimed to have a membership of 100,  whilst

the  registered union had a membership of 1,280.  A

number  of  the  ex-officers of the  larger  union,

probably  because  they  were  not  re-elected   to

office,  have since joined this splinter union  and

are  now  its president, vice-president,  secretary

and treasurer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out to me that if the

Registrar  had the power to examine  the  books  of

some  of  their  employers, he would most  probably

discover that many of these union officials in  one

way   or  another  have  some  interest  in   their

employers' shops. Even today, the membership of the

larger  union is many times more than that  of  the

splinter union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in 1949, one of the officers of a

certain  registered  Chinese  Seamen's  Union   was

convicted  and  sentenced to six  months'  rigorous

imprisonment  on  a  charge of criminal  breach  of

trust  of union funds. Some years later, this  same

man formed yet another Chinese seafarers' union and

had   it  registered.  He  is  now  the  registered

secretary  of this union. Under the existing  Trade

Unions  Ordinance, the Registrar has  no  power  to

refuse to register a union with such an undesirable

person as an official.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in 1956, a Chinese union claiming to cater

for  hair-dressers with only 40 members  came  into

existence.  There  was  at  that  time  already  in

existence  a registered trade union of many  years'

standing  catering for the same class  of  workers.

Three of the seven persons who made the application

for  registration of the splinter union were former

officials



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



of  the registered union who were not reelected  to

office. Even today, the membership of this splinter

union  is  less than 100, while that of  the  older

established union is over 800.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a direct result of the ease with which

splinter  unions  could be formed  and  registered,

there is today in existence in Singapore a total of

eight registered trade unions claiming to cater for

the workers in the food catering service alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that a number of

splinter  unions have their registered  offices  at

the  same address. There are many such unions which

have been formed on similar lines at the expense of

the   strength  of  the  bargaining  power  of  the

existing unions. But I do not think it necessary to

waste  the  time  of  this  House  by  giving  more

details.  I  will now come to the case of  seamen's

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may be interested to know

that among the 10 applications for the registration

of new unions which I refered to earlier, and which

are  still  pending,  two  of  them,  one  with   a

membership   of  50  and  another  with   30,   are

applications to form unions to cater for seamen and

maritime  officers. These applications to  register

new  seamen's unions have been made in spite of the

fact that there are already on the register a total

of  10 registered seamen's unions, two of which are

exclusively for maritime officers and the remainder

for  seamen. The 10 seamen's unions at  present  on

the  register  do  not include the  three  seamen's

unions  and  two  maritime  officers'  unions,  the

certificates of registration of which have  already

been cancelled by the Registrar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come now, Mr Speaker, to the case of the

teachers'   unions.   Of   the   remaining    eight

applications this year, three are to form unions to

cater  for  teachers of one category or other.  The

first  application  is  to  form  a  union  for  10

teachers,  the second for 30 and the third  for  11

teachers.  Meanwhile,  there  are  already  on  the

register 18 registered trade unions catering for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



teachers of various categories. This number  of  18

registered  teachers' unions  does  not  include  a

registered  trade union, which although  it  caters

for  other  employees, has rules permitting  it  to

enrol   teachers   as   members.   Of   the   three

applications  to  form  new teachers'  unions,  one

openly admitted that it was to be a splinter  union

for teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me come, Mr Speaker, to the position of

general unions. As on the 27th of May, 1959,  there

was  on  the  register  a  total  of  eight  unions

catering for general workers. With the exception of

two,  which could claim to have some thousands  of

members  each,  the rest have only  a  few  members

each.   Mind  you,  they  call  themselves  general

unions.  One of these general unions can  claim  to

have only 12 members, and another only 11. Most  of

these  general unions were registered between  June

1955  and  February this year.  Among  the  10  new

applications for registration this year,  there  is

one   applying  for  registration  of  yet  another

general  union. From its proposed rules,  a  person

holding an administrative or managerial post  in  a

shop  can  also  be enrolled as a  member  of  this

general  union. This general union is too obviously

a yellow union to deceive anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my association with

Government unions, I found that there are  splinter

unions  amongst  Government employees  as  well.  I

remember   a  time  when  the  head  teachers   got

disgruntled.  They  broke away from  the  teachers'

union  and  formed themselves into a head teachers'

association and had it registered as a trade union.

We  had  to do something about it, Sir. The Whitley

Council  decided that they were not going to  allow

any   splinter  union  to  participate  in  Whitley

Council  procedure,  and  it  passed  a  resolution

excluding the splinter union from participation  in

the  Whitley system. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will  pass

now  from  splinter unions to the  case  of  yellow

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undesirability and, in fact, the danger of

the  existence of yellow unions was fully  revealed

by the events of the Hock Lee Bus incident in early

1955,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



which  was  sparked  off by the  formation  by  the

management of a yellow union known as the Hock  Lee

Bus    Employees   Union.   Thank   God,   on   the

recommendations of the arbitrator of the  Hock  Lee

Bus  dispute,  this yellow union  dissolved  itself

voluntarily, though after much harm had been  done.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I will quote  again  now  from

paragraphs  1  and  2  of  page  2  of  the  Labour

Department's monthly report for May, 1955. This  is

what  the  Report  says  about  the  Hock  Lee  Bus

dispute:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Industrial unrest during the month reached its

climax  on  the night of May 12, when violence  and

rioting which had been worked up over the Hock  Lee

bus  dispute  broke  out.  A  full  report  of  the

industrial aspect of this dispute is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Bus Workers' Union for many years

limited  to the employees of the Green Bus  Company

began  to extend its activities among other Chinese

bus  companies in the Colony in the latter half  of

1954.  Towards the end of February, 1955, a  branch

of  the  union was established at the Hock Lee  Bus

Company,  and it seemed to be generally known  that

it   would   find  great  difficulty   in   gaining

recognition from the management of this company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneous with the establishment of the union

branch,  two of the branch officials were dismissed

from  the  company  for reasons, according  to  the

management,    unconnected   with    trade    union

activities.  This blithe assurance  was  of  course

never accepted by the Singapore Bus Workers' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, another union was formed known as

the  Hock  Lee Bus Employees' Union. The  Singapore

Bus  Workers' Union branded this rival union as  an

employers' or yellow union in disguise; whereas the

management  insisted  that  it  was  a  spontaneous

creation by a group of their own workers who viewed

with some alarm the irresponsible leadership of the

Singapore Bus Workers' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fact, however, that supported the suspicions of

employer  sponsorship of the Hock Lee  Bus  Company

Employees'  Union  was  the remarkable  speed  with

which  demands were submitted and agreed to shortly

after its formation. On the 4th of March this union

wrote  to  request a revision of pay and conditions

of  employment.  On the 5th of  March  a  board  of

directors'  meeting  was  held  to  consider  these

demands,  and  on  the 6th a reply satisfactory  to

both sides was given. The new conditions of service

were made effective from the following day, the 7th

of March."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since my assumption of office,

numerous  complaints  have  been  received  by   my

Ministry   from   trade  unionists  regarding   the

existence of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



yellow unions. One such union has for years had  an

undisputed employer as its president. We traced the

records. He has been signing records which  declare

him  as an employer. This man, who is an undisputed

employer, and several other agents of employees  as

members,   have  decided  that  they   would   pull

themselves  out of this union and allow this  union

to  reorganise itself. The employer and the  agents

of  employees who used to control this  union  have

now expressed their willingness to relinquish their

control  over the union, and a general meeting  has

been  called recently to elect a new committee from

an  entirely  new  membership of  workers  hitherto

uncatered for by this union. In the case of another

union  of  employees of restaurants,  some  of  the

officials and members of which have openly admitted

being   shareholders  of  employers'   restaurants,

appropriate  action to cleanse this  union  is  now

proceeding.  There  is  yet  another   union,   the

president  of  which is also an employer.  He  has,

however, recently resigned his office and  many  of

the  members  of  this union have  abandoned  their

membership and joined another union, the membership

of which is strictly confined to employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come to a clause of the

Bill  which might be criticised by Members  of  the

Opposition today. And that is clause 5 of the Bill,

Sir, which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"(2) The decision of the Minister on an appeal

under  section 16 of this Ordinance shall be  final

and  shall  not  be  called into  question  in  any

court.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision in the Bill that

appeals  from the decisions of the Registrar  shall

be  heard  by the Minister whose decision shall  be

final and shall not be questioned in any court, may

be  argued  to be an infringement of Article  4  of

Convention   No.  87,  which  is  The  Freedom   of

Association   and   of  The   Right   to   Organise

Convention,   1948.  This  Article  provides   that

workers and employers' organisations shall  not  be

liable   to   be   dissolved   or   suspended    by

administrative authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few months ago the Secretary

of  State  sought  confirmation from  the  previous

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



whether  the  law in practice here with  regard  to

trade unions conformed with the provisions of  this

Convention  and with the provisions  of  Convention

No.   98,  which  is  The  Right  to  Organise  and

Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949. In a  reply

to  the  Secretary  of State, the  last  Government

pointed  out that there were many sections  of  the

present  Trade  Unions  Ordinance  which  infringed

Articles  2,  3 and 4 of The Freedom of Association

and  of The Right to Organise Convention 1948,  but

that  the law in practice here with regard to trade

unions was in conformity with The Right to Organise

and  Collective  Bargaining Convention,  1949.  The

previous   Government   replied   that   its   full

legislative  programme had unfortunately  prevented

it  from giving early consideration to measures  to

bring  the  Trade Unions Ordinance into  conformity

with The Freedom of Association and of The Right to

Organise Convention, 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, in their reply, the

previous Government set out the various sections of

the  present  Ordinance - I am not referring  to  the

Amendment Bill - which conflicted with the provisions

of  that Convention. The previous Government stated

that  the  present sections 14, 15, 26, 28  and  29

conflicted  with  Article 2 of the  Convention  and

that  the  Schedule under section 32, and  sections

38,  39,  40,  41,  42 and 46 conflicted  with  the

provisions of Article 3 of the Convention and  that

sections 16, 17 and 29 (5) conflicted with  Article

4  of  the Convention. Now for the benefit  of  the

House,  Sir,  I will proceed to read the  texts  of

these various Articles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 2 provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that workers and employers without distinction

whatsoever  shall have the right to  establish  and

subject  only  to  the  rules of  the  organisation

concerned  to  join  organisations  of  their   own

choosing without previous authorisation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 3 is in two parts. Part I provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that workers and employers' organisations shall

have  the right to draw up their constitutions  and

rules,  to  elect  their  representatives  in  full

freedom,  to  organise  their  administrations  and

activities and to formulate their programmes."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



Part II of Article 3 provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that the public authorities shall refrain from

any interference which would restrict this right or

impede the lawful exercise thereof."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Article 4 provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"that workers and employers' organisations shall

not  be  liable  to be dissolved  or  suspended  by

administrative authority."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their reply to the Secretary of State, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, they also said that conditions  were

not  suitable  for any change to  be  made  in  the

present Ordinance because of the Government's  fear

of   subversion  and  infiltration  by   subversive

elements into the union organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, section 16 of the Trade Unions

Ordinance  provides that appeals from the  decision

of the Registrar should go to the Minister. I would

submit,  Sir, that this is rightly so  because  the

question  of whether the registration  of  a  trade

union  should  be  cancelled  or  withdrawn  is  an

essentially  executive  act.  The  new   power   of

cancelling  the registration of yellow or  splinter

unions  is  one, I submit, Sir, that  can  only  be

exercised by an executive body. I submit  that  the

machinery of the courts is quite unsuitable to deal

with  such matters which hinge so much on questions

of policy and executive action. The Bill therefore,

Sir,  seeks to retain the provision for appeals  to

be  heard  by the Minister but it seeks to provide,

as  is usual in other Ordinances, that the decision

of  the Minister should be final. The purpose, Sir,

is  frankly  to shut out any appeals to the  court,

for  the  Government  believes  that  such  matters

cannot  be  resolved  in  a  court  and  that  such

decisions   can   only  be  made  by   a   Minister

responsible to the Legislative Assembly and to  the

electorate. I am informed, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that

although under the amendment to section 17  of  the

Ordinance  appeals to the court will be  shut  out,

this   amendment   however  will   not   shut   out

proceedings by way of certiorari.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case where the registration of the

Malayan  National Seamen's Union was  cancelled  on

the grounds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



that  the union had contravened section 44  of  the

Ordinance   by  failing  to  furnish   within   the

prescribed  period  annual  returns  in  certiorari

proceedings, the order of the Registrar  cancelling

the union's registration was quashed on the grounds

that the notice required for these proceedings fell

short  by  one  day  of the period  of  two  months

stipulated in the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have extracted precedents

from other Ordinances to show that there is nothing

improper in the Government seeking powers  to  shut

out  appeals  to the High Court on the question  of

the cancellation of registration or the refusal  to

register  a trade union which is either a  splinter

or  a  yellow  union. In fact, the last  Government

took   similar  powers  when  dealing  with   other

matters; and I shall now proceed to refer to a  few

of  the  similar powers which the former Government

took  with  regard to other matters.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  in  Ordinance  No.  40  of  1958  the  Public

Entertainments   Ordinance   where   there   is   a

forfeiture  of security, aggrieved persons  have  a

right  of  appeal  to the Minister  whose  decision

thereon  shall be final. That is the  provision  of

section   11(5)  of  Ordinance  No.  40  of   1958.

Similarly,  section  13 (3) of the  same  Ordinance

provides that an applicant aggrieved by the refusal

of  his  application by the licensing  officer  may

appeal  in  writing to the Minister whose  decision

thereon  shall be final. Similarly, with regard  to

the  cancellation  of  a  licence  under  the  same

Ordinance - the  Public Entertainments  Ordinance - the

decision of the Minister shall be final. Again, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I refer you to the Nursing Homes  and

Maternity  Homes Registration Ordinance (No.  5  of

1959)  on  the  question  of  the  refusal  of   an

application  and the cancellation of an application

for  registration. Section 5 (4) of that  Ordinance

provides  that  the  Minister's decision  shall  be

final. Similarly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer you  to

the  Planning Ordinance (No. 12 of 1959) to section

13 (2) which deals with the enforcement of planning

control. That section provides for an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



appeal and the Minister's decision thereon shall be

final.  Similarly,  in the case of  development  of

land  under the same Planning Ordinance,  there  is

provision  for an appeal. Section 14  (3)  provides

that the Minister's decision shall be final. And  I

would  refer  lastly to the Control of  Manufacture

Ordinance  (No.  14  of 1958)  in  respect  of  the

registration  of goods. Section 5 (6) provides  for

an appeal and the Minister's decision on the appeal

shall be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has taken

the  stand that the plurality of small trade unions

would  work  to  the detriment of the  trade  union

movement  as  a  whole. The Government  knows  that

trade unions have been fostered by employers - I have

produced  all  the  evidence before  this  House - in

order  that  they  may split the workers  and  that

these  unions are used not to strengthen the  cause

of  workers  but  to  make it easier  for  the  bad

employers  to  exploit  the  workers.  The   P.A.P.

Government,  as has been said before by  our  Prime

Minister,  does  not believe in the maintenance  of

the outward forms of democracy, or in this case the

outward forms of trade union freedom, if the effect

is to undermine the real essence of democracy or of

trade  union  freedom.  The  Government  does   not

believe  in  trade union freedom if it is  used  to

kill the trade union movement itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in

agreement with the principles outlined in the Bill,

but,  as  the Minister has pointed out,  he  has  a

feeling  that  an objection might be taken  by  the

Opposition  to  clause 5 of the  Bill  and  he  has

therefore  attempted to reply  in  advance  to  the

objection that the Opposition might raise  on  this

particular clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I come to this clause, I would like

to explain why so many trade unions were registered

in  previous years. The Trade Unions Ordinance  was

promulgated in 1941 just before the war, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



under  that  law  any  seven  persons  signing   an

application  form to have a trade union  registered

shall  automatically have the application  approved

unless the Registrar was satisfied that the objects

of  the proposed union were not in accordance  with

the law. The Labour Department even tried to assist

trade unions, to make their applications more  easy

by  having model rules. Therefore, most sponsors of

trade  unions who wanted to have their applications

approved quite quickly just adopted the model rules

and  in  a  very short time the trade  unions  were

registered. I did mention, Sir, during  the  debate

last  month, that I had in my mind the same thought

as  is now stated in this particular Bill, but then

I  was in the position of having to deny, mostly to

Members  of  the Opposition, the right to  organise

new  trade unions. I felt that it was not  fair  on

the   part  of  the  Government  to  restrict   the

activities  of trade unionists. Now in this  desire

not   to   hinder  the  activities   of   political

opponents,  it had also to give way  to,  shall  we

say, adventurers of the type that the Minister  had

mentioned.  If  we were not firm on any  particular

class  of sponsors, we should not be firm  at  all.

And  we  have all listened to the figures given  by

the   Minister  in  the  reports  of  the  previous

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was aware that such a situation was not a good

thing,  but  then I was mostly guided by  the  fact

that  I  should  not do anything  to  restrict  the

activities of political opponents who in their  own

endeavour desired to form trade unions to work  for

the welfare of the Members, and thus we have, shall

we say, a very unhappy situation today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that I support the Bill. It is a good

thing. The Minister has pointed out how he proposes

to  go  about in the consideration of yellow unions

or splinter unions. I think the best way to achieve

this  is  to  allow the workers a free choice.  The

Minister  has mentioned the question  of  a  ballot

taken  of  employees in any particular industry  or

place  of  employment - to, give the workers  a  free

choice  to decide which particular union they  want

to represent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



them.  That  would make the position  of  the

Minister  a  little bit more tenable. He  need  not

have to be faced with a situation whereby two rival

unions  come to claim his compassion, his sympathy,

and  his understanding. That is the easiest way  to

decide   which   particular   organisation   should

represent the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming now to clause 5. The Minister has

pointed  out that the previous Government had  also

contravened certain articles - Articles 2, 3, and,  I

forgot the other one - and he has therefore said, "It

is  quite  all right. What was done previously,  we

are  continuing  to  do now." And  he  also  quoted

certain  legislation whereby powers were  given  to

Ministers to come to decisions which should not  be

brought to any Court of Law. Sir, in regard to  the

other legislation - entertainment, business, and  one

or  two  other  things - those are not  protected  by

conventions  of  an international organisation.  In

the  case of workers' organisations, there  is  the

International   Labour   Organisation,   of   which

Singapore  is  a  member.  Resolutions  adopted  at

conferences of the I.L.O. are, to a certain extent,

binding   on   all  member-countries.   Previously,

Singapore was a colony and therefore came under the

United Kingdom delegation. Now that Singapore is  a

self-governing state, I think Singapore  can  claim

to  become  a  full  member of the  I.L.O.  And  if

Singapore were to be a full member of the I.L.O., I

submit   that   Singapore   should   observe    the

conventions and resolutions which were  adopted  in

the interests of the workers. And as the Government

has  claimed  that  it  is  a  government  for  the

workers, I submit that it would be in keeping  with

their   declaration  if  they   were   to   observe

conventions.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Mr Speaker, in dealing with the Trade

Unions  Ordinance, we on this side  are  very  much

surprised  that  the  ex-Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare and the present Opposition Members are  all

against  it. The ex-Minister for Labour and Welfare

says, as a reason, that the Trade Unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  was in force in 1941 and that  the  past

Government  was  at least good enough  to  draw  up

trade union registration and rules on modern lines.

But   the   workers  are  not  worried   over   the

modernisation  of  trade union registration,  rules

and  regulations. And why did the  past  Government

not   change   the  1941  Trade  Unions   Ordinance

concerning union by-laws? He says the best way  for

the  Minister  to decide which union is  yellow  or

splinter is by secret ballot. Mr Speaker, Sir,  on

this  business  of secret ballot, I would  ask  the

hon.  Member on the opposite side: what was  talked

about the ballot in the past Government when he was

the  Chief  Minister and Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the same matter of splinter

and   yellow  unions,  I  would  quote  Legislative

Assembly,  Singapore, Sessional Paper No.  S  7  of

1957,  a  report  into  the trade  dispute  at  the

Singapore  Harbour Board. In the Singapore  Harbour

Board  there  are  eight existing  unions,  and  to

determine  which union represents the  majority  of

workers, a Court of Inquiry was appointed and  they

recommended that the easiest way to settle  it  was

by  secret ballot. The unions which represented the

workers  are mentioned in page 10 of the  Sessional

Paper:-

Sir,  these  eight unions were looked into  by  the

Court  of  Inquiry, and in the Court of Inquiry  it

was  clearly stated that even though there  was  no

trade union law to determine by virtue of law,  the

Court  of Inquiry recommended unanimously that  the

Minister  should,  together  with  Labour  Ministry

officials,  take  the initiative to  supervise  the

ballotting  and  to  determine which  union  should

represent the majority of the workers. And today we

heard  from the hon. Member for Cairnhill, the  ex-Minister  for  Labour  and  Welfare,  advising  our

present  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  that  the

easiest way is by ballot; it is the only thing. But

I  would ask him that if he had the same idea, what

had  he done when the recommendations of the  Court

of Inquiry were placed before this Assembly?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, on this matter of splinter and yellow

unions,  since  the publication of this  report,  a

further  two  new  unions in the Singapore  Harbour

Board were registered. One is the Singapore Harbour

Board  Mechanical Drivers' Union with a  membership

of  45,  and the ex-Minister for Labour and Welfare

and  the Registrar of Trade Union know that one day

or  another a ballot will be taken, and  all  these

unions would automatically be cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, we find that apart from these

splinter  and  yellow  unions,  there  is   another

category   of  such  unions - unions  of  a  communal

nature.  Communalism  is creeping  into  the  trade

union  movement.  There  is the  Singapore  Harbour

Board Malay Employees Union, which is only for  the

Malays.  We have never heard in trade union history

that Malays must have one trade union, Indians must

have  one  trade  union, and  so  on  for  Chinese,

Eurasians  and  Europeans. We trade  unionists  are

interested  only in one community, a  community  of

workers.  The registration of that Malay  Employees

Union   has  clearly  violated  the  trade  union's

fundamental principle, and the past Government  was

even  willing  to  register this  union  which  was

completely organised on a communal basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Law

has  already  explained the  position  of  existing

trade  unions in Singapore today and the number  of

workers   they   represent.  In  introducing   this

amending Bill, this Government, or the Party  as  a

whole,  intends to have one union for one class  of

workers,  so that the unions can face the employers

as  a  united  body representing all categories  of

workers. Thus the unions have more bargaining power

and   more  strength,  and  the  employers   cannot

victimise the unions' active members. The  existing

trade  union law in Singapore more or less  follows

British   trade  union  practice - the   Member   for

Cairnhill mentioned that seven members can  form  a

union!  Why  was the past Government  reluctant  to

take  a firm stand in implementing these laws? And,

he mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



that he wanted his political opponents to form more

unions  to fight him. Sir, if we draw up a list  of

all  the small unions registered from 1955 to 1958,

we  will  find that none was P.A.P. registered;  it

was  the  S.P.A./Labour Fronters.  They  themselves

initiated  this because they knew that in Singapore

Left-wing  trade unions were powerful, and  in  any

trade  union disputes they were not going to follow

what  the past Government was doing in the name  of

democracy. And so they thought it was best for them

to  break  this union, and to find people who  were

willing  to  ally with the past Government  and  to

encourage  the workers to form splinter  or  yellow

unions. This is not the P.A.P.'s policy. From  1955

we believed that the trade unions should be strong,

should  be united, and they should stand  firm  for

the rights of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by this law we find that most

of  the unscrupulous employers took the opportunity

to  encourage  their  employees  to  form  splinter

unions. To encourage this, the employers would make

certain  promises of jobs to certain employees  and

thereby  encourage them to form a  union.  And  the

employers  knew that such a union would  be  easily

registered  without  any  enquiry  whatsoever.  And

therefore  we  usually find in Singapore  employers

who just stand up and tell the other unions, "Look,

we have a new union registered which represents the

majority  of  our workers, and I am  not  going  to

recognise  your  union." So instead  of  the  union

fighting  against the employer for  better  working

conditions for its workers, we find (and  this  has

happened  in  the  last  four  years)  the   unions

fighting  one  another, and  the  employers  taking

advantage of the situation. And to settle a dispute

over   which  union  represents  the  majority   of

workers,  the  Government either  keeps  silent  or

collaborates  with the employers  and  says,  "This

small   splinter   union  really   represents   the

workers."  And  this  is  the  root  of   all   the

industrial  unrest in Singapore for the  last  five

years.  Why?  The hon. Member for Cairnhill  is  so

afraid that if the Minister were to make a list  of

all the things which were hidden



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



by  the  past Government, they might be exposed  to

the   people  of  Singapore  and  to  the   workers

especially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker, Sir, in certain

establishments,   for   example,   the    transport

industry, which we shall take as a whole, after the

Hock  Lee  Bus  riots and the leaders  of  the  bus

workers  were  detained,  the  past  Government-the

S.P.A.  Government-took advantage of the  situation

and  encouraged  the formation of one  other  union

which is now considered to be a yellow union, which

represents only two bus companies, that is, the Tay

Koh  Yat  Bus Company and the Hock Lee Bus Company.

Every trade unionist in Singapore and the people of

Singapore   know  that  the  union  was   purposely

registered and encouraged by the past Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we say that this Trade Unions (Amendment)

Bill  is  coming into force, we can  make  it  very

certain  and very clear to other trade unions  that

what  the  present Government intends to do  is  to

safeguard the interests of the working class and to

safeguard  them  from  exploitation.  When  I   say

exploitation,   Sir,  there  are   two   kinds   of

exploitation  in  Singapore at the present  moment.

That  is, one is exploitation by the employers  who

take   advantage  of  the  situation,  and  second,

exploitation by the self-styled trade union leaders

in   Singapore  who,  in  collaboration  with   the

political parties, have from the beginning tried to

exploit the workers. Because from our experience we

have  found out that these trade union leaders have

either  collaborated with the employers or  perhaps

they have shared the profits with the employers who

do  not  recognise  the  genuine  registered  trade

unions in that establishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when this law is implemented,

it  is  quite clear that the employers cannot  play

any  more  "divide  and rule"  tactics  by  saying:

"Look,  I  can  only  recognise  that  small  union

because  I like the faces of the leaders. I  cannot

recognise your union because you people are  fierce

and  of  the fighting type. So I cannot sit  around

the  table and discuss because all your demands are

reasonable. I cannot make friends with you  because

you are not corrupted."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is a good piece of legislation to tell

the  employers:  "Look, it is  high  time  for  you

people  to  change your attitude and recognise  one

union  in one establishment and deal with that  one

union." Once they deal with that union it is  quite

clear  that the workers of Singapore will  flourish

because there is one union in one establishment, so

that when one employer makes an agreement with  one

union  that  agreement  is valid.  And  even  if  a

handful  do  not  like the union  leadership,  they

cannot  just get about seven men and send in  their

application  for  registration.  If  this  law   is

implemented, it is my earnest belief that  all  the

workers in Singapore will be happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to note one more

point - that  the  hon.  Member  for  Cairnhill   was

talking for the trade union movement. I should like

to know, Sir, at the present moment, how many trade

unions he represents? How many thousands of workers

he  represents and on whose behalf was  he  talking

when he was talking about the trade union movement.

Even  while he was the Chief Minister he  had  said

that  he was born as a clerk and he would die as  a

clerk



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how

relevant  that is to this debate. The  hon.  Member

for Cairnhill, I take it, has spoken as a Member of

this Assembly. He is entitled to speak as a Member,

and not as a representative of a trade union.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I am not going to

argue with you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was trying to stress is this. He cannot be

representing  any unions. I just want  to  make  it

clear  that  we  on this side, at  least,  whatever

opinions we express we can say that they have  come

from  the  unions which we represent. So that  puts

more  value  and  more strength into  our  opinions

because  we  know the feelings of the workers,  and

how they are eagerly awaiting the implementation of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I on this side am trying to make it

clear  that  as soon as this Law is passed  we  can

expect  a  big  hue and cry in Singapore  from  the

yellow unions which were once helping more or  less

the past Government to prevent the healthy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



growth of the trade union movement in this country.

So  once  this law is implemented we can  see  what

these self-styled trade union leaders, half of whom

belong to the gangster group and the other half  to

corrupted  people, are going to do. We can  have  a

good  headline in the newspapers. And  I  hope  the

Hon.  Minister will, immediately after the Bill  is

passed,  start cancelling these yellow and splinter

unions  because the Singapore Harbour  Board  Union

itself   has  been  waiting  since  1957  for   the

implementation of the recommendations of the  Court

of  Inquiry.  Today we are very glad  to  hear  the

views from the same mouth of the Chief Minister who

once  refused to hold a ballot because he knew that

once this was taken, all these eight or nine unions

with his good old friends would be ousted from  the

trade union arena in Singapore.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning

the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill to give powers to

the  Minister for Labour and Law to restrict  trade

unions  which  are  considered  detrimental  to   a

healthy  trade  union movement,  I,  in  principle,

agree,  so  that  we can organise the  trade  union

movement  in Singapore as one which can  fight  for

the  interest of labour. But I would like to remind

the Assembly that with these powers, there must  be

consideration to the effect that there will  be  no

action   taken  which  is  motivated   by   certain

sections,  because from what we have witnessed  the

majority  of  the  trade unions existing  today  in

Singapore are mixed up in politics. Therefore, this

connection of theirs can be to the detriment of the

trade union movement which has, as its object,  the

improvement  of  the  workers  and  which  has   no

discrimination  in relation to the  colour  of  the

skin  or religion. We know that the labour movement

in  Singapore can be considered a new movement  and

the  majority of the workers are not yet fully able

to understand its true aims and why they should get

together to face their employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as these workers are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



yet  fully  conversant with the  principle  of  the

trade union movement, it often happens that if they

become  members of a certain trade union they  will

be  tied  to  a  political ideology  of  which  the

leaders  of  those trade unions are the  adherents,

because  there  is  a difference between  political

ideology  and  the  trade union  movement.  In  the

circumstances, they cannot fit themselves into  any

trade union movement. But, unfortunately, they  are

not  prepared to sit on the fence because they  see

that the trade union movement in Singapore is mixed

up  in politics. If they do not belong to any trade

union  they  will become the victims because  their

fellow workers will victimise them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson quoted an instance of a

labour movement in the Singapore Harbour Board.  He

also  drew attention to a debate in this  House  on

the recommendations that had been made by the Court

of   Inquiry   into  the  Harbour  Board   dispute,

particularly the consolidation of the Harbour Board

workers into one labour organisation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think possibly the Member is

referring to the hon. Member for Telok Blangah, not

Anson.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker. I meant the Member for Telok Blangah.  The

Member  for Telok Blangah also mentioned two  trade

unions which emerged after the recommendations made

by the Court of Inquiry. What I would like to do is

to  clarify this - as regards one of the trade unions

which  has  just  emerged and  which  has  followed

communal lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Telok Blangah has in particular mentioned the union

representing   Malays.  It  is   agreed   that   it

represents  Malay  workers  in  the  Harbour  Board

because they consider that they have no alternative

to  safeguarding or protecting their interests, not

only  in respect of their means of livelihood,  but

also  their  political view-point. This is  because

they  have  observed that the Harbour  Board  union

movement is closely linked with political movements

in Singapore and also the reason-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order? Yes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> The hon. Member has just mentioned

that   the  Harbour  Board  Staff  Association   is

connected with political activities in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. It is a

matter of opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Sir, I would like him to clarify that

point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a matter of opinion. Does the

hon. Member give way for clarification?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, the Member does not.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

conduct of the trade union in the Harbour Board  is

well-known. It is a trade union which has  a  great

interest  in the political movements in  Singapore,

but  the  majority of the workers are  those  whose

ideologies do not fit in with the movement of  that

particular  trade  union which supports  a  certain

political  organisation. I  remember  that  when  a

strike  was staged in the Singapore Harbour  Board,

those who were members of this union worked hard to

conduct  the  strike with a view  to  making  it  a

success.  But  only  a  handful  of  other  workers

actively participated. When the strike reached  its

climax, they realised that they were being  led  in

the  wrong direction, one not in keeping with their

political  beliefs.  They then  decided  that  they

could not continue with the strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I said just now, on the whole, I support this Bill and agree with it. But we must be

careful  as to how past happenings can be  improved

upon,  so that a strong labour union can be created

to   look   after  the  interests  of  the  workers

irrespective  of  their  political  ideologies   or

religious beliefs.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as members of the public know,

the  P.A.P.  Government is the people's Government.

It  is  a  Government supported and backed  by  the

people;  a Government representing the poor  masses

who have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



down-trodden  and exploited by the past  Government

and  also exploited by employers who were protected

by  the  last  Government. It  is  the  desire  and

intention  of  my  Party to raise the  standard  of

living of the masses, particularly the workers,  in

Singapore,  who have, as I mentioned earlier,  been

ignored or suppressed by the last Government and by

employers  protected  by the last  Government.  The

P.A.P. is not only a Party which has not failed  in

its  promises - it is one which highly  respects  the

promises it has made. This is because we know  that

a government which does not fulfil its pledges will

inevitably have its fate decided by the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one closely associated with the trade union

movement,   I   should   explain   something   here

concerning  this movement. As far as  I  know,  the

conditions  for  the workers at the present  moment

are still bad. This is because the laws promulgated

by  the  last  Government were one-sided - they  were

more  on  the side of the employers. The reason  is

that  during  the  life  of  the  past  Government,

splinter  unions were established, the majority  of

them   to  split  the  unity  of  the  workers   in

Singapore.  In  addition, yellow unions  were  also

used  by employers to break the solidarity  of  the

workers. To fight for the interests of the workers,

we  will  amend  these laws and  will  take  proper

action on employers who do not observe them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for yellow unions and those which do not

represent   the  majority  of  workers,   we   will

endeavour to have them dissolved. The policy of the

present  Government has the support of  the  entire

labour force in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important problem facing the Government at

present  is  unemployment, to  overcome  which  the

Government  requires  large  sums  of  money.   But

unfortunately when we examined the Treasury left us

by  the  last  Government, we discovered  that  the

coffers  were  empty.  In spite  of  this,  we  are

confident  that with the efficiency and ability  of

the  P.A.P. leadership, and with the  support  and

backing  of  the  people  of  Singapore,  we   will

overcome  difficulties and the people of  Singapore

will be led to the gate of happiness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I should explain that a noble ambition

cannot  be implemented overnight or in one  or  two

days, but that it may take 10 or 20 years. However,

that is our ambition. Whether it can be realised in

a  short  or long period rests with the  people  of

Singapore. I say this because I know that only with

the  co-operation  of  the  people  especially  the

labour force can our ambition be realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be explained that the trade union

movement  in  Singapore should not follow  communal

lines. The welfare of the workers in Singapore does

not  depend  on  race, that is to say,  that  if  a

Chinese worker is exploited, his Malay or Indian co-worker  is  similarly exploited.  Therefore,  in  a

trade  union  movement, communalism or race  should

not come into play. I appeal to the labour movement

to  cease  communalism so that we  can  unite  that

movement   in   Singapore.  Although   the   P.A.P.

Government  has the overwhelming support  of  the

people,  that does not mean that there are no  more

elements   continually  trying   to   subvert   the

programmes    of   the   Government.    In    these

circumstances,  I  hope  that  all  the  people  of

Singapore  will  be  on their guard  against  these

elements,  so  that  our  ambition  will   not   be

subverted. Once again, therefore, I appeal  to  all

the people of Singapore to give all-out support  to

this Government so that we can, hand-in-hand, build

a nation in peace and justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now I heard the Member for the Southern Islands state that he agreed with this

amending  Bill, but he thought the Minister  should

give  careful  and just consideration  when  he  is

pressed. I think the Member is not yet fully  aware

of  the labour movement in Singapore. I myself know

for  a fact that the Member has no connection  with

labour  movements. The Member stated that political

encroachment  is  taking place in the  majority  of

labour  unions. Once again, I say that  the  Member

knows little about the trade union movement. In the

trade union movement there are members who play  to

the various political parties. From what I know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



of  the  large trade unions, members come from  the

P.A.P.,  S.P.A., U.M.N.O., and so on.  The  workers

are   all  united  in  their  dealings  with  their

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for the Southern Islands

talked about the Harbour Board unions. I personally

had  worked in the Harbour Board Union in  a  part-time  capacity. The Member for the Southern Islands

also    stated    that   the   members    of    the

union - especially the Malays - did not receive  proper

care and that they could not fit in their political

beliefs.  Mr  Speaker, what  the  Member  for  the

Southern  Islands  stated at the beginning  of  his

speech  is contradictory to what he stated  at  the

end  of  his speech. Earlier, the Member said  that

politics  should not be used in trade  unions,  but

later  on  the Member said that because the  Malays

could  not  fit  in their political  beliefs,  they

formed other unions.

he  is not yet fully aware of our trade union laws,

will consider them thoroughly or take part in trade

unions in the future.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I had better read the

Standing Order which might be of some assistance to

hon.  Members, that is, Standing Order 30 (4) which

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Member who has spoken to a question may again

be heard to offer explanation of some material part

of  his speech which has been misunderstood; but he

<br><br>So that if any Member considers that he has been

he can apply to be heard again.

Sir,  I  wish  to  clarify  my  speech  which   was

misunderstood. It was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



commented  by the Member for Kallang  that  at  the

beginning  of my speech I stated that in the  trade

union  movement  we should have no connection  with

political  parties. The reason why I  say  this  is

that  a particular trade union was found to be  run

in   accordance  with  the  beliefs  of  a  certain

political party and some of the members were not in

agreement  with these political beliefs. Therefore,

the  result  is that these members left that  union

and  formed another union with the object of having

nothing   to  do  with  politics  but   solely   of

concerning themselves with improving the conditions

of their employment.



<br><br>7.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on clause 5 of the

Bill now under consideration, the Hon. the Minister

for Labour and Law somewhat anticipated the point I

wish to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the existing Ordinance, Mr

Speaker, although the Minister has a right to over-ride  the  decision of the Registrar, that decision

of   the  Minister  over-riding  or  accepting  the

decision  of  the  Registrar does  not  prevent  an

aggrieved  party  from taking the decision  of  the

Minister  into  court. Now, the Hon. Minister  says

that he has decided to introduce this amendment  to

the  existing section 17 of the Ordinance primarily

because  he  feels  that  such  matters  cannot  be

suitably resolved in court. I take it that his only

explanation  to  the  House  for  introducing  this

proviso  is  because  he feels  that  such  matters

cannot  be suitably dealt with in a court  of  law.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not an expert on trade union

matters,  as so many of us here claim  to  be.  So,

therefore,  I went to the Trade Union Acts  in  the

United   Kingdom  from  which  our   Trade   Unions

Ordinance is derived and on which it is based.  The

inspiration for the trade union movement as we know

it  comes  from the United Kingdom, and  our  Trade

Unions Ordinance is to a large extent based on  the

English  Trade  Union Acts. I  was  surprised,  Mr

Speaker, to find that the Trade Union Acts  in  the

United Kingdom expressly and categorically preserve

the  rights  of  aggrieved parties  to  take  their

grievances into court.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



I  am  therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, somewhat  at  a

loss  to  understand how similar matters  could  be

suitably  aired in an English court  but  the  same

matters  cannot  be suitably  dealt  with  in  our

courts.  I do not for one moment believe  that  the

Minister for Law is suggesting that our courts  are

less capable of dealing with a situation which  the

English courts seem to deal with fairly well.  Sir,

leaving the ultimate decision on certain matters in

the  hands  of  a  Minister is necessary,  to  some

extent,  to  carry  on an efficient  government.  I

concede, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Minister must  be

given  certain  executive powers from  which  there

should not be an appeal; otherwise the courts  will

be flooded with niggardly and wanton appeals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister cited four Ordinances as

giving power to the Minister to do certain acts  on

matters - if  I  may  be permitted  to  say  so,  Mr

Speaker - which are not of general public importance

but  are  matters on which individual subjects  are

involved with the Government and with the permanent

officials    of    the   Government.    In    those

circumstances, it is only right and proper that the

Minister,  who  is  not a public official  in  that

sense,  should  be  given the  right  to  determine

whether  a licence should be given, or to  do  some

such act which only affects the private individual.

Such a decision should rest with the Minister.  But

this,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is an entirely  different

matter. This is a matter which does not involve one

person.  It  involves  the  right  of  persons   to

associate themselves together in one group in order

to    further   their   own   economic   interests.

Unfortunately, such matters are tied with political

issues  sometimes.  I  was surprised  to  hear  the

Member  for Telok Blangah (Mr John Mammen) in  his

speech  suggesting that the Minister for Law should

use  these  powers  to strike out  what  he  called

"S.P.A. splinter unions." If the Minister were  to

use  his powers with that end in view, I should  be

very  unhappy, but the mere fact, Mr Speaker, that

a  responsible  Member of this House could  suggest

that  the  Minister should use these powers  to  do

that leaves open the question that such an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



amendment is fraught with danger. Therefore, it  is

only  right  and  proper that on a matter  of  such

public importance the ultimate decision should  lie

with the courts of law, as in England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, cannot deny

that  the cancellation of yellow or splinter unions

as they call them is a political matter. Therefore,

it  is of importance that on an issue such as  this

the ultimate decision should lie with the courts of

this  country which are completely above suspicion,

completely  neutral, and which will look completely

objectively  upon  such matters  according  to  the

rules  framed by the Minister and not according  to

any preconceived political ideas.



<br><br>7.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Member for Cairnhill suggested that when

giving  powers to the Minister for the cancellation

or for the withdrawal of registration of yellow and

splinter unions it should be decided by means of  a

ballot.  Sir,  he was not of that same  opinion  in

1957  when he appointed a Court of Inquiry to  look

into  industrial disputes in the Singapore  Harbour

Board.   A  Court  of  Inquiry  appointed  by   the

Singapore  Government,  of  which  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  was then the Chief Minister as  well  as

the  Minister for Labour and Welfare, did recommend

that a ballot should be held and that the result of

such a ballot should be taken into account for  the

recognition of the most representative union in the

Harbour Board. Unfortunately, these recommendations

did  not  suit  the  Chief Minister  in  1957  and,

despite  various appeals from the unions  connected

with  organising the workers in the  Harbour  Board

and  the Singapore Trades Union Congress, which  is

the   national  centre  for  unions,  the  Minister

refused to hold a ballot. That was the situation in

1957,  but  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  has  since

changed  his  views. It does appear that  his  view

with  regard to ballots to decide or to assist  the

workers to decide which union they will support has

now changed according to the side of the House that

he finds himself in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



Mr   Speaker,  the  Member  for  Cairnhill   also touched   on   I.L.O. conventions,   international

opinions with regard to the Amendment Bill that  is

before   the   House.  The  present  Trade   Unions

Ordinance  was introduced in 1941, mainly  modelled

on   the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance  that  was  then

existing  in  Ceylon,  and  when  it  was   finally

implemented after the war, it was clear to all  who

had  the interest of the workers at heart that  the

purpose  of the Trade Unions Ordinance was to  show

the     world,    in    particular    international

organisations  such as the I.L.O. and  at  a  later

stage  the I.C.F.T.U. and so on, that the Singapore

Government  did recognise the rights of workers  to

form  unions; that it could not only show  this  by

means  of  having legislation but also by having  a

number  of  unions.  But the  legislation  made  it

impossible for effective trade unionism  to  exist.

At  the  last sitting, Sir, I did mention that  the

Trade Unions Ordinance as it stands today makes  it

possible  for a man, his wife and five children  to

form  a  union. And it has become quite  a  fashion

among persons who do not believe in the welfare  of

the  workers,  who do not believe  in  sound  trade

union  organisation, but who only believe in  their

own  personal glory, to take advantage of this part

of  the  legislation.  When  they  find  themselves

defeated in a democratic election within the  trade

unions they decide to set up splinter unions.  This

has  become  quite a fashion. In private  industry,

this  move  of discredited union leaders  who  lose

elections  and who want to form splinter unions  is

sometimes  encouraged  by  employers  directly   or

indirectly. The Minister for Labour and Law  quoted

an  example of Hock Lee. Several other examples can

be  quoted. Political parties too have played their

part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trade unions that do exist in

Singapore - they number 225 - cannot be said  to  be  a

movement  that  is  united and cohesive,  that  can

offer  adequate and complete service to the members

that they represent. We cannot do so because of the

limitations  imposed on the movement by  the  Trade

Unions Ordinance. The limitations are not expressed

in  so  many  words  as appear  in  the  Ordinance,

because   the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance  makes   it

possible for splinter and yellow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



unions to grow. I myself, Sir, have for many  years

been  associated  with  unions  in  the  Government

service.  Five years ago, there was only one  union

for  teachers, but now there are several unions for

teachers.  There  was  one  union  in  the  medical

service;  now  there are various  splinter  unions.

There was one union catering for administrative and

clerical  workers; now there are half a dozen  such

unions.  It is the same in every industry,  whether

it is in the Harbour Board, the Armed Services, the

City Council, or whether it is in private industry.

We have also a union which, strangely enough, calls

itself the Professional Women's Association,  whose

aims  and  objectives are not very clear. But  that

union has managed to pull out some members from the

teachers'  unions, some from the  Medical  Services

Union,   and   it   now  constitutes   itself   the

Professional Women's Association. We have had inter-union  rivalry as a result of splinter  unions  and

yellow  unions. Some of these rivalries have  ended

in  bloodshed and riot, as was seen in the Hock Lee

riots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one were to analyse the number of man-hours

lost  as  a  result of strikes and  lock-outs,  one

would  be  surprised  to know  how  many  of  those

strikes  were  caused  directly  as  a  result   of

straightforward industrial dispute, and how many of

them  were  caused because the employer refused  to

recognise  a  legally constituted and proper  union

but desired to reach agreement with either a yellow

union or a small splinter union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If industrial relations are to be maintained at a

high  level of understanding between employers  and

employees,  and if the present Government's  policy

of  industrial peace with justice is to be  carried

out,  then  a  climate  of confidence  between  the

workers  in  their own organisations and employers,

particularly  the  good  employers  and  reasonable

employers,   must  be  established  so   that   any

agreement  reached would be kept.  In  the  present

situation, it is not possible, for where  the  good

employer  wants  to maintain his agreement  with  a

properly  constituted  union,  you  have  the   bad

employers who are willing to subsidise or to assist

the  formation of yellow unions or reach  agreement

with splinter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



unions - agreements that are often to  the  detriment

of   the   workers   organised  by   the   properly

constituted union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands, Sir, did

make suggestions that unions should not be involved

in  politics. Yet in the same breath he spoke about

a  union in the Harbour Board, whose members had to

resign  from  a properly constituted union  because

they  could  not  agree with the politics  of  that

union.  This  union, I believe,  is  organised  and

confines  its  membership to  a  particular  racial

group. If the Member for the Southern Islands meant

that only unions subscribing to the politics of his

own   political   organisation   could   exist   in

Singapore, perhaps he would have been more  to  the

point.   But  he  confused  the  issue   by   first

suggesting  that all unions should keep  away  from

politics.  Sir, previously it was a  popular  thing

for  trade  union leaders to say that trade  unions

should  keep  away from politics. But  the  workers

never  at  any time believed that unions  could  be

kept  away  from  politics.  The  progress  of  the

workers  and  the improvement of their standard  of

living   are  dependent  to  some  extent  on   the

assistance  that they can provide or  the  pressure

that  they  can bring to bear on political  parties

which are favourably disposed to the workers. It is

only  natural  that the majority of the  unions  in

Singapore  should  support the present  Government.

They  do so, because this Government, for the first

time  in  the history of Singapore, did put  out  a

concrete  and a positive labour policy  before  the

workers and got a mandate from the workers and  the

people.  The workers have faith in this Government.

It  is  by the overwhelming support of the  workers

and the people of this country that this Government

was  elected.  The  workers have also  shown  their

feelings for the past Government. While it might be

said - as  the  Member for Farrer Park  did  say - that

political   considerations  would  come   in   when

withdrawals   of  registration  from   yellow   and

splinter  unions are made, it must be  made  clear,

and  I  think the Minister did make it very  clear,

that  we  are not dealing with unions whose leaders

support  this Party or that Party. We  are  dealing

with yellow and splinter unions. The definition  of

this term to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



trade  unionists  is very clear.  If  it  is  by  a

coincidence - and it has happened in Singapore  - that

many  splinter unions, strangely enough,  have  had

their  offices, either temporary or  permanent,  at

one   spot,  I  may  say  that  quite  often  their

addresses by a coincidence have happened to  be  at

Allenby  Road.  But  it is a coincidence  that  the

splinter  unions gather strength from  one  another

and  they  seem  to congregate in  one  place.  The

cancellation  or the withdrawal of the registration

of  those unions will take place. The motive is not

one  of  politics. The fact remains that  they  are

splinter unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one studies the Annual Reports of the Labour

Department  during the last ten  years,  one  finds

that  on an average 20 unions are registered  every

year  and 11 unions lose their registration. Either

they  are  cancelled  because they  have  not  kept

within  the  terms of the Ordinance,  or  they  are

dissolved  because the members have lost  interest.

As  a  result of this growth of unions on  the  one

hand   and   de-registration  on  the   other - these

constant fluctuations - workers do lose some of their

faith in the trade unions that they have. They join

a  trade union today and they find that because  it

is small and ineffective (they may not realise that

it  is a company union), these unions are not  able

to  look after their interest, as a result of which

the  workers  become disillusioned with  the  trade

union  movement. If the workers are to  believe  in

the  democratic form of government, then the  trade

union  movement, as an institution in a  democratic

society, must be made to succeed, must be  made  to

work,  and  it must produce results. If  the  trade

union  fails  to produce results, then the  workers

will  lose faith in the trade union movement,  and,

consequently,   must  also  lose   faith   in   the

democratic process of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment, Sir, is to

strengthen  the  trade union movement  and  not  to

weaken  it.  It is to strengthen it by  doing  away

with  the  large  number  of  splinter  and  yellow

unions, consolidating the workers into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



properly constituted unions, and perhaps at a later

stage reorganising them on an industrial basis. If,

as  we  believe,  the  workers' organisations,  the

trade  unions,  should  be  protected,  should   be

encouraged to be strong and powerful - because only a

sound  trade union movement can properly look after

the  interest  of  the  workers - then,  Sir,  it  is

imperative that this amendment is accepted.



<br><br>7.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, the Trade

Unions (Amendment) Bill, which is being debated, is

appropriate  to  safeguard  existing  trade  unions

which  are  being  wrecked  by  yellow  unions   or

splinter  unions.  We discover  many  yellow  trade

unions  and  splinter unions which  are  constantly

trying to wreck the growth of a healthy trade union

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many yellow and splinter trade unions were formed

with  the  encouragement of  employers.  And  these

employers  who  encouraged  the  establishment   of

splinter and yellow trade unions are employers  who

received  protection from the last Government.  The

previous   Government  constantly  protected   such

employers,  so that their workers or employees  who

were  members of the trade union movement could  be

exploited. For instance, the employers know that  a

healthy trade union movement will submit claims for

better   or   improved   conditions   of   service.

Therefore,  these  employers  tried  to  use  these

employees to form another trade union whose  claims

would be considered by the employers. This state of

affairs  has occurred in many instances, and  I  am

sure  my  colleagues  have  quoted  instances   and

explained the acts that had been committed  by  the

employers  to  form  yellow  and  splinter  unions.

Therefore,  the  Trade Unions (Amendment)  Bill,  I

believe, is in accordance with the assurance  given

by  the  People's  Action Party to  the  people  of

Singapore  during the electioneering. The  People's

Action Party has stated its policy to the people of

Singapore - the   overwhelming   majority   of   them

comprise workers - that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



will  look  after the interest and welfare  of  the

labour movement. With this Trade Unions (Amendment)

Bill,  we  can give security to members of  healthy

trade  unions so that their interest will be looked

after  and  thus  they will not  be  victimised  or

exploited  by  their employers through  yellow  and

splinter unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for the Southern Islands

said  he  agreed with the Trade Unions  (Amendment)

Bill.  But he felt suspicious that this Bill  could

influence   the  members  to  side   with   certain

political  parties.  He also  mentioned  the  point

raised  by  the  Member for Telok Blangah,  that  a

small  trade  union  based on  communal  lines  was

established  because the Member for  Telok  Blangah

believed that the main object of establishing  this

particular small communal trade union was solely to

instil  political ideology. But the Member for  the

Southern  Islands  has refuted the  statement  that

they  no longer had faith in the trade union  which

represented them, on account of the fact that  they

were  misled to accept political beliefs, and  they

therefore formed a union for the genuine purpose of

protecting the workers' interest and members of the

Malay  working  class. Therefore, it  is  necessary

that unions of this nature should be established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as far as I know, the union which was formed, as explained by the Member for Telok

Blangah  just now, was, in reality, to  consolidate

or  enhance political ideologies. That is  to  say,

the  members  and officials who formed  this  union

were all U.M.N.O. members who at one time tried  to

sabotage  the unions which represented  them.  When

the  union which represented them was faced with  a

trade   dispute,  however,  and  when   they   were

unsuccessful  in  enhancing  their  position,  they

formed  another trade union. Also, I still remember

when   my  union,  that  is,  the  Telephone  Board

Employees Union, was faced with a trade dispute, we

appealed to a Minister for assistance to settle it.

But the Minister stated that he tried to settle the

dispute   because  the  members  of  the  Singapore

Telephone  Board  Employees Union  comprised  Malay

members,  the  majority  of  whom  are  members  of

U.M.N.O.  The  way in which he tried to  settle  it

took the form of political-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering how the Member

for  Ulu Pandan can relate all these matters to the

Bill.  I think he is quite in order to make passing

mention of certain splinter unions, but to go  into

details is a bit too much.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

shall  try to comment in detail on the speech  made

by  the  Member for the Southern Islands  just  now

concerning the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill,  with

which  the Member for the Southern Islands said  he

agreed  in  principle provided that the Bill  would

not  jeopardise unions not involved with  political

movements  and  an  assurance  could  be  given  to

workers  who  are members of trade unions  that  it

would be implemented in a more suitable way. As for

the  Member  for  Farrer Park,  he  said  the  Bill

follows  the Trade Unions Ordinance in  the  United

Kingdom, and that the members of trade unions there

involved  in a trade dispute could have the  matter

brought to a civil court. He asked why we cannot do

likewise in Singapore - is it because the law  courts

in Singapore are less capable? I would like to draw

attention to the trade disputes which were  settled

in  the  courts of Singapore. I believe the methods

by  which  they were settled were colonial methods,

that is to say, they were one-sided affairs and the

Ministers concerned, for instance the Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare, did not  take  the  slightest

interest    in    the    Court's    decisions    or

recommendations. So what is the use if when a trade

dispute is settled in the courts, its decisions  or

recommendations  are not heeded and  no  action  is

taken  in  the interests of the workers  concerned?

With the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill, however,  I

believe,  that  all  workers in Singapore  who  are

members  of  healthy  trade  unions  will  have  an

assurance that their conditions of work, etc., will

be improved.

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, when a new system is born we naturally

want  to  revise the old one. To amend  legislation

permitting yellow and splinter unions is  therefore

one  of our Government's policies, because we  want

to unify the unions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker,  here  I would like  to  analyse  the yellow  unions. They are detrimental to the welfare

of  the  workers. Take, for instance, the Hock  Lee

bus riots to show how yellow unions are detrimental

to  workers - serious riots broke out when  a  yellow

union  was established. When this happened  was  it

advantageous  to the workers? They  wanted  to  get

their three meals but, unfortunately, another union

was set up to destroy their legal union and against

their   welfare.  While  negotiations  took   place

between the employers and employees, a yellow union

was  set up. That was very bad for the workers. Mr

Speaker,  there are many other unions of a  similar

nature  which  are not useful to good  relationship

between employers and employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we settle the frictions between employers

and   employees,  we  do  not  purposely  seek  the

disadvantage   of  the  employers.   However,   the

employers purposely give a lot of reasons - illogical

ones - which  are not for the welfare of the  workers

and  create  a lot of incidents. Under the  present

Ordinance, some employers, although they knew their

workers  have  a legal union, purposely  got  other

workers to form a yellow union. This created a  lot

of  friction between the workers and thus  gave  an

advantage to the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under the old system, the colonial rulers ruling us naturally liked to have many

unions  for  the workers and thus create  friction.

There was friction between employers and employees,

and   also   between   employees   and   employees.

Therefore, I say that when a union truly represents

the welfare of the workers, the old system must  be

reformed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Farrer Park spoke about

the  system  in the United Kingdom. We  the  P.A.P.

Government were elected by the people of  Singapore

and  we  are  responsible for the  welfare  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we do not amend the legislation permitting yellow and splinter unions, and unify

all unions for the sake of the country's economy we

will  suffer  much  serious  loss.  In  our  policy

statements, we have analysed the country's  economy

and  stated the serious problems facing it.  If  we

have  yellow unions side by side with legal  unions

and  creating  a lot of trouble among the  workers,

that  will  not  be advantageous for the  country's

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign, there were many

false  unionists who shouted that they  would  look

after  the  welfare of the people and provide  jobs

for  the  unemployed. In fact,  that  will  not  be

possible  if  the problems of the workers  are  not

solved. Mr Speaker, politically speaking,  we  are

different  from the Opposition Members.  Apparently

they are nonchalant about this problem. In order to

avoid  trouble between employees and employees,  we

want to unify all employees in Singapore and create

a  new  society. We know that all the goods in  the

world  were  created by the workers. Therefore,  we

say  that we must look after their welfare.  We  do

not want to be used by other people. We do not want

trouble   created  between  workers  and   workers.

Therefore, I positively support this Bill to  amend

the  legislation  permitting  yellow  and  splinter

unions.
