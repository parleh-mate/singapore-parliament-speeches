<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, of course, realise that

that  motion  can  only be moved after  notice,  but

<div align="center"><b>COMMERCIAL TELEVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(INTRODUCTION)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment to Question [9th February, 1956].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction  of commercial television in  Singapore

by the issue of an exclusive licence to a commercial

undertaking  without  charge  on  public  funds  but

subject   to  control  by  the  Government." -   (The

Minister for Education).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was, to leave out all the words

from "of" in line 1 to the end and insert?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"television in Singapore and recommends that a

Commission be appointed to explore the possibilities

of  setting up a public corporation to operate it." - (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, if

I  may  conclude  the remarks I was making  on  this

amendment yesterday afternoon, I should like  to  do

what  I  can to correct a false impression  and  any

misunderstanding  which  may  have  been  caused  by

reports in this morning's Press, where I am reported

as having attacked the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member who moved this motion made it

clear that the original motion before the House  was

not  a Government motion; that this is a free debate

in  which Members are entitled to express their  own

views, and in which the views of the Government  are

not being put forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it quite clear, beyond

misunderstanding, Sir, that I have not as yet  joined

the  People's Action Party and nothing that  I  said

yesterday will, I hope, be interpreted as in any way

attacking the policy of the Government. I was giving

my  views  in this debate as other hon. Members  are

doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  after  having  heard  the  arguments

advanced  yesterday by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

(Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) and others, I now propose,  Sir,

to  move an amendment to the amendment which is  now

before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



House.  The amendment that I am moving is  to  leave

out  all the words from "a" before "Commission"  and

insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Committee be appointed to explore the

possibilities of its introduction in Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The appropriate time, of course, to

move  that amendment, the hon. Member will  probably

realise,  is  when I propose the Question  later  on

"That   the  words  proposed  to  be  inserted,   be

inserted"; but, of course, that does not prevent the

hon. Member from speaking on what he proposes to do.

Mr Braga.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The purpose of this amendment, Sir, is

not  to keep out the possibilities of any other form

of institution to run television. It may be a public

corporation; it may be a private corporation; or  it

may  be a marriage of both. It does not exclude  any

possibilities. Sir, I will move this amendment  when

you put the Question before the House, and not now.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I had better remind hon. Members that

the  only  Question before the House is,  "That  the

words proposed to be left out, be left out." If that

is  agreed, then, of course, we go on to  the  other

Question as to the words to be inserted. That is the

position.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> If it

please  you,  Sir,  I would like clarification.  In

order  to have this amendment accepted, the existing

amendment before the House then should be negatived,

and  then we proceed. Is that it, Sir? Or is it only

when  you propose the Question that we can  move  an

amendment before the vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I just explain it again? The

procedure  is  this.  Now  we  have,  in  fact,  two

Questions  which  affect  the  Member  for   Tanjong

Pagar's  amendment.  The  first  Question  is   that

certain words that he proposes to leave out be  left

out. That is being debated now, and in the course of

the  debate any Member may, of course, touch on  the

words which the hon. Member wishes to include.  That

has been done. Now, after I put that Question, "That

the words proposed to be left out, be left out", if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



Members agree that those words be left out, then, of

course, I will go on to the Question that the  words

proposed  by  the  hon. Member to  be  inserted,  be

inserted.  It is at that period that any Member  can

move amendments to that Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put the first Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is, "That the words

proposed to be inserted, be there inserted", and the

words proposed to be inserted are the words proposed

by the Member for Tanjong Pagar:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"television in Singapore and recommends that a

Commission be appointed to explore the possibilities

of setting up a public corporation to operate it".



<br><br>That  is the Question that is now before the  House.

Now, Mr Braga.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, I am very much obliged. I

do  move  an  amendment to the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar's amendment. I have already handed it  to  the

Clerk of the Assembly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words from "a" in the first

line and to insert the words "Committee be appointed

to  explore the possibilities of its introduction in

Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already said, Sir, this would not

exclude the possibilities of any institution running

it as the Committee may recommend.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee (Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Mak Pak Shee):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original amendment was to leave

out  all the words after the word "of" and to insert

the  words  "television in Singapore and  recommends

that  a  Commission  be  appointed  to  explore  the

possibilities of setting up a public corporation  to

operate it". Now it has already been agreed that the

words  proposed to be left out, be left  out.  Since

then  there  has been another amendment proposed  to

the  original amendment, and that is, to  leave  out

all the words



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



after  "a"  and  to insert the words  "Committee  be

appointed  to  explore  the  possibilities  of   its

introduction  in  Singapore".  So  that  the   whole

Question would then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   television  in   Singapore   and

recommends that a Committee be appointed to  explore

the possibilities of its introduction

in Singapore".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out of the original amendment, be left out".



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, we

have  had  quite  a  few miracles  this  month.  The

Progressive    Party    have    accepted    complete

independence and the Democrats have come  out  fully

in  favour  of  a Socialist platform  equal  to  the

Labour Front, and the Labour Front has converted  an

official  into being a Fabian - more Fabian  than  the

Labour  Front - who  tells  us  the  principles   of

Socialism for which we should stand. Now,  Sir,  the

fact  that  I  am  going to vote in favour  of  this

amendment  will  suggest that there is  yet  another

miracle,  and I am being converted by my friend  and

colleague  the  Hon. the Minister for Communications

and Works (Mr Thomas) and the leader for the P.A.P.

But  that is not the position. It is preferable that

an   instrument  of  this  character,  with   public

influence,  should be in the hands of Government  if

the expense is not prohibitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, in my small way and in so far as I

could, examine the possibilities. For myself  I  was

satisfied,  Sir,  that for the first  few  years  it

would  be preferable to allow private capital to  do

the  spade work and to have Government control;  and

later  on, as we see how things progress, to buy  it

over   with   full   knowledge  of   the   practical

difficulties as they work out daily, and as  we  can

see  them before our eyes and particularly with full

knowledge  of  the  cost  to  the  country  of  this

service.  That is why, Sir, I supported the original

motion  and I was against the amendment which sought

to  limit  the  service of television  to  a  public

corporation  without  consideration  of  any   other

possibilities, because I feared, and I  still  fear,

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



if  we  seek to make it a public corporation and  do

not  investigate  the other possibilities,  we  will

find  it impossible to carry on or else take over  a

burden with considerable liabilities which we cannot

fully  envisage and which may gravely  reflect  upon

our  capacity  to  deal  with  problems  of  a  more

pressing social character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment now proposed by my friend and

colleague the Minister for Health (Mr Braga),  Sir,

takes  away that objection, although it still leaves

the  objection of delay - and delay can be  important,

but  it  is not vital. In this instance, Sir,  there

have  been  sentiments expressed - and expressed  with

some   force  and,  may  I  say,  with  some  logic - sentiments  of  fear,  even from  a  member  of  the

officials,  that  to put this in the  hands  of  big

business would gravely prejudice the welfare of  the

country - and it is very welcome that we should  have

from  an official so refreshing a suspicion  of  big

business!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the word "Commission" has been changed to

"Committee"  for this one purpose: A Commission  has

considerable  powers of compulsion, powers  to  take

evidence   on  oath  and  to  force  production   of

documents  and  attendance,  and  powers   to   take

evidence in private as well as in public. Now,  Sir,

those   powers  should  not  be  lightly  given   or

unnecessarily given. In a matter of this  character,

there  can be no reason whatsoever to fear that  any

organisation  or  anybody who  is  invited  to  give

evidence  would refrain from doing so. There  is  no

necessity  for  these powers of  compulsion,  and  a

Committee would be fully adequate because  it  would

similarly  have  powers  to take  evidence  both  in

public  and in private. For the rest, Sir, it leaves

that Committee free to consider other aspects of the

introduction  of television without  the  limitation

that  is sought by the Member for Tanjong Pagar.  As

my  friend and colleague the Minister for Health has

pointed  out, it may well be that there could  be  a

marriage between public and private capital, Sir, in

the  form of giving Government the control which  is

considered  adequate and which I consider  necessary

over television. It may be that even that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



would be impossible and the Committee would wish  to

recommend  that, though it is preferable to  have  a

public   corporation,   nevertheless,   because   of

technical, organisational or financial difficulties,

commercial television be introduced for a  temporary

period. We have this morning read that Indonesia has

accepted  commercial television and  is  introducing

it.  In  those circumstances, Sir, I, for one,  will

accept  the  amendment proposed  by  my  friend  and

colleague  the Minister for Health - that a  Committee

be   appointed  to  investigate  the  possibilities.

Though  I do regret that there should be this delay,

I  do also recognise that if there is this wide  and

genuine fear of the threat of big business, then  it

is  necessary  that we should accept this  delay  in

order to have the picture that the public wishes.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

perhaps few of us remember that a few years back  we

had  an  exhibition in Singapore of television.  The

public  thought that television would be  here  very

shortly,  but  years rolled by without  any  result.

However,  some  steps,  in the  way  of  motions  or

amendments  to  motions, are now being taken - whether

it  should  be  run  by a public corporation  or  by

private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those democratic countries which are slowly

proceeding towards Socialism have still a  love  for

privately-sponsored projects with  some  control  by

the  Government, and if these projects are found  to

be  unsatisfactorily run later, then the  Government

takes over. After all, Sir, even the big states have

not been able to provide all the capital for all the

necessities,  and  that is why they  have  encouraged

private capital to come forward.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr R. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I am coming to the amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I just want to make quite clear what

the   position   is.   There  seems   to   be   some

misunderstanding. Hon. Members will realise that the

position now is that we have agreed that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



commercial television is out of the picture. We  are

now  dealing  with  the question whether  or  not  a

Commission  should  be  appointed  to  explore   the

possibilities of setting up a public corporation  as

against a Committee to explore the possibilities  of

the introduction of television.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> With respect, Sir, do forgive

me for seeking to correct you - I do apologise - but the

very purpose of the amendment is to leave commercial

television  in  the picture. The  amendment  by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew)  says

"public  corporation", whereas the amendment  by  my

friend  the Hon. the Minister for Health (Mr Braga)

leaves it to a Committee to decide whether it  wants

a  commercial institution, whether it wants a public

corporation, or whether it wants a marriage  of  the

two. Commercial television is still in the picture.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There seems to be some

misunderstanding about the whole procedure,  because

once  certain words are left out of a motion,  those

words are left out and cannot be restored. But if it

is  the  wish of the Assembly that the matter should

still be pursued, it can, of course, be done.  I  am

only  pointing out what the procedure is. So, if  it

is the wish of the Assembly that this question of  a

commercial  undertaking  should  still  be  in   the

picture,  the debate on it can, of course, continue.

Is that the wish of the Assembly then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The majority seem to say Yes, so let

us  have  some  more  talk  about  it.  Yes,  Mr  R.

Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am not pleading on this

platform  that we must have a commercial corporation

to  do  that. Far from it. I am just putting forward

the  picture  of  how other countries  are  allowing

private capital to come forward and help the country

in certain projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this television exhibition I

was talking about just now,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



I  happened to ask one of the engineers who was there

as  to what distance one could operate a station. If

I  remember  it correctly, Sir, he told me  that  it

could   be  from  50  to  70  miles.  Now,  if   any

corporation, public or private, or Government is  to

operate,   it  can  take  advantage  of  the   other

territories also to earn additional income and  also

give its benefits. Sir, we have forgotten altogether

this most important aspect. If a station can operate

from  75  miles away, then it is possible  that  our

neighbouring territory will also be interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is this: Why not let the State

run this? But, then, Sir is the State big enough  to

take  up so many projects? Has it sufficient capital

to  do so many things? I certainly say that we  have

only  got  a limited capacity. If we have a  limited

capacity, why not explore the possibility that other

territories might join, and here the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary  (Mr Goode) brought in a very good  point

in  this debate - that if it is to be a State project,

why  not bring in broadcasting also? That is a  very

important  point.  Broadcasting  serves   not   only

Singapore,  not only the Federation,  but  also  our

other neighbouring territories, Borneo, etc. and  it

might  be possible for a Committee or Commission  to

explore the possibility of getting these territories

in,  because if they are interested, our burden will

be  less. It is very well to say why not put  up  so

many  million  dollars for this  and  that  project?

Where  are we going to get the money from? Sir,  our

neighbours even have floated corporations where  the

State  capital  is 51 per cent or 75  per  cent  and

private  capital is less. The State has the  control

but  they  give up the management to a  properly-run

private  organisation. I refer to a shipping company

floated  by the Government of India; 75 per cent  of

the  capital belongs to the Government  and  25  per

cent  to  a private company, but the management  has

been  handed over to the company. Sir, take the case

of  the India National Airlines. It is a Government

concern and is capitalised by the Government. It  is

one of the best airlines, and second to none. Yet it

has been handed over to a private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



company to run and it is doing wonderfully well.  It

may be State-cum-private capital too. We might bring

in   other   interested  territories.   The   bigger

territories should have more interest. I do not know

if  I  am  in  order,  Sir,  but  this  was  debated

yesterday. Take the railways, for example. It  is  a

Federation  affair.  Airlines may  be  a  Federation

affair   too,  because  a  major  portion   of   the

Federation  is  served by them.  The  Government  of

Singapore  should not take on their own shoulders  a

responsibility  which  is not  entirely  their  own.

Public   internal  transport  is,  of  course,   the

Government's  responsibility.  They  can  take  over

television   if  they  want  to,  but   when   other

territories  are interested, we have  got  to  think

wisely. Whether a Committee is appointed to consider

the question or whether it should be a Commission is

immaterial;  but if broadcasting is to  come  in,  I

think  a  Commission might be better.  However,  the

Hon. the Chief Secretary has not moved an amendment

to bring in broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a Commission is appointed to consider only

television, the procedure would be rather  laborious

and expensive. A Committee might do quicker work.  I

would suggest, not a Committee of this House, but an

ad  hoc  Committee  which  should  also  consist  of

experts who can give us really good advice, check on

the  information  received, and make recommendations

accordingly to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  had  a  very  open mind when the debate  on  this

motion started, but the excellent exposition by  the

Hon. the Chief Secretary persuaded me to think that

the  course he has suggested is the best one in that

there is every possibility that television could  be

economically  run by the Broadcasting Department  in

conjunction     with,    possibly,     advertisement

programmes.  To  me,  who  has  been  both  in   the

Government   and  in  business,  that  is   a   great

attraction.   I   have  known  how   expensive   any

undertaking  can be when run by Government,  but  in

this  case  we have an existing corporation  dealing

with   practically  the  same  line   as   that   of

television. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



all  the  buildings there, quite a bit of equipment,

the  personnel,  and  the new venture  can  well  be

undertaken  by the existing staff with  an  addition

of,  say,  half the number which would  normally  be

required by a new corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we are persuaded that we should take time to

think  and make enquiries before we proceed further,

then  I  agree with the amendment suggested  by  the

Hon. the Minister for Health, to the effect that the

enquiry  should be conducted fully and  not  limited

just  to  a public corporation. I therefore heartily

support this amendment moved by him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief

Minister appears to prefer a Committee rather than a

Commission, because he feels that a body which is to

investigate a very important subject would not  have

the  powers of compelling witnesses to speak on oath

and  make  other  requests  for  the  disclosure  of

information.  I  think the Chief  Minister  probably

does not realise that such an enquiry would have  to

be  extensive and thorough, and a Commission  is  by

far  the  more effective way of getting  information

before  the members of such a Commission. I  am  not

dogmatic in my approach to television being under  a

public  authority.  I  am  prepared  to  meet  those

Members   who  wish  to  have  this  Commission   or

Committee  which will investigate the  possibilities

of  television  under some other  authority  than  a

public   authority.  But  I   feel   that   such   a

Commission - I  would  prefer a  Commission - should  be

asked  to  pay  particular regard to,  and  to  make

recommendations on, the best way in which it  should

be introduced in Singapore. It might be well to give

this Commission sufficient scope so as to include in

its   deliberations  the  question  of  broadcasting

together with that of television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, an amendment which I hope will

meet the views of those Members of this House who do

not   wish  the  Commission  to  be  tied  down   to

investigating   only  television  under   a   public

authority  but  under any other  authority.  Such  a

Commission  could, at the same time,  be  given  the

opportunity    to   investigate    and    to    make

recommendations on the setting up of a public cor-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



poration  to  run both broadcasting  and  television

together.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is possible under the

present amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not saying Sir, that -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> To examine the possibilities -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

amendment as it now is, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   television  in   Singapore   and

recommends that a Committee be appointed to  explore

the possibilities of its introduction in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go beyond that and give this

Commission the power to explore the possibilities of

putting   broadcasting  and  television  under   one

authority. It may be a public authority. It  may  be

that  the  Commission, after its deliberations,  may

recommend  that it remains under the  control  of  a

Government  department.  In  any  case  it   is   an

opportune   time  to  consider  this   question   of

broadcasting  together  with  television   on   this

present motion. I have here, Sir, an amendment which

I propose to move. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To leave out all the words after 'a' and to put

in   the  words  'Commission  to  be  appointed   to

investigate the possibilities and recommend the best

means whereby it can be established, with particular

reference to making recommendations for the  placing

of broadcasting and television under one authority'".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is one aspect which perhaps the

hon. Member has not considered, and that is that  he

has,  in  fact,  moved  an  amendment  which  is  an

amendment  to  his  own amendment.  Therefore,  that

being  so, I think he is completely out of order  in

doing  that. Of course, there is nothing to  prevent

any  other  Member from adopting his suggestion  and

moving the amendment at the appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect, of course, is that this

amendment  completely negatives  the  amendment  now

before the House. Therefore the procedure really  to

be  adopted  is for the hon. Member to vote  against

this  amendment. Then, if he succeeds, his amendment

will, of course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



come back to the House and somebody else can move an

amendment to his original amendment. I hope  I  have

made myself clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Speaker, Sir. I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we  can

precede    with   this   debate   without   personal

animosities. I hope we will take this opportunity to

have   a   Commission  appointed  to   explore   the

possibilities    of   bringing   broadcasting    and

television under one authority. On many an  occasion

in  this  House important matters have arisen  quite

accidentally  as  when  some persons  wanted  to  be

junior  Ministers  and this led to a  constitutional

crisis.  Some  persons think that  television  is  a

great  idea  and,  after talking  to  some  friends,

decide  to  invite tenders. Some persons  get  angry

because  others criticise them for the way in  which

things  are done; or they object to amendments  even

if  they are reasonable - indeed particularly if  they

are reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever happens at the end of this debate I hope

the  House will remember that Members of an Assembly

come and go, but institutions like broadcasting  and

television may go on, if not forever, at least  long

after  we are gone. We should sit back now and  think

over  the possibility of doing something on  a  firm

and  steady basis. I must thank the Chief  Secretary

for having introduced broadcasting into this debate.

I  had  wanted to introduce this subject of bringing

broadcasting   and  television  under   one   public

authority, but I thought that if I went that  far  I

might   antagonise   sufficient   Members   on   the

Government side to make it impossible for my  motion

ever to get through. But I now find support from  an

official  for  the idea of putting broadcasting  and

television together. Of course, the official view is

that  it  would  be  better if  both  were  under  a

Government department. My view is that it  would  be

better  if  both  were under an  independent  public

authority. Members of the Opposition will  therefore

have  less  reason  to  suspect  any  bias  in   the

presentation of any views, or any particular kind of

view,  over  a Government broadcasting or television

system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am against this amendment by the Hon. the

Minister for Health because:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I do not think a Committee is adequate for

this purpose; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I consider this is an appropriate time to have

a  Commission  appointed, not only  to  explore  the

possibilities of commercial or State television  but

also  to consider whether this is not the right time

to bring broadcasting together with television under

one authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House therefore to support me in

rejecting  the  Minister for Health's  amendment.  I

would invite it to amend my amendment in order  that

this  Commission will have the power to  investigate

the  question  of broadcasting and television  being

placed under one authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the processes of

democracy is often accused of being rather slow, and

I  must  say that they have been strikingly slow  in

this  Assembly during the sittings of the  last  two

days and today. I do personally believe that in this

particular   debate  on  television,  we   are   all

substantially agreed that what we want  is  to  have

the  matter examined and have the information before

us  on which we can make up our minds. I do not feel

there  is  any great substance in whether  it  is  a

Commission or a Committee. There is no matter that I

can  see which is likely to call for judicial powers

to  enforce  people to give evidence on oath  or  to

compel  secret  papers  to  be  produced.  There  is

nothing much to consider except possibilities in the

future.  There  is  nothing  much  in  the  past  in

television which we can hope to examine,  and  I  do

not think that point is very significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, I am quite satisfied with a Committee

provided it is well planned and competent to do  its

work.  I  do  not  think it will  be  obstructed  by

inability  to  compel evidence.  I  think  that  the

various points that have been raised since the  Hon.

the Minister for Health put his amendment can all be

dealt   with   quite  adequately   without   further

discussion here, by giving an undertaking  that  the

terms of reference for the Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



will  be so framed that whatever the representatives

of  the  people  want  to  be  considered  shall  be

considered.  We do not have to frame  the  terms  of

reference  in  this House. We can  indicate  broadly

what the intention of the House is, and it is up  to

the  terms  of reference to indicate precisely  what

the  functions of the Committee are. I am sure there

will  be  no  difficulty  about  framing  terms   of

reference   which  will  be  satisfactory   to   all

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only rise to make this suggestion, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  because I feel that at present we have  got  a

kite  up in the air with an endless stream of little

amendments  attached to its tail, and if  we  go  on

attaching further and further amendments we shall be

here  until  we recess for our tiffin and  we  shall

still  have got very little further with  our  Order

Paper;  and  I  can see the sitting going  on  until

maybe ten o'clock or twelve o'clock at night or into

the early hours of tomorrow before we get away if we

continue  to  spend a lot of time debating  what  is

really  not  much more than a procedural  point.  So

personally,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  be  glad  to

accept  the amendment of the Minister for Health  on

the  understanding that the Committee would be given

adequate terms of reference to deal with the matters

which have been raised in this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  Does the Minister for Communications and Works

say  that  he feels that this Committee should  have

the   power   to  investigate  the  possibility   of

broadcasting and television being put together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes, I think there is no reason at all

why  they should not examine that. I think it  is  a

most fruitful suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is part of the whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

appears  to me that in this debate one of  the  most

important  points has been lost sight of.  Both  the

original motion and the amendments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



have  suggested,  in principle, the introduction  of

television in Singapore, but I have not heard, apart

from  a few passing remarks, whether it is desirable

to  introduce television in Singapore. To  me,  Sir,

this  is a very grave matter which should have  been

debated at considerable length and the pros and cons

assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that the terms of reference of the

proposed Committee should, if possible, include  the

question   whether  it  is  desirable  to  introduce

television  in Singapore, because in  the  past  few

months I have heard many arguments against this. The

Hon. the Chief Secretary made it very clear to this

Assembly yesterday that more than 50 per cent of the

population are below the age of 21. This controversy

about  the  introduction of television in  Singapore

has  been going on for some time, although there has

been no official suggestion as to its introduction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no strong views about television in

Singapore,  because I have always thought  that  its

introduction  in  Singapore  will  not  benefit  the

ordinary  man  in  the street  very  much.  I  would

request  the Government to consider this matter  and

to  so  frame the terms of reference as to  meet  my

request.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a matter of elucidation, in

answer to my friend the Member for Seletar. As I see

it,  the motion should have been passed and I should

have  to  carry out the appointment of a  Committee.

The motion accepts the principle of the introduction

of  television,  Sir,  and in the  circumstances  it

would  not be appropriate for Government to  include

in  the  terms  of  reference  a  request  that  the

Committee consider the desirability, because,  as  I

see  the  motion  or the amendment  now  before  the

House,   it  incorporates  an  acceptance   of   the

principle   of  its  introduction.  All   that   the

Committee  can do is to investigate all  the  means,

including the question of an alliance with any other

forms of entertainment, radio as well as others. But

it cannot investigate the question of desirability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out

of  the  original amendment, be left out," put,  and

agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is, "That the words

proposed to be inserted, be there inserted," so that

the original Question, as amended, would read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   television  in   Singapore   and

recommends that a Committee be appointed to  explore

the possibilities of its introduction in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an opportunity for hon. Members to suggest

amendments to the words proposed to be inserted.  If

there are none, I will put the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be inserted,

be there inserted," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Now the original Question, as

amended, is before the House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   television  in   Singapore   and

recommends that a Committee be appointed to  explore

the possibilities of its introduction in Singapore."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, for the purposes of the

record, I wish to say that we have taken note of the

fact  that  the Chief Minister and the Minister  for

Communications  and  Works  have  said   that   this

Committee  will  be  empowered,  in  its  terms   of

reference,   to   investigate  the  possibility   of

bringing  broadcasting  and  television  under   one

authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> With respect, Sir for the

record,  I  would not have my words twisted,  but  I

would  like  to  say that the terms  of  reference - I

repeat  what  I  have  said - of the  Committee  would

empower  it to investigate any relationship that  it

considers   appropriate   between   television   and

broadcasting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I should be much obliged, Mr

Speaker, Sir, if the Minister for Communications and

Works  would  clarify the position,  because,  as  I

understood  him,  he  said, in  his  bland,  affable

manner, "Yes, the Committee will have powers to look

into  everything,  and  all  this  debate  is  quite

unnecessary." Is that so or is that not so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I really feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that democracy is slowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



down  almost to a standstill! I think the  Committee

should  investigate the things which it is asked  to

investigate and which are the things which the House

wishes to have investigated and which the House  has

indicated  should  be  investigated  and  which,  no

doubt,     the     Committee    will    investigate![Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. We cannot go on like

this.  Mr  Lim  Choon Mong, you can  speak  on  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

now we have the whole motion, as amended, before the

House;  the question is whether this House  approves

the  principle  of  the introduction  of  commercial

television in Singapore and a Committee to be set up

to investigate it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The word "commercial" has been left out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir. I have noticed that

radio,  broadcasting  and newspapers  are  all  very

important media whereby ideas can be passed.  Radio,

especially, is a suitable pastime for people. I also

know   the   great  importance  of  the  cinema   in

entertaining people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no very strong views against

television, and I am just saying what is in my  mind

as  a private citizen. From my observations, Sir,  I

think  we  do not have many industries in Singapore,

and  I think the first need of Singapore is to  have

more  money  put  into industry.  The  question  has

occurred to me whether it would be right for  us  to

encourage    investment   in   another    form    of

entertainment or whether it would not be better that

the  people who have capital should be persuaded  to

set  up more industries so as to boost up production

for the sake of greater national wealth. We do want,

of  course, some sort of entertainment too, but I am

of  the  opinion  that if we have television  coming

into Singapore, we must consider what section of the

people  it  will benefit. A television set,  I  have

been told, would cost between $800 and $1,000. I  am

wondering whether this amenity, when it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



comes to Singapore, will ever reach the common man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Will it ever reach the homes

of  people  who  earn  $100 or  $200?  Sir,  as  has

occurred  in  other  lands,  television  sets   will

probably be set up in public houses, in coffee-shops

(as  we  have  them here) or in bars. It  will  then

create  a  situation whereby the man in the  street,

who  cannot afford to own a television set,  may  be

attracted  to  get into a bar or a  coffee-shop  and

then glue his eyes on to the television set, instead

of  spending more time with his family at  home.  Of

course,  as  you  know,  the family  should  be  the

strongest  unit  in democracy and we  should  always

make the man stick to his family. I therefore wonder

how much this is going to take the man away from his

family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, there is the question of the

programmes. Whether they are good or bad depends  on

the  people behind them. It is just like  a  double-edged sword. It can cut one way and do good. It  can

cut the other way and demoralise the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do understand and I do appreciate the fact that

T.V. is a modern form of entertainment available  in

all  advanced nations, and because of that we should

also  have  this  amenity.  But  I  would  like  the

Committee,  if  it ever sits down  to  consider  its

terms  of reference, to consider also the points  of

view that I have put forward in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

does  appear quite clearly now that the  Member  for

Serangoon  has  become  more socialistic  than  ever

before.  Of  course, it will be  the  duty  of  this

Government - the   Labour  Front  and   the   Alliance

Coalition  Government - to see that the  interests  of

the  masses  are  not  only  not  ignored  but  well

protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visualise that when television comes to

Singapore the youth clubs, the trade unions and  the

community  centres will be provided with  television

sets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> At Government expense?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> I have found out that in England

now  you  can  get  a television  set  on  the  hire

purchase  system at a price of about 25 guineas.  If

Government,   during  the  early   stages   of   the

introduction  of  television in  Singapore,  do  not

place  a  duty on television sets, it will certainly

enable the low income group to have television sets.

So  I should like to assure the Member for Serangoon

that  he  need  not  be  alarmed,  as  far  as  this

Government is concerned, that the interests  of  the

masses  will not be protected, especially the  youth

clubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House approves in principle the

introduction   of   television  in   Singapore   and

recommends that a Committee be appointed to  explore

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<div align="center"><b>TRANSFER OF POWERS AND INTERPRETATION ORDINANCE, 1949</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, this is a very simple

matter  with  a complicated procedure. Way  back  in

1945  the  British Military Administration issued  a

proclamation to give power to reduce the consumption

of electricity and to restrict supplies to consumers

because at that time, as all Members know, the power

station was most grievously over-laden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in the fortunate position of having a

modern  power station and it is no longer  necessary

to  have the powers to restrict consumption. It  has

therefore been decided that that proclamation should

be  cancelled.  This  is done  by  the  Governor  in

Council   making  an  order  which   includes   that

proclamation  in  the Schedule to  the  Transfer  of

Powers  and  Interpretation  Ordinance,  1946.   The

Schedule   lists  those  proclamations   which   are

cancelled.  It  is,  however,  necessary  for   this

income  tax  under section 13 (1) (e) of the  Income

Tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance.  This exemption is effected by  inclusion

of  the  name of the Board in the First Schedule  of

the  Ordinance.  For this purpose, a resolution, of

the  Assembly is necessary under section 102 (1)  of

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Board is constituted under the Federation

consists  of the Director of Marine as Chairman  and

not  less than four nor more than six members to  be

appointed  by  the High Commissioner. The  Board  is

empowered, under the Ordinance, to collect dues from

ships entering the Federation waters at the rate  of

ten cents per unit registered ton of shipping. These

dues  are  paid  into the Light Dues Fund  which  is

utilised  to  maintain and improve the  navigational

aids in the Federation waters and for other purposes

connected with it. According to the accounts for the

year  1954,  some $624,000 were collected  as  light

dues  and  the  expenditure, as  authorised  by  the

Ordinance, amounted to $448,000. The balance of  the

Fund on the 31st of December, 1954, was $471,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedents for the inclusion of such a public body

in the First Schedule are, inter alia, the Singapore

Harbour  Board  and  the Penang Harbour  Board.  The

Malayan Board of Income Tax has considered this case

and  has  recommended that the Light Dues Board  may

properly  be included in the First Schedule  to  the

to  enable  candidates  to qualify  locally  and  to

the Royal Institute of British Architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board, with the approval of the Minister, is

empowered to make by-laws to carry out the  purposes

of  the  Ordinance. The Board is also  empowered  to

cancel registration of architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance prescribes, inter alia, the fees

payable  on  initial registration and on  subsequent

renewal of registration. All moneys collected  under

the  Ordinance are paid to the Board to be  applied,

<div align="center"><b>(ADVANCES FOR ERECTING LOW-COST HOUSES)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the allocation of

advances  to the Singapore Improvement Trust  up  to

but not exceeding the sum of one million dollars for

the purpose of erecting low-cost houses for sale  to

members of the public subject to such conditions  as

the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing

may from time to time impose; and that this Assembly

further  takes note that the Government proposes  to

guarantee repayment of one half of that part of  any

loan  made  by  the  Federal and  Colonial  Building

Society,  Ltd., in respect of any such houses  which

exceeds 80 per cent but does not exceed 90 per  cent

of  the agreed valuation of the property which forms

the security for such loan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of introducing this motion is to give a

full  opportunity for explaining, and to obtain  the

Assembly's  formal approval of,  a  scheme  for  the

erection  of low-cost houses for sale to members  of

the  public. For some time, various proposals for  a

scheme of this nature have been under consideration.

The  Government is making every effort, through  the

agency of the Singapore Improvement Trust, to  build

as  many houses and flats as possible for letting at

low  rents,  but we consider it desirable  that  the

opportunity should be given to members of the public

in  the  lower income groups to buy their own homes.

Many  houses  are  now  being  built  for  sale   in

Singapore  by  private enterprise, but  we  consider

that it is desirable to supplement these efforts  by

building small, well-planned houses as cheaply as is

compatible  with  good  construction,  so  that  the

benefits  of home ownership may be extended  as  far

down the lower income groups as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore now proposed that the Singapore

Improvement Trust, as the direct agent of Government

in  this  matter, should be advanced funds up  to  a

limit  of  $1  million  at  any  time  for  building

suitable  types  of cheap houses.  This  expenditure

will  be  recouped when the houses are sold and  the

money   used  again  for  further  building.   These

advances  will  therefore be  in  the  nature  of  a

revolving  fund which, it is hoped,  will  enable  a

substantial number of houses to be built and sold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A block of 68 houses in Queenstown, which the

Singapore Improvement Trust has already built,  will

be  taken over for sale under this scheme and  plans

for  further building are being put in hand. I would

emphasise that this scheme is entirely additional to

the Trust's present

and  future programmes for building houses and flats

for  letting,  and  it  is not intended  that  there

should  be  any reduction in the tempo  of  building

under   those   programmes   on   account   of   the

introduction  of  this new scheme for  building  for

home ownership.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also explain to hon. Members that it is

not Government's intention to make any profit out of

this   scheme.  Some  small  variations   from   the

estimates  will  be  inevitable,  but  the   general

principle will be that the purchase price should  be

the  actual cost to Government. Taking one programme

with  another over a period, the advances  which  we

make  available under this scheme will be  preserved

intact,  but  with  no accumulation  on  account  of

interest or profit for use in further schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the scheme. Government has had to

bear  in  mind that the maximum loan which  building

societies  are  normally prepared to  offer  on  the

security of an individual house and plot of land  is

only  80 per cent of their valuation. It was thought

that  to  introduce a scheme whereby each  purchaser

had to lay down at least 20 per cent of the value of

the  house,  would  tend  to restrict  severely  the

number  of  people  who  could  participate  in  the

scheme.  A  special arrangement has  therefore  been

made with the Federal and Colonial Building Society,

Ltd.,  whereby under this scheme loans of up  to  90

per cent of the agreed valuation may be made by that

Society,   so  that  in  each  case  the  individual

purchaser  will  have to make a minimum  deposit  of

only  ten  per cent of the valuation.  It  has  been

agreed  with  this Society that Government  and  the

Society  should  share equally the  additional  risk

which  the Society will incur by making loans of  up

to  90  per  cent of the valuation, instead  of  the

present  limit  of  80  per  cent.  Government  will

therefore  be  guaranteeing  the  repayment  to  the

Society of one-half of that part of any loan made by

the  Society under this scheme which exceeds 80  per

cent  but does not exceed 90 per cent of the  agreed

valuation.  The  Society has agreed  to  this  joint

guarantee for properties valued at $8,000 and below,

but  it  should be noted that Government's intention

is  to  build houses for sale at prices  much  lower

than that limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need take up Members' time

further on this subject, and I will leave it  to  my

hon. colleague  the Minister for Local  Government,

Lands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



and Housing to explain further details of the scheme

and  to  refer  to the conditions which  it  is  his

intention  to lay down. I will merely add that  this

scheme   is   essentially  in  the  nature   of   an

experiment. We do not know what the demand is likely

to  be, but Government feels that it will be a  very

desirable  step  to  afford  facilities   for   home

ownership to those sections of the community to whom

they  are  not at present available. Sir, I  beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise to second the  motion.  This

Government, when it took office, announced  that  it

was  its  intention  to  find  ways  and  means   of

encouraging those in the lower income group  to  own

their  own  homes.  This scheme is  the  first  step

towards that end. The houses are to be sold at their

real  cost, due allowance being made for appropriate

overheads. They will be offered to families  with  a

joint income from all sources of not more than  $400

a  month.  Preference will be given to wage-earners.

The  title  to  the houses will be a  99-year  lease

which   will   contain  a  limited  restriction   of

assignment. This restriction is designed to  prevent

them  from  falling  into the hands  of  speculative

buyers.  Amongst  the restrictions which  Government

has  in mind and which it most certainly will insist

are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That houses are to be used for residential

purposes by the owner occupier;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sub-leases shall not be assigned either in

whole  or in part without the written permission  of

the Singapore Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the houses are sold, more

houses will be built from the proceeds of the  sale.

With  a  fund  of $1 million it will be possible  to

build  approximately 200 houses each year.  If  this

scheme  meets  with the success which  we  think  it

deserves,  consideration  will  be  given   to   the

question  of making a larger sum available for  this

purpose. I should like to repeat, however, what  the

Hon. the Financial Secretary has said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



just  now,  and  that  is  this - it  is  Government's

intention  that this scheme should be  supplementary

to and not in any way in replacement of the existing

S.I.T. building  programme. While building  for  sale

will,  to some extent, help to conserve the  capital

resources  of  Government, the main  object  of  the

proposal  is  to  foster a community of  responsible

home-owners,  a  community which  will  add  to  the

strength and stability of the new Singapore which we

are  planning. I trust, Sir, that this is  a  motion

which hon. Members from both sides of the House will

be able to give their wholehearted support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on a point of information.

The  Minister  has  indicated that  he  expects  200

houses to be built. My arithmetic shows that  if  $1

million  is  divided  by 200,  the  answer  will  be

$5,000.  He says 200 houses will be built each  year

as   the  loan  gets  repaid.  Could  we  have  more

information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) As to the type of houses being built and the

cost; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As to how these 200 houses a year is arrived at

out of this $1 million?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as to the type of houses which we intend to build, I

should  think the Singapore Improvement  Trust  will

probably build the type of houses that are now being

put  up  along Guillemard Road which, I  understand,

cost approximately between $4,000 and $5,000 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the revolving fund, I did say just now

that,  with a fund of $1 million, it is possible  to

build  200 houses a year. As a beginning, Sir,  this

will  be so, but as loans are being given and houses

are  being bought by wage-earners, I anticipate that

this  figure  will keep on increasing from  year  to

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a further point of information,

Sir. If  $1 million purchases 200 houses at  $5,000

each,  and they are bought by members of the public,

then  the following year the capital would not  have

come back to build



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



another  200  houses.  Could we  have  the  position

explained?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, the

position   is   this.  This  is  in   pursuance   of

Government's policy to give interest-free  loans  to

buy houses. We give the S.I.T. $1 million. It builds

200   houses.  It  sells  them  to  people  who   go

immediately  to  the Federal and  Colonial  Building

Society and say, "We want to buy a house for $5,000.

Will you loan us 90 per cent of it, which is $4,500?

Here  is $500." So the Society gives the $4,500 plus

the  $500  to  the purchaser. The purchaser  himself

remains  indebted  to the Society,  but  the  S.I.T.

(which  is  already building in the meanwhile)  gets

its $1 million immediately on sale and that pays for

the  next 200 houses which it resells. Have  I  made

myself clear, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As I understand it, Sir, $1

million is given to the S.I.T. The S.I.T. builds 200

houses  at $5,000 each. 200 people come and buy  the

houses  at $5,000 each. They each go across  to  the

Federal  and Colonial Building Society and put  $500

down.  Then  they get $4,500 from the Society  as  a

loan.  The $500 deposit plus the $4,500 is thereupon

sent  back to the S.I.T. which builds another house.

But  the  man  who goes to the Society  to  get  the

$4,500  will have to pay interest on the $4,500.  So

where is this interest-free house?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the loan is interest-free

to  the  S.I.T. to keep down the cost of the  house,

because if it costs $5,000 interest-free, then  plus

interest it may cost $5,500 or $6,000; so that  part

of  the additional cost, Sir, is borne by Government

by way of a hidden subsidy in that the loan is given

to  the S.I.T. free of charge. A man who has $5,000,

Sir,  can  then go to the S.I.T. and buy this  house

which has been built on a loan free of interest  and

at  a  cost  much lower or lower than it would  have

been  if the S.I.T. had to borrow money at four  per

cent  or  more,  as  it does now. Therein  lies  the

subsidy  from the Government - an interest - free  loan.

We cannot pursue it further at this stage,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



Sir, and try to make mortgages interest free!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hope the Chief Minister will

forgive  me,  but  do I understand  that  Government

assistance  in  this matter lies  in  financing  the

S.I.T. to put up houses and selling them at cost?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Without interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Without interest. Then let us

view  it from the purchaser's point of view. I want

to  buy one of these low-cost houses and I go  along

to  the  S.I.T. and say, "I have $5,000." The S.I.T.

say,  "Here  is  a house which has cost  us  $5,000,

including  the  land  on  99-year  lease  plus   the

building on it." In fact, the Government subsidy  is

to this extent: that for the period between the time

when  the S.I.T. has paid for the building, and  the

time  when it sells it and gets the money back  from

the Federal and Colonial Building Society, there  is

no interest charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not quite get the point, Sir. I do know one

party  that gets an advantage out of this, and  that

is   the  Federal  and  Colonial  Building  Society,

because  it  is  going  to do a  lot  of  profitable

business.  But from the buyer's point of view,  what

does he get out of the house which he could not have

got  from  a  good contractor? If we  did  not  have

building societies that were out to rook the public,

somebody  puts  up  a house worth $5,000  and  says,

"Here you are - $5,000 for it!"



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is it a question?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Oh, information!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I think we are getting

just a little beyond our depth. I would suggest that

the  hon.  Member makes his speech, puts his  point,

and perhaps the Minister will reply later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am at this disadvantage, Sir,

in that I am unable to criticise the scheme unless I

understand it. Of course, I am better informed  now.

At first I was under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



misapprehension that the Government was buying these

houses,  building 200 every year, and  selling  them

out  of this capital of $1 million. Now we have been

roughly  informed  how this thing  operates,  but  I

would  like to know what is the advantage. The Chief

Minister  has said that the advantage is that  there

is no interest charged to the S.I.T. As far as I can

see,  the  interest would run from  the  moment  the

building is completed and materials and labour  paid

for  until the moment when it is sold and the  money

obtained. Is that not a very short period of time?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Just once more, Sir, and if my

hon. Friend cannot understand it, I will leave it at

that.  The  subsidy  from  Government  is  two-fold.

First,  there is a normal subsidy to the  S.I.T. in

clearing  the  sites and giving certain  allocations

per acre in respect of all sites on which the S.I.T.

builds. That is the normal subsidy in respect of all

S.I.T. buildings.  But  the  second   subsidy   is

this - that  in the normal course, whether it  is  the

S.I.T. or a contractor, to start building,  capital

will  have  to be produced and that capital  carries

interest.  The  S.I.T. would, in the normal  course,

pay  interest at market rates, six per cent or more,

from  the  moment  it starts building - not  from  the

moment the building is finished - until it sells it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Sir, the loan is intended to

continue and we hope to give further loans, so  that

if  this experiment is a success, there will be more

than  200  houses built and sold to the public.  The

purchaser benefits from:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) absence of the additional cost of the charge

of interest from a normal contractor;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) absence from the profits of a normal

contractor; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the normal subsidy of Government to the S.I.T.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I have elucidation from the

Chief  Minister with reference to the normal subsidy

to the S.I.T.?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in the normal course, the

Singapore  Improvement Trust  building  schemes  are

subsidised in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



respect of all costs of preparing and laying  out  a

site  in  excess of $25,000 per acre.  I  understand

from the latest scheme that that subsidy amounts  to

some  $7  millions  out of the  total  cost  of  the

buildings of $21 millions or $23 millions. The  cost

of  lay-out is normally very considerable, but I  am

informed  by  my  colleague  that  I  am   under   a

misapprehension  about this and I do  apologise  and

wish to clarify it, Sir. It seems that where we  are

selling at cost under this scheme, there will be  no

subsidy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Who charges the cost of building?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We charge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

misunderstanding occurred because of the use of  the

phrase  "interest-free" by the  Chief  Minister.  In

this case, I do not think the idea of the public and

his  idea coincide at all. An interest-free loan  to

buy a house means that the purchaser gets it free of

interest; but this morning's exposition by the Chief

Minister would imply that only the interest on  that

million dollars which is sought to be loaned to the

S.I.T should be waived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind then, the advantages accruing to the

purchasers  of these low-cost houses are these:  the

saving  of  this interest; no profit by the  S.I.T.;

cheaper  construction by the S.I.T. because  of  the

facilities  they have and the big numbers  they  are

producing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to this motion, our Party welcomes this measure.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You are starting a loan society?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Keen Teck:</b> My motives are always subject to suspicion by the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not the only one!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> We have always advocated

housing  for  the lower income groups,  particularly

when  we  can  help  people who are  earning  a  few

hundred dollars a month to have a stake in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



country and free themselves from the restlessness of

certain  members whom the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

represents.  As long as four years ago, I  advocated

in the Press the sale of Singapore Improvement Trust

houses  and  flats  already  built  to  the  public,

because I pointed out that the requirement of 10,000

units per year, which would involve a commitment  of

$50 millions by Government, could not be undertaken;

and more so today in conjunction with the efforts we

are  trying  to  make to create more industries  and

give    better    working    conditions    to    the

underprivileged people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now see that people who are well off can

build their own houses; people with moderate incomes

are being provided for by the housing societies; and

it  is only those people in the low income group who

must  be  subsidised  to a certain  extent  by  this

Government.  Although it is a small  effort - it  will

only  involve 200 houses - nevertheless, it is a  very

welcome one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that has been worrying us is that

we   do  not  have  enough  information,  and   this

morning's debate clearly illustrates that possibly a

White  Paper  should have been produced before  this

House.  We  could have studied it and we could  have

saved  at  least ten minutes of our time  trying  to

find out what type of houses are being provided  for

and  under  what conditions they are to be  sold.  I

have  to  point out that we have to be very  careful

how  these  houses are going to be allocated.  There

are only 200 of them and there may be complaints  of

favouritism;  so  I  would advisedly  point  out  to

Government  that it is much better to  let  us  have

everything  clear-cut. As this is, to  my  mind,  an

extremely  urgent  matter, I  am  not  proposing  an

adjournment. I hope that this motion will be  passed

today so that we can straightaway go and dispose of

these 200 houses. But at a later stage, when another

loan  is  asked for, I do hope that all  the  points

will be given to us in a White Paper and we can then

study the whole question without having to spend  so

much time in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that raises a doubt in my mind is

the second part of the motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



which   asks  this  Assembly  to  "note   that   the

Government  proposes to guarantee repayment  of  one

half  of  that part of any loan made by the  Federal

and  Colonial Building Society, Ltd., in respect  of

any  such houses which exceeds 80 per cent but  does

not  exceed 90 per cent of the agreed valuation."  I

am  always averse to Government committing itself to

any guarantees, and it would appear that a guarantee

of  this  nature might also affect any other private

concern which would try to build for people in  this

income  group.  But  on  reflection,  I  feel  that,

because the amount involved and the risk incurred is

so  small, and the advantages that it would give  to

the  purchaser are so great, I am prepared to  waive

that  objection.  I  do hope that  the  Federal  and

Colonial  Building Society and other loan  societies

would take all this into consideration and give  the

same concession as they have agreed to do now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these thoughts, Sir, and so as not to delay

the lower income group from getting these houses  as

soon  as possible, I hope Members will approve  this

motion today, and I am quite confident that a  White

Paper  will  be  produced  in  the  future  for  our

guidance.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Sir, the Government indeed is to

be congratulated on this magnificent scheme which is

now   placed  before  the  House.  In  the  previous

Legislative  Council I have many a time argued  that

most  of  the people in Singapore do not  own  their

homes  and that it is highly desirable that  such  a

step  should be taken. I hope today that the  people

who  will be benefited by this scheme are the  wage-earners. These people have been paying rent all  the

time  and they have never had any incentive  to  own

their  own homes. I hope and believe that the  wage-earning  class of Singapore will take  advantage  of

this scheme and let the Government 'stump up' more and

more money for a scheme of this kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to comment on those aspects which

deal  with the Federal and Colonial Building Society

and  the  interest-free loan at this  time,  because

comments may be forthcoming after the first sale  of

these  houses built by the S.I.T. I hope  that  that

experiment will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



give  a lot of knowledge and experience to both  the

Government and the Singapore Improvement  Trust,  so

that  any  complaints arising out of the first  sale

will be corrected in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only sorry that this scheme has been delayed

a little bit by both the Singapore Improvement Trust

and  the  Government. As far as I am aware,  it  was

unavoidable.  There  was  no  intention  at  all  in

delaying  this scheme. Sir, I heartily endorse  this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we are

all  grateful  to the Government Ministers - three  of

them - for taking about half an hour to explain to  us

their scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It shows how clever you are!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am indebted to the Chief

Minister, Sir, for his complimentary remark. However

I   think  he  should  realise  by  now  that  I  am

impervious to silly criticism from those  for  whose

intellectual capacity I have the greatest wonderment

but no desire to emulate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are being told today is that a

mountain  has produced a mouse. We were  told,  once

upon a time, that this island was going to be turned

into a property-owning democracy and one of the ways

in  which the Government was going to do it  was  to

build  houses  and make everybody petty bourgeoisie.

Everybody was going to get a $5,000 house,  and  the

Government  was going to do it in a big way - interest

free. You buy as you pay your rent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it turns out that the two advantages that a

purchaser  gets from buying one of these  Government

subsidised houses, instead of buying somebody else's

house, is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That interest is not charged for the time in

which capital has been expended and before sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No profit is being made by the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the S.I.T. would compute in the

cost its administrative expenses? It would! So,  the

situation now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



is that the S.I.T. does not charge a profit for its

entrepreneuring effort. As I understand it from  the

Hon. the  Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing,  in  terms of dollars and cents,  it  would

amount  to  $500  to  $600. Sir, assuming  that  the

S.I.T. is an economical and efficient builder,  one

would, by buying an S.I.T.-built house, saves  about

$600 and the sort of profits which associates of the

Member  for  Serangoon in their building enterprises

would add on. But if the S.I.T. is not efficient and

competitive in costs, then it may well  be  that  no

advantage at all would be gained by buying an S.I.T.

house.  However, for the purposes of my argument,  I

will  assume that the S.I.T. is as efficient as  any

other  builder, perhaps even more efficient so  that

there   is   some  advantage.  On  that   basis,   I

congratulate the Government for working out a  very

cheap  scheme  which will help about 200  people  to

house  themselves each year, provided they are  able

to  earn  not  less than $400 a month.  I  have  not

worked it out mathematically, but, at a rough guess,

I  would say that a family must be prepared  to  pay

not less than $120 a month towards repayment of that

loan of $5,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be that this is one way to alleviate

the  housing  situation in the middle income  group,

but  it  is no more than a mockery of a solution  to

the   housing  problem.  We  were  told,   when   the

Government  took office, which they  were  going  to

investigate the problem of housing. They  said  they

fully  appreciated the tremendous  pressure  of  our

increasing population and the urgent need  to  clear

the  slums and build houses. We were told that there

would   be  a  Housing  Authority  to  replace   the

Improvement Trust. We were told that this was one of

the  important targets of the Labour Front. We  were

told  today by the Hon. the Financial Secretary that

building  by the S.I.T. for collection of rent  will

go  on  as  it  has always been going on.  Sir,  the

housing  problem  will never be solved  as  long  as

building  by the S.I.T. goes on in the  way  it  has

gone on over the past five, six or seven years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



and so long as the only innovation introduced by the

Government   is  a  property-owning   scheme   which

produces  200 houses for purchase on the  instalment

plan  via  the  good  services of  the  Federal  and

Colonial  Building Society. I need not elaborate  on

what  I  have  said  before when  I  criticised  the

Budget. I would only remind the Government that time

is  running out, and in the very near future it will

have to go back to the electorate and show results.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Let us do our own worrying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, if others did the worrying

of  the Chief Minister for him, and he were able  to

get rid of some of his worries, he would today be  a

much happier man.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What arrogance!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What humility. One feels that

perhaps  the Chief Minister is somewhat over-wrought

by  the difficulties confronting him. But if he does

not  put  his  back  to the wheel,  if  the  housing

problem is not solved, then his Government will fail

dismally. It has made grandiose promises. It has the

capacity to fulfil a great part of them. It has  the

power. It can raise taxation. But it threw away  $19

millions on tobacco. And all it can do is to produce

$1  million interest-free to help finance that  part

of the housing programme from building to sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support this motion because a drop in the ocean

is  better than none, but we would like to take this

opportunity  to remind the Government that  this  is

not  the  way  in which the housing problem  can  be

resolved.  Whilst  it may be possible  to  get  200,

maybe  300,  maybe  even  500  middle  income  group

workers to buy houses on the hire-purchase system  a

year,  that  is  not  the way in which  the  housing

problem can conceivably be resolved. The housing problem  is more acute in the lower income bracket.  It

is the man who earns $150 a month and who has got to

find  a  roof under which to live who must be looked

after. If the Labour Front Government does not  look

after him, then he will seek other governments whose

promises



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



he can trust. That may be one of the solutions. That

is  a  point  the  Chief Minister  does  not  really

understand, does not really appreciate. All he  says

periodically is - thank God we have not had it for the

last two days - "this lovely island of ours" - an island

full of slums, poverty and disease!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   P.A.P. has  a  now   well-established

reputation and capacity for reducing everything they

touch  to  a  condition  of slime.  This  is  not  a

Government scheme to meet the housing problem. It is

a  pilot scheme to attack one aspect. It is a  pilot

scheme  which,  even at its fullest  expansion,  can

touch but a small aspect of our housing problem, but

it  is  a step in the right direction in respect  of

that  aspect of the housing problem. It is  not  the

exclusive  remedy that Government is producing.  The

P.A.P. are  quite unable to let a right action  for

the  welfare of some part of our population go  past

unless  they  can take the credit for  it - that  same

credit  that the Member for Tanjong Pagar sought  to

take  this  morning in respect of  the  question  of

broadcasting  and television. Where he  cannot  take

the credit, Sir, he seeks to pour ridicule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us get the facts straight. This

scheme  is  not for those who can earn a minimum  of

$400  a  month.  It is for those who are  earning  a

maximum  of  $400.  There  is  a  distinction  which

neither  the Communists nor the P.A.P. are at  times

able to understand, but there is a distinction which

I hope other Members will understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the loan is not interest-free - just a few

dollars.  I  would like the House to recognise  this

fact - that this one million dollars is not  going  to

come  back to Government for a long, long time.  The

housing  problem, on that part, is going  to  remain

with  us  for decades. If this scheme is successful,

Sir,  other loans must and will follow in  order  to

encourage  the  purchase of  houses  by  this  group

earning  between $200 and $400 and  who  can  afford

this type of housing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



The  money  on  these loans is not  coming  back  to

Government,  and  each  year  Government  is  losing

interest on the money loaned out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> How much is it? The Chief

Minister: It is about 4� per cent on the open market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> $4,000, is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is P.A.P. arithmetic!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> $40,000 a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This will be every year, and

this  will  continue for years because  we  are  not

getting  back our money next year, nor in two  years

unless,  of  course,  by  a  special  resolution  in

Council  or  a  special decision of Government,  the

loan is recalled. This is a revolving loan which  is

going  to  remain with the S.I.T. and  is  going  to

remain free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim

Koon  Teck)  drew  attention to the  question  of  a

Government guarantee. I will confess that originally

I  did not care for it, but the point is this. There

are many people who are unable to afford $1,000 as a

deposit,  and this Building Society would  not  lend

more than 80 per cent. Nor would any Society that we

could  contact  lend more than 80 per  cent  of  the

valuation.  So, in order to encourage a larger  loan

to  facilitate purchase by those who are  unable  to

place a deposit of more than $500, we have agreed to

this  guarantee  which, as has been rightly  pointed

out,   Sir,  does  not  involve  us  in  an   unknown

liability. The liability as known is not excessive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice the jibe, Sir, that we are supporting one

private corporation. Again, Sir, I must confess that

I  was  not particularly happy, but when the factors

are   investigated  there  seems  to  be  no   other

organisation  prepared to give us  equal  or  better

facilities.  Nor is Government in a  position - it  is

not advisable at the present moment, but it could if

it  wanted to - to set up an organisation to deal with

these loans. It may be that if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



scheme is, in fact, as successful as we hope it will

be, then other steps will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come to this House in the last two

days  seeking to tackle, step by step,  our  housing

problem.  Yesterday, I think it was, my  friend  and

colleague  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and  Housing  indicated that we  were  reducing  the

interest  on  all loans to the Singapore Improvement

Trust. All loans, Sir, which at present carry  three

and  four per cent, we are reducing to two per cent.

It  will  cost us $1 million this year and  it  will

cost the country progressively more each year. Apart

from the question of the study at the present moment

of  special legislation in order to enable the  sale

of  S.I.T. flats and building to the public, so that

Government can carry out its own policy - and in  this

connection I am happy to note that we have at  least

the  Member  for Paya Lebar with us - we are  awaiting

the establishment of a Housing Authority which will,

we  hope,  be  an independent Authority,  with  full

Government financial support, in order to  implement

our  housing  plan which will be presented  to  this

House before it is introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the scheme

that  has  just been presented to this  House  is  a

timely  one.  In  Singapore,  Sir,  there  are  many

private  builders  but most of them  want  only  one

thing - and  that is profit. It is not profitable  for

private builders to build houses below $5,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Did you ask your friend about that?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> With this scheme, I would say

the advantage to the small man is that he is now not

asked  to stake a sum that he will never be able  to

save.  He will be able to get a house that is within

his  means. A worker, Sir, who earns a small sum  of

money  usually, finds that it is difficult to  save.

It  is  difficult for him to save money on his  own,

but with the arrangement of loans as set out, it  is

possible for him to do some sort of forced saving,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



such  as joining a "tontine". He puts aside  $30  or

$40 a month and, at the end, realises a large sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment, Sir, I hope, will be a good one

but  I know that there are many factors that may mar

its  success.  If we talk about people  in  the  low

income  group, there are many people  who  can  come

within  this  category. It would be  very  difficult

indeed  to  say who should or should  not  be  given

first  choice  of  a house. What I would  like  this

scheme  to  achieve is to see that it  benefits  the

people while at the same time we should not hear  of

too many complaints.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the main

attraction  of  my present job is  that  when  I  go

swimming in the political sea and appear to get into

difficulties, my colleagues are quick to organise  a

rescue  squad  to extricate me from my  predicament!

Sir,  I  now  find myself in the happy  position  of

having  had every question - very legitimate questions

I  think - put  in  the course of this debate  already

answered for me by my colleagues!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the allocation of

advances  to the Singapore Improvement Trust  up  to

but not exceeding the sum of one million dollars for

the purpose of erecting low-cost houses for sale  to

members of the public subject to such conditions  as

the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing

may from time to time impose; and that this Assembly

further  takes note that the Government proposes  to

guarantee repayment of one half of that part of  any

loan  made  by  the  Federal and  Colonial  Building

Society,  Ltd., in respect of any such houses  which

exceeds 80 per cent but does not exceed 90 per  cent

of  the agreed valuation of the property which forms

the security for such loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the First Report of the Select Committee on

Standing Orders, as contained in Sessional Paper No.

L.A.  13 of 1955, be adopted; and that the following

amendments be made to the Standing Orders -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Standing Order 61, new paragraph (6):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add new paragraph (6) as follows -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(6) There shall be a Committee to be known as the

Estimates Committee to consist of a Chairman to

be  appointed by the Speaker and not more  than

five  Members to be nominated by the  Committee

of  Selection,  as  soon as may  be  after  the

beginning  of each Session, in such  manner  as

shall  ensure  that so far as is  possible  the

balance   between   the  Government   and   the

Opposition in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>

Committee.  It  shall  be  the  duty   of   the

Committee  to  examine  any  of  the  Estimates

contained  in  the  Schedules of  Appropriation

Bills  and  financial motions, to  suggest  the

form in which Estimates might be presented, and

to  report what economies consistent  with  the

policy  implied  in  the  Estimates  might   be

effected."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Standing Order 69 (1), lines 3 and 4:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave out "on all the services of the Government" and

insert "out of the revenues and other funds  of

the Colony".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Standing Order 69 (2), line 3:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "seven" insert "clear".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Standing Order 69 (2), line 6:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "Speaker" insert "or Member presiding".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Standing Order 69 (11), line 1:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave out "the" and insert "any".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Standing Order 69 (11), lines 1 and 2:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave out from "question" to "debate" and

insert "in the Committee of Supply".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) New Standing Order 69A:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add new Standing Order as follows -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"69A.- (l) Whenever supplementary financial requirements

for  expenditure out of the revenues  and  other

funds  of  the  Colony become  necessary,  there

shall  be introduced into the Assembly a motion:

"That  this  Assembly resolves that the  sum  of

$... shall be supplied to the Government  under

the  heads  of expenditure and for the  services

specified   in   the   Schedule   contained   in

Sessional  Paper  No ...". At  least  five  clear

days'  notice shall be given of the introduction

of such motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upon the motion being proposed and

seconded, the same shall stand committed to  the

Committee of Supply to which the Schedule  shall

then also stand referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Assembly shall thereupon, without any

question  being  proposed, resolve  itself  into

Committee  and paragraphs (6) to (11)  inclusive

of   Standing  Order  69  shall  apply  to   the

consideration of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Schedule to the Motion shall be dealt

with before the Motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) At the conclusion of the consideration of

the  motion  and the Schedule in Committee,  the

Assembly  shall resume and the Member in  charge

shall  forthwith report that the motion and  the

Schedule  have been considered in Committee  and

agreed  to  (with  amendments).  Thereupon   the

question  on the motion (with amendments)  shall

be   put   and  decided  without  amendment   or

debate."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) Standing Order 70:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave out Standing Order 70 and insert new

Standing Order as follows -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"70.- (l) As soon as possible after

the  end  of each financial year there shall  be

introduced   into   the   Assembly    a    final

Appropriation  (No. 2) Bill which shall  include

such  supplementary  financial  requirements  as

may  have been agreed for the previous  year  in

accordance with Standing Order 69A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The debate on the motion for the second

reading  of  the Bill shall be confined  to  the

general  principles  of  Government  policy  and

administration  as indicated  in  the  Bill  and     Schedules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) When the Bill has been read a second time,

a  motion  for the third reading shall thereupon

be  made by a Minister. Such motion shall not be

required  to  be seconded and shall  be  decided

without amendment or debate."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Select Committee was appointed under Standing

Order   No.   63  for  the  purpose  of  considering

amendments  to  Standing  Orders.  It  devoted   its

attention,  in the first instance, to  the  Standing

Orders dealing with financial procedure. The Report,

which has been in the hands of hon. Members for some

months,  is  the  result of its  deliberations.  The

Standing  Orders concerning financial procedure,  as

originally  drafted, are not in all respects  suited

to   the   procedure  for  obtaining   supplementary

provision  which has been adopted  for  use  in  the

Assembly.  For  example, no provision  is  made  for

consideration of financial motions in  Committee  of

Supply,  which is an essential feature of the  House

of  Commons procedure. No specific provision is made

for  a  Final Supply Bill covering all money motions

which  have been debated in Committee and passed  by

the  Assembly.  Reference is made  to  Supplementary

Supply  Bills  which are unnecessary  if  additional

funds  are  obtained by motions and a  Final  Supply

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Standing Order 69A provides for the

consideration of money motions in the  Committee  of

Supply  and  new  Standing Order 70 provides  for  a

Final  Supply  Bill. The reference to  Supplementary

Supply Bills has been deleted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments to which attention should be

invited are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, five clear days' notice must now be given

of  a  money motion. Hitherto, only one day's notice

has been required under Standing Order 22 (3).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, provision is made for an Estimates

Committee  by  means of new Standing Order  61  (6).

This  again  follows the House of Commons procedure.

The  functions of this Committee will be to  examine

any  of the estimates contained in the Schedules  of

Appropriation  Bills  and  financial   motions,   to

suggest  the  form in which the estimates  might  be

presented,  and to report what economies  consistent

with  the policy outlined in the Estimates might  be

effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two other minor amendments. These

are  explained in the Appendices to the Report which

Members have in their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards Standing

Order 61, new paragraph (6):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Estimates Committee to consist of a Chairman

to  be  appointed by the Speaker and not  more  than

five Members",



<br><br>I  think  this  number is too small.  The  Estimates

Committee  deals with very important matters  and  I

consider that there should be at least seven or nine

Members  on  this  Committee. I would  prefer  nine.

There may be many matters which need the Committee's

consideration and I do not know how five Members can

conveniently reflect the position of the Parties, or

their  views  in  this Assembly. I  am  not,  for  a

moment, asking for representations for Independents;

nevertheless,  I  feel  that five  Members  are  not

enough.  If I am satisfied with the explanation  why

the  number  is fixed at five, I may  not  move  any

amendment, but if I consider that the explanation is

not  satisfactory,  I might move an  amendment  even

though I may not get a seconder.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move

the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (3) of

section  27  of  the  Women  and  Girls'  Protection

Ordinance (Chapter 33), resolves that the Women  and

Girls'   Protection   (Places  of  Safety-Amendment)

Rules, 1956, made on the 20th day of January,  1956,

and  published  as Notification  No.  S  27  in  the

Gazette Supplement No. 5 of the 26th January,  1956,

as  contained in Sessional Paper No. S.L. 6 of 1956

be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Overseas Chinese Creche was established

in 1952 and is serving as a residential nursery home

for  some 50 children under the age of six  who  are

homeless  or  have come from broken  or  undesirable

homes. The Director of this creche has hitherto been

very  cooperative  with  the  Department  of  Social

Welfare.  On many occasions, the creche has assisted

the  Department  greatly when accommodation  at  the

Girls'   Home  craft  Centre,  York  Hill,  or   the

Salvation Army Nursery Home were not available.  The

creche  has  received a per capita  grant  from  the

Government since 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By declaring the creche a place of safety, the

position is regularised in that it now comes legally

under   the   supervision  of  the  Social   Welfare

Department. Previously, no proper records were  kept

nor  were  case  histories kept. An officer  of  the

Social  Welfare Department can now see  to  it  that

this is done and so raise the standard. There is not

sufficient  Government accommodation for  all  these

cases  and  voluntary organisations  such  as  this,

properly supervised, can do a great deal to ease the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place of safety, Sir, is a place to which

destitute,     abandoned,     cruelly-treated     or

uncontrollable  children may be sent  for  care  and

protection. By gazetting this creche as a  place  of

safety,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



it  will then become one of the many homes to  which

children, falling under the provisions of the  Women

and Girls' Protection Ordinance and the Children and

Young Persons' Ordinance, could be referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Sir, I would ask that this

Assembly  approves  the Women and Girls'  Protection

(Places  of  Safety-Amendment)  Rules,  1956,  laid

before this House today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 174 of the

that    the    Labour   (Notes   of   Evidence-Fees)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Regulations referred to in this motion

lay  down  the  fees that shall be leviable  in  the

Office  of  the Commissioner for Labour  for  making

copies  of  notes  of  evidence recorded  under  the

provisions  of paragraph (d) of section 153  of  the

Labour  Ordinance,  1955.  Fees  have  always   been

charged  for  these under the old Labour  Ordinance.

Although  it is the Government's policy  to  provide

for the services of the Labour Court without charge,

it  is  considered that, in accordance  with  normal

judicial  procedure, fees should be paid  by  either

party  who  requires copies of notes of evidence  to

continue the case in the High Court should the party

concerned   disagree  with  the  decision   of   the

Commissioner for Labour. It is to be remembered that

it  takes  a considerable amount of time to  prepare

such  copies  from  the notes in the  Commissioner's case-book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is a straightforward case. The

increasing  congestion in the Singapore River  makes

it impossible for many of the motor sampans that ply

on the River to find a mooring place at night in the

authorised area, and therefore representations  were

made by the Motor Sampan Owners' Association to  the

Government  and, after investigation, it  was  found

possible to extend this area. Sir, the revised  Port

Regulations  are  now under consideration  but  that

will take some time, and since the motor sampans are

already  moored in the extended area it  is  thought

necessary to regularise the position by moving  this

motion. Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>NAVAL BASE - EVICTION AND PICKETING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 7th of

February,  I  wrote to the Hon. the  Chief  Minister

seeking the Governor's consent to this motion. In my

letter, I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I refer to the telephone conversation with you

this  morning at noon when you informed me that  the

Governor's  consent had been refused for the  motion

criticising the Naval Base Authorities."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the House was asked to pass the Protected

Areas and Places Ordinance, I drew attention to  the

danger  of  abuse of the powers conferred  by  this.

Ordinance -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I think the hon.

Member  will  only be in order if  he,  in  passing,

indicates  whether  or  not  he  has  received   the

Governor's recommendation or consent. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> On a point of order, Sir. My

understanding of Standing Order 33 (2)  is  that  in

relation  to  motions of this kind, the  consent  or

recommendation of the Governor must be signified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



by  a Minister. My recollection of a precedent which

we  have  had  before  in this  House  is  that  the

withholding  of that recommendation or consent  must

also  be  signified by a Minister. I had understood,

Sir,  that that was the procedure. That is my  point

of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am perfectly aware of that Standing

Order,  Mr  Attorney-General. I think we  have  not

reached the point where the objection can be  taken.

The  motion  itself has not been  presented  to  the

Assembly. It is just a notice of a motion, and until

it  is proposed, it does not become a motion of  the

Assembly. The position, as far as I see it, is  that

any Member can move a motion simipliciter. Then,  if

he  is  met  with  this objection  which  cannot  be

overcome,  the Assembly shall not, as  the  Standing

Order  says,  proceed with the motion.  That  is  my

ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Am I to understand, Sir, that your

ruling  is  that the motion is to be formally  moved

and  it  is only thereafter that the Standing  Order

applies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was reading

the  letter  which  I wrote to the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister on 7th February asking him to approach  His

Excellency  the  Governor for his recommendation  or

consent  in order that this motion can be  proceeded

with.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

it   appropriate  that  a  communication   of   that

character,  and any reply received  which  is  of  a

personal   character,  should  be   raised   without

permission?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already pointed out to the

hon.  Member that all he can do is to indicate  that

this  recommendation was sought but it has not  been

granted.  That  is all. I do not want  to  know  any

other  points  that might have been  raised  in  the

correspondence between the hon. Member and the Chief

Minister. It does not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Since the House is determined

that I shall have no chance to make any reference in

passing  other than to the fact that I  have  sought

the Hon. the Chief Minister's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



help  to  get this consent, may I say, Sir,  that  I

have  never received a reply to this letter  of  the

7th  of  February? I have indicated to the Hon. the

Chief  Minister in the strongest possible terms  the

importance  of  this motion being  debated.  I  have

received  no reply. I shall therefore formally  move

my  motion  and  leave  it to  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  to indicate to the House what the position

is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

The  Member for Tanjong Pagar wrote to me and I have

replied  to  him saying that I have  spoken  to  His

Excellency  and His Excellency regrets  that  he  is

unable to give his consent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the last

communication between the Government and myself  was

this  letter to the Hon. the Chief Minister to which

I  have  received  no  reply.  However,  may  I  now

formally move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the action of the Naval

Authorities  (1) in forcibly evicting  two  workers'

families residing in quarters in the Naval Base  and

(2)   in   using  the  Protected  Areas  and  Places

Ordinance to prohibit and prevent picketing  by  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Governor

has  signified  his  consent in order  to  enable  a

debate to take place on this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hurrah!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, this Bill was introduced

some  two months ago. At that time, there were  some

misgivings  as to what our attitude was. Today,  the

Second  Reading  of  this Bill  coincides  with  the

emergence  of the new Liberal-Socialist  Party,  and

the  first act of this Party is to introduce a piece

of  social  legislation that will be good  for  all,

especially so for the clerical people and  the  shop

assistants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will have seen in the explanatory note,

this  Bill is intended to protect a large number  of

employees who find it difficult to come together  to

carry  out collective bargaining with a large number

of  employers in various trades and industries.  The

largest  section  of these workers comes  under  the

definition  of shop employees. As hon.  Members  are

themselves aware, Singapore is a city of many shops.

You  find them more highly concentrated in the city,

but even in the remote areas you do find many shops.

Born  and bred in Singapore, and constantly  rubbing

shoulders  with  the common man in the  city - I  have

many friends working as clerks and shop assistants - I

see  how they work, the opportunities given to  them

to  rest  and  play, and also the remuneration  they

receive for their employment. By and large, I should

say,  shopkeepers do keep a large  number  of  their

shop assistants contented. But there is a section of

employers, by whatever name we may define them,  who

are  really  slave-drivers, and  they  extract  from

their  employees the fullest amount of work  that  a

human  being  can afford to give without  injury  to

health.  It is within my knowledge, Sir,  that  some

shop  assistants wake up as early as six o'clock  in

the morning and they start working and they are kept

working until about eleven or twelve o'clock in  the

night. I believe, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



that this sort of treatment is not the best that  we

can  accord to a fellow human being. I believe  that

no  one  inside this Assembly House or outside  this

House  will  disagree with me when I say  that  shop

assistants are not machines. They are just like  you

and  me.  They  must work for their  living,  but  I

believe  also  that they should be given  sufficient

time  to  relax and sufficient time to recoup  their

lost energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the clerks, generally speaking, is not

as  bad as that of the shop assistants, except  that

there are proprietors who will make a clerk do  more

than  his  fair share of work. In quite a number  of

instances, I know that clerks do carry home a lot of

work  to do. Sometimes they have to carry on working

in the shop itself until very late at night. Most of

them  are accounts clerks and correspondence clerks.

As  to ventilation and place of work, you will  find

that the shop assistants usually work either in  the

front  of  the  shop  or  in the  backyard.  Clerks,

however,  are  usually given a desk in  one  obscure

corner  that  is least useful to business.  In  that

sort  of a place, you will usually find insufficient

lighting  and  ventilation. Perhaps a few  of  these

employers try to improve those conditions and put in

a dingy lamp or a little fan, but this will not help

to cool the place or change the air sufficiently for

the  clerks to work in healthy surroundings. I  need

not  say it too often, but I know that it is  within

your  knowledge that clerks and shop  employees  are

not  having an easy life. They are employed in small

numbers.  One shop may probably employ two or  three

shop  assistants.  Some may  even  employ  just  one

assistant  and  because the shop assistants  are  so

disunited and because it is so hard for them to  get

together,   it  is  difficult  for  them   to   make

justifiable   demands - demands  for  better   working

conditions or better wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore the duty of every Assemblyman here

to   help   them  to  get  a  square  deal   through

legislation.  I  have come into  contact  with  many

employers.  In fact, some employers have written  to

me.  I am very happy to say that the employers today

are  not  the employers of yesterday. Most  of  them

agree that more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



favourable conditions should be established. Many of

them  have  gone through my Bill, and,  after  that,

have  written to me saying that it is in  line  with

what they would like to see done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, aims at giving every shop and

clerical  employee  a total of fourteen  consecutive

paid  holidays  for  one year's  work.  This  is  in

addition  to  the weekly holidays.  There  might  be

cases,  Sir, where an employer may want to employ  a

clerk  for  eleven months and, after that,  dispense

with  his services. In this Bill, Sir, we have  made

provision  that,  if that should be  the  case,  the

employee  will still be entitled to one  day's  paid

holiday for every month of service he has given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important part of the Bill, Sir, aims at

giving  maximum protection to a worker in the matter

of hours of work. It advocates that a shop assistant

can  only be asked to work up to a maximum of  eight

hours  a  day  or forty-five hours  a  week;  for  a

clerical  worker, seven hours a day  or  thirty-nine

hours  a  week. Good employers have already observed

these  conditions  for a very  long  time.  This  is

nothing new to people who are considerate, but  what

we  do  want here is for other employers  to  follow

that  good  lead. The case that I am  talking  about

applies,  Sir,  especially to  clerical  workers.  I

believe  that  all  employers  and  those  who  have

contacted  me  and written to me will  support  this

Bill wholeheartedly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember that we had in the past a

measure  called the Weekly Holidays Ordinance.  When

it  was  enforced,  proprietors  feared  that  their

businesses would be adversely affected. They thought

probably  they  would  lose  one-seventh  of   their

business  in a week. However, when that Bill  became

law,  businessmen  soon discovered  that  they  were

continuing to do the same volume of business in  six

days   instead   of  seven.  Even  many   of   those

proprietors who can keep their shops open for  seven

days  a  week are also following that lead and  they

set  aside  one  day  as a holiday.  In  fact,  Sir,

customers  are already aware that Sunday is  a  rest

day  and  they do their buying during the other  six

days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, today we find our shops opening

from six o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock

at night. We find that the shop assistants will have

to wake up early, attend to the customers during the

first  few  rush hours up to about ten o'clock,  and

after that, we find that they are just made to  hang

around the shop doing nothing but wait for the  next

rush  period  at one o'clock. Thereafter,  there  is

another  lax period, and another wait for  the  next

rush  period. Later on in the night, you  will  find

that  the shop is open to a few stragglers who  will

come to buy their goods at the latest hour possible.

If   this  Bill  should  become  law,  Sir,  and  if

shopkeepers  can regulate their hours and  make  the

workers work in shifts, I envisage that business can

probably  start at about eight o'clock  and  end  at

about  six  o'clock in the evening.  This  will  not

adversely affect business. I believe the result will

be  the same as that achieved by the Weekly Holidays

Ordinance  and that people will learn to  buy  their

things early before the shop closes. Instead of  the

shop  waiting for the customer, it will be the  case

of the customer knowing when to buy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now turn to another very important part of the

Bill  which affects wages. Now, we may have a  large

number of workers doing the same type of work but in

different shops. Some of the workers are paid  more.

Some of them are paid less. Some are paid even lower

than  what  they should get. Now there  is  a  great

difference of pay and many workers are dissatisfied,

but  the  present set-up is such that  if  they  are

dissatisfied  with their pay, the  only  alternative

they have is to resign from their jobs. We know,  of

course,  that this weapon cannot be used by many  of

the  shop assistants and therefore legislation  must

be  brought about to help them. We would like,  Sir,

to  see  that a worker be paid a minimum  wage.  The

minimum wage is not to be determined by the employer

or  the  employee. We believe, Sir, that  there  are

many people in this world who have a conscience, and

we  believe that, if one side will give to the other

side  what it hopes the other side will give to  it,

then  this world will be a better world. We  do  not

believe  that  the  workers' best solution  to  have

their demands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



met  is the strike weapon. We believe that the  best

weapon should be negotiation. We believe that if the

workers  can band themselves together, say, a  small

number  of  workers  in  one  whole  street  banding

themselves  together  and  negotiating  with   their

employers, come to an agreement among themselves and

then bring their case to the Labour Department, much

waste  of  time and dissatisfaction will be avoided.

Here,  I  am  talking about how  they  arrive  at  a

minimum  wage. They arrive at that minimum  wage  by

negotiation  first and after that have it  confirmed

with the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about minimum wage, Sir, I would like

this  House to know that there are many in Singapore

who  would  want  to make the workers  misunderstand

what  is actually a minimum wage. They are, in fact,

spreading  rumours  round - and they  are  mischievous

rumours  too - that the minimum wage is  actually  the

highest  wage they should get, or they will get,  if

this  Bill  goes through. I know that  we,  who  are

sitting  here  in  this Assembly,  know  what  is  a

minimum  wage but I would like the workers at  large

to  know that if we fix a minimum wage of say  $150,

then  an employer cannot pay a worker less than that

sum but may pay him, say, a sum like $200 or $250 or

anything  that is higher. I say this, Sir,  for  the

benefit  of  many people outside this  Assembly  who

cannot understand what is a minimum wage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, the provision is centred on co-operation between worker and employer, but in many

cases  there  may  not  be full  agreement  on  this

subject  and things may come to a deadlock. In  this

case,  Sir,  we  have the Tribunal coming  into  the

picture  where both sides are represented  by  equal

numbers  and  another  equal number  of  independent

people  sitting on that Tribunal to  find  out  what

should  be  the  most  equitable  wage.  Once   that

determination is reached and signed by the Minister,

it  will then be fixed. However, Sir, in many cases,

we  do  find that determinations, whether  they  are

arrived at by negotiation or by the findings of  the

Tribunal, leave things that are much to be  desired.

In all probability, one side of it is discontented,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



and  we do not feel that it is good to tie any party

down.  Hence,  provision is also made in  this  Bill

that  a  determination can also be revoked  if  both

sides  agree  to it, or if one side is dissatisfied,

but  if they revoke it and it comes to the Tribunal,

then the Tribunal will fix

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a matter of wage disputes, we do find that we

have  a  big  class  of people  whom  we  call  shop

assistants but we must also understand that although

there  are shops in the city and shops in the  rural

areas doing the same type of business, yet one  type

may  be doing better business, having a busier time,

and  the  other  type  may not  be  as  busy  or  as

prosperous. Therefore, to draw a hard line and  make

this  determination binding on all classes of people

or on all shops is not quite right. In this Bill, we

have  made provision that a small area may be  taken

into  account or a certain type of business  may  be

classified   together  for  such  purposes   for   a

determination to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of this Bill - clause 4 - is also

important.  This clause provides that all  employees

who  are  employed  on contract or agreement  before

this Bill becomes law, and whose terms are even more

favourable  than those provided for,  shall  not  be

deprived  of  such  benefits but shall  continue  to

enjoy such advantages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my intention, Sir, that this Bill should be

committed to a Select Committee of the House  before

it  comes up for the Third Reading. Contrary to  the

opinion  expressed by some Members in this  Assembly

that  we  have the cooperation of the Government  in

drafting  this Bill, we say, "No, we have done  this

all  on  our  own. We have done our  best."  But  we

believe,   Sir,  that  this  Bill  can  be   further

improved. We know that there are many people  inside

this Assembly as well as outside it who can give  us

valuable assistance. We do not say that what we  say

must  be  right, but we say, "We will take  what  is

best  from  everybody and incorporate what  is  most

practicable and what is most useful for the  workers

in  Singapore."  I have noted, too,  that  Sessional

Paper  No. Cmd. 11 of 1956 has been published giving

the Government's version of what the Shop and Office

Employees Bill should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



like.  I  feel,  Sir, that if this  Bill  goes  into

Committee, the good ideas that are in this Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 11 may also be incorporated into this

Bill.  Further, Sir, before I conclude, I would  say

that  we are grateful to the Hon. the Chief Minister

for  expressing his intention to co-operate with  us

on  this Bill when I move it for the assent of  this

Assembly. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rousing

cry  of  the Member for Serangoon for social justice

for  clerical  workers  and shop  assistants  is,  I

respectfully  submit, an echo of what  I  have  been

saying  for  years  and  years  in  the  Legislative

Council and is an echo of what I have been saying in

the  trade union field and of what I have said since

I became the Minister for Labour and Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved the Second Reading of the Labour

Bill,  now the Labour Ordinance, 1955, at  our  June

meeting last year, I did make mention that I had not

lost   sight   of,  and  would  introduce,   further

legislation  to  ensure  that  shop  assistants  and

clerical   workers  should  also   be   given   fair

conditions of employment. Even in the discussions in

the  Select  Committee on the Labour  Bill,  Sir,  I

reiterated  my intention to introduce  such  further

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our October sitting last year, Sir, when the

Member  for  Serangoon sought leave to  introduce  a

Bill governing the conditions of employment and  the

rights   and   privileges  of  clerical   and   shop

assistants,  I drew the attention of this  House  to

the reasons for the delay in introducing my proposed

Bill. I said that I was awaiting the passage of  the

Labour   Bill  which  was  committed  to  a   Select

Committee  and  that  I  had  been  confronted  with

difficulties  over  the  scope  and  extent  of  the

proposed  legislation. However, Sir,  the  Hon. the

Chief Minister at that sitting said, inter alia, and

I quote from column 815 of the Official Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am so happy to see hon. Members opposite taking

their responsibilities seriously that the Government

will  support this motion and will permit this  Bill

to be placed before the House; and I trust that when

we  produce  our  own,  we will  co-operate  on  the

ultimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



Bill to be discussed by this Assembly. "



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill was introduced by the Member for

Serangoon  last  November, and when  printed  copies

were  available, I made a very careful  and  lengthy

study  of it and I have come to the conclusion  that

the provisions in the Bill are not practicable under

local conditions. However, Sir, as the principle  of

the  Bill is to give legislative protection to  shop

assistants  and clerical workers - which principle  is

in  line  with the Labour policy of the Government - I

will  not  oppose the Second Reading, especially  as

the mover has stated in his speech just now that  it

is  his  intention to co-operate with the Government

when the Bill is referred to a Select Committee  and

to co-operate on the ultimate results. But I do wish

to stress, Sir, that other than the principle of the

Bill,  the  Government cannot accept the  provisions

contained therein, which, I repeat, in my view,  are

impracticable under local conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Sir, to draw the attention of

this  House to Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 11 of  1956.

This  lays  down the Labour policy of the Government

and  includes,  as  an annexure,  a  draft  Bill  to

regulate the conditions of employment of clerks  and

shop   assistants.  This  Bill   would   have   been

introduced  by me in this Assembly had it  not  been

for  Government support of the motion of the  Member

for Serangoon when he sought permission to introduce

his  Bill, which is now receiving its Second Reading

today.  Referring  to Cmd. Paper No.  11.  Sir,  and

arising  out  of the remark made by the  Member  for

Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) yesterday in the debate

on multi-lingualism, may I draw his attention to the

fact  that  the Bill, which is an annexure  to  this

Report  and  which  he has been preaching  with  all

enthusiasm, is a Government Bill and not the Bill of

the Member for Serangoon?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now, Sir, make a comparison on general

lines  between the Bill of the Member for  Serangoon

and  the annexure to Cmd. Paper No. 11, and for ease

of  comparison in my speech I will name them as  the

Member's Bill and the Government's Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, the Liberal-Socialist Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Government's Bill, Sir, is

based on the Labour Ordinance which, although it has

been recently consolidated and amended, has been  in

force  for  many  years. The Labour  Department  has

therefore considerable experience of the problems of

administering this type of legislation. Considerable

expansion   of   the  Labour  Department   will   be

necessary,  but this is inevitable if a  department,

which  has previously looked after the interests  of

only  one section of the working population, is  now

to  extend its activities to cover almost the entire

working  population. The Member for Serangoon,  Sir,

in  his speech just now said that he did not discuss

the drafting of his Bill with the Government. He did

it  all  on  his  own. May I respectfully  draw  the

attention of this House, Sir, to the fact  that  the

Member's  Bill  is taken from the  Ceylon  Shop  and

Office   Employees  Regulation  of  Employment   and

Remuneration  Act, 1954? It contains 38  clauses  as

against 72 in the Ceylon Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Send it to Sir John Kotelawala!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> These 38 clauses, Sir, are, in

the  main, taken word for word from the Ceylon  Act.

Its provisions make it necessary for the Minister to

bring  the various parts of the Ordinance into force

by Order, and every such Order must be approved by a

resolution  of  the  Legislative  Assembly.  It   is

certain,  Sir, that the Minister will be  subject  to

continuous pressure until Orders have been  made  to

cover  all  shops and all offices in  all  areas  of

Singapore, and it therefore seems simpler  to  apply

the  provisions of such a Bill to all shops and  all

offices  in  the first place, as in the Government's Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, the Government's Bill regulates

contracts  of  service,  lays  down  conditions   of

payment  of  wages and limits the type of deductions

which  may be made from wages. None of these  points

is  covered in the Member's Bill, and in the case of

shop  assistants  at  least,  who  are  seldom  paid

regularly and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



in   full,  they  are  very,  very  necessary.   The

Government's  Bill provides for paid holidays,  paid

annual  leave,  paid sick leave and overtime  rates,

and  fixes  the  number of hours of  work  per  week

beyond  which  overtime must be paid.  The  Member's

Bill  provides for regulations to be made  regarding

overtime  but  does  not  provide  for  paid  public

holidays or paid sick leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Bills, Sir, prescribe certain registers to be

kept by the employers and give powers of inspection.

Clerks  and  shop  assistants are given,  under  the

Government's  Bill, the right to have  their  claims

heard in the Labour Court in the same way as workmen

under  the Labour Ordinance, 1955, but no such right

is  given  under the Member's Bill. The Government's

Bill makes it an offence for contracts of service to

restrict the right of employees to join, participate

in  or  organise trade unions. No such provision  is

made in the Member's Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's Bill, Sir, limits the scope of

the  interpretation of a clerk to a person  employed

in  or  about the business of an office whose  wages

are  not  more than $400 or such other  sum  as  the

Minister may from time to time declare, but does not

include persons employed in positions of management,

or  workmen or domestic servants already covered  by

the  Labour Ordinance, 1955, or any class of persons

which the Minister may from time to time declare not

to  be classed for the purposes of the Ordinance. It

also  limits  the scope of the interpretation  of  a

shop assistant to a person employed in or about  the

business  of a shop otherwise than in an  office  or

clerical  department, or in a position of management

with  the  same wage limit as a clerk. The  Member's

Bill, Sir, does not provide for such limitation. The

interpretation  is all-embracing. A  clerk  means  a

person  employed  in  or about the  business  of  an

office,  and  a  shop assistant is a person  who  is

employed  in or about the business of a shop.  This,

in effect, means, Sir, that the manual worker, right

up  to  the manager or even the managing partner  in

any office or shop, will be covered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



by  this Bill. It also ignores the fact that a  good

number  of workmen within the meaning of the  Labour

Ordinance,  1955, who are employed  in  offices  and

shops,  are  already covered by such  an  Ordinance.

This  particular aspect of the Member's  Bill,  Sir,

has  been  attacked, and attacked very strongly,  by

the  Singapore Employers Federation.  I  bring  this

out,  Sir, because the Member for Serangoon did  say

that  he  did  receive  praise  from  employers   in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Those are his friends!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Government is opposed

to  Part  III  of the Member's Bill and  will  seek,

through  its Members on the Select Committee  to  be

appointed,  to have this Part rejected. I  will  now

explain  the  Government's objection. This  Part  is

concerned with the regulation of remuneration.  This

again is done by order of the Minister. In the first

place,  it  directs the Commissioner for  Labour  to

endeavour   to   determine  the  minimum   rate   of

remuneration. The determination of the  Commissioner

for  Labour shall not be made applicable to any shop

or  office unless the consent of the employer and of

the  employee  has  been obtained.  The  chances  of

agreement seem slight. It is therefore, Sir, on  the

Remuneration  Tribunal, to which  the  Minister  may

refer any case when the Commissioner for Labour  has

not  been able to make a determination with  consent

that most of the work of regulating wages will fall.

The Tribunal makes the draft determination which  is

published in the Gazette and objection may  be  made

in  writing to any determination. The Tribunal  then

confirms with or without amendment its determination

which, once it receives the Minister's approval,  is

published  in the Gazette, and then it  comes  into

force.  There is little doubt that there will  be  a

lot  of  applications from unorganised  workers  for

determinations to be made regulating wages in  shops

and  offices, and it will certainly take  years  and

years before all can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



settled  and  decided.  In  the  case  of  organised

workers,  however, the trade unions  will  certainly

prefer  to  seek improved wages through negotiations

as a more effective and a more satisfying method. It

seems preferable, Sir, to wait for the Report of the

Commission  on  the Minimum Standards of  Livelihood

rather  than  to start regulating wages for  certain

groups  in a piecemeal fashion such as this. In  any

case,  Sir,  the Remuneration Tribunal seems  to  be

similar to a Wages Council which can be set up under

the  Wages  Councils  Ordinance,  1953.  Under  that

Ordinance, a Wages Council can be appointed for  any

class  of  shops  or  offices in  which  it  may  be

considered  that it is desirable to  regulate  wages

and conditions of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Member's Bill, Sir, provides for

closing  orders which may be made by  the  Minister.

Such  orders  are  going to  be  very  difficult  to

enforce owing to the construction of Singapore shops

which  are  often dwelling homes and  owing  to  the

habits of the public. A large inspectorate would  be

necessary  for  this purpose and this would  involve

Government in much expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still evasion of the Weekly Holidays

Ordinance, 1949, referred to just now by the  Member

for  Serangoon, in spite of frequent checks  by  the

Labour   inspectorate.  An  enforcement  of  closing

orders  would be still more difficult to carry  out.

This Part of the Bill, Sir, is just an expansion  of

the  method  of  application of the Weekly  Holidays

Ordinance, 1949.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's Bill, which gives shop assistants

and  office  workers a civil right to overtime,  has

the  virtue of simplicity. Enforcement of this  Part

of  the  Bill will, in most cases, be done  by  shop

assistants  and  clerks themselves by  laying  their

complaints  before  the Labour  Court.  Although  an

increase  in the staff of the Labour Court  will  be

necessary, the Government's Bill would be much  less

costly  to  enforce than that of the Member's  Bill,

apart   from   another  important  factor   of   the

practicability of enforcement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to adopt legislation from another country

without  conducting enquiries regarding its efficacy

there  would  be the highest folly. Ceylon  has  had

legislation  providing for closing orders  for  many

years  before the 1954 Act, and in his  1950  Report

the  Commissioner for Labour in Ceylon  stated  that

there was an almost complete lack of co-operation on

the  part of shop employees who feared reprisals  by

employers and that shop legislation was regarded  as

nuisance legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have written to the Ceylon Commissioner

for  Labour  and we have received his reply  to  our

questionnaire,  and this reply, Sir, strengthens  my

view  that the provisions of the Member's  Bill  are

not practicable under local conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

congratulate  the  Minister for  Labour  for  having

corrected  a  political mistake  made  by  his  hon.

Leader.  Some  months ago, his hon.  Leader  decided

that  it  would  be a good thing if  the  Opposition

started to help them to govern, and he welcomed with

open  arms the possibility of having legislation  of

this nature introduced by the Opposition. I hope the

Opposition today has learnt that its job is  not  to

introduce  legislation of this nature which  only  a

government with the apparatus of state is  competent

to  formulate, and that it should confine itself  to

constructive criticism.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Constructive?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all agree

with  the  principle  of the Bill.  The  Progressive

Party says, "We have done it and we want the kudos."

Says  the  Minister for Labour, "We agree  with  the

principle of the Bill. The Member for Serangoon  has

not  done it well and it is all wrong. We are  going

to  do it." Says the P.A.P., "Let us get on with the

job.  Send it to the Select Committee and,  if  need

be, the P.A.P. will be there to assist you."



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> From the contributions made in

the  past  two  days by the P.A.P.,  Sir, the  Lord

preserve us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



from  their  assistance! All that I can remember  in

two  long  days is nothing but destructive criticism

with nothing constructive at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are dealing with the conditions of

livelihood  of a humble, loyal and timid section  of

the  population - a  section  that  has  never  pushed

itself  upon the public and that would take what  is

given - and  it  is therefore all the  more  necessary

that there should, in all sincerity, be genuine  co-operation  in this matter. When Government  received

the Bill, Sir, perhaps you will remember - I think  it

was   in  November  last - that  in  happily  granting

consent  for the motion of the Member for  Serangoon

to  introduce  this  Bill, I  did  indicate  to  the

Assembly that Government had on the stocks a similar

Bill  and that we would appreciate co-operation  with

the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, having studied the Member's Bill, we

believe - and this is not because it has been borrowed

from  a  neighbouring territory, because  we  freely

confess  that ours is a compendium wherein  we  also

borrow     from    a    number    of    Commonwealth

territories - from  the  experience  of   the   Labour

Department,  that the Bill submitted  to  you  under

this  White  Paper  in  one that  better  meets  the

conditions  in this country. The Bill introduced  by

the  Member for Serangoon, as has been pointed  out,

is  only  part of the Ceylon Act. It does not  cover

the  field  if one would only look at the number  of

parts covered by the Government Bill; but I rise  to

say  this, Sir, that, in the normal course, it would

have  been the duty of Government to oppose the Bill

because  of  its very grave inadequacies.  We  would

have  done  so,  Sir,  but for  this  fact - that  our

Standing  Orders provide that if a Bill is rejected,

no  Bill  of a similar character embodying the  same

principle  may  be introduced in the  Assembly,  not

merely  during that sitting but during that session,

so  that if we were to reject this Bill we would  be

in  the unhappy position of having to wait until the

next  session, if any, because you are  aware,  Sir,

that  the  life of this Government and the existence

of  parliamentary democracy is in the  balance  next

May, and we would not wish to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



delay and perhaps defer indefinitely. So we are,  as

a  Government, with a whiff of life supporting  this

Bill but I do not wish the House to be misled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the mover of this Bill, the

Member  for Serangoon, is content to send  it  to  a

Select Committee and to take into consideration  the

Government White Paper, which is an excellent  idea.

But  I trust that it is clearly understood that,  on

the  Third Reading, if any matter passes through the

Select Committee which is not acceptable to us,  the

Government is free to take up the issue as though it

is   on   the  Second  Reading.  It  is  an  unusual

procedure, Sir, but it is permissible, and in  order

not to mislead this Assembly I rise to make it clear

that  we  are  happy  to  support  the  Member   for

Serangoon because we want, as I know he wants, early

legislation  controlling the  living  conditions  of

these humble workers. The details, I am hopeful,  in

fact  I  believe, can be amicably worked out in  the

Select Committee, particularly if my hon. Friend the

Member for Serangoon is a Member, where matters  can

be   explained   in   detail   by   the   respective

professional  officials. It may well be  that  there

will be no trouble with the Bill, but I think it  is

right  that it should be understood that our support

at   this   juncture  does  not  preclude  us   from

criticising  any  aspects at a later  stage,  if  we

consider necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I have no

quarrel  with  the  principle of having  a  Bill  to

protect the interests of office and shop workers,  I

shall  be  doing a great disservice to a very  large

number of my electorate if I do not remind the  hon.

Member, who moved this motion, that he has forgotten

a  very  large  number  of workers  in  the  Service

departments in Singapore. It is a retrograde step to

have omitted them in the hon. Member's Bill and I do

not  think that there is any provision at  all  made

where  the  office workers can be  included  in  the

interpretation clause in the Member's Bill.  Sir,  I

think  I  should  point this  out  because  the  new

Liberal-Socialist Party has some supporters  in  the

Service departments and it is for me now to champion

their  cause  by  pointing  out  to  the  mover  his

omission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that the Select Committee would be

wasting  a lot of time if the Bill, as presented  by

the hon. Member, were to be discussed in detail.  At

the   same  time,  I  am  very  surprised   at   the

Government's agreement to send this Bill to a Select

Committee, because the Hon. the Minister for  Labour

and   Welfare  himself  has  opposed  many  of   the

principles in this Bill. I cannot find the logic  of

his  agreement  for this Bill to be  referred  to  a

Select Committee. I think the hon. Member's Bill  is

beyond  repair and although I feel that there should

be  some  sort of legislation along these  lines,  I

shall  not  vote for it to be referred to  a  Select

Committee because there are many things involved  in

this  Bill which we will never be able to  do  in  a

Select  Committee.  We  should  have  another   Bill

introduced in the way that we want and in detail, so

that  we  will  be able to sit around and  talk  the

matter  over.  I do not regard this  Bill,  Sir,  as

serving  any useful purpose by having it  considered

in  a  Select Committee, and I do say this with  all

honesty and sincerity.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> But then, we cannot have it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim Choon Mong, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems

that the Government side has said that this Bill  is

not  adequate  and  that  it  falls  short  in  many

respects. I would like to inform the House, Sir, that

before this Bill was prepared, a public meeting  was

held  in  the Badminton Hall and we invited everyone

who  felt that he wanted to improve the lot  of  the

shop  assistants  or the clerks to that  meeting  to

make  his  contribution. We have  proposed  what  we

think should be the minimum that would be asked  for

the  clerks  and the shop assistants.  We  are  only

making a start with this Bill. We do not say that it

will  cover  everything but the minimum requirements

that  we propose therein were passed unanimously  at

that  meeting. That does show some support  for  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one of the Members here did say that it is a

mistake  for the Opposition to put up such  a  Bill,

that  we  should not co-operate with the Government,

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



that  we  should keep on criticising it. We  do  not

believe  in  such views. We believe that  we  should

only  criticise  Government if  they  go  wrong.  We

believe  that  if  we  can make a  contribution,  we

should make that contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are aware, Sir, that we have not the machinery

at   our   command   to  make  all   this   detailed

legislation, but we have done our very best. We  did

not  claim,  at the Second Reading, that  it  was  a

perfect  Bill,  but that it could be  made  perfect.

That  was the reason why it should be referred to  a

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world there are people who have gone

before us. They are wiser and they have expressed  a

great  deal  of views. I believe, Sir, if  you  look

through all the Bills in this House - every Bill - you

will  see that there is not one that can be said  to

have  been  originally drafted by the Government.  I

say  that  these Bills have sometimes been  borrowed

from  England,  sometimes from India, and  sometimes

from Australia or somewhere else. We should not  say

that  a private Member has copied from certain other

Bills  because  we are now and have been  all  these

years doing that very same thing. Sir, we must  copy

what is best in this world and leave out what is not

good. In Ceylon, you say that there is an Act  of  a

similar nature running into something like 70 to  80

sections,  and covering many aspects of legislation.

Today,  Sir,  we present a very short Bill.  I  have

been told that it falls far short of requirements. I

have  been told that the Ceylon Act is not workable.

Sir,  as I say, we are only making a start.  We  may

still  find a lot of mistakes that will have  to  be

corrected. This Bill will have to be further amended

even  if it should become law, just like any of  our

old Bills. Many amendments may have to be made later

to make it suit local conditions as the days go by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out to me by the Hon. the

Minister  for  Labour and Welfare  that  the  clause

relating to wages is not as good as it should be and

that  the  Tribunal will be made to work  very  hard

because  agreement  may not be reached  between  the

shop  assistants  and  the shopkeepers,  and,  as  a

result,  he  will  be  loaded with  work.  I  cannot

subscribe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



to this view, Sir. I know that many who work in this

island as shop assistants are not discontented,  and

I  know  that  the  good  relationship  that  exists

between  the  shopkeepers and their  employees  will

help  to  bring about agreement in more than seventy

per  cent of the cases affected. I believe that only

in a very small number of shops have we discontented

employees.  If  they were really discontented,  they

would have left the shops because there has been  no

legislation  to protect them up to now.  They  would

have  left, but they are there, and I know  many  of

them  have  been  working there for many  years - some

running to ten years, twenty years or thirty  years.

In  fact,  Sir, my view is that even if  we  have  a

Tribunal,  that Tribunal will not be  made  to  work

very  hard.  What  it will have to  do  is  to  send

agreements  to the Minister for him to sign  on  the

dotted line. Probably some work will be involved  in

the signing. I do agree with that!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You can buy a chop!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> That might help, but I do not

think that it is going to be a terrible problem!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has hinted at another point - about closing

orders.  I  say that, in the same way as the  Weekly

Holidays  Ordinance can be enforced, closing  orders

can  also  be  enforced, if you cannot  enforce  the

Weekly Holidays Ordinance and see that the shops are

closed  on that day, then that is admitting  defeat.

If   you  say  you  can  enforce  the  law,  it   is

successful. If cases of people going against the law

are  few  and  far  between, then you  have  made  a

success of it. A similar result can be achieved with

these  closing  orders. The Hon. Minister  envisages

that  the  best way would be for shop assistants  to

form   themselves  into  one  big  union  and   then

negotiate  with employers who have formed themselves

into  another  big  union. Then, everything  can  be

signed, the closing order will affect everybody, and

everybody will be happy. But I say that in Singapore

the  most difficult section of the workers that  can

be  persuaded  to  form a union would  be  the  shop

assistants.  Similarly, the most difficult  type  of

trades where employers:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



can  come  together will be the shop owners.  It  is

also  very  difficult  for us  to  fix  a  wage  for

everybody.  I  dare say that a shop in North  Bridge

Road and one doing a similar business in Ponggol end

will  not  have  the same volume  of  business.  The

workers  in these two shops will not be working  the

same number of hours or, I should say, putting forth

as  much  energy  on  one  side  as  on  the  other.

Therefore,  to  say  that their  wages  and  working

conditions  should be the same is, I  think,  wrong.

That   is  why  we  put  into  that  Bill   a   wage

determination which can be fixed by the employer  on

the  one hand and by the employees on the other.  We

believe that we can fix wages by regions and not  on

the  whole,  probably by streets but  certainly  not

affecting the whole of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which has been brought up

by   the  Hon.  Minister,  and  that  is  about  the

definition  of  shop assistants or clerks.  Here,  I

agree with him that probably a better definition can

come  by  and  by  and I would certainly  welcome  a

better  definition  of the terms "clerk"  and  "shop

assistant".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.
