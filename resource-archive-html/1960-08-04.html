<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development to give the dates of commencement and

completion of the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Four and seven-storeyed flats at St. Michael's Estate;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Seven-storeyed flats at Kallang Estate;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Two-storeyed terrace houses at St. Michael's Estate;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Four-storeyed flats at Duchess Estate, Queenstown; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Three-storeyed flats at Princess Estate, Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> St. Michael's Estate commenced on

1.7.57  and  was  completed on 29.6.59; Kallang  Estate

commenced  on  1.9.56  and was completed  on  30.12.58;

Duchess  Estate, Queenstown, commenced on  11.2.57  and

was   completed   on  15.3.59,  and  Princess   Estate,

Queenstown,  commenced on 1.10.54 and was completed  on

20.3.56.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the basis of

these  dates,  is it correct to assume that  all  these

flats and terrace houses were building during the  time

of the previous Government?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose the dates speak for themselves.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.

<div align="center"><b>ROADS BUILT BY KAMPONG DWELLERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  in how many kampongs were roads  built  by

kampong  dwellers with materials supplied by Government

from 1st June, 1959, to the latest convenient date.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> There are two kampongs where

assistance  is  being given by the Government  and  the

people  living  in those kampongs have  volunteered  to

build the roads themselves. They are Kampong Kubor  and

Kampong  Farrer.  Work is still  in  progress  in  both

kampongs.

<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>HOSTEL FOR MEMBERS OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</b></div></h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  the  hostel  for Members of  the  Assembly  is

running at a profit or loss to Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck) (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply

to this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostel for Assemblymen is neither making a profit

nor  incurring  a loss. The Assemblymen  utilising  the

hostel  pay  a  rent of $120 per month,  which  is  the

standard  rent payable when the house is let  furnished

to   Government  officers.  The  occupants   meet   the

recurrent  cost  for water and light.  A  telephone  is

provided  at Government expense at $42 per quarter.  No

crockery or other amenities are provided.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Would the Parliamentary Secretary to

the   Minister   for  Finance  please  say   how   many

Assemblymen are occupying this hostel?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> If the Member for Cairnhill is so

interested, I must have further notice of the question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am so interested that I am

asking  some more supplementary questions, if you  will

allow me. The next supplementary question is: are these

Assemblymen  who  are  living  in  the  hostel  out  of

accommodation in their own homes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Regarding the first question, there

are seven Assemblymen and Assemblywomen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary in a

position  to  say how much it costs the Government  per

month to run this hostel?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I require further notice of the

question.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary  has  not  answered my second  question.  Are

these  people  who  are living in  the  hostel  out  of

accommodation in their own homes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this

question was answered during the last session  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to

enter   into  a  debate  but  since  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  cannot give an answer, I will not press  the

issue.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance   how  many  overseas  trips  were   taken   by

Ministers,    Parliamentary   Secretaries,    Political

Secretaries  and  P.A.P. Assemblymen  since  1st  June,

1959, and whether and what clothing and allowances were

given to them by Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply

to this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six overseas trips were made by Ministers and

Parliamentary Secretaries and two overseas  trips  were

taken by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



Political  Secretaries  and  Assemblymen  on   official

travel  for  which expenses were borne from  Government

funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total board and lodging expenses were $5,068.50.

The  subsistence  allowances  were  $3,288.47  and  the

outfit allowances were $2,000.

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS ON SICK LEAVE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  how  many teachers in Primary and  Secondary

English  schools  went on sick leave  (a)  between  1st

September, 1958, and 30th June, 1959 (except when there

was an epidemic), and (b) between .1st September, 1959,

and   30th  June,  1960  (except  when  there  was   an

epidemic): and whether any instructions were  given  to

the  Medical Officer to keep medical leave  down  to  a

minimum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The number of teachers in primary

and  secondary English schools who went on  sick  leave

for  the ten-month period September 1958 to June  1959

was 2,528.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that it is not possible at such short notice

to supply figures of teachers on sick leave for the ten-month  period September 1959 to June 1960.  The  Member

for  Mountbatten, who until last year was the principal

of a Government English primary school, should be aware

that  leave  registers for Government schools  for  the

year  1960  are not normally submitted to the  Ministry

till January 1961. I will, however, answer part of  her

question  now,  that  is,  for  the  four-month  period

September  to December 1959. The number of teachers  in

Government  and  Government-aided English  schools  who

applied  for sick leave during this period  was  1,561.

The  number of teachers from aided English schools  who

applied  for  sick  leave during the  six-month  period

January  to June 1960 was 267, but the figures for  the

same  period  in  respect of Government English  school

teachers  will take some time, as explained  just  now,

but will be supplied to the Member for Mountbatten when

available.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any specific instructions being

issued  to  the  Medical Officer to keep medical  leave

down  to  a  minimum.  It is normal  practice  to  give

medical   leave  only  when  the  Medical  Officer   is

satisfied  that the condition of the officer  justifies

it.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, comparing these

figures  with  those  for  previous  years,  could  the

Minister tell us whether he considers these figures  to

be quite high?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the figures quoted

were  for the ten-month period September .1958 to  June

1959  when the last Government was in office, and there

are  no  comparative figures just yet  for  the  period

September 1959 to June 1960. I have only been  able  to

supply  part  figures  and, as already  explained,  the

Member  for Mountbatten, who was the principal  of  an

English  Government  primary school,  should  know  her

General Orders and regulations - that the leave registers

for  Government schools do not come up to the  Ministry

till the end of the year.

<div align="center"><b>GRADUATE AND NORMAL - TRAINED TEACHERS AND LECTURERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of resignations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Education  how many (a) graduate teachers in Government

and   Government-aided  schools,   (b)   normal-trained

teachers  in (i) secondary, and (ii) primary Government

schools,  and  (c) lecturers in the Teachers'  Training

College,  resigned  from 1st June, 1959,  to  a  latest

convenient date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of

teachers  who resigned from service during  the  period

June 1959 to May 1960 were as follows:



<pre>

            Graduate teachers in Government

            and Government-aided schools            160



            English Stream                           74

            Chinese Stream                           86

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 74 who resigned from the English stream, 22

were  expatriates  of whom two opted  to  retire  under

Malayanisation  terms  and 14  were  married  women  on

temporary month-to-month appointments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal-trained teachers

in Government schools:





<pre>



   Secondary   	         	 15

   Primary   	        	106

 Lecturers in the

   Teachers'Training

   College   	                 13



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve of the 13 who resigned from the T.T.C. were

expatriates   of  whom  five  opted  to  retire   under

Malayanisation terms and seven were married women on  a

temporary month-to-month basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To judge the staffing position in schools purely on

the  figures of those who resigned will not  provide  a

fair picture of the situation. Just as nature abhors  a

vacuum,   so  do  vacancies  arising  not   only   from

resignations  but  also  from retirement  or  death  be

filled  by  recruitment. Therefore, to  appreciate  the

staffing position in schools in its proper perspective,

it  is  necessary to have an overall picture  regarding

the   number   of  teachers  as  against  the   student

enrolment, that is, the staff/student ratio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1959, there were 9,870 teachers in Government

and Government-aided schools, and the student enrolment

was  308,333, or a staff/student ratio of 1 to  31.  In

June  1960,  there  were  10,428  teachers  to  340,521

students,  or a ratio of 1 to 33. During the year  from

June  1959  to May 1960, therefore, there has  been  an

overall  increase of 558 teachers and 32,188  students.

This   staff/student  ratio  of  1  to  33   is   still

exceedingly  favourable when we bear in mind  the  fact

that  because  of  the heavy cost of education  on  the

national  budget  we  are  now  requiring  classes   to

increase their capacity from the previous 40 to 44,  or

a staff/student ratio of 1 to 44.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, could the Minister inform this

House  as  to  the reasons why such a large  number  of

teachers have resigned from Government service?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, men and women

have  varying  reactions to responsibilities.  Quite  a

number  probably  have resigned  because  the  task  of

nation-building  proves to be too heavy.  Others  think

that  teaching  is a part-time business  and  could  be

indulged, while others think that it is time they  went

back to the Federation, or Sarawak, or Australia. It is

difficult  to give a general answer to a very  sweeping

question.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the next question

will  not  be so sweeping. The Minister has  said  that

there  is an increase in the number of teachers in  the

Education  Department.  Is it  not  a  fact  that  that

increase is the result of recruiting untrained teachers

and teachers who are at present receiving training?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer to the Member for

Cairnhill  is as follows. In June 1959, the T.T.C. had

an  enrolment of 2,241. In June 1960, the enrolment  is

2,407, i.e. an increase of, shall we say, 160 only.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the increase in enrolment of

teachers in the T.T.C. does not reflect the increase in

the number of teachers who are at present teaching, and

who  surely have to take a number of years before  they

can come out of the T.T.C. as qualified teachers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The supplementary question is: is it

not  a  fact  that  the increase in  the  enrolment  of

teachers  in the T.T.C. does not correctly reflect  the

increase  in  the number of teachers, as given  by  the

Minister for Education?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Minister like to answer that

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in school we

teach  children  that  "one  and  two  are  three"  and

subtracting "one from three leaves two". I  have  given

facts and figures which would appear not to click  with

the  Member  for Cairnhill, who is the former  Minister

for Education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, will the Hon, the Minister for Education say that one trained teacher

equates to a new recruit as a teacher?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we are now entering into a

debate. I think the Member for Cairnhill and the Member

for  Mountbatten could file a motion or claim the right

to raise the matter on the Adjournment.

<div align="center"><b>(Second Day)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question [3rd August, 1960],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the

Legislative Assembly of the State of Singapore, express

our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening of the present session of this Assembly."'.-(The Prime Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, the Prime

Minister's speech yesterday was intended to confuse the

real  issues  facing  the people. After  the  Hong  Lim

Branch  of  the  P.A.P. had  tabled  its  historic  16

resolutions  at  the  P.A.P. Special  Party  Conference

called  on 18th and 19th June, the Prime Minister  used

all  the State and private organs of propaganda at  his

command - the  State organs are like Radio Singapore  and

the private organs are all his agents, together with  a

rigid control of the Press - to systematically divert the

attention  of  the  people  from  the  real  issues  by

disseminating smears and distortions, by calling  names

as  what  he  did yesterday, by concocting charges  and

smearing  my work in the City Council and the  Ministry

of  National Development. The offensive propaganda  was

carried  out on a grand scale, which the Lim  Yew  Hock

government had not learned. But it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



was  all  the same - ineffective. Why was it ineffective?

It  is  because  of  two basic reasons..  Firstly,  the

people  have  known for some time of the  deviation  of

P.A.P. aims and policies by the Prime Minister and  his

able lieutenant, the Minister for Finance, who are  the

two  persons responsible for steering the P.A.P. along

its present actively pro-colonial course. Secondly, the

Prime  Minister  is  as  good  a  propagandist  as  Dr

Goebbels   of   the  last  war  was.   He   tells   the

intellectuals one story. He tells the farmers, hawkers,

workers,  petty traders, and so on, another  story.  He

tells  the businessmen a third different story, and  he

goes on ad infinitum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, Mr Speaker - the so-called Minutes

of  the Party Conference were given to the Press in two

different  and distinct versions, one for the  English-speaking  members of the public and the other  for  the

Chinese-speaking  members  of  the  public.  But   what

happened?  People  meet at one  time  or  another;  the

hawker could meet the clerk, the businessman could meet

his  employee,  and  the  others,  the  bilingual  and

trilingual  speaking  public who could  read  both  the

Chinese  and  the English Press, when they compare  the

reports   they  find  that  they  have  been  receiving

different    stories,   in   other   words,   different

propaganda.  Thus the people realise that  it  is  mere

propaganda, like Dr Goebbels' propaganda, and not  the

truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth, Mr Speaker, is this. At the Badminton Hall

rally,  round about 30,000 people attended, half inside

and  half outside. Is it necessary for me, Mr Speaker,

to  convince you with photographs taken at the Hall? We

can pass them around later if Mr Speaker will allow.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is giving

me  a  very difficult task, and that is to draw a  line

somewhere.  I  do not think this Assembly is  concerned

with  the internal strife of the Party itself. What,  I

think,  the  Assembly is concerned with is the  overall

picture which that strife perhaps has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



created in Singapore. Therefore, I ask the hon.  Member

not  to  go  into  too  many  details,  like  producing

photographs and things like that. Perhaps if  the  hon.

Member  will bear that in mind, we could then get  back

to the motion which is before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. All my

remarks  are  related  to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech  and to the Prime Minister's address.  Though  I

have  to  make the necessary clarification, I will  not

produce the photographs any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rally at the Badminton Hall, the Prime

Minister was convinced that he had failed to divert the

attention  of the public from the Hong Lim resolutions,

despite  his  intensive propaganda campaign  and  rigid

suppression of the Press and mass rallies. The Ong  Eng

Guan scapegoat is not good enough; too small fry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week, there has been little talk about Ong

Eng  Guan being anti-"collective leadership". No  more.

"Dr  Goebbels'" first shot has failed. This is because

we  have effectively exploded the so-called "collective

leadership" of the P.A.P. Nobody in Singapore  believes

it  anymore. So, yesterday we heard in this Assembly of

a  new  scapegoat, the so-called Left-wing adventurers.

The   first   scapegoat - Ong  Eng   Guan.   The   second

scapegoat - the  Left-wing  adventurers.  And  the  third

scapegoat,  most  probably, will be  the  Minister  for

Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who turned up at the Badminton Hall rally

were,   by   implication,   the   work   of   Left-wing

adventurers,  and not because the masses supported  the

Hong  Lim  resolutions.  Mr  Speaker,  how  would  you

explain the masses gathering at P.A.P. election rallies

held  before  the  P.A.P. formed  the  Government?  Two

Wednesdays ago, at the opening of this Assembly,  there

was  the  necessity to direct six lorry loads  of  Work

Brigade members to stand in front of the Supreme  Court

to  cheer and shout "Merdeka". As I said yesterday, you

can lead a horse to the water, but you cannot force  it

to  drink. The Brigade workers on that morning did  not

shout  "Merdeka". I repeat, Sir, how would you  explain

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



masses gathering at P.A.P. election rallies before  the

P.A.P. formed the Government? Was that the work of Left-wing  adventurers? You cannot effectively explain  away

the  masses  who turned up at the Badminton Hall.  They

turned   up  because  they  supported  the   Hong   Lim

resolutions  which were concrete expressions  of  their

hopes  and grievances. They turned up because they  had

bottled  up in their hearts for the past one  year  the

bitter disappointment of the Government which they  had

voted  in  and  to which they gave such an overwhelming

majority,  and  which  now betrayed  their  fundamental

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true when the Prime Minister said yesterday

that   "there  was  an  absence  of  deep  and  abiding

grievance among the people." Mr Speaker, how would  he

know?  How would the Prime Minister know when  he  does

not  see  the people but shuts himself up in  the  City

Hall?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight in Singapore today is still between the

colonialists and the pro-colonialists on the  one  side

and  the  people on the other side. The Prime  Minister

did  his  level best in his speech to convince us  that

his  Government is still a progressive Government.  His

tactics are simple. After 14 months of strange silence,

the  Prime Minister started admonishing the K.M.T., the

colonialists,  the European interests, the  colonialist

newspapers.   These   are  very   simple   kindergarten

exercises. I hope this time the Speaker will not refuse

me  to  practise  a  simple  kindergarten  exercise.  I

remember when I was in school I used to play this  type

of  exercise. On one finger is a piece of  paper.  "Mr

Speaker,  see,  this is right." But immediately  I  put

this finger down, and I put another finger up, and  the

paper  becomes  left. So we are doing  the  same  thing

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister admonished the K.M.T. and so on. He detained two journalists in the name of K.M.T. right-wing subversion,and he thus hoped the people will

consider him left. And then the Prime Minister went  on

further to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The policy of the Communist Party... is to unite with

all   progressive  forces,  of  which  the  P.A.P. is

acknowledged as one, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



struggle  against  the  forces  of  reaction,  viz.

colonialism, imperialism and feudalism."



<br><br>And he said again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not unaware that with the Communist on one

side  of  us and the British colonialist on the  other,

each side will want to pull us to its side."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, are these simple kindergarten

exercises  convincing? They would be as  convincing  as

when  the former Chief Minister, Mr Lim Yew Hock, said

in  this  Assembly, "Gentlemen, I am anti-colonialist."

Were  the  two  journalists  detained  for  K.M.T. sub

version?  Were  they  leaders of the  so-called  K.M.T.

subversive organisation in Singapore? What  I  know  is

that one of them was detained 15 minutes after my Press

conference on Sunday, 3rd July, 1960, on his way to his

office  near  Cable and Wireless at  Robinson  Road  to

cable my Press releases to his paper in Kuala Lumpur. I

do  not  support  this paper because it  always  writes

sensational articles. But what happened is this.  Being

a  paper printed in Kuala Lumpur, its editors could not

be   called  up  and  be  intimidated,  as  editors  of

Singapore  newspapers have been regularly  intimidated,

Mr  Speaker. Sometimes this intimidation goes  on  for

hours.  This paper in Kuala Lumpur exploited the  rigid

control  on Singapore's newspapers, arid its sale  were

boosted   up  from  several  hundred  copies  to   many

thousands  of  copies. So the best way  was  to  detain

these   two   journalists  and  teach   the   Singapore

journalists  a lesson. The Chinese proverb says:  "Kill

the cockerel in order to teach the monkey."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the colonial newspapers which the Prime

Minister  mentioned yesterday? What the Prime  Minister

attacked  was  not  the  Straits  Times.  The   British

editorial  writers of the Straits Times  are  good,  of

course.  They  wrote two editorial articles  dated  the

22nd of June and the 24th of June praising the stand of

the Lee Kuan Yew Government. Why did the Prime Minister

not  mention  about  the Voice  of  America  which  was

praising him? The person the Prime Minister attacked in

his  speech  yesterday,  by implication,  was  a  local

writer  named Mr Huang Tze-chin, alias Francis  Huang,

who wrote a series of articles in the Sunday Mail about

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



present  political  crisis. Our  present  Minister  for

Culture  also used to write similarly. There is nothing

wrong  about  it. Francis Huang is one who believes  in

liberal  capitalism, if I can sum it up in  two  words,

and  if that is a correct description. After his  first

article  in  the Sunday Mail on the first Sunday  after

the  Party conference, I believe he was called  up  and

grilled  for  four  solid  hours.  His  second  article

negated  his  first  article.  I  hope,  gentlemen,  to

refresh your memory. And being not happy about it,  Mr

Huang  wrote a third article which negated  his  second

article.  So  the  first article was his  article;  the

second  article was the Government's article;  and  the

third  article  was  his artic1e to negate  his  second

article.  He  negated his second article by  writing  a

third article and indirectly telling the people that he

had   written  his  second  article  under   Government

pressure.  So  we have these articles  of  Mr  Francis

Huang  which are his own - the first article, the  fourth

article and the fifth article. What had Mr Huang  Tze-chin  written about which the Prime Minister  said  had

confused  and  deluded the public? Mr  Huang  Tze-chin

considered  himself a political scientist, and  advised

the present ruling clique of the P.A.P. to come out  in

open  support of liberalism and capitalism. He was  not

happy  that  now they were only supporting  it  in  the

dark. At the moment, it is actually a game of hide-and-seek. Mr Huang Tze-chin advised a national coalition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that in the days of the Lim Yew Hock Government, there had always been shouts

of  a  national  coalition, and the Singapore  People's

Alliance was thus formed. Mr Huang Tze-chin said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The way can be prepared for a national coalition only

if  the  suspicions left over by history are  dispelled

through a genuine revival of the bourgeois freedoms and

the creation of an atmosphere of genuine liberalism."



<br><br>Suspicions - about whom? About Lim Yew Hock?  No  mention

is being made of a coalition with whom. Does it imply a

national coalition with Lim Yew Hock?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has been

mentioning the name of Lim Yew Hock very often. When he

says  "the  Lim  Yew Hock Government",  perhaps  it  is

excusable. But when he says, "Lim Yew Hock", I think he

ought to say the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is a popular man!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I should

explain what I meant when I said "Lim Yew Hock". It  is

not  so much the Member for Cairnhill himself, but  the

political force that he represents in Singapore.  I  am

not referring to the present Member for Cairnhill as he

is himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Huang Tze-chin then continued in the Sunday Mail.

He gave these alternatives. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the alternatives to the liberal analysis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to allow things to drift towards a smash-up in

1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is to launch a wave of repression to mop up

Ong and all who are not against him."



<br><br>There will be many, many hundreds of thousands who  are

not against him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A third is to intensify the present crisis into a

constitutional    crisis,   thus    inviting    British

intervention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth is to give it all up as a bad job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these alternatives bear thinking about, if one

shifts one's gaze from the tiny cockpit of Hong Lim  to

the decisive arena of the 1964 general election."

Mr  Huang  Tze-chin concluded his article  dated  17th

July,   1960,   with  an  attack  on  the  Government's

detention  of  the two journalists. And  what  did  the

Prime  Minister think about this? He said this  in  his

speech yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All this talk of absolute democratic rights, laissez-faire liberalism, freedom and human rights, in the face

of  the stark realities of an underground struggle  for

power, can only confuse the English-educated world."



<br><br>In  other  words, he believes also in guided democracy.

In  other words, he also believes in sending riot squad

vans  to P.A.P. branch meetings, intimidation of  Party

members  by sending C.I.D. men to see them in the  dead

of night, calling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



them up and subjecting them to secret trials and so on,

which  the people have seen in plenty in the  past  six

weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, by implication, the Prime Minister, in his reference to Huang Tze-chin's articles, although he

does  not  mention those articles by  name,  wants  the

European imperialists, colonialists, the bosses of  the

Straits  Times  who control the Sunday Mail,  to  clamp

down  on  writers like Huang Tze-chin. It was the  same

when  the  Lim Yew Hock Government wanted  the  Straits

Times  to clamp down on writers like Mr S. Rajaratnam,

who  is  at  present  the  Minister  for  Culture.  Mr

Speaker, the Prime Minister does not want to clamp down

on  British  editorial writers who praise  the  present

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Prime Minister in his speech yesterday

talked  about the Communist Party on the one  side  and

the  colonialists  on  the  other.  So  a  very  simple

exercise again, trying to imply that the Government are

in   the  centre  and  they  are  not  therefore   pro-colonialists. How would the Prime Minister explain then

the  presence of expatriates like Thomson,  Blades  and

Meadows in control of key positions in the machinery of

the State? So these expatriates are not colonialists at

all. And again he implied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People say the P.A.P. is progressive, so I, the Prime

Minister, must also be progressive."



<br><br>The  members of the P.A.P. are progressive. The  P.A.P.

Assemblymen  and even some of the Ministers  are  still

reasonable. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for

Home   Affairs  and  our  Minister  for   Culture   are

reasonable  and  nice gentlemen. But it  is  these  two

persons,  the  Prime Minister and his able  lieutenant,

the  Minister  for Finance, who have in the  past  year

steered  the  present Government along  a  pro-colonial

course. The Prime Minister said yesterday - this  one  is

important-yesterday was 3rd August, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British want to preserve their economic and

military interests ... for as long as possible."



<br><br>May I repeat it again?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British want to preserve their economic and

military interests...for as long as possible."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Economic and military interests" are, like in a magic

show,  switched  back again after our exposure  at  the

Badminton  Hall rally on the 12th July,  1960.  A  year

ago, on the 17th July, 1959, after the Government  was

formed,  the  Prime Minister wrote these words  in  the

Petir editorial:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British force is a negative one from cur point of

view.  They are interested in Singapore as a  base  and

only  indirectly to a much lesser extent  in  Singapore

and Malaya remaining outside the Communist bloc."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, please note, that there was no talk on the 17th of July, 1959, about British economic

interests. The British were not interested in  economic

and other interests any more in July 1959. Suddenly, in

August  1960  they are interested again. What  has  the

Party   manifesto  said  about  this?  "Colonies   were

acquired  mainly for commercial reasons. They  retained

them for the same reasons. The economic structure which

a   colonial   power  creates  and  maintains   in   an

independent  territory  reveals  the  true  motive  for

empire  building. The primary function  of  a  colonial

economy  is  to  increase  the  wealth  of  the  mother

country."  If  I  could sum up  in  a  few  words,  Mr

Speaker - in  1955, the Colonialists' main objective  was

economic. After the Government was formed in July 1959,

the  British were not interested in economic  interests

but only in a negative way in Singapore as a base. Then

after  our  attack, on the third time, the British  are

interested in economic interests again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, political issues cannot be settled the way the Prime Minister is settling them, by magic

words,  by  twisting  the facts  and  by  shifting  the

issues.  You  can  notice  the  changes  in  the  Prime

Minister's basic stand - one day, one stand.  As  I  said

yesterday,  when  I  listened to the  Prime  Minister's

speech,  it was like listening to the voice of Lim  Yew

Hock.  And when I mention Lim Yew Hock, it is the  same

as  what  I  have  said just now. It is  most  pleasant

reading  through  the Hansard - three big  volumes - and  I

advise everybody to buy a copy! Could you, Mr Speaker,

reduce the price?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, political issues cannot be settled by shifting the issues. The masses have voted us in and

asked  us  not  to tax the poor. That is all.  You  are

shifting  the issue to socialism. The people asked  for

constitutional  talks  and  you  shift  the  issue   to

independence.  Everybody knows  that  the  present  so-called  internal self-government is a mockery. Have  we

really  internal self-government? What about the  other

issues  like military land, assessments, tax on British

military  trucks  and  so  on?  The  1958  Constitution

departs  in  many fundamental aspects  from  the  White

Paper  drafted  by the all-Party team.  The  people  in

Tanjong Pagar accepted it because half a loaf is better

than no loaf. You shift the issue to independence.  You

talk  about  our water supply as what the  Progressives

did. The people asked for talks with the Federation  on

merger.  This  was  contained in item  3  of  the  1955

Legislative Assembly election manifesto of  the  P.A.P.

Now,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have a copy of the  election

manifesto  of  the  People's  Action  Party   for   the

Legislative Assembly elections in April 1955:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Item 3 - Unity with the Federation. The P.A.P. believes

that  immediately after the elections in Singapore  and

the Federation, negotiations should be started to bring

about the unification of Malaya."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember immediately after the elections, I raised

this matter with the Prime Minister. He did not want to

reply.  I  am  just  wondering about his  sincerity  on

merger. You cannot shift the issue by asking a question

which  is  irrelevant. This is what the Prime  Minister

said yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it to be? Independence through talks with the

Federation  for merger, or independence  for  Singapore

alone through talks with the British?"



<br><br>There  was  no direct reply whether the Prime  Minister

was interested in the election manifesto of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people talked about fighting colonialism. The

Prime  Minister tried to intimidate them. At a  special

Party conference on Saturday, 18th June, 1960, he  said

that  to fight Colonialism was to fight British troops.

"Now we have no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



machine   guns   and  if  the  British  troops   leave,

Indonesian troops will come in." That is what  he  said

on  18th  June,  1960. Yesterday,  the  Prime  Minister

implied this. He said that Singapore "can be so  easily

captured  and destroyed. Have they forgotten that  some

80,000 British troops had to surrender in Singapore  10

days  after  the  Japanese captured  Singapore's  water

supply  situated in Johore?" The Prime Minister  should

have  said  this in November 1955 when the  P.A.P. was

formed.  Mr  Speaker, the P.A.P. have  fought  British

Colonialism for five years and we did not fight British

troops.  We can only solve political issues  by  facing

them and not by shifting the issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not talk about the August 1957 affair in the P.A.P.

any  more.  It will do more harm to the Prime  Minister

than  he knows. From what I know, there was a group  of

people in the P.A.P. who wanted to capture 8 out of the

12  seats in the Central. It was not a movement against

anybody.  The Secretary-General managed to  retain  his

seat and save his skin, because I heard some weeks  ago

that he gave several hundreds of admission cards to non-Party members -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the hon. Member can

assist by relating those remarks to the question before

the House. It seems to me they are quite irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have got to point out

this  August  1957 affair. Yesterday's  speech  of  the

Prime  Minister  was  meant to  smear  me.  What  I  am

attempting  to  do is to give a short note  to  clarify

about myself. That is all that I am trying to do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think what the hon. Member should do

then is to quote from the Prime Minister's speech. Then

I  will  decide  as to whether or not his  remarks  are

relevant thereto.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg leave for a few

seconds to get the relevant section.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is what the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This man, whom they detested and despised to the

point  of  conspiring to oust him in August 1957,  they

now  find  a  useful lever for pushing the P.A.P. into

what  they  hope would be a more malleable and  plastic

position."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to clarify this because these are hard words

used against another Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was trying to say is that the movement in

August  1957  was not a movement against  anybody.  The

Secretary-General managed to retain his seat, because I

heard  recently  that  he  gave  several  hundreds   of

admission  cards  to non-Party members  to  go  to  the

Badminton Hall to vote him in. It was not enough. And I

believe the ballot papers were not properly counted.  I

bear  no grudge against anybody because I was out.  The

Secretary-General  pleaded  with  Tann  Wee  Tiong  and

myself  to  come back to the Central later so  that  he

could have enough men for his "front" to fill up the 12

seats. This is all the clarification I wanted to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Government's policy speech nothing has been said about the social revolution. The Prime

Minister said in cols. 83-5 of Hansard, Vol. 3,  No.  2

of 22nd April, 1958:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, I said, not as an idle boast, that the P.A.P.

will  win the elections if they were held tomorrow,  or

next year, short of something catastrophic happening or

something  very  foolish that we do. And  we  will  win

them,  apart  from  the question  of  having  a  better

organisation and having better personnel,  because  the

other  Parties do not attempt to understand the meaning

of a social revolution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social revolution!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have they not ceased to wonder why in the last four

months  the  Government was Just swept  aside  and  the

attention of the people of Singapore was focused on the

City  Council? Why? Because it had captured the  hearts

and minds of the workers.... For the first time they begin

to  understand that these magnificent institutions like

the City Council, which they had viewed as institutions

of  bureaucracy  and petty oppression could  be  turned

into  public institutions for their protection, welfare

and benefit. Albeit, they needed some colourful gesture

like  throwing out the mace to drive the  lesson  home.

But that is the lesson the Labour Front must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



learn if they want to know what is going on, and have a

chance  to  compete at all. The Labour Front leader  in

the  City  Council said - as it was reported in the  last

few  days  and with a great deal of silent praise  from

the  English  language press - "Oh well, let's  have  the

Mayor  of  Penang  here but let's  have  none  of  this

nonsense about, `Down with colonialism and all  that,'"

because obviously by implication, his Party is  not  in

favour  of it. For the first time, the City Council  is

going to mean something to the people."



<br><br>The Prime Minister continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we - this year or next year - we are prepared for it

any  time, - cannot  do  the same  transmutation  for  the

institutions  of  Government  and  make, them   become

symbols  of the people's rights and privileges  instead

of symbols of colonial bureaucracy and oppression, then

at  the end of our five-year term of office, we will be

out on our heels and deserve to perish.".



<br><br>The Prime Minister continues on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When in pursuit of a social revolution, never pay the

slightest  attention  to the present  English  language

press. Praise from them means destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decide what you have to do, decide what is right and

press on. The more they howl against you, the more  you

can be certain that you are on the right track.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, this is what we now hear in the policy speech.

"It  would no doubt have, been advantageous, before  an

election, to have come forward with lavish promises  of

independence   and   socialism."   Mr   Speaker,   the

socialists do not expect socialism during the  P.A.P.'s

present  regime. Socialism is not the issue.  But  what

has  the  Government done during the past year?  Almost

nothing,  except to pass a multitude of laws,  none  of

which  touches  on  the basic economic  fabric  of  our

existing  society, but mostly laws which are  meant  to

consolidate the power of the present regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we do not like to talk about social revolution before the elections, and do another thing

after  the  elections. We stand for the P.A.P. as  the

people  have  understood it, and  on  which  they  have

pinned  their hopes, and for which they have voted  the

P.A.P. into power. It cannot be denied that the present

institutions of Government are still being looked  upon

by the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



as  symbols of colonial bureaucracy and oppression.  We

stand for what the Prime Minister said in April 1958:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the first time they begin to understand that

these  magnificent institutions like the City  Council,

which  they  had viewed as institutions of  bureaucracy

and  petty  oppression  could  be  turned  into  public

institutions   for   their  protection,   welfare   and

benefit.".



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  believe  that  the  Government

departments  and  other  public  institutions  can   be

transformed,  as the City Council has been transformed,

into symbols for the people's well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the policy speech, the second year is to

be  a year of construction - the so-called decisive year.

We  hope  this  is so. We hope it will  be  a  year  of

construction.  More  than seven  months  of  1960  have

passed, but the construction projects contained in  the 1960  Budget  still remain

largely untouched.  In  many

cases,   plans  have  not  even  been  initiated.   The

construction projects in the 1960 Budget were meant  as

a  propaganda show-piece. In 1959, there was hardly any

construction  at  all. The $9 million surplus  of  1959

which  was  boasted about in the policy speech  is  not

necessarily  wise public finance. The  money  has  come

from the various taxes on the poor and the white-collar

workers. The $9 million surplus should have been  spent

on  public  work projects like the building  of  roads,

houses, and so on, to alleviate the sufferings  of  the

poor   and   to   alleviate  the   acute   problem   of

unemployment,  particularly during this time  of  trade

recession and acute unemployment. The savings from  the

pay-cuts  of the civil servants are not being used  for

useful  construction work which would help the  economy

but  for  unnecessary  and  wasteful  expenditure;  for

instance,  like overseas trips, provision of  cars  and

bodyguards for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries,

$20,000  to beautify and air-condition Sri Temasek  and

change   its   marble  which  is  already  in   tip-top

condition,  and  other  wasteful items  of  expenditure

which even the Lim Yew Hock Government did not think it

fit and wise to incur.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has hardly done any construction work

during  its  one year of office. Most of  the  projects

which the Ministers opened were projects conceived  and

initiated - and some almost completed - under the  Lim  Yew

Hock  Government:  the Thomson Road Hospital,  the  St.

Michael's Road Market, the post offices, the micro-wave

stations,  the St. James Power Station and  many  other

projects.  The  exceptions were the  community  centres

which   cost  about  $20,000  each.  The  Public  Works

Standing  Committee, which is under the direct  control

of  the  Prime  Minister, is in  charge  of  all  these

construction projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, nothing has been mentioned in the policy speech about the funds to finance the proposed

construction  projects  in  this  "decisive"  year   of

construction. Is this to be dependent to a large extent

on British and American aid? The British Government has

promised  $65 million in grants and loans  to  finance

projects many of which are of military significance and

are of no direct benefit to us. What type of aid are we

going  to  obtain  from the United States  through  the

World  Bank? Mr Speaker, this is very good magic!  You

do  not  borrow money from Mr Lee Kong Chian, but  you

borrow   money   from  the  Overseas  Chinese   Banking

Corporation.  From  what  we  have  studied  of   other

countries,  none  have survived by being  dependent  on

American aid; as none have survived from praises by the

Straits Times. We believe in making an attempt to  find

the  funds  from  our  own people first.  I  asked  the

Minister  for  Finance in August 1959  to  allow  the

S.I.T. to  float housing bonds, but this was rejected.

We  could have mobilised the people to buy these bonds,

as we have mobilised them to build various projects. At

least we could have made an attempt, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment situation is now worse than before.

The  Lim  Yew Hock Government tried to find scapegoats.

It blamed the P.A.P. is the present Government going to

find  scapegoats in similar fashion? Mr Speaker, blame

Ong  Eng  Guan! The people do not expect us to  find  a

complete solution to our unemployment problem, but they

expect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



the  Government, in which they had so  much  faith,  at

least  to  make  a  sincere and determined  attempt  to

alleviate  this problem. No honest attempts  have  been

made.  Is the Work Brigade an attempt to give  jobs  to

some of the unemployed? No. One of the purposes of  the

Work  Brigade  was,  as  I  said  yesterday,  to  shout

"Merdeka" outside the Supreme Court building. The  Work

Brigade and the community centres are to be the "second

line  of  defence" of the present Government  when  the

Party  members have melted away, when few people go  to

the  P.A.P. branches, and when  they  cannot  get  the

voluntary  workers  to do work at mass  meetings.  They

also  want  the Work Brigade to appear as  "masses"  at

meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy speech there is nothing very new about

the  activities of the various Government  departments.

These  departments  are  just linked  together  like  a

street  directory. Compare it with  any  of  the  three

policy  speeches on the activities of these departments

under  the  Labour Front Government, and you  will  see

little  difference. Most of the plans  put  forward  in

this  policy speech were shaped, planned and  initiated

by  previous Governments. For instance, the chapters on

shipping,  the  Port Authority, civil aviation,  postal

services, and so on. During the past year, the  present

Government   have  not  been  so  much  interested   in

construction and solving the problems pf the unemployed

and   the  building  of  a  better  Singapore,  as   in

consolidating their own position and seeking their  own

ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of housing is a typical example. The

S.I.T., after reorganisation in August 1959, planned to

build  10,000  units in the first phase. The  only  two

local  architects  at  that time  with  public  housing

experience  in Malaya were recruited. Schemes  of  work

were  ready.  Plans and specifications were  drawn  up.

Housing  sites and levelling were ready,  and  in  some

places  piling  was completed. The Prime  Minister  saw

them  with his own eyes when he visited the Queenstown,

Kampong  Koo  Chye, MacPherson Road and  Kampong  Tiong

Bahru  sites on Friday, 16th September, 1959.  Tenders

were advertised. Arrangements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



for  the  laying  of  water, gas  and  electricity  and

storage services were made. The drainage scheme in  the

MacPherson  Road  area was completed  in  record  time,

partly  to alleviate the danger of flood to the farmers

in  the  Geylang Serai area, and partly to dry  up  the

MacPherson Road site for the building of S.I.T. flats.

But  one  thing was not forthcoming. The  Minister  for

Finance  refused to give the money though  he  had  the

money.  I have the correspondence to prove it.  Instead

the  Minister for Finance went further and  refused  to

defreeze the funds which were promised to the S.I.T. in

the  1959 Budget under the Lim Yew Hock Government:  $7

million for the general construction of flats and  $4½

million  for  the building of flats on two fire  sites.

The  present  4,000 units being let out by the  Housing

Board  as  described  in  the policy  speech  were  all

planned  by these same two architects whom we  engaged.

Out  of  these  4,000  units, tenders  for  1,968  were

advertised  before  the Housing Board  was  formed.  We

could have advertised for more if we had the money. The

reason given by the Minister for Finance was fantastic.

I  did  not  believe it myself. It was that  as  little

money  as possible should be spent in 1959 so  that  in

the  1960  Budget  a big sum would be  provided  which

would serve as a good propaganda front to boost up  the

economy. Mr Speaker, you do not eat today, so that you

can have "two" bowls tomorrow! The tens of thousands of

applicants  for  S.I.T. flats have to  suffer  in  this

magic  show.  The  purpose of the  1960  Budget,  which

provides  for  big construction projects but  is  never

meant  to  be fulfilled, is to "boost" the economy.  My

impression  was  that  only a  small  fraction  of  the

projects would be built. You cannot "boost" economy  by

bluff.  Neither  can you consolidate your  position  by

passing   laws  and  building  community  centres   and

organising Work Brigade. The masses which turned up  in

their  tens  of thousands to support the 16 resolutions

at  the  Badminton Hall rally is a concrete and glaring

example  of  the bitter disappointment of  the  people.

Their   hopes  and  their  dreams  have  been  bitterly

shattered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always stood for honesty and integrity.

We  believe in telling the people what we think we  can

and cannot do. We believe in real construction, the way

it  was done in the City Council. Targets were set. The

staff and the masses were mobilised when required,  and

an  all-out  effort was made to reach and  surpass  the

targets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year has been spent, not on construction, and not

for  the  benefit of the masses who have supported  the

P.A.P.  But one whole year has been spent in  order  to

consolidate  the  power of the present  leadership,  so

that  when  the masses have made up their  minds  after

some  doubts:  are  these the people  who  have  really

betrayed  them? Are these the people who have  departed

from  the fundamental aims and policies of the People's

Action Party which they have voted in and on which they

have  pinned  their hopes and dreams? - when  the  masses

decide  to fight, the Lee Kuan Yew Government  will  be

consolidated for such a fight. How do they consolidate?

These are some of the ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) laws to control and regulate trade unions, mass

organisations, political parties and societies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) laws to give undue advantage to the present

regime in elections;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) creation of so-called mass organisations like

community centres and Work Brigade to prepare them

for  the  time  when  the  Party  members  in  the

branches and the masses have melted away;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) television to be immediately installed to take

the  place of mass rallies, because there will  be

fewer  attendances at the mass rallies. The  Prime

Minister  will  be  able to speak  to  the  masses

through television. Direct and indirect control of

the means of propaganda;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) suitable arrangements to ensure that finance is

not lacking;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) military exercises, ample bodyguards, security

guards and fencing for the houses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) control of the key positions in the Executive,

the   Judicature   and  the  control   of   P.A.P.

Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are three sources of constitutional

power  in  a democracy: the Legislature, the  Executive

and  the Judicature. These sources of State power  must

be  firmly controlled in the hands of men whose loyalty

to  the  present regime and the colonial  interests  is

beyond  doubt.  The  Lee Kuan Yew Government  can  only

maintain  control  of  the Legislature  if  the  P.A.P.

Assemblymen  do not rebel - like the three  of  us  here,

when  the  struggle between those who stick  to  P.A.P.

policies  and  those who have betrayed P.A.P. policies

begins.  From the very early days, they have  tried  to

control  the Assemblymen by devious ways; for instance,

brainwashing by Mr Thomson, the softening-up  process,

overseas  trips.  But  the most effective  way  is  the

provision  of a way of life to these Assemblymen  which

makes them identify themselves with the status quo  and

have  nothing to benefit by the social revolution.  The

Executive, which is the second source of constitutional

power, must be in the control, of persons whose loyalty

to  the Prime Minister and his Minister for Finance and

what  they  represent is beyond doubt. That is  why  we

have the Meadows', the Thomsons, and so on, controlling

more State power today than in the previous government.

The Judicature must also be in safe hands. The story  I

heard about the non-confirmation of Mr Tan Ah Tah, the

Chief  Justice, is something which the public  will  be

shocked to know. I quote what the Secretary-General  of

the P.A.P. said about the Judicature in l956 - Hansard of

5th December, 1956, col. 1082:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second issue on which the White Paper has been

silent  is the Supreme Court judgeships, it is an  open

secret that there has been political wrangling over the

appointment  of two new judges, dating  from  the  time

when  the Labour Front Coalition Government was led  by

the   Member  for  Cairnhill.  We  now  know  from  the

estimates  that  only  one  more  judgeship  is  to  be

created. We wish to make it clear that, whatever this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



Government says in this White Paper, my Party  believes

that   the  principle  of  the  inviolability  of   the

judiciary  can only be accepted after we Malayans  have

decided  who  shall  fill those positions.  We  do  not

accept  that  those  whom the colonial  Government  has

appointed  as our judges are inviolate, and  cannot  be

removed by this Legislature or this Government. However

honest,  however good as lawyers they may be, they  are

part  and  parcel  of the colonial machinery  which  is

unacceptable   to  any  Malayan  nationalist.   In   no

territory  of  the British Commonwealth  in  South-East

Asia  were European judges allowed to remain in  office

when  the British imperial power finally departed.  The

only  exception  was  in Ceylon  where  a  white  Chief

Justice, who I notice is already a model for the  Chief

Justice  of  the Federation of Malaya, was  allowed  to

remain  because the Ceylonese Government wanted him  to

remain. But when that Government decided that he should

go,  he  went. That is a principle which we must  first

establish  before  we  accept  the  principle  of   the

inviolability  of  the  judical service.  It  would  be

unfair to many distinguished judges if my remarks  were

to  create  the impression that I think they  were  all

dishonest   and   useless   instruments   of    British

imperialism. The former Chief Justice of Singapore, for

instance,  was a man of great learning and  balance  of

judgment,  for  whom all members of  the  Bar,  whether

white or black, had considerable respect. That does not

in the slightest way detract from the principle that we

cannot  accept a white judiciary imposed  upon  us.  We

want the principle established that if we want them  to

quit, then they must go. Then when we appoint our local

men,  they  will be inviolate. They cannot  be  removed

either  by the Government or the Legislature except  by

the most stringent of procedures."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I just want to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to his speech made in 1956. As I have

said,  the  three sources of constitutional power,  the

Legislature, the Executive and the Judicature, must  be

in  safe hands. By the end of the first year of office,

the  Lee  Kuan  Yew  government  hopes  to  see  itself

strongly  entrenched with the approaching  storm.  They

know  that  the betrayal of P.A.P.'s aims and  policies

cannot  be  left  unchallenged for long  by  the  Party

members and the people. This is what the Prime Minister

meant  when he said that "the first year of office  was

one  of reorganisation, consolidation and preparation."

Reorganisation, consolidation and preparation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lee Kuan Yew government still considers that the

fundamental conflict in our society is one of  language

and not of economics. He splits Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



society  into  the  Chinese-speaking and  the  English-speaking - you  will find this in his speech yesterday - he

considers  the  Tamils  and the Malays  as  numerically

unimportant  in  Singapore and not what socialists  do:

into  economic classes. This will serve to explain  the

attitude  towards Nanyang University. They always  talk

about  external  influences in Chinese  textbooks,  for

instance.  But  they never talk about British  colonial

influences,  in text-books used in the English  schools

and  printed by British commercial firms in  Singapore.

Due to a wrong analysis of the basic contradictions  of

our  society,  the Nantah (Nanyang University)  problem

has resolved itself into a deadlock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we do not believe that language separates us. We believe in a united Malayan nation of all races.

A  society is not divided into the languages  that  the

people speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our attitude towards education is this: we stand for

real  equal  treatment  in  all  the  four  streams  of

education. We consider the fundamental conflict in  our

society  as  an  economic  problem,  and  not  one   of

language. We do not deny, that when Malay is  made  the

national  language, the present language barriers  will

be  removed. But the conflict in the language  barriers

is  not  fundamental.  We need a  phased  programme  of

targets  to  be  reached in order  to  make  Malay  the

national language. We believe in Malayanisation of  all

text-books step by step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the effort to promote industries in

Singapore. But how can we promote industries within the

present  political  context?  Industrialisation  is  in

direct  conflict  with the interests  of  the  colonial

power.  This is what the Party manifesto said  in  1955

about industrialisation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The need for industrialisation has been stressed even

by  advocates of colonialism. Yet very little has  been

done  about  it,  and very little besides  the  highest

exhortations  will  be  done so long  as  the  colonial

structure  is  maintained in Malaya.  The  colonialists

primarily regarded it as an outlet for the manufactured

goods of the mother country. The colonial power cannot,

therefore,  be  expected to be enthusiastic  about  the

setting  up  of local industries which might  seriously

affect the import of manufactured goods from the mother

country."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



The Party manifesto went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the Constitutional concessions granted so far

have   been   particularly  careful  to   protect   and

perpetuate  the basic economic and political  interests

of  the colonial power. The retention of basic colonial

interests runs through all Constitutional arrangements.

since the reoccupation in 1945."



<br><br>At  present,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, investment  policy  is

concentrated on how to attract foreign investors. We do

not  reject foreign investors, but concentration should

be  on  how to encourage local businessmen to  turn  to

industries.  Local  investors  should  be  given   more

favourable  treatment than foreign investors,  and  not

the other way round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

mentioned that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government does not wish to give the impression

that  there  have  not been mistakes  and  shortcomings

during the past year."



<br><br>Mr Speaker, this was repeated by the Prime Minister in

his speech yesterday [Straits Times of 4th August]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Minor mistakes of haste, born out of impatience to

put  the world right, were committed. They were errors,

not  of  the  rashness of the policy to be implemented,

but  of  the  intemperate haste in  not  preparing  and

carrying  the  people, and could have been  avoided  by

consultation and discussion."'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, what I gathered from the Prime Minister's address  on  the policy speech and from a recent  Petir

editorial is that these mistakes are not on fundamental

principles but mistakes of triviality - going a  bit  too

fast  on  legislation. It means that the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Law,  who, as I have  said  just  now,  is

another  possible scapegoat, has gone  ahead  with  too

many pieces of legislation during the past year. It  is

not  so much with the laws themselves as with the speed

with which they were passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are different. We are not worried about these little mistakes of technicalities and form,

because  no  person can avoid these little mistakes  in

running  his Ministry. What we are more concerned  with

are   the  mistakes  of  the  content  of  policy   and

fundamentals.  If  we  are sincere  in  rectifying  our

mistakes,  then  we  rectify  mistakes  of  policy  and

fundamentals,  such as reaffirming  the  faith  of  the

present Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



in  the  revolutionary manifesto of  the  P.A.P.;

reaffirming   the   faith  in  the   struggle   against

colonialism,  and  all the aims  and  policies  of  the

P.A.P. before it formed the Government;  fighting  for

the  detainees  of  the Internal  Security  Council  to

release them without conditions. I made my stand  clear

in  a  meeting on 28th August, 1959. Since then I  have

not been allowed to speak any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-register the trade unions without conditions. What

was  said by others yesterday was not, I believe,  what

happened..  Mr Speaker, in the Straits Times  of  25th

May, 1960, the Minister for Labour and Law gave reasons

for the de-registration of trade unions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Byrne gave two reasons for the Government's

action.  He  said, `There should be  no registration  of

any  federation  of  trade unions  within  any  of  the

categories of unions set out under the new Trade Unions

Ordinance, 1960, until the Ordinance has become law.'"



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  these reasons were later  withdrawn  and substituted because, if they had persisted,  the  Trade

Unions  Ordinance would become law some time or  other;

perhaps  it would not become law in May, but  in  June,

July,  August, or even September, and they  would  then

have  to  restore the unions' registration. So  in  the

meantime  they  had  to  think out  another  reason,  a

"really   good  sound"  reason - the  Internal   Security

Council, which always comes in useful. Anybody  in  the

trade   union  movement  knows  that  the  two  reasons

contradict each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gambling Bills reversed the P.A.P.'s taxation

policy, and is meant to tax the poor and subsidise  the

rich;  not to tax the rich and subsidise the poor.  Mr

Speaker,  there  are several types of  government.  The

British   capitalist  government  taxes  the  rich   to

subsidise  the poor. They follow the Keynesian  theory.

Our  so-called socialist Government taxes the  poor  to

subsidise the rich.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectify all the mistakes as enumerated in the Hong Lim

resolutions. You cannot fight these political issues by

intimidation on a scale bigger than that of the Lim Yew

Hock government, by suppression and by temptation.  For

instance,  you  cannot just ring up the Press  after  a

Badminton Hall rally and order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



them   to  black  out  the  speeches  made,  and  after

protestations  by the Press, allow them  to  limit  the

speeches  to 500 words. Yesterday I mentioned that  Mr

Thomson's articles in the Press are not limited to  500

words.  In the Nanyang Siang Pau, Mr Thomson wrote  an

article  on the Police Force, propounding his  colonial

political philosophy, and that article is not less than

2,500 words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government does not ring up the Nanyang

Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh and say, "Boys,  500

words  for  Mr  Thomson, and Mr Ong  Eng  Guan  1,000

words."  Spicy words! "For Mr Thomson, you  can  write

any amount of words you like. For Mr Ong Eng Guan, 500

words  or 300 words." I wonder what is going to be  the

directive tonight? I am sure it might be 1,000  or  750

words.  At  one  of our Press conferences  one  Sunday,

there  was  much bargaining: 300 words, 500 words,  750

words, and later, after much bargaining on the counter,

1,250 words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot win the political battle by detaining a

journalist  15 minutes after he had attended  my  Press

conference  on  his way to cable my Press  releases  to

Kuala  Lumpur,  so that you can use him  to  intimidate

other  journalists. You cannot win the political battle

by  sending  C.I.D. and other people to the  houses  of

Party members.

remember that he is addressing the Speaker. The use  of

the second person might confuse us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I must apologise to

you.  You  are a very nice gentleman. "You"  means  the

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is also a relic of

colonialism!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Prime Minister cannot win by

sending C.I.D. and other people to the houses of  Party

members   to   intimidate  them.  He  cannot   win   by

intimidating  the  printing  press  which   prints   my

speeches  which  were blacked out by  the  local  Press

according to the Government instructions. The proof  is

here.  Could I read it out, Mr Speaker? The proprietor

is the Chip Bee Press, and it is dated 26th July, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am directed to draw your attention to the following

sections of the Printing Press Ordinance:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5.-(l) Every document printed within the State of

Singapore shall have printed legibly on its first or

last printed leaf the name of its printer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No person shall print or publish or distribute or

assist in distributing any document which does not

comply with the requirements of this section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.-(1) No person shall print or publish or assist in

the printing or publishing of any newspaper in the

State of Singapore unless the proprietor of such

newspaper has previously obtained a permit in writing

under the hand of the Minister authorizing the printing

and publication thereof, which permit he may, at his

discretion, grant, refuse, or revoke, or grant subject

to conditions to be endorsed thereon."



<br><br>and to point out that you have not complied with the

said Ordinance in connection with the printing by you

of the pamphlet "How to fight colonialism" containing

public lectures held at the Singapore Badminton Hall on

Tuesday, 12th July, 1960.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, even until

yesterday  the  said  Chip  Bee  Press  was  publishing

material supplied to it by the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, this is not a good

reply,  because  the proprietor of the Chip  Bee  Press

refused  to  be intimidated. Of course, it  is  at  the

discretion of the Lee Kuan Yew Government to cancel his

printing   licence.  It  is  very  simple.  When   the

proprietor  comes to renew his licence, the  Government

can  put all sorts of troubles and restrictions in  his

way. It is very simple. They can say, "Why do you print

this  piece  of paper from the Member for Hong  Lim?  I

will teach you a good lesson."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, this letter is in connection with

"How  to  fight colonialism", printed by the  Chip  Bee

Press, Singapore. This letter contains two points. One,

every  document must bear the name of the printer.  And

C.B.P. means, in short form, the Chip Bee Press. And if

this  letter does not contain it, how can the  Ministry

of  Home Affairs have written to the proprietor of  the

Chip Bee Press? The other point is that the printing of

a  newspaper requires the obtaining of a licence.  But,

Mr  Speaker, I am not printing a newspaper. This is  a

pamphlet - it is free of charge - and I thought I have sent

you a copy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for Hong

Lim  should drag the Speaker into this debate.  Anyway,

it  seems  to me that the Member is, in fact, embarking

on  details which are quite irrelevant to what  we  are

discussing today. He will have to satisfy me that those

details are, in fact, relevant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



But  up  till  now I am inclined to say that  they  are

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. What I

have  got  printed  by the Chip Bee  Press  was  not  a

newspaper. It was a pamphlet. And this letter from  the

Ministry also mentioned "pamphlet".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister cannot win by offering jobs back to those P.A.P. members whom he has sacked

from the S.I.T. He can only win by one course - by going

back to the pre-1959 May, pre-election days, if that is

ever  possible  with  him. We are  sitting  here  today

because the Prime Minister has forced us to sit here.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that part ought to be

cured. The fact is that the hon. Member and the Members

for  Punggol and Aljunied are sitting on the Opposition

benches  because  of the decision of the  Speaker.  The

Speaker  received information from the  Leader  of  the

House that the three Members are no more Members of the

Government Party. So, acting under the powers given  to

the Speaker in the Standing Orders, he has decided that

the  three  Members will have in future to sit  on  the

Opposition Bench.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

been  misunderstood. What I have been trying to  convey

to  the House is the political nature of the change  of

seats  not  the physical nature, nor the constitutional

nature.   If  the  Prime  Minister  and  his  erstwhile

colleague, the Minister for Finance, had not controlled

the  gun,  then the position in this House today  would

have  been  different. That is  what  I  am  trying  to

convey.  If  the Prime Minister had acted according  to

the  rule  of  law,  the  Party  Constitution  and  the

democratic process, then the situation today would have

been  basically and radically different, and  we  would

not  be here on this side. The people of Singapore know

at  this  very hour who represent the true P.A.P.  They

know  that  the  Prime Minister and  the  Minister  for

Finance represent colonial interests and that they have

betrayed the revolution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  introduction of the constructive and inspiring

policy  speech delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

on  behalf of the PAP. Government, it was necessary  to

emphasise  the  limitations under which the  Government

had  to work. This has to be brought home to the people

in   order   to  make  them  understand  the  political

situation and the political problem in Singapore today.

These  limitations were clearly defined by  the  P.A.P.

before  the  elections. The elected Government  has  to

operate  under  a constitution which did  not  give  it

complete  freedom  and  political  power.  The   P.A.P.

realises that Singapore, being a small island  with  no

natural  resources, and dependent on the non-productive

trading  economy for its livelihood, cannot be expected

to become a socialist society overnight, and as long as

Singapore is separated from the Federation. Knowing the

political  and  economic limitations,  the  P.A.P. has

accepted the reins of Government so that we can advance

the  course  of  the  people as  stated  in  our  Party

manifesto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have said is nothing new, but

has  been repeatedly said by my Party, by my colleagues

and  even by my ex-colleague, the Member for Hong  Lim.

It is not my intention either to bore you or this House

by repeating it over and over again, but I particularly

wish to stress this point, because there are forces  in

Singapore  today, forces which the Prime  Minister  has

termed  Left-wing adventurers, who are trying  to  lead

the  people  astray  by desperately  shouting  that  we

should abandon the Constitution and reopen fresh  talks

with the U.K. Government; Left-wing adventurers who are

out  to  bring chaos to this country and misery to  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Speaker, and just now, I was watching

the  performance of my ex-comrade, the Member for  Hong

Lim. He was never so fiery in all the 14 months he came

to this Chamber. What a change, Mr Speaker! Yesterday,

the  Member for Hong Lim brought volumes of the Hansard

and reminded the Secretary-General of my Party what he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



had  said  over  a number of years. I am confident  the

Secretary-General of my Party knows the  stand  of  the

Party and what he has said over the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you will permit me, I would like to quote the speech by the Member for Hong Lim which he

delivered in this House at the opening session of  this

Assembly.  The words which he spoke will reply  to  his

fiery speeches today. It is at col. 347 of the Hansard,

Vol. 11, No. 6 of 21st July, 1959:



<br><br><!--Mr Ong Eng Guan-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b>  Mr  Speaker,  the Rendel Constitution  is  now

dead. We have today in this Assembly on your right hand

side  43  representatives of the people  of  Singapore.

Although  the Rendel Constitution as a constitution  is

now  dead, we have still remnants of the Rendel era and

the pre-Rendel era in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship which the captain and his crew under the

Rendel  Constitution have navigated for four years  has

now  sunk, and a new ship - the State of Singapore - is now

being manned by a strong, youthful and virile crew  and

this  ship, we are confident, will chart and  pave  the

way  to  all  the  hopes to which we  the  people  have

aspired for many years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we understand the limitations of the present Constitution, which do restrain the political

power of the elected representatives of the people.  We

do  understand those limitations. We do understand that

the  elected  Government  has to  work  within  certain

defined   powers   and  that  there   are   curbs   and

restrictions  on  those powers and  functions  which  a

normal   fully  elected  Government  is   supposed   to

exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we also understand that within the island state of Singapore, we also have limitations on our

economy,  limitations  which  even  a  magician  turned

Minister  for Finance cannot solve. I do  not  envy  my

colleague,  the  Minister for Finance,  for  his  heavy

tasks.  But  we  the P.A.P., understanding  those  very

limitations,  have  come  up  today  and  accepted  the

responsibilities  of  Government because  there  is  no

choice left to the people. For many years, particularly

during  the past four years, we have seen that  it  was

nothing  but inefficiency, waste, corruption and  filth

everywhere.  The masses cannot get what they  want - even

the  basic  necessities  which  any  modern  Government

should  be able to provide. And it is the task  of  the

PAP.  Government knowing the political and the economic

limitations  of the present situation, to come  up  and

accept the responsibility of this Government, as we did

so  in  the  City  Council. When we were  in  the  City

Council,   our  powers  were  as  limited  within   the

framework of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



Constitution   as  our  powers  now  in   the   present

Government are limited within the present framework  of

the  new  Constitution. But we will be taking  a  wrong

move  if  we  refuse  to accept the  responsibility  of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are working..."-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.

Member  is  going to read the whole speech. If  he  is,

then,  of course, he is completely out of order. He  is

only permitted to read extracts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, if you will permit

me  to read certain parts of the speech. I am not going

to  read the whole speech, but only certain parts of it

to draw out my -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Only extracts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, we are working the Constitution hoping

that the day will soon dawn on our people when we shall

breathe the fresh air of freedom as our brethren in the

Federation and other parts in Asia do breathe. Our  way

is the way of ultimate independence through merger with

the Federation, and before that is achieved we have  to

accept   whatever  limitations  are  imposed  on   this

Government       by       the       so-called       new

Constitution - limitations imposed on us in  this  island

State with no raw materials.".



<br><br>And then he goes on by saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the limitations of the Constitution, the

role of the Opposition is even much more important than

ever.   The  role  of  the  Opposition  is  to  provide

constructive criticism to the Government and  not  just

to attack the Government in all its policies.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, time has changed and so has the Member for Hong Lim. It would not be a surprise if he were to

say that he did not write his speech. He was forced  to

read  it. He did not believe all this when he spoke  in

this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are forces that stay in this country today which believe that Singapore's economic

ills can be cured by shouting anti-colonial slogans and

abandoning  the present Constitution now. They  believe

by shouting anti-colonial slogans and abandoning the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



Constitution  the workers will automatically  get  more

dollars tomorrow. The taxi-drivers and the hawkers will

earn  more money. The farmer's hen will lay the  golden

egg.    More    schools,   hospitals   and   employment

opportunities could be found. The P.A.P. Government has

no  intention of leading the people of Singapore  to  a

national suicide. The P.A.P. Government has stated that

it  has no intention of recklessly abandoning the  aims

and policies arrived at after long deliberations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Member for Hong Lim honestly believe that

with his 16 resolutions the people of Singapore with an

empty  stomach can defeat colonialism? No, Mr Speaker,

the  Party  has stated that the anti-colonial  struggle

requires more flexible and effective tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the basic problem in Singapore today is to find expanding opportunities for our youth, and only

economic  and  industrial  expansion  can  solve   this

problem.  The  people  of  Singapore  today  need  more

expanding opportunities for employment. Schools, health

services  and  housing - and  this  is  what  the  P.A.P.

Government intends to do for the people in this year of

construction.  No  one can deny that  with  the  P.A.P.

Government there is now greater economic and  political

stability.  The  people no longer fear  the  Government

servants and the Government buildings. The large  crowd

that  swarm  the  Labour Ministry and the  Ministry  of

National Development is a demonstration of the people's

faith  and confidence in the P.A.P. Government to solve

their  problems. These people enter these buildings  no

longer  with fear but with dignity and national  pride.

The  previous  year,  as  has been  said,  was  one  of

reorganisation. Naturally it has not been able to  show

results  yet.  But  in the present year,  the  year  of

construction,  lots of things - constructive  plans - would

he  done  for  the  people. For  instance,  the  common

commodity  market  talks are being  held  now;  private

investments of 13 major concerns have applied under the

Pioneer  Industries Ordinance so that they  could  give

more jobs to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



people   in  Singapore;  the  Jurong  Industrialisation

Scheme and the Government's Five-Year Economic Plan - all

these schemes will be put into effect this year and the

coming years.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, from the speeches made yesterday

and today by the Prime Minister and the Member for Hong

Lim,  it appears to me that this Chamber is being  used

as   a  House  to  debate  Party  differences.  At  the

beginning,  I  was of the opinion that we were  wasting

time,  but the points brought up by the Prime  Minister

and  the  Member for Hong Lim reveal clearly  that  the

atmosphere in the P.A.P. is unhealthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should go into the main issue, that is, the speech

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. My Party and I are  of

the opinion that the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara is unsatisfactory. It is also unsatisfactory  to

the  public. It refers to what will be done and not  to

what  has  already been done. I have read the 24-column

speech  many times. What is most strange is that  there

is   no  mention  at  all  about  the  policy  of   the

Government. I have gone through the speech  in  detail,

but I have not come across the phrase "a non-Communist,

democratic  Malaya" which was previously  used  by  the

Prime Minister. It may be that since the speech of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara two weeks ago in this  Chamber,

there  has  been  a  change  in  the  attitude  of  the

Government.  It  is not positive in its  stand  on  the

political  situation in Singapore or in  Malaya  today.

Does  it  mean, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the  Government,

after  14  months  in office, has now awakened  to  the

danger  of  Communism  which  could  bring  about   its

downfall? Does it also mean that the Government,  after

14  months in office, has now only realised that  there

do  exist elements which constitute a source of  danger

to  it  and  to  the people of Singapore?  I  say  this

because the Prime Minister in his speech admitted  that

the Malayan Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



Party  is  re-organising its  forces  with  a  view  to

damaging  the economy and the trade union  movement  in

Singapore. If this is the state of affairs in Singapore

today, then I think it would be most propitious for the

Government  to change its attitude from  that  of  non-Communist to that of anti-Communist-Then only would  it

mean  that the Government is positive in its  stand.  I

feel that we should be frank and honest. The Government

has  always been harping on the fact that it is a  non-Communist  Government and that their actions show  that

they  are anti-Communist. Is there another side to  the

picture?  Could it mean that the Government will  still

adopt  a non-Communist attitude but that outside forces

will  put  pressure  on the Government  to  take  anti-Communist steps? I think the Government should  clarify

their stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Prime Minister has said that the

object  of  the  Government  is  to  establish  a  non-Communist, socialist Malaya. My Party and I are of  the

opinion  that  it  is  difficult for  us  to  create  a

socialist Malaya until the people of Singapore  feel  a

sense  of loyalty to the State. This is the fundamental

issue  in all independent countries in Asia and Africa.

We  have  seen the different `isms' put into  practice:

Communism,  Socialism  and  Liberalism.  But  the  most

important  factor is that the people of the State  must

feel  a  sense  of national pride. If no  such  feeling

could  be  aroused among the people, it is not possible

for  us  to  create  any kind of  `ism' - whether  it  is

Communism  or  Socialism.  In  this  connection,   this

national feeling is akin to a tree. If the roots of the

tree are not watered, it will die.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G.KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to the

economy  of the State of Singapore. The Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  in  his  speech  has said  that  the  State  of

Singapore  is  now  more stable both  economically  and

politically. I do not see how the Government can arrive

at such a conclusion. It is clear and obvious that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



the  economy  of  Singapore  at  this  moment  is  very

unhealthy. Thousands of people are unemployed. We  have

heard  in this Chamber that not less than 58,000 people

have  registered for employment in the Labour Exchange.

The  Government has failed to give a guarantee  to  the

effect  that  the  58,000 registered unemployed  people

will  be given employment. Furthermore, there are  many

thousands of unemployed persons who have not registered

for employment. In all, there are not less than 100,000

people in Singapore who are out of job. Normally,  when

the prices of rubber and tin are high, Singapore stands

to  benefit, although these commodities come  from  the

Federation of Malaya. But today, although the prices of

rubber  and  tin are high, yet the people of  Singapore

are not enjoying the prosperity that is experienced  by

the  people  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya.  In  this

connection,  how  can  the  Government  say  that   the

economic stability of Singapore is healthy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to speak at

length  on the City Council, but I would like  to  draw

the attention of the Members of the House to an article

in  the  P.A.P.  Petir and in other newspapers  clearly

pointing out that the previous Government did  not  use

its  dictatorial powers when it took over the functions

of  the City Council, although at that time there  were

many  allegations  levelled  at  the  then  Government.

However,  there is one question which I would  like  to

put  to  the  Prime  Minister himself.  When  will  the

Government establish the Public Utilities Board to  run

the utility services? This is not a new suggestion,  as

it  was  decided by a Committee (formed by the previous

Government in 1956) on which members of the P.A.P. also

sat. We would like clarification from the Government as

to when this Board will come into existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, the speech

of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is most unsatisfactory to

U.M.N.O. in respect of the special position  of  the

Malays.  Yesterday, my colleague the Member for Kampong

Kembangan spoke at length on this subject, and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>





would  like to add further to what he has said. In  the

speech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  there  is  no

mention  at  all  about  the special  position  of  the

Malays.  However, I am confident, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  that  the Government can implement the provisions

contained in the preamble to the Constitution. But what

the  Government has done during the past 14  months  is

far  from  satisfactory. In the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, no mention has been made as to how  the

Government  is going to put into effect the  provisions

in  the Constitution which was agreed upon by U.M.N.O.,

the Labour Front, the Liberal-Socialists and the P.A.P.

as  a  result of the constitutional talks in London  in

1957  and  1958. The Hon. the Prime Minister and  other

Members  of the P.A.P. have said that the Malays  would

be helped in the field of education. I agree with that,

but  this should not mean that this is the only way  we

could  render  assistance to the Malays.  Education  is

good  and  beneficial for our children who will  become

adults  in  the  future. But what about the  Malays  in

general  today - those who are out  of  job  and  possess

nothing?  Are these people to be victimised?  What  are

the ways and means by which the Government proposes  to

help   these  people  who  are  suffering?  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, it is well known that Malays are  unable

to  get  jobs in commercial firms, except a few British

commercial firms which are prepared to offer employment

to  the  Malays. We know that a great majority  of  the

traders in Singapore refuse to offer employment to  the

Malays   for  Unknown  reasons  except  as   syces   or

gardeners. Therefore, the Malays are forced to turn  to

the Government for help. The Malays are forced to leave

their  fate  in the hands of the Government. Therefore,

it  should  be the responsibility of the Government  to

offer jobs and help to the Malays in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that as far as the Malays are concerned,

Government  will  relax  the terms  of  employment  and

conditions governing promotion of serving officers. The

Prime Minister, in his speech, has said that in view of

the shortage of staff in the Government service, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



right  and  proper  that  academic  qualifications  for

employment be relaxed. Therefore, it will be  in  order

for  Government  to relax the terms of entry  into  the

civil service, as far as the Malays are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, on the question of housing, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech has said that the

Government  will construct 52,000 units at  a  cost  of

$210 million. I hope that this expenditure will not  be

concentrated only on the building of flats at  Kallang,

Queenstown,  and like places, but also that  Government

will  set aside a portion of this sum on projects  like

the Jalan Eunos Resettlement, where houses are sold  to

the poorer Malays on an instalment basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of health, I have just received the

report  of the Ministry of Health for the year 1958.  I

have  read the chapter on Infant Mortality, and  it  is

clearly  seen  that infant deaths are 35  per  thousand

among  the  Chinese,  and  40 per  thousand  among  the

Indians.  But in the case of the Malays, I am surprised

to find that out of every thousand infants born, 85 die

before  they  reach the age of one year.  Therefore,  I

would  ask  the  Minister for  Health  to  institute  a

committee to investigate this high mortality rate,  and

to put up views and suggestions to Government as to how

to resolve this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now turn to the subject of the Alsagoff Estate. Not long ago I raised a question

in  this Chamber as to what were Government's plans  in

regard  to this estate. Then I was of the opinion  that

Alsagoff Estate would soon be sold and the position  of

the  residents there would be helpless. It is therefore

proper  that Government should draw up a plan  to  look

after the interests of the residents. But at that  time

the Minister for Finance replied to the effect that  he

had  no  information  whatsoever that  Alsagoff  Estate

would  be sold. Until about five months ago, Government

was  not able to do anything about it. The position  of

the  residents  there is akin to  that  of  the  people

living  in Nee Soon, where the tenure is very insecure.

So, I hope that Government, in its Five-Year Plan, will

spend part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



the   money   voted  for  reconstruction  purposes   in

purchasing  this  estate, cutting  it  into  lots,  for

ultimate sale on instalments to the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will speak on the Islam religion. The Yang

di-Pertuan Negara in his speech said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government will introduce comprehensive

legislation  for the regulation of Muslim marriage  and

divorce  and Muslim religious affairs on the  lines  of

legislation in the States of the Federation of Malaya."



<br><br>This   is  ideal  and  good.  This  time  I  hope  that

Government, in introducing such legislation, will  give

ample  time to the Opposition for study, and that  free

copies of the legislation translated into Malay will be

given  to  the Muslims in Singapore so that they  could

closely  follow  the  legislation  that  affects  their

religion.  And  I also hope that Government  will  take

into  account  the  matter  of  zakats  and  wakafs  in

Singapore,  because such matters are now in  a  chaotic

state,   and  should  receive  the  attention  of   the

Government.  The  Government  also  should   base   its

proposed legislation on the lines of legislation in the

States of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>4.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion of thanks moved by the Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his motion, the Prime Minister has given a

critical  review of the past and a bold  and  realistic

analysis  of  the  future. It is my fervent  hope  that

Members  of  the Opposition would study this  excellent

piece   of  political  discourse  so  as  to  at  least

understand  the political forces at work in  Singapore.

Whether they agree or disagree with the P.A.P. stand is

immaterial.  But what is important is that they  should

be  aware  of  the  existence of a  perpetual  struggle

between  the forces of the extreme Left and the extreme

Right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party is a socialist Party,

pledged  to  eliminate  the unjustness  of  a  colonial

society  and the exploitation of man by man. We believe

in the principles of socialism and of the building of a

more just and egalitarian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



society. It is therefore out of the question to  expect

the  P.A.P. to  move  to  the extreme  Right  and,  as

suggested by the hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan,  to

adopt  a  fanatical anti-Communist stand. On the  other

hand,   the  methods  of  bloody  revolution   and   of

totalitarianism  of the extreme Left convulse  us  with

horror. We value too much the democratic ways of  life,

the  freedom of the individual, the privileges  of  the

people,  to  be governed by a government of  their  own

choice.  It  becomes  therefore  equally  out  of   the

question  to expect the P.A.P. to join hands  with  the

Communist forces towards its own extinction.  We  stand

for  what  we believe in, and we do so with a firm  and

unshakeable  conviction  for the  establishment  of  an

independent,   democratic,   non-Communist,   socialist

Malaya.  As the Communists believe that history  is  on

their  side, so do we believe that history  is  on  our

side.   This  belief  is  evolved  not  out  of   cheap

plagiarism,  but  out  of  a scientific  and  realistic

analysis of the special conditions obtaining in  Malaya

in   relation   to  the  tendencies  of   international

political  trends.  In so far as the present  political

leadership of Soviet Russia dismisses the idea that war

would  inevitably  lead  to a  Communist  victory  `and

Communist   expansion,  we  believe  that   present-day

Marxists are capable of moving and modifying their ways

with  the change of times. The present deadlock in  the

cold  war cannot be sustained forever. There must be  a

third  force  to  resolve these  two  antagonistic  and

opposing forces in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaya, we believe that non-Communist socialism is

the  answer. We believe this with such deep  conviction

that  it would be hopeless for either the extreme  Left

or  the  extreme  Right to coerce us  into  any  unholy

alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spoken but on very few occasions in this

House,  it is my privilege, of not only being  unlikely

to  be  misquoted  or  quoted out of  context  both  in

relation to time and text, but also of remembering what

I  have  said  in  this House. On one  occasion  I  was

reputed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



to  have  used  language that got  past  the  excellent

parliamentary  vigilance  of  the  Speaker.  I  vividly

remember that during the last Budget session,  I  spoke

on  the  need  for the Opposition not to  use  alarmist

tactics,  not  to make mountains out of molehills,  and

not  to  delude the people with false alarms and  half-truths.  I  am indeed sad to note, Sir, that my  advice

has  fallen  upon  barren soil. I  have  always  prided

myself  on  being somewhat popular with ladies  of  all

ages, and of all sizes! In consequence I have developed

a  human  virtue, or feeling, or whatever you may  call

it,   of   chivalry.  Notwithstanding   this   acquired

disposition, I find it hard to let some of the  remarks

made  by  the  Member for Mountbatten pass  by  without

comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer again to her alarmist antics, though I must

admit  to  remaining  a  silent  admirer  of  her  very

Carnegiean eloquence and pedagogic ease with which  she

handles the Queen's English, puns and all. She kept  on

harping  about  the  fleeing of capital,  even  to  the

absurdity of suggesting that the P.A.P. Government  was

incompetent and not fit to govern, and that Members  of

the  P.A.P.  Government were but political playboys.  I

wish she would understand the realism of politics or at

least  the realism of everyday life. I find it ironical

that  I have to explain to a matured schoolteacher with

rich experience that people resist change, and that  to

every  action  there  must be  an  equal  and  opposing

reaction,  and  that  we cannot  and  must  not  expect

capitalists to love socialists. In fact, only 14 months

after  a socialist victory in the elections, Government

have  not only managed to stop the out-flow of  capital

from   the   country  but  actually   induced   private

investment in Singapore. This is eloquent testimony  to

the  ability of the P.A.P. leadership to respond to the

needs of our people and of our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, Sir, the advent of a socialist

government  is  followed  by  a  transitory  unsettling

period.  This period has been universal and consistent.

Every  socialist government, be it the first Government

of  the  United Kingdom or of Australia or New Zealand,

has    had    to    face    difficulties    with    the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



commercial world and the civil service. In Singapore in

particular, we have a civil service the upper  echelons

of which are geared to a British standard of living and

way  of life, whilst the labouring classes stagnate  at

the Asian level. The unsettling effect must necessarily

be expected to be both exaggerated and prolonged. It is

hard  to  expect  a  class of individuals,  with  newly

acquired  privileges and pleasures, to  jettison  these

privileges  and  pleasures overnight.  There  has  been

sufficient  dissertation  on  the  philosophy  of   the

English-educated elite, of which I am one, that I would

not wish to repeat the arguments in this House. Suffice

it  to  mention regretfully that most of  the  English-educated  elite,  nurtured  by  a  colonial  education,

confused  by  capitalist-controlled English newspapers,

and  deluded  by  promises of the previous  government,

were  not protagonists of the silent revolution led  by

the  P.A.P. and  inspired by the  Asian  revolutionary

fervour.  The  natural tendency and response  of  these

people   to  a  P.A.P.  Government  was  to  quit,   if

alternative employment was available and in the case of

the    more   highly   paid   Government   officers - the

doctors - not   only  was  there  the   availability   of

alternative employment, but there was also the lucre of

private  practice. This clearly gives the  lie  to  the

statement  of  the  Member  for  Mountbatten - that   the

Minister for Health has only one will, and that is  the

will  to  see doctors resign from the service.  On  the

contrary,  every effort is being made to encourage  the

doctors to remain in the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be pertinent here, Sir, to mention that the

doctors  are  the  first  to  be  offered  professional

allowances.  In fact, the professional allowances  were

negotiated by the doctors to their benefit, so much  so

that  the  other  professional officers  became  rather

unhappy. The professional allowances payable are: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$225 for officers receiving a basic salary of $1,000

and above;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150 for officers receiving a basic salary between

$900 and $1,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$75 for officers receiving below $900.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary scale of medical officers commences at $820

per  month, while the other professional officers start

at  somewhere around $600. Therein lies the  grudge  of

the  other  professional officers. They take  a  longer

time to reach the maximum of $225 allowances per month.

The  Government is also aware that many  of  our  local

officers are keen to go overseas for higher studies and

postgraduate  qualifications. Because of  the  relative

shortage  of medical staff, they have to be held  back.

Plans  have  therefore been set  afoot  to  solve  this

shortage  by recruiting doctors overseas, so  that  our

own  doctors may not be deprived of the opportunity  to

specialise.  In this respect, I am pleased to  announce

that  plans  are ahead for the recruitment  of  doctors

from Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed happy to say that today the unsettled

period  is over, both in the world of commerce  and  in

the  civil service. The English-educated, despite their

lack  of  revolutionary fervour, has many  virtues.  In

general,  the English-educated is more liberal  and  is

non-communal  in  outlook.  In  particular,  the  civil

service  is  diligent, intelligent and  able  to  adapt

themselves  to  the circumstances and  respond  to  the

needs of the people. In the Ministry of Health, we have

the fullest co-operation from all our staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise for

the  benefit  of  the Opposition in  general,  and  the

Member  for  Mountbatten  in particular,  that  in  the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the opening  of

this Parliamentary session, the grammatical tenses must

necessarily  be  prevalent in  the  future  tense.  Any

government,  to  stress on the past in  such  speeches,

would indeed be a dead duck.



<br><br><!--Mr G. Kandasamy-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G. Kandasamy)</b>: Order. Is it  a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was both

amused  and  amazed to hear the Member for  Mountbatten

touch on Utopian socialism when she got carried away by

her  flight  of  rhetoric  on standpipes.  I  stand  to

correction, Sir, but I do recall that she said that the

solution to the criminal and sinful waste of water  due

to  abuse  of public stand-pipes can be, and  will  be,

solved  by  installing water pipes in  each  and  every

household. Perchance she is unaware that housewives and

householders  do  not allow water to  flow  freely  and

unnecessarily from their water pipes because the  waste

is  charged  in terms of dollars and cents; or  perhaps

she  was suggesting that Government should supply  free

water  to  all households. If so, the Government  would

also have to supply free electricity, free housing, and

free  transport.  It  all sounds  very  nice  and  very

Utopian.  But where do we stop? Who will foot the  bill

for these enlarged free social services?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan, in his usual long-windedness, spoke on things which he has always spoken

in  this  House.  The only new note he  struck  was  to

appeal to the P.A.P. in all his naive sincerity to drop

its non-Communist stand and adopt anti-Communism. It is

perhaps  asking too much of him to understand that  the

P.A.P. stands  for  non-Communist  socialism  out   of

conviction  and  belief, and not out of expedience  and

convenience. In his enthusiasm he allowed himself to be

carried  over  dangerous ground. And  he  affirmed  his

faith   in  communalism  which  the  Federation   Prime

Minister,   Tunku  Abdul  Rahman,  has   denounced   as

political  bigotry  and adventurism.  He  went  to  the

extent  of  quoting chapter and verse from  a  book  of

fiction to prove that the Malays founded Singapore. But

is  all this effort necessary when the special position

of  the Malays is already written into the preamble  of

our Constitution? Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir, in this era

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



enlightenment  and scientific advance, a person  should

be judged by his ability and capability, and not by the

house unto which he was born.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition has always suffered from political and

emotional  immaturity. Nor has the recent reinforcement

on the Opposition benches helped to remedy this defect.

Having been schooled not to accept a book by its cover,

I  had always thought that behind the youthful charm of

the  `Member  for  Hong Lim there lay hidden  political

maturity  and  judgment. His speech in  the  House  has

disabused  me  of this illusion. I cannot help  feeling

disappointed  to  hear  him  rant  on  colonialism  and

Malayanisation, in notes which sounded both  false  and

hollow. Disappointed -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the word "false" with

reference to a speech made by a Member of the  Assembly

is completely unparliamentary, and must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> When I referred to "false", I

referred to the tone of the speech, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the hon. Member should try

and  debate with the Speaker. I ask him to withdraw the

word "false".



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I withdraw the word "false"

unconditionally  as  the Speaker  demands  of  me,  and

perhaps -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope I am not being accused of

intimidation.  The point I want to make is  that  there

are  certain  Standing Orders which must be  obeyed  in

this  House,  and I, as Speaker, am here  to  see  that

those  Standing Orders are obeyed. The word "false"  is

unparliamentary and must be withdrawn unconditionally.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not

trying  to  debate  with you or  imply  that  you  were

unnecessarily harsh. I was merely complimenting you  on

your  very excellent parliamentary vigilance.  I  shall

now withdraw the word "false".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said I was disappointed because the Member for Hong

Lim saw fit to shout at us in this House slogans out of

context,  both in relation to time and space.  I  state

categorically that the P.A.P. is anti-colonialist.  But

we  are  realistic  enough to know  that  in  order  to

survive  the  inter-play of forces between the  extreme

Left   and  the  extreme  Right,  we  must  compromise.

Singapore  cannot  be  independent  by  itself,  either

politically or economically, unless with merger with  a

larger  entity.  I  am  sure the Member  for  Hong  Lim

realises this. As long as we cannot be independent,  we

have  no  other  choice  but to  accept  the  terms  of

internal  self-government. The alternative is political

suicide,  not  only for the People's Action  Party  but

also  for  the  people of Singapore. Unless  increasing

numbers  of  factory  chimneys  emit  smoke  into   the

Singapore   skyline,  unless  the  P.A.P. policy   of

industrial  peace with justice is made real,  socialism

and  independence  for Singapore will  have  to  remain

myths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim talked at length on

Malayanisation. Surely he should know  that  the  right

time and the right place to express his concern was  in

September  1955,  when  the Malayanisation  Commission,

chaired  by  my  friend,  teacher  and  colleague,  Dr

Sreenivasan,  was  in  session.  Surely  he  cannot  be

unaware  that  Malayanisation involves the  payment  of

compensation  to entitled expatriate officers.  May  I,

Sir,   quote  from  a  booklet  entitled  "Scheme   for

compensation for loss of career." Page 1, paragraph 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The object of the Retirement from the Public Service

(Compensation)  Ordinance,  1956,  is  to  permit   the

payment  of  compensation to certain  officers  of  the

Singapore  Government whose services may no  longer  be

required... The Ordinance is in effect a scheme to award

compensation  to  certain  categories  of  officers  in

respect   of  whom  the  Secretary  of  State  accepted

responsibility  when  they  were  appointed  and  whose

conditions  of  service  will have  been  fundamentally

altered."



<br><br>In the second paragraph of the same booklet, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to earned pension or gratuity in lieu,

entitled  officers who retire under the Ordinance  will

he eligible to receive compensation..."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 11, it again says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every entitled officer will be informed of his future

prospects by being sent with his option form  a  letter

either  requiring  him  to retire  or  offering  him  a

minimum period of assured further service in Singapore.

The  period  of  further service  may  subsequently  be

increased but will not be decreased."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Mr Speaker, Sir, the "period of further

service may subsequently be increased but will  not  be

decreased." Again quoting paragraph 25:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compensation is the capital amount paid for loss of

career  and will be calculated in accordance  with  the

Second  Schedule to the Ordinance. In brief,  the  lump

sum  is the product of an officer's total annual  fixed

emoluments  and any personal pensionable allowance  and

the  compensation factor appropriate  to  his  age  and

length of service."



<br><br>In paragraph 24, it again says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Section 19 of the Ordinance provides for loans

against  compensation. A loan must  not  exceed  three-quarters  of the compensation for which an  officer  is

eligible, and will be subject td interest at  the  rate

of one quarter per cent per mensem."



<br><br>And  it might be pertinent to mention, Sir, that in the

case  of  expatriate officers, most of them have  taken

this loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, it is not only illegal to

malayanise  any post prematurely, but gross  folly  and

indeed  brinkmanship  to  rid  the  country  of  expert

officers  after  having  paid  very  dearly  for  their

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be relevant again to note, Sir, that the

Malayanisation Commission, which was regarded to be too

Left  by the previous Government, stated in its interim

report.  I  quote,  Sir,  "The Interim  Report  of  the

Malayanisation Commission", page 13, paragraph 15:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caution must be exercised in the case of departments

whose needs require knowledge and skill so precise  and

exacting that anything less would invariably mean chaos

in  those departments. We have in mind departments like

the  Public  Works Department, Telecommunications,  the

Postal   Services   and  Civil  Aviation.   These   are

departments where inefficiency would mean chaos, but on

whose  efficient  running depend the  revenue  and  the

lives of people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 16, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Though we bore in mind that our task was to

Malayanise  as rapidly as possible we did not  hesitate

to  postpone or prolong the period of Malayanisation of

posts if that was in the best interests of Singapore."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



Surely,  Mr Speaker, Sir, the unnecessary resignations

of  engineers and architects from the P.W.D. cannot  be

construed  to  be  in the interest of Singapore  or  of

Malayanisation. The collapse of governmental  machinery

in  certain  newly  independent countries  must  surely

serve  as a warning note to us that we must not be  too

hasty  and  too rash in such matters as Malayanisation.

Let  us malayanise by all means, but let us not be  too

impatient  lest  black-outs become  a  regular  feature

again in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Member for Hong Lim ranted like Hitler.

Today  he  became  a petty vendor of  recklessness  and

sensationalism.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must be

careful   with  his  language.  I  think   that   whole

expression   must  be  withdrawn.  It   is   completely

unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I withdraw

that  statement and substitute thereto "a  merchant  of

inaccuracies"? I listened with horror when he sounded a

very  false - I  beg your pardon - I was in horror  when  I

heard  him  state that the Prime Minister said  at  the

conference  of the 18th of June of the P.A.P. that  if

the  British  troops  were  allowed  to  march  out  of

Singapore,  Indonesian troops would  march  in.  I  can

state  here,  Sir, that as a member of the  Secretariat

which   was   responsible  for  the  minutes   of   the

conference - and  I  say  so  on  behalf  of  the   whole

Secretariat  of the P.A.P. which were taking  down  the

minutes  of  that  meeting - that  no  such  things  were

mentioned  and  no  such  recklessness  was  committed.

Perhaps  the Member for Hong Lim, who has not  been  of

sufficiently  high  quality to merit  inch  columns  in

newspapers,  is taking the opportunity  of  ranting  in

this House, hoping that the newspapers will report  him

not  because he is the Member for Hong Lim but  because

he is saying this in the process of an Assembly debate.

I  state  here again, Sir, very categorically  that  no

such statements were made at the conference, and I  can

produce minutes to prove this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Geylang Serai in his speech again

harped  on  communalism.  Already  the  Government   is

providing  free  education at all  levels  for  Malays.

Already  all  privileges are given to  Malays  both  in

respect of higher studies and of employment, and  still

he  harps  on it. His latest technique is to  introduce

into this Assembly the very well-known infant mortality

rates  of the various races. The Malays have an  infant

mortality rate of 85 per thousand up to the age of  one

year.  Surely,  Sir, this cannot be attributed  to  any

mistake  of  the  present  Government.  Surely,  if  it

reflects  anything at all, it reflects  the  ineptitude

and   the  incompetence  of  the  previous  Government.

[Interruption] Why not? Of course, it must reflect  the

incompetence  of  the previous Government  because  the

figures   today   show   the  inefficiencies   of   the

administration yesterday. In any case,  there  is  very

little  that the present Government can do about  these

rates,  because the previous Government had not thought

it fit to teach the Malays the acceptance of the modern

methods of science and medicine. It is well known  that

the Malay is conservative in so far as Western medicine

is  concerned. He still believes in the bomoh and would

be  reluctant to go and see a doctor until a very  late

stage  when the doctor can do very little.  It  is  the

intention of the Government to educate these Malays  to

better  understand  that  the  facilities  provided  by

modern  medicine is in their interest. It  is  in  this

connection that we have stressed in the speech  of  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two Out-patient clinics will be opened at Jalan Kayu

and  Lim  Ah Pin Road. More Maternity and Child  Health

centres  will be built next year, particularly  in  the

rural areas.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the infant mortality rate is high for

.Malays  cannot be attributed to the lack of  provision

of doctors for curative care for the Malays, but to the

lack  of understanding and acceptance by the Malays  of

the  maternal and child health services in general.  It

is,  therefore,  the  intention of this  Government  to

increase the number of child welfare centres so  as  to

give  the Malays in the rural areas a better chance  to

be educated and a better chance to make use of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



facilities  offered  by  the  Government,  whose   only

interest is in the interest of the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the year that has passed has been one

of  sustained  activity in the promotion of  the  well-being of our growing working population. When the reins

of  political power passed into our hands just a little

more than a year ago, we boldly declared that we were a

Government  solidly on the side of the workers  and  we

have  by  our  actions in the past year honoured  every

word of that declaration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took immediate stock of the position and found that

much  of  the  past labour discontent was  due  to  the

failure  of the previous Government, i.e. the  Lim  Yew

Hock   Government,  to  implement  the  provisions   of

legislation which were enacted for the benefit  of  our

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of our expanded labour courts have spent

much  of  their  time in the last year adjudicating  on

individual  and union claims for arrears in respect  of

overtime, holiday pay, annual leave and other  benefits

of   which   our  workers  have  been  wrongfully   and

shamefully  deprived. These arrears in most cases  were

such  that if all defaulting employers were obliged  to

meet  the  full  extent of these claims,  most  of  the

smaller  employers would have been put out of business.

For  that reason, a Ministry directive had to be issued

to  the officials of our labour courts instructing them

to  limit  these  claims  for arrears  when  they  were

received, to a period of one year only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have had to issue directives to protect

certain employers from their own past wickedness, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the disputes which have taken place in the

past  year  have  not been over wage demands  but  over

retrenchment  and  temporary lay-offs.  Industries  are

sometimes  forced to take this action  because  of  the

fluctuation  in  the  demand  for  their  products   in

overseas  markets,  or because of a  shortage  or  non-availability  of  the raw materials they  require.  The

unions have, because of the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



surplus  of labour, resisted very strongly such  action

by  employers, and industrial peace, therefore,  cannot

be  maintained under such conditions until a remedy  is

found.  Immediate  attention  will  be  given  to   the

introduction  of  a  relief scheme in  respect  of  our

manufacturing  industries  so  that  workers  who   are

unfortunately retrenched or temporarily laid  off  will

be  provided with temporary relief funds to  tide  them

over the period when they are retrenched until they get

new  employment; or when they are laid off, until  they

are re-employed. It is obvious, Sir, that such a relief

scheme,  if it is to be successful, must be limited  to

manufacturing  industries  which  are   tied   to   the

Government's industrial expansion programme. Commercial

enterprises which engage only in the import and  export

trade   as   well  as  banking,  insurance,   shipping,

transport  and  other such concerns  will  have  to  be

excluded  from the scheme. In circumstances  where  the

relief scheme is applicable, the funds will be provided

by  contributions  from both employers  and  employees.

There will have to be a minimum contribution period and

a  maximum  benefit period. An official well versed  in

the  operation of such a scheme will be recruited under

the  Colombo Plan to advise on how such a scheme should

be  set up and to set up the machinery required for the

operation of the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the industrial expansion

programme of the Government gets under way, there  will

have  to  be  closer liaison between the  planning  and

organising side of industry and the Ministry itself  so

that  the  Ministry will know in advance the  potential

labour  requirements of industry and will  be  able  to

adjust  the  supply  of labour accordingly.  When  such

liaison  is  established, it will be possible  for  the

Ministry to know well in advance which industry will be

laying off staff and which will be requiring more staff

within  a  foreseeable period of such things happening,

and  planned  switches can therefore be  arranged.  For

this  purpose a section will be set up in the  Ministry

which  will offer to labour and employers an  efficient

Labour Market Information Service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



which  will  help to reduce and minimise  the  hardship

which  labour at present often experiences  when  large

numbers of employees are suddenly laid off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Exchange will be considerably improved

so that employers will be encouraged to make fuller use

of  the  facilities which it offers  by  placing  their

labour requirements with the Exchange. Legislation will

be  introduced later in the year to make it an  offence

for  any  person,  who  is already  in  employment,  to

register  as a job seeker, and registered job  seekers,

who  find jobs either through the Exchange or on  their

own  account,  will be required by law  to  notify  the

Exchange  so  that  their names can be  taken  off  the

register.  The use of the Exchange by persons  in  part

employment  or seeking a change of job will thereby  be

prohibited.  Those whose names have long  been  on  the

register  without finding jobs either because  of  age,

physical  disability or because of lack of aptitude  or

skills  will  be regarded as unemployable and  will  be

taken  off  the  register. Their needs will  be  better

served  through  Public  Assistance  than  through  the

Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers will also be taken under legislation to be

introduced   to  require  all  employers  who   propose

employing  non-citizens to notify the  manager  of  the

Exchange  of their intentions and to obtain  the  prior

approval of the Ministry before they can proceed to  do

so.  There  will be simplification of the documentation

required for record purposes, and classification of the

records will be made on the basis of the answers  given

at  interviews. The questions asked at these interviews

will be designed to elicit the information required for

a  proper  classification to be made. At a later  stage

when  the  Exchange is more up-to-date,  trade  testing

will be resorted to so that in due course there will be

available at the Exchange, reliable information on  the

numbers and various kinds of skilled workers who are in

search of jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special effort will be made to keep a proper

register of those who are seeking their first jobs.  It

has been found



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



that  in the past those seeking their first jobs rarely

made  use  of  the  Exchange. The  placement  of  those

leaving  school in industry will occupy a good deal  of

the  attention of the Ministry in the year  ahead,  and

employers  will  be encouraged to send teams  on  their

personnel  and  management  side  to  our  schools   to

popularise jobs in their concerns amongst young persons

about   to  leave  school.  Employers  will   also   be

encouraged   to   prepare  brochures   explaining   the

opportunities their concerns offer to those who wish to

make a career in their concerns on leaving school,  for

distribution in the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Employment Bill will be introduced which will

repeal the three Ordinances dealing with the conditions

of  labourers, clerks and shop assistants, and the  new

Bill  will  considerably  extend  the  scope  of  these

Ordinances to include the aforementioned categories  of

employees  as  well  as all other  employees  who  were

hitherto   excluded  from  the  scope  of  our   labour

legislation.  A  uniform scheme  of  benefits  will  be

provided under the Bill and a uniform scheme of working

hours  introduced for all employees. Those who work  on

their own account, whether they are paid at piece rates

or  on  a commission basis on premises provided by  the

employer,  will  be  deemed to  be  employees  for  the

benefits of the new law. Power will be taken under  the

new  Bill to enable the Ministry to fix the opening and

closing  hours of shops and other establishments  where

the  nature  of  the business done is such  as  not  to

require  these  premises  to  be  opened  after   their

employees  have rendered a full eight hours work.  This

will  put an end to the wholesale evasion of our labour

law  which  daily  takes place in such  premises  where

employees  have  to work for much longer  periods  than

eight hours a day without the payment of any overtime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprises which are not tied to the Government's

industrial  expansion programme  such  as  those  which

engage  in  the  import and export  trade,  commercial,

insurance, banking, transport, shipping and other  such

concerns  will be required to provide retrenchment  pay

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



a  scale  laid down when staff are laid off. This  will

put  an  end  to the confusion which at present  exists

when  retrenchment pay is either refused  or  given  at

varying  rates  by different employers  when  staff  in

these  concerns are laid off. Under the new Bill, power

will  be  taken to enable the Ministry to make  special

regulations  providing for the conditions of  work  and

benefits  of  domestic  servants.  The  scope  of   the

definition  of  "domestic servant" will be  limited  so

that  such  service  rendered in  or  about  a  private

dwelling  house  will  reckon  as  domestic  service,

whereas  service  of  a  domestic  nature  rendered  in

hotels,  boarding houses, restaurants, bars and private

clubs  will reckon fully for all the benefits  provided

for an employee under the new labour law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions implementing the recommendations of the

Contract Labour Commission Report will also be included

in  the  new Employment Bill. Contract labour  will  be

prohibited  in  certain industries,  but  where  it  is

permitted,  contractors  and sub-contractors  employing

labour  will  be  required to register and  to  provide

security in case of default in payment of wages.  There

will also be written into all labour contracts, whether

of  a  principal contractor or a sub-contractor,  as  a

requirement  of  law,  a fair wages  clause.  Where  an

employer owns factory premises and the machinery in it,

he  will  be  required to employ those working  in  the

factory direct. Employment of labour under contract  to

supplement  the permanent labour force in a factory  to

cope  with  an increased demand for goods  or  services

will also be prohibited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Bill will be reintroduced with

amendments   to  enable  the  new  unification   policy

centered  around the 19 categories of trade unions  and

the dissolution of general and miscellaneous unions  to

be  fully  implemented. This Bill passed through  three

Readings at the last session but was not assented to by

His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  Amendments

have  been  proposed  for  the  consideration  of   the

Singapore Trades Union Congress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



which   will   require   all   existing   general    or

miscellaneous Unions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To amend their rules to confine their membership

to employees in any one of the categories specified

in the First Schedule to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To terminate the membership of any of their

members who do not belong to the category specified

in the rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To submit a return to the Registrar of Trade

Unions  showing that they have complied with  these

requirements.



<br><br>The  Singapore Trades Union Congress has been asked  to

consider   a   further  proposal  that  a  general   or

miscellaneous   union   should   comply   with    these

requirements  before it is permitted to  federate  with

other  unions in the same category. Agreement on  these

proposals  has  so  far  not  been  reached  with   the

Singapore Trades Union Congress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Ordinance will be implemented

by  the  appointment  of the President  and  panels  of

Members  of  the  Court  and  the  recruitment  of  the

necessary staff. The Court will be housed in the former

Estate Duties Office in the Supreme Court Building  and

plans have already been approved for the conversion  of

this office into a suitable Court Room. In addition  to

the  Court Room, accommodation will be provided for the

President and members of the Court and there will  also

be  meeting  rooms  for  the employers'  side  and  the

employees' side. There is also to be a Central Registry

and  for  the  purpose  of  setting  up  the  machinery

required for the implementation of this Ordinance,  the

Registrar  of the South Australian Court of Arbitration

is  now  here  under  the Colombo Plan  to  advise  the

Ministry. Many collective agreements have already  been

concluded between employers and unions of employees and

these  agreements will be registered with  the  Central

Registry  of the Court as soon as it is set  up.  These

agreements will be published in the Government  Gazette

after they are registered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee will be set up with representatives from

the  Singapore Trades Union Congress to advise  on  the

designing and detailed planning for a Trade Union House

to  be  built  for  the  use of the  S.T.U.C. and  its

affiliates. A very central site in the city has already

been  earmarked  for  this  purpose  within  convenient

distance of the major bus routes serving the city. This

building will provide all the amenities which  a  Trade

Union  House  requires in the way of  a  large  meeting

room,  union offices, an office for the Secretariat,  a

library and a fully equipped research unit. The grounds

will   also  be  spacious  enough  for  outdoor  sports

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Work Brigade will be considerably

expanded  and  15 sites have already been selected  for

work  camps.  One  camp has already been  completed  at

Pasir  Ris and work is now progressing on the  widening

and  channelling of the Sungei Api Api from its  source

to  the sea. This will improve the drainage of the area

and  bring under cultivation a very large area of swamp

land.  Work on the construction of camp sites at Jurong

for  the completion of a 2½ mile link road between Chua

Chu  Kang  and Jurong, at Kaki Bukit and  at  the  Paya

Lebar  Airport for the improvement of the  drainage  in

the  Geylang Serai area and for extending the  existing

resettlement scheme in this area and at Andrews Avenue,

Sembawang,  for  the  establishment  of  a  new   Malay

Settlement in the area formerly occupied by  the  Bukit

Sembawang Hill Rubber Estate, is now progressing at top

speed. As these camps are completed and the development

schemes  associated  with  these  work  camps  are   in

operation, new work camps will be started. The  present

planning provides that by the end of the year, 15  work

camps will be built and 15 development schemes will  be

in  full  operation. The strength of the  Work  Brigade

will then have increased to 3,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Special Planning Unit for the Work Brigade has been

set  up.  This  will enable professional and  technical

officers  who are now seconded to the Brigade from  the

Public  Works Department to return to their own  duties

so that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



development  plans  of  other Ministries  will  not  be

impeded.  The administrative side of the  work  of  the

Work Brigade has been taken over by the permanent staff

at  the former headquarters of the Civil Defence  Corps

and   when   the  work  of  re-organisation  at   these

headquarters is completed, there will be more  Chinese-speaking  officers at these headquarters to  deal  with

the  administrative matters affecting  the  Brigade.  A

special Transport Unit for the Brigade will also be set

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work on which the Brigade is engaged is very

varied  and those working in it will be able  to  learn

useful  trades in the course of their service. In  road

making  schemes  they  learn  to  construct  road  side

drains, lay down water pipes, metal roads and construct

road side pavements. In drainage schemes they learn  to

construct bridges and weirs across streams and  in  re-settlement schemes, they learn farming and the building

of  houses  and  camps. A directive  has  already  been

issued  from  the  Ministry of  Finance  to  Government

departments  and  quasi-Government  bodies  instructing

them to give the first preference to all vacancies  for

tradesmen and skilled workers in Government service and

in  these  quasi-Government bodies to  those  who  have

passed  through the Work Brigade. Boys from the  Gimson

School have already been absorbed into the Work Brigade

and  those  from Pulau Senang who make the  grade  will

also  be  given  an opportunity to serve  in  the  Work

Brigade  before they regain their place in society.  As

our    industrial   expansion   programme   progresses,

employers  will  see the advantage of recruiting  their

labour  force more and more from members  of  the  Work

Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the new Trade Union Ordinance is

introduced, a Labour Advisory Council will be set up on

which  there  will be representatives of industry,  the

trade  unions and Government. The work of  the  Council

will be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to advise Government in relation to employment,

industrial relations, employee welfare and

related industrial and economic matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to advise the Ministry of Labour and Law in

relation to matters on the labour side of the

Ministry's work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the function of this Council to keep itself

fully  informed of the developments in both the  public

and private sectors of investment and arrangements will

be  made for meetings of the Council to be addressed by

the  Minister  for Finance and members of the  Economic

Development Board. It is in this Council that organised

labour  with representatives from the Singapore  Trades

Union  Congress will be fully consulted and  associated

in    the    task   of   implementing   our   Five-Year

industrialisation  programme. The  views  of  organised

labour in the matter of the maintenance of good working

conditions  for our workers while our industrialisation

programme  progresses will be brought to the notice  of

both employers and the Government in this Council.  The

Council will provide a forum in which organised labour,

capital  and  Government will be able to formulate  and

work  out  plans for the promotion of industrial  peace

with  justice  as our industrialisation programme  gets

under way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social welfare side of the Ministry, medium and

small  community centres will continue to be  built  in

all   areas  which  are  thickly  populated  and  small

community halls costing not more than $5,000 each  will

be  built  in attap areas both in the urban  and  rural

parts  of  the  State.  We  have  already  built  seven

community centres since we assumed power and from  next

month,  three  community centres will  be  opened  each

month  and four in December. We have planned a  network

of  these community centres and community halls through

which  the People's Association which has already  been

set  up  by  legislation will be able to  organise  the

leisure activities of our growing young population. The

inaugural meeting of the People's Association  will  be

held  this month at the National Recreation Centre  and

it is through this People's Association that we hope to

integrate the activities of the various associations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



which  are members of the People's Association  in  the

greater purpose of organising the leisure activities of

our  young  population in these community  centres  and

community  halls. The community centres and halls  will

in future afford a point of contact between the work of

these  associations  and  the  masses  and  instead  of

functioning   as   they   do  now   in   more   limited

circumstances,  these associations will  in  future  be

able  by this contact to find a larger base upon  which

they will be able to expand their own activities. As an

example,  the  Boy Scouts Association has already  been

approached  to  form scouting groups in  our  community

centres and well known coaches like Wong Peng Soon  are

now  moving front community centre to community  centre

to  coach our young people in the art of playing a good

game of badminton.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter which lapsed after reference to

Select  Committee  owing  to  the  prorogation  of  the

Legislative  Assembly will be re-introduced.  The  Bill

will  have regard to the proposals for amendment  which

were  made to the Select Committee of the last session.

Deficiencies in the Bill which were noticed when it was

under reference to Select Committee will be removed and

points   of  detail  which  were  overlooked  will   be

introduced. The basic feature of this Bill which puts a

stop to polygamous marriages, except for those who  are

Muslims,  as  from  the 2nd March  of  this  year  will

however remain unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the law side of the work in the Ministry, it is

proposed to expand the service of the Legal Aid  Bureau

in  civil  cases.  Instead of free legal  aid  being  a

responsibility of Government alone, the local Bar  will

be  associated  and a scheme devised on  the  lines  on

which  the legal aid system is operated in England.  In

such  a  scheme provision will be made for contributory

legal  aid  so that a larger section of the  population

will  be  able to benefit from the scheme.  An  officer

will  be  sent to study the legal aid scheme in England

with  a  view  to  introducing a  modification  of  the

English system here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will be introduced to enable graduates in

law  of the University of Malaya to be admitted to  the

local  Bar  after a short period of pupilage and  after

passing  an  examination  of  a  practical  nature.  In

association  with the Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya, a joint Examinations Board on the model of  the

Council of Legal Education in England will be set up to

examine  candidates  at the local  University  who  are

required  to  take  this  practical  examination  after

completing  their  period  of  pupilage  as   well   as

candidates  who  have  completed  their  legal  studies

overseas.  It  is  hoped that in  time  there  will  be

reciprocal arrangements between the Governments of  the

two territories to enable a candidate called to the Bar

in  one  territory  to practise  at  the  Bar  in  both

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will also be introduced to protect honest

traders  from  the  fraud  of insolvent  and  dishonest

persons  who set up spurious business concerns for  the

sole  purpose  of defrauding honest traders  with  whom

they  pretend  to  do business. As  our  State  is  the

largest commercial emporium in South-East Asia,  it  is

essential  that  our  honest traders  should  be  fully

protected against such frauds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New court houses will be built at Kallang on the

vacant  site next to the National Recreation Centre  to

house  two district courts, one criminal and one civil,

and  two magistrates courts. A magistrate's court  will

also  be built at Sepoy Lines and a court to deal  with

juvenile and maintenance cases will be set up  at  Fort

Canning.  These  new  court  houses  will  relieve  the

congestion in our subordinate courts and will bring our

courts nearer to the homes of our own people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive legislation for the regulation of Muslim

marriage  and divorce and Muslim religious  affairs  on

the  lines of legislation enforced in the states of the

Federation  of  Malaya will be introduced  during  this

session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may revert once again to the labour side of my

Ministry. The year ahead is one of construction and  as

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



Party  forming the Government we are committed  to  the

realisation  of  our policy of full employment  through

industrialisation  within  our  term  of  office.   Any

setback  in the year ahead will make it impossible  for

us  to  realise  the  target  we  have  set  ourselves.

Although we as a Government have done many good  things

for  the  benefit  of  our people during  our  term  of

office, none of these good things will be of any  avail

if   we  fail  to  find  a  solution  for  our  growing

unemployment problem. The solution of that  problem  is

our main concern, all other things being subsidiary. In

finding  a solution to this problem, however,  we  will

never  be  unmindful of our duty to  ensure  that  with

industrialisation  and the expansion  of  our  national

income,  our  workers will continue to get  fairer  and

better rewards for the fruits of their labour. We  feel

that  as  a Government, solidly behind our workers,  it

will  be  possible for us to obtain their goodwill  and

cooperation  in  achieving the task that  we  have  set

ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, in conclusion, answer some of the matters

raised by the Opposition. We make no apology for having

imposed the pay cuts. The first point about it is  that

we  imposed  the  cuts  on ourselves  first  before  we

imposed  them  on others. These pay cuts  were  in  the

circumstances  very necessary. When  the  former  Chief

Minister  invited the Head of the Indian Civil Service,

one  Mr Bapat, to Singapore a few years ago, to advise

him  on  how to reorganise the civil service  on  Asian

lines,  I  remember  that  when  speaking  to  him   he

expressed  very  great  surprise that  a  comparatively

junior  Assistant Secretary in our civil service,  with

three  years' service, received the same salary  as  he

was receiving. As Head of the Indian Civil Service,  he

was  then receiving 2,000 Rupees a month, or $1,240 per

month in our money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make it clear to all concerned that

those  in  the  lower income groups and  in  the  lower

bracket  of  the  middle income groups  have  not  been

affected  by the pay cuts at all. My former  colleagues

in the civil service, who are in the higher brackets of

the middle income group and in the higher income group,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



know  that with Malayanisation great opportunities  for

promotion   have  come  their  way,  which  more   than

compensate  them  for  the  pay  cuts  of  which   they

complain. Barely five years ago, the highest  posts  to

which a person starting as a clerk in the service could

hope  to  rise  to  were a handful of prize  posts  for

Office  Assistants. Today, those with ability can  make

their  way  to  higher appointments via an  echelon  of

higher  posts  which are available to them.  There  are

today  opportunities for promotion from clerical  posts

to  higher  clerical  posts, Executive  Officer  posts,

Higher   Executive  Officer  posts,  Senior   Executive

Officer  posts,  timescale posts in the  Administrative

Service,  and from there on to the Superscale posts  in

the  Administrative Service. It is true  today  to  say

that there is no impediment in the way of an officer of

ability  enabling him to rise in the service  from  the

post  of  a  junior  clerical  officer  to  that  of  a

Permanent Secretary in a Ministry. The same rapidity of

promotion is also available to junior officers  in  the

time-scale  administrative and  timescale  professional

and  technical  posts.  With the disappearance  of  the

expatriate hierarchy in the Superscale posts  of  these

services, many of them have already very early in their

career  obtained promotion to these posts  which  would

never have been within their reach, were it not for the

Malayanisation  policy.  My former  colleagues  in  the

civil  service  also know that the pay  scales  in  the

civil  service have never remained static in the  post-war  years. They are very familiar with the work of the

various   Commissions   and   Committees   which   have

constantly reviewed the pay scales of civil servants to

bring them to what these scales are today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants must realise that with the large

unemployment  problem  which  faces  us  today,  it  is

essential that there should be economies if we  are  to

find  the  money  to  finance the Industrial  Expansion

Programme which we have planned. As I have said earlier

on, it is only with industrialisation and the expansion

of  our national income that we can hope to assure  all

our workers, including those in the civil service, that

they will continue to enjoy their present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



high  standard  of living. It is important,  therefore,

that  the civil service, especially those in the higher

brackets  of the middle income group and in the  higher

income  group  should not lose sight of  these  weighty

considerations. They would certainly be the losers  if,

for  any  reason, we as a Government failed to  achieve

the  target which we have set out to achieve within our

term of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been taken to task by the Opposition for not

having  given  more attention to the need for  tracking

down  the  kidnappers. It is strange indeed  that  this

charge should come from the lips of the Opposition.  In

January  this  year  when  we introduced  the  Offences

Relating  to Vehicles Bill to provide heavier penalties

for those who were convicted of stealing motor cars and

bicycles, this is what the Member for Farrer  Park  had

to  say [Hansard, of 14th January, 1960, Vol. 12,  col.

103]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What this Bill proposes to do, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

to  increase the punishment in the hope that  increased

punishment would reduce the crimes."



<br><br>I still quote him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...may I with respect again say that the difficulty is

not  that  our  laws  do not provide the  remedies-they

do-but  that  the  Police are not able  to  arrest  the

thieves, however much the punishment might be:".



<br><br>He goes on to say this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To suggest that it is necessary to bring in this Bill

because the theft of vehicles is so prevalent, is not a

proposition which I can accept. I would suggest to  the

people  who  enforce the law that it is  not  increased

punishments  that will stop the theft of vehicles,  but

the catching of the thieves that is going to stop it."



<br><br>On  that  occasion, Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply  to  the

Member for Farrer Park, I said [col. 104]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we allow the situation to drift, then one day the

Member  for  Farrer Park will come here and say,  `Does

the  Government not know that the situation is  getting

from  bad to worse? What is the Government doing  about

it?   I  have  also  lost  my  motorcar!  What  is  the

Government going to do about it?'"



<br><br>I assured the Member for Farrer Park then that when the

Bill  was  passed, he would have the  security  of  his

motor  vehicle for so long as the Offences Relating  to

Vehicles  Ordinance remained in our Statute  Book.  His

reply was that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



he  only  owned a bicycle. I mention this. Mr Speaker,

to  show  that  we  did not get any  support  from  the

Opposition  then, when we were trying hard  to  do  the

right thing for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich businessmen have been in to see me complaining of

the  prevalence of kidnapping, and amongst other things

they  mentioned that many of the businessmen themselves

were  partly  to blame for the present sorry  state  of

affairs.  They  told  me  they  knew  that  many   more

kidnappings had taken place than were reported  in  the

Press.  They said that the victims of these kidnappings

had  resolutely refused to make any complaints  to  the

police, and that this remained their attitude in  spite

of   the  fact  that  they  had  been  urged  by  other

businessmen to lodge formal complaints with the police.

It  must be apparent to Members of the Opposition  that

the  police force works under a very real handicap when

those who complain that the police have not done enough

to  bring the kidnappers to book, themselves refuse  to

cooperate with the police. Furthermore, we have had  it

from   the  lips  of  the  Members  of  the  Opposition

themselves  that  laws  enhancing  the  penalties   for

certain  crimes  will  not  in  themselves  reduce  the

incidence  of  these crimes. We believe  that  if  more

cooperation is extended to the police by those who  now

complain that the police have not done enough to  track

down  the  evil-doers, then more  can  be  achieved  in

bringing these miscreants to justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the re-employment of those who have

left  the  civil service, I can assure the  House  that

since we have been in Government, to my knowledge not a

single  officer has been required to leave the  service

otherwise   than  through  the  disciplinary  procedure

governing  dismissals in the service. No civil  servant

has,  to my knowledge, been arbitrarily dismissed  from

his   post.  There  have  been  resignations  from  the

service,  but such resignations are beyond our control.

Under  the  Government General Orders, any officer  who

voluntarily  resigns  from  the  service  forfeits  his

gratuity or his pension and is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



not  eligible  to be considered for further  employment

should  be   change his mind later and wish  to  be  re-employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions, however, have been different in certain

departments  of the former City Council,  where  it  is

known  that officers of long service with good  records

have  left  their employment prematurely  for  fear  of

discrimination and other reasons. As the Prime Minister

has   already  told  the  House,  those  amongst  these

officers  who  have sought re-employment have  all  been

reabsorbed  or offered re-employment in the service  of

the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now proceed to deal with some

of  the  submissions made by Members of the Opposition.

You  will remember, Sir, that yesterday the Member  for

Mountbatten,  who  is  dozing off  now,  said  that  no

capital  could  be  attracted into Singapore  since  we

became  the  Government. She claimed that there  was  a

great loss of confidence. Mr Speaker, Sir, it was  the

lot  of the Member for Mountbatten to have been a  good

school  marm before she became a Legislative  Assembly-woman.  My  lot has been in other spheres. I  had  been

holding  a  very  senior appointment  in  an  essential

planning Ministry of the Lim Yew Hock Government, and I

have  known  of the various schemes of investment  that

they  were  trying to attract to Singapore.  There  has

been  a  lot  of talk about the Central Wholesale  Fish

Market  scheme. And there was a lot of argument  as  to

where  that market was to be sited - was it to be at  the

Old Kallang Airport or was it to be at the mouth of the

Rochore  River? There were lots of argument,  but  till

today there is no wholesale fish market. There was talk

of setting up a Japanese fish cannery, and Mr Cresson,

the  Industrial Development Officer, was sent to  Japan

to  work  out with the Japanese concerns there a  joint

enterprise.  Where is that Japanese fish cannery?  Then

we  were told that large overseas tobacco manufacturing

concerns were going to set up new tobacco businesses in

Singapore. Where are those concerns? The Minister  whom

I  then  served  took a trip to America to  attend  the

P.A.T.A. Conference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



Amongst other visits, he spent  his  time  in

investigating the possibility of his personally setting

up  a tobacco industry in Singapore. But he changed his

mind   and   thought  that  toothpaste  was  a   better

proposition, and he has since started a big  toothpaste

business.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have not  been  blessed

with very good teeth, and I still prefer to keep to the

good  old  brands. Mr Speaker, Sir, we were then  told

that  there  was  a  magnate from Hongkong,  one  David

Soong,  who was very interested in setting up  a  flour

industry  in Singapore costing $2 million.  He  was  to

visit  Singapore and go into the possibilities, and  if

they  were  good, to set up a factory. Where  is  David

Soong?  Where  is the factory? Then we were  told  that

there was going to be a big sugar refinery. Millions of

dollars were going to be invested. Where is that  sugar

refinery?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was my duty then to popularise

these  ideas - ideas which everybody knew were just pipe-dreams.  But we had to put them forward and say,  "Yes,

everybody  is very interested. There are conditions  of

great  stability  under the Lim  Yew  Hock  Government.

Everybody is excited about investing." They soon forgot

about  these  schemes and proceeded with the  Singapore

Constitution Exposition instead to distract  attention.

Just  before  the elections, they had to  think  of  an

industrialisation scheme. What did they think out? They

talked of the Singapore River development scheme.  That

is  the  scheme considered by the World Bank  when  the

Directors  of  the  World Bank were in  Singapore  some

years before. They published it. That scheme was in the

form of a book which was pigeon-holed. They resurrected

it  just before the elections to make you believe  that

they had planned the scheme for industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, they wanted to build low-cost

factories,  and there was a lot of talk about  low-cost

factories  for  small businessmen and so  on.  All  the

arguments were against it. The only thing they achieved

was  the  Leng Kee Road Project. But that was a project

financed and planned by the Malaya Development Society.

That is the sum total of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



industrial development there was under the Lim Yew Hock

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the same hysterical remark

that  has  been  made since the P.A.P. Government  came

into  power - that there is a state of general chaos  and

that  no capital will be attracted. What are the facts?

Dr  Goh Keng Swee, before he left here, gave me a list

of   the  various  concerns  which  are  investing   in

Singapore.  I  have got it here. The Marusen  Toyo  Oil

Company  with a subscribed capital of $25 million;  the

Malayan   Flour   Mill  (Singapore)  Limited   with   a

subscribed  capital of $4 million. Now where  is  David

Soong? We have the Malayan Flour Mill with a subscribed

capital   of  $4  million.  The  Sheng  Huo  Enterprise

Limited,    $1,011,000;   Cold    Storage    Creameries

Limited - expansion, $200,000; Friesland  (Malaya)  Ltd.,

$3   million;   Metal  Tubes  and  Chemical   Products,

$270,000;   H.  Dember,  $500,000;  British   Aluminium

Company   Limited,  $10  million;  Chin  Leong  Company

Limited,  $2  million;  Mizrahie  Pharmaceutical  Works

Limited,  $100,000;  Hong  Tye  Tea  Merchant  Limited,

$500,000;  Kong Guan Flour Mills Limited,  $1  million;

Shell   Oil   Refinery,  $54  million;   a   total   of

$101,581,000 subscribed capital and with an  authorised

total capital of $112,700,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have not publicised all this. We have never made a fuss about it. It is only when we are

challenged,  when it is said that we are doing  nothing

about investment, and they get hysterical about it that

we   must  come  out  and  tell  them  that  all  these

investments have been attracted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a very personal note, the Member

for Mountbatten complained - I think she was very excited

at  the  time - that it is very unfair that she  was  not

invited  to open the Mountbatten Community Centre  last

Saturday. Then she accused us. She said, "Look  at  it.

What  do  they  do?  They get defeated  candidates  and

others  whom they want to build up politically to  open

our  community centres." Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact,  no

defeated candidate was invited to open that community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



centre. We invited Dr Toh. And why did we invite Dr

Toh? Because he is more at home -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, the Hon. Minister means

the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do, Mr Speaker. We all know those

surroundings of tenement flats. All the people who live

there  are  the people who were victims  of  the  Tiong

Bahru  fire.  They are all very poor people.  They  are

people who mix socially with -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> The Deputy Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No - what is his official designation? The

Member for Rochore. Now they mix with him socially. But

in the case of the Member for Mountbatten, the way she

dresses -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of information?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, when I

said "defeated candidates", I did not mean

"Mountbatten". I am sure the Minister knows what I

meant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I will come to that later. Mr Speaker,

Sir,   unless   the   Member  for  Mountbatten   could

accommodate  herself  socially  with  that   gathering,

bearing  in mind that there are some gentlemen opposite

who  would  be frightened to be seen in this  House  if

they  were dressed as we are, how can we ever ask  them

to open our community centres?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, then we were charged with using

Government funds for party purposes. This is a building

that  was  put up. I think, by the late Tan Thoon  Lip,

and  the money provided for this building came from Mr

Lee  Kong  Chian. The people who put this  building  up

still owe Mr Lee Kong Chian money. This building up to

recently was in the occupation of the Katong Boys' Club

Association.  They ran activities here.  Of  their  own

accord they have handed over this building to us.  They

say  that if they hand it over to us, they will be sure

that  all  the activities will be better organised  and

that the building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



will be an asset to the poor people who are living

around.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it was Mr Lee  Kong  Chian

who  paid  for the renovations. They cost  round  about

$15,000  to $20,000. Where, have Government funds  been

used for political purposes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have been charged with leaving the

Geylang/Katong  Community Association  severely  alone.

That  is  the  Association  in  which  the  Member  for

Mountbatten  moves about very gracefully.  The  members

all dress, Mr Speaker, Sir, as she does; not the types

that  live in the old airport estate. Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  made inquiries. We wanted to know how they  get  on

together, but we find that there are a lot of factional

fights  going on in that Association. We want to  serve

the  people and work with them. We do not want  to  get

involved in little factional fights. So we have decided

to  leave this Association alone and keep away from it.

Is there anything wrong in that, Mr Speaker?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to my ex-colleague, the

Member  for Hong Lim. During this debate yesterday  and

today,  the Member for Hong Lim appeared in this  House

with  many heavy tomes. I have never in my life  before

seen him carry so many books. All that he was doing was

to  look  up  all  of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's  anti-colonial

speeches. Mr Speaker, Sir, he is very angry  that  the

Prime  Minister has refused to go on repeating  himself

like a worn-out gramophone record. I mean, if he has no

policies,  then  all that he can say is,  "I  am  anti-colonial. I am anti-colonial." That is all. "I  put  up

standpipes because I am anti-colonial." That is all  he

can  do. He has said that the Party leadership is  also

now pro-colonial. He says that he has not even troubled

to look at the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. He says

that  he  is  quite  convinced  now  that  this  is   a

completely  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government's  statement  of

policy. It is a pro-colonial statement of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have mentioned some things such

as  our  intention  to improve the  conditions  of  our

farmers.  We  have  said that we  intend  to  introduce

legislation to give farmers better security of  tenure,

and that a Bill will be introduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



in  this Assembly during this session.  We  have

talked  about  the need for improving  the  strains  of

chickens. I remember the Member for Hong Lim  going  on

the radio and praising himself for the good work he was

doing  among the farmers and so on. That finds a  place

in  the  policy statement. Yet he did not say that  his

speech  over Radio Singapore was pro-colonial.  But  he

says  that the same thing which appears in the policy

statement  is  pro-colonial.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this

matter appears in the policy statement of this year - our

undertaking that we will introduce legislation to  give

farmers  better security of tenure. Last year  in  this

House, we have had all sorts of promises from the -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> From the Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> From the Government - yes. We must accept

collective responsibility. But the person who did speak

was  the Member for Hong Lim, who was then the Minister

for   National   Develop  ment.  He  said   that   that

legislation was going to be introduced. There  were  no

ideas,  and  no  contributions from him  The  file  was

passed  on  to him to work out a scheme. He  could  not

think of devising -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> On a point of

clarification, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the only radical

legislation  which  the  P.A.P. Government  thought  to

bring up was legislation to give security of tenure  to

the  farmers.  This legislation, which would  radically

change  the present relationship between the  landlords

and  the tenants, and in a way change the present  land

system, was drafted and completed by the able Attorney-General  in the Ministry of Labour and Law.  But  since

this  legislation  touched too much on   the  interests

which the Lee Kuan Yew Government wants to protect,  it

was deferred. The excuse given was that it was not good

enough,  although it was being prepared with  the  able

assistance  of the Ministry of Labour and  Law,  and  I

believe -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member cannot

embark on another speech. Probably that is as far as he

can go.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am glad, Mr Speaker, that he has paid a

compliment to the Ministry of Labour and Law  since  he

considers  that  we  are able to  give  him  very  able

assistance. Mr Speaker, Sir, before you can set up any

bit of legislation, it is necessary for you to tell the

draftsmen  what you want. But, Mr Speaker, Sir,  there

were  no ideas, no contributions from his Ministry.  We

had  to  look up the Legislation in England. We had  to

put   up   all  the  proposals  with  regard  to   this

legislation. Nothing was forthcoming from the  Ministry

of National Development. All that we were handed was  a

bunch of empty files.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one aspect of the Member

for  Hong Lim's speech that we all know does not accord

with  the  facts. He says that we are pro-colonialists,

that  this  policy  statement is a pro-colonial  policy

statement. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is of no use to  us  to

hark  back  to  1954, 1955, 1956. The purpose  of  this

policy  speech is to review what the Party has done  in

the  last  year and to forecast the trends in  the  new

Session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Member for Hong Lim

to  interrupt me and try to seek clarification for  the

things  which I shall say from now on. I would like  to

ask  him whether he did not, in fact, subscribe to  the

Party's  manifesto which was put to the electorate  and

adopted  in  our  publication "The  Tasks  Ahead".  Mr

Speaker,  I should like to ask him whether he  did  not

himself read out one of those policy speeches at one of

the mass meetings. We know that all persons who are  in

the present Government read those policy statements  at

our  mass  rallies.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  he  could  have

criticised  us as pro-colonialists. If he thought  that

what we have said in our Party manifesto, the manifesto

which  we  have put to the people of Singapore  at  the

last election, was a pro-colonial policy statement, why

did he not tell the people at the mass rallies, "Do not

support that manifesto. That is a fraudulent manifesto.

It has been put up to defraud the people of Singapore"?

Did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



he  have  the  guts and the courage to  say  that?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, ask him to interrupt me at any time  for

clarification of what I am saying? Did he  not  himself

suggest  the  creation  of  the  Ministry  of  National

Development? Did he not try to get within  his  control

nearly   every  important  institution  of  government,

including the City Council? Ask him if that is not so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before we became the Government, we put this policy statement to the people. We had it accepted

by  the people and it was our duty as the Government to

carry  out  the  policy which has  been  supported  and

adopted  by  the people. What steps did the Member  for

Hong  Lim  take  to integrate City Council  departments

with Government departments? What steps did he take  to

set  up the Housing and Development Board? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I say to this Assembly, he took no steps at  all.

He  had no intention of implementing that policy at any

stage.  It was the Cabinet, collectively, which ensured

that  he  did so. Mr Speaker, Sir, he showed his  hand

here  in this Assembly yesterday. He said that  he  had

only two enemies amongst us - the Prime Minister and  Dr

Goh Keng Swee. We were all -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Minister for Finance, Sir. We were all

his  friends, he says. Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, why?  Why

does he single out Dr Goh Keng Swee for his -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, the Minister for Finance - for the venom

of  his  spleen? Why? It is because, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

Dr  Goh  Keng Swee - the Minister for Finance - would  not

allow  him  the full use of the City Council  funds  to

build  up  a body of grateful retainers around himself.

He  would  not  allow  that. Hence his  great  personal

dislike of Dr Goh Keng Swee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister will

recollect  that I did endeavour to stop the Member  for

Hong  Lim  when  he was embarking on details,  and  the

Minister himself is perhaps guilty of the same offence.

Perhaps the Minister will consider cutting out quite  a

lot of the details and going on to generalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all are responsible to

the  electorate  who have put us here. On  an  occasion

like this  we review the activities of the  past  year.

Each and everyone of us is accountable for what we have

done  in the past year. Mr Speaker, Sir, if I were  to

suggest  to  this House that the Minister for  National

Development had discharged his duties faithfully,  then

I have to ask myself why is it that the S.I.T. had only

put  up 124 housing units when the previous Government,

whom  we have all maligned, was able in its first  year

of office to put up more than 6,000? Why has there been

an  improvement only when we took steps to set  up  the

Housing Board, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim said that

all  who sat opposite him were his friends. True,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  were  his  friends.  We  were   his

colleagues.  But  we all wanted him to  carry  out  the

Party  policy which he refused to do. That is why,  Mr

Speaker, he sits where he is and we remain as we are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he said very kind things about me

yesterday. He suggested that he was afraid that I would

be  made a scapegoat. He was the first scapegoat and  I

would  be  the second scapegoat. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  he

referred to a statement in the speech where it is  said

that  we  were hasty in our desire to get  things  done

quickly  last year. That we should have consulted  more

with  the  affected interests, and that we should  have

taken  a  little  more time to explain our  policy.  He

suggested to the House that that was put in the  policy

statement  to  discredit me personally as Minister  for

Labour  and Law. Mr Speaker, Sir, I say to this  House

that  that  is completely and entirely untrue,  and  he

knows  that  to be untrue. All Ministers put  in  their

contributions when-the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



prepared. The Cabinet, as a committee, discusses  these

contributions.  That  was  done  in   this   case.   We

unanimously agreed that that clause should  go  in.  It

was never inserted at any time to bring discredit on me

personally  or  on  the Ministry  of  which  I  am  the

political  head.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  believe   in

collective responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, take the Member for Hong Lim's

attitude towards the Betting Bill, the petrol tax, help

for   taxi-drivers,  de-registration  of   federations,

decisions of the Internal Security Council He was fully

associated  in  all  that with us.  There  was  a  full

discussion  at  all meetings. He was asked  whether  he

agreed  or disagreed with the policy. He said  that  he

agreed.  He went outside and said no, that he  did  not

agree,  and  that  decisions  had  been  taken  in  his

absence.  He  was  a  member of the  Internal  Security

Council.  I  am  not. He went to the  meetings  of  the

Internal Security Council. He did not want to  carry  a

brief  case, lest the people say that he was a  stooge.

But   lie   attended  the  Internal  Security   Council

meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of the raising of the

assessments   and   the  setting-up   of   a   National

Construction Corps, we were his Cabinet colleagues, but

we   were  never  consulted  at  all  till  they   were

announced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have all read the headlines in

the  Straits  Times  of an announcement  about  a  $400

million  building scheme. The first time we knew  about

this  $400  million scheme was when we saw  it  in  the

Straits  Times. Then we asked him, "First  of  all,  is

this  true?  Did you say all that?" "No,  no,  no,"  he

said,  "this was a leak." Unfortunately for him I   know

the people to whom -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know it is a very difficult

problem  to draw a line somewhere. But I do not  think,

as  I  have  said before, that this Assembly should  be

troubled  with  details  of that  nature  which  really

reflect  on  the personal conduct of a Member  of  this

Assembly.  All  we  did  hear  would,  of  course,   be

completely  in order if there was a substantive  motion

before the House dealing with the personal conduct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Member  for  Hong Lim. As  I  have  indicated,

details  of  that nature would, to my mind,  bring  the

matter  within the mischief of that Standing Order.  If

the Minister can generalise, then he will be in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I respect your ruling on this,

but  we  are not trying to be unfair. I have said  here

that  he can interrupt me any time if he wants to  seek

any point of clarification. I am quite prepared to hear

him on all that he wishes to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to draw the

attention  of  the House that what the  cigarette  case

Minister is doing now is a re-enactment of the  special

Party conference on the 20th of June, 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you could be a little

patient  with me, when it was said to us that this  was

all  a  leak,  we were surprised that the Minister  for

Finance -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think, on that point, the

Minister has gone far enough, because I have ruled that

it  is  a  matter  of detail touching on  the  personal

conduct  of a Member. If the Minister wishes to enlarge

on  it,  he should choose another occasion and  perhaps

give notice of a substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on this side of the

House  are not concerned with the political aspirations

of  individuals in our Party, nor are  we  in  any  way

concerned  with  a struggle, if any, by individuals  to

gain political power. We on this side of the House come

from  all  walks  of  life. Some  of  us  are  ex-civil

servants,  some of us are trade unionists, some  of  us

are hairdressers, some of us are seamstresses, some  of

us  are postmen. We are a mixed bag, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

but there is one common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



bond  between  us all, and that is the common  bond  of

loyalty to the Party programme and its policies. It  is

that which binds us all together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have read of challenges in the

papers, challenges put out by the Member for Hong  Lim,

asking us to declare our stand as Assemblymen on the 16

resolutions.  We  take up the challenge.  We  meet;  we

discuss  our attitude to this challenge; we prepare  in

full  meeting a reply to this challenge. We  agree  the

Party's reply to these 16 resolutions. The next day, at

our  convenience, we meet at an appointed place and  we

subscribe our signatures to that document. When that is

published,  what does he say? We have been  manipulated

and coerced by the Prime Minister, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just now that we are a

mixed  bag;  we are people who come from all  walks  of

life;  we  are humble people; we have got our own  self

respect,  each  and everyone of us hero,  even  if  the

Member for Hong Lim has lost his. Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Hong Lim has said that all the Assemblymen

get their living from Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Is, that a fair

remark  to make? We are decent human beings. We may  be

humble people; we may not be accountants drawing $5,000

a  month. Sometimes when the hon. Member speaks to  me,

he  speaks like a capitalist. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  are

humble  people. But is it a fair thing to say  that  we

all depend on Mr Lee Kuan Yew for our living?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, Sir, all

of  us know that the Prime Minister never tries to gain

support from any of us by offering us any bribes. It is

against  his very nature. He does not expect a personal

bond  of  loyalty to him from any of us.  All  that  he

expects is that we have a common bond of loyalty to the

Party  to  which  we belong. It is different  with  the

Member  for  Hong Lim. He wants to buy our Assemblymen.

He wants them to be personally obligated to him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To allege that a Member wants to buy

Members  of the Assembly is, I think, perhaps  going  a

little too far. That expression ought not to be used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

difficult to keep on the official rails on an  occasion

like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a public meeting called to educate all

the people of Singapore. I did not know that the Member

for  Hong  Lim was an educationalist until I discovered

that  he wanted to educate all the people of Singapore.

He  wants  to save the people of Singapore! There  were

many,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, who helped to  organise  that

meeting and they wanted to know what his stand  was  on

the  question  of the detainees and the do-registration

of  federations.  They  were not  interested  in  Party

matters.  No, they wanted to know what his  stand  was.

And  I  spoke  to  many of them. They  went  there  and

listened to him. All that he could say on the detainees

and  the de-registration of federations was that  there

was  an  Official Secrets Ordinance and that  his  lips

were  sealed. That was all he could say. They  expected

an  exhibition  of manly courage - "On such  and  such  a

date,  I said to the Cabinet, `Release So and So.'  My

colleagues (pro, colonialists) said, `No.' " Nothing of

the  sort  came  from his lips. "The  Official  Secrets

Ordinance  was  there  and my lips  are  sealed." Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that was the general  attitude  of  the

Member  for Hong Lim at that public meeting. You  know,

Sir, that there was a Party disciplinary committee  set

up. Everybody turned up. Twenty-two liars turned up. We

were all there to face the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Hon. the Minister is now

going back into details. He went away from them but now

he is coming back to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all did not meet him,

but he posted to each and every one of us his reply.  I

was  very  interested in that reply, because there  was

mention in it that we, as the Executive Committee, were

never consulted when Sir William Goode sent for Mr Lee

Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, he did not send for the Prime Minister.

He  sent for Mr Lee Kuan Yew. The Member for Hong  Lim

suggested  that  the  Executive  Committee  were  never

consulted and that there was displeasure. All of us  in

the   Executive  Committee  cared  less.  We  were  not

aspiring  for  higher office. We  were  returned  as  a

Government. We had no such pipe dreams of wanting to be

the  Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, Sir, the only  person

amongst   us  who  could  validly  have  a  claim   for

consideration is Dr Toh Chin Chye. He has always  been

the Chairman of the Party and he is respected by all of

us. He has never on any occasion shown that he was ever

interested in this appointment. He is a colleague  and

a friend, and all of us respect him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a lot of talk about what

dirty  dogs we were, and how we have gone back  on  the

whole  Malayanisation policy. Sir, we  all  believe  in

Malayanisation,  but what we .can never  stand  for  is

"Batu Pahatisation". The Member for Hong Lim got rid of

local  officers and replaced them with his friends.  Do

you consider that to be a policy of Malayanisation?  He

has  mentioned the case of Mr Owen. We all  know  that

Mr  Owen is an Indian born in the Federation, and that

he  went to Australia with the Member for Hong  Lim  to

study  accountancy. He married an Australian  girl.  He

came  back to Singapore. He sought a job and  when  the

Member for Hong Lim was the Mayor, he fitted him into a

job.He  got  rid of senior local officers and  put  Mr

Owen  in. Things were running down very rapidly.  Quite

obviously  you cannot put a young accountant in  charge

of about $120 million worth of funds. So when the Prime

Minister stepped in, immediately Mr Owen owned  up  to

it  himself. He said that he was put into that job  and

not that he wanted it. He knew his shortcomings. And he

was quite prepared to leave the service and go back and

settle  in  Australia. If those  were  the  facts  with

regard to persons whom the Member for Hong Lim did  not

approve  of, then he would criticise these  people.  He

would say, "You can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



not  hold  up  these people as Malayans - people  who  go

abroad,  get  married, return and  work  in  their  own

country,  then leave and settle abroad." He would  call

them  mere  expatriates,  but  because  they  are   his

friends, they are considered to be worthy of imitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he also dislikes Mr George Thomson.

I do not know whether he is afraid -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Since Mr Owen is now in Australia,

I  think  I  am duty bound to clarify the position  for

him.  I have in my possession today a letter dated 24th

December,   1959,  addressed  by  Mr   Owen   to   the

Administrator, City Council, and I believe copies  were

sent to the Press, but they were stifled in time. If  I

can  have  your permission, Sir, I shall read  out  his

letter because it concerns his personal reputation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid that is not in order. If the

hon.  Member  wishes,  he  can  briefly  summarise  the

contents  of the letter in clarification but he  cannot

read the whole letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The reasons for his resignation are

briefly summarised as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am most unhappy that the Prime Minister, in his

talk  with the Executive Committee members of the Local

Senior  Officers  Association on 12th  November,  1959,

said this, "Mr Owen will probably find himself back in

the  Water  Department or be sent to  Tebrau  to  check

petty cash."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister made reference to my age and length of service in the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that I was instructed by you to assume the

duties  of  City  Treasurer on the  day  following  the

departure of the substantive holder of the post.'





<br><br>Now, who was asked to take charge of the duties of  the

City  Treasurer when Mr Owen was removed from  office?

He is not an accountant but a student of geography!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this man Mr George

Thomson  is an obsession with the Member for Hong  Lim.

He  is accused of brainwashing the civil servants,  and

so  on.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that Mr  Thomson

was   an  Information  Officer  employed  by  the  last

Government. It is also true that he is a good lecturer.

He  was  employed  as a lecturer in the  University  of

Leeds even before he came out here. The policies of the

Political Study Centre are controlled by members of the

Government,  and he lectures within the scope  of  that

authority. He cannot get out of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Meadows, Mr Speaker, Sir, he and

the  Member  for Hong Lim were once very good  friends.

The  Member  for  Hong Lim had a job  in  the  Southern

Islands and he thought that Mr Meadows was the man  to

do that job. When the Prime Minister thought that there

was  need for the services of Mr Meadows elsewhere,  I

am  told that one of the Parliamentary Secretaries  was

instructed  by  the  Member for Hong  Lim  to  make  an

official protest, because he needed the services of Mr

Meadows  for  his development schemes in  the  Southern

Islands.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when  did  that  intense

dislike  of  Mr Meadows begin? It was when  the  Prime

Minister  appointed  Mr  Meadows  to  carry  out   the

integration  of the City Council departments  into  the

Government departments. From that time, the Member  for

Hong  Lim hated Mr Meadows, because he wanted to build

up his City Council empire and he was not allowed to do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has a great personal dislike

for  the  Minister for Finance, because the latter  had

the  courage to put his foot down when he wanted to use

City Council funds improperly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said quite enough this

afternoon to bring out the points that we have  had  to

make  with regard to the charges that have been brought

against us by the Member for Hong Lim. We have not done

all  this with a view to humiliating him. We have  done

this  to  defend  ourselves  against  the  unwarranted,

unfair and unjust charges which he has brought against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



us.  He  knows that those charges are not true. He  has

said  in  this House, in your very presence, Sir,  that

there were two persons that he disliked amongst us  and

that  the  rest were his friends. True, we were  always

willing  to  be his friends.. In this House itself,  we

knew that he had made mistakes and we stood by his side

right  through  to  the end. We believe  in  collective

responsibility and we have never let him down  on  this

side of the House. In spite of all that, he took unfair

advantage  of  us.  He knew that his Ministry  was  not

working  as it should have been working, and he  wanted

to  disclaim all responsibility for it. It is for  that

reason  that  he  has  brought  these  charges  against

us - charges which he personally knows to be untrue.



<br><br>7.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, just over a year ago, one of our  Members

on  this side of the House did suggest that if on  some

future  occasion the Opposition needed  assistance  and

help,  we might be able to provide such assistance  and

help;  and  on this second occasion, when debating  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech, their  strength  has

been  augmented by three Members from this side of  the

House. You will notice, Sir, that the Opposition do not

look  as  cheerful  as they should, but  perhaps  after

hearing  the  long story today and yesterday  they  may

have occasion to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his monumental history of the Russian revolution,

Leon  Trotsky,  who  was  one of  the  authors  of  the

Revolution,  notes  how during revolutionary  times  an

intellectually and spiritually bankrupt social class is

unable to discern the significant from the trivial. For

example,  he relates in his book that during the  fatal

month  that  preceded  the  revolutionary  storm.  Tsar

Nicholas, who kept a regular diary, made no mention  of

the  great  momentous events that preceded the  Russian

revolution. As the

tension  and  pressure grew, he noted such  revelations

as.  "Got dressed. Rode a bicycle to the bathing  beach

and  bathed  enjoyably  in the sea."  Or,  on  the  day

following  a  serious mutiny by his  own  soldiers,  he

recorded the following for posterity, "Walked long, and

killed two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



crows.  Drank  tea  by daylight." I  cannot  help,  Mr

Speaker,  but  feel that the speeches of some  of  -the

hon.  Members  opposite  throw  as  much  intellectual

illumination on the great problems facing this  country

as  did  Tsar  Nicholas' diary entries on  the  Russian

revolution. Those who have spoken had a chance to trace

for us the grand design of great events. But all we got

was  something not above the level of "Walked long, and

killed two crows. Drank tea by daylight."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in his opening address, the Prime Minister

tried  to  stimulate, or at least tried to elevate  the

discussion  to  an  adult level by  trying  to  draw  a

pattern  of  the dark and powerful currents  of  social

change  that moved beneath the tranquil surface of  our

contemporary  political scene.  Here  were  forces,  he

outlined yesterday, which could ultimately reshape  the

lives of every one of us in this Assembly, outside this

Assembly, for good or for better. I had hoped that hon.

Members opposite would have risen to the occasion.  The

Member for Mountbatten did rise, but unfortunately  not

to the occasion but only to her feet. What she did say,

and  she  had a great deal to say, merely confirms  the

truth  of  Trotsky's statement about  the  intellectual

black-out  of  social classes in  the  last  stages  of

decay. The hon. Member was full of complaints about how

life  had  become intolerable under the P.A.P. regime.

The  civil  servants,  she  said,  were  seething  with

discontent.  Unemployment,  she  said,  had  become   a

nightmare.  She also reminded us that the  hon.  Member

for  Tanglin was cowering under P.A.P. intimidation.  I

thought  the  Member  for  Tanglin  never  looked  more

cheerful than he did in the last one year under  P.A.P.

rule.  Capital, she said, was flying away. Lawlessness

was  widespread. In short, the country had gone to  the

dogs.  Now, I will not insult the intelligence  of  the

hon.  Member for Mountbatten by saying that she  really

believed all this, any more than she believed  her  own

election propaganda - that if the P.A.P. came into power,

all  well-to-do  ladies  would  be  deprived  of  their

jewellery  and trinkets. The hon. Member's  jewellery

not  only  scintillates, but has  increased  in  lustre

during the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



last  one  year. The unadorned truth is that the  Party

that the hon. Member represents has nothing to offer by

way  of  political insight, political  profundity,  and

political  guidance to those of us who  wan-t  to  know

what  this  is  all  about. So they fall  back  0n  the

fantasies which they purveyed during the last elections

and which, for lack of a proper Publicity Officer, they

have  had to revive again today in connection with  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's address - to  revive  the  old

bogies,  imaginary  chaos, imaginary terror,  imaginary

oppression, and so on. If I may quote Trotsky  for  the

last  time,  he says that an invariable  symptom  of  a

dying  social class is that it deliberately turns  away

from  realities and surrounds itself with what  he  des

cribes as infantile fantasies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the S.P.A. have had very little to say,

very  little  observations to make, on the analysis  of

the  trends and forces outlined for the P.A.P. by  the Prime Minister. It is at least -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose the Minister should

have  used  the singular, the Member of  the  S.P.A.  I

think  he  embraces all Members of the S.P.A.  Not  all

have  spoken. Only one Member has spoken, according  to

my record.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> May I, as a former journalist, use

the   collective  "we"?  Anyway,  thank  you  for  your

guidance   in   this  matter.  Even  members   of   the

journalistic profession, when they write the  editorial

columns,  take unto themselves the colours  of  royalty

and describe themselves as "we".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not a journalist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Mountbatten had very

little  to  offer  by way of comment on  the  analysis,

which was offered by us for serious consideration,  not

because  we  want to impress the Members opposite  with

our  erudition  and profundity, but merely  because  we

feel that what was said yesterday mattered a great deal

for everyone of us. If we did not comprehend the social

forces  around  us and if they were not  constructively

harnessed, then they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



could  wreck our lives and our country. Because we  had

hoped  that they would stop talking about "Walked  long

and  killed two crows" and delve into more serious  and

worthwhile problems which were implied in the speech of

the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What some Members opposite may not realise is that

politics is no longer a game of marbles. What  we  say,

what we do or what we do not do, can mean happiness  or

tragedy  for  the one and a half million  people  whose

future  is in our hands. This is not a boast, it  is  a

statement  of fact. After the first year, the  play  of

social forces has reached a stage where we cannot treat

them  as  matters  for  academic  discussion,  but   as

offering  serious  problems  and  calling  for  serious

decisions on which the whole future of a million and  a

half  people would depend. So, I hope that  when  other

Members  of the Opposition get up to speak, they  would

not, by way of intellectual illumination, offer us horror  comics  and fantasies as was offered by the  Member

for  Mountbatten.  For example, in the  face  of  these

great problems, what the Opposition has to offer is  an

amendment  by  the  irrepressible Member  for  Tanglin.

"Restore  pay cuts", he says. Would the restoration  of

pay cuts resolve these major problems?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Be -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Is it seriously suggested that once

the  pay  cuts  are  restored,  the  whole  course   of

political  life  in Singapore is going to  be  altered?

What  should really worry the Members opposite is that,

after   one   year,  political  insight  and  political

understanding should not have gone further than "Walked

long,  and  killed  two crows." The pay  cuts  was  the

obsession  last year when the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech was debated. This was discussed at great length,

with  great  passion  and with great  fervour.  A  year

later, this problem still constitutes their main theme.

No  doubt  this  old  bone will be disinterred  like  a

sacred  relic,  to  be passed around  with  appropriate

wailing and gnashing of teeth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



when  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech  is  debated

next  year.  Why  has  the political  thinking  of  the

Opposition  not  evolved to a  more  adult  stage?  The

reason  is that they have not caught up with  the  fact

that  the English-educated civil servants, to whom this

fossilized bone of pay cuts is offered as a bait,  have

also  undergone  a change of outlook  during  the  past

year. I quite well understand that the English-educated

civil   servants  once  provided  the  base  for   such

political  movements  as  the  Progressive  Party,  the

Labour  Front and the S.P.A. During the past few years,

they and their Right-wing friends tried to retain their

hold   over   the  English-educated  by  conjuring   up

fantasies  that the PAP, was out to cut their  throats,

and  that  dire consequences would follow if they  were

under  P.A.P. rule. It is true that the P.A.P. did  not

soft-soap  the English-educated with promises  of  good

life  and lolly all round. Blunt truths had to be  told

and  some of the truths were not pleasant, and  it  was

easy  to  distort all this frank speaking as a campaign

against  the  English-educated, and in  particular  the

English-educated civil servants. But  during  the  past

year, as a result of the Government's action by way  of

lectures  at  the  Political Study  Centre,  the  Civil

Service  has grasped the fact that far from  trying  to

destroy the English-educated, what we have been  trying

to  put across to them has been a hard but hopeful  way

of  ensuring a just, honourable and permanent place for

them in the social revolution unfolding before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressives and their successors under different

guises  tried  to  win  over  the  English-educated  by

dangling  prospects of good jobs, of  speedy  promotion

when  the  expatriated were replaced, and they possibly

held  out  visions  for  every  English-educated  civil

servant  of  an M.G. in the front porch and a  swimming

pool  in  the back garden. But they hid from  them  the

hard  political  realities, thus dangerously  isolating

the English-educated groups from the main stream of the

social  revolution. Now these hard realities have  been

made  clear  to them, and far from cowering before  the

approach of P.A.P. Assemblymen, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



English-educated  civil servants are resentful  because

these  issues  have not been made clearer  to  them  by

those  who espoused their cause in the past.  They  may

not  be  pro-P.A.P., and we are not interested  whether

the English-educated civil servants or any other member

of  that group is pro-P.A.P. or not. What we want  them

to  realise  is  that, in the broad issue  of  national

interest,  the  English-educated, like everybody  else,

should  be  prepared  to do their  duty  intelligently,

bravely  and  passionately. And once these issues  have

been  put forward clearly to the English-educated civil

servants, they have shown a willingness to take up  the

challenge  that confronts them. That is why the  S.P.A.

now  dangles  this bone of pay cuts  in  an  effort  to

retain the spectators who are now drifting away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Tanglin can grasp

what I am going to say to him, but I will try. The  pay

cut  issue  will not alter the course of  history,  nor

will  it resolve our major problems. The iron-mine  age

of Singapore politics is over. The civil servants, even

if  the  pay cuts are unpopular, will not be so foolish

as  to  save themselves by jumping into something which

is  already sinking. Sir, I will not take too much time

by  dealing with what pre-publicity in the Press led us

to  believe was to be an earth-shaking amendment by the

Member  for  Joo  Chiat. I was more  impressed  by  his

year's   silence,   which  at  least   hinted   at   an

unfathomable  and  mysterious  profundity,  a   silence

pregnant with unutterable but inspired truths.  Now  he

has  spoilt  it  all,  spoilt this silent  intimidating

vision,  with an amendment which could have  been  more

appropriately dealt with during Question Time.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> You will see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Or as an adjournment speech if the

Member is really bursting to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> You will see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> All I can say is that many of us will

no  longer  be  inspired by the sight  of  the  silent,

contemplative figure which sat before us day in and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



day  out  for  365 days, and who we thought  had  given

himself over wholly to what they call "cerebration".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, to turn our attention to the new recruits on

the  other  side of the House. I understand, Sir,  that

this afternoon, for some obscure reason, I was given  a

bouquet by the Member for Hong Lim who thought  that  I

was really a good man fallen among angels. So let me in

a  very  polite and courteous manner preface my remarks

by  saying that it is not an easy or pleasant thing  to

defrock   publicly  a  former  Party   and   Government

colleague,  especially also as he is one  with  whom  I

have had good personal relations. But knowing very well

the political tactics of the Member for Hong Lim, I  do

not  think  that he will quite succeed in dividing  and

ruling  this  side of the House. The fact  that  I  was

given  a  bouquet,  and the fact that  I  came  in  for

special honour-able mention, together with the Minister

for  Home Affairs, will not stop me from saying what  I

have to say, not about the individual Ong Eng Guan, but

about the Member for Hong Lim, because he has chosen to

play  a political role which, whatever the consequences

for  him, will, I am convinced, mean disaster  for  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty is that I know that when one, as

I  have said, defrocks a colleague publicly in front of

the Opposition,, it will be relished to some extent  by

the  hon. Members opposite; but if that is so,  I  hope

they  will  realise that the Member  for  Hong  Lim  is

himself  a pawn in the game played by adventurers  more

skilled,  more clever and more agile than  he  is.  The

Member  for  Hong  Lim is also well  aware  what  these

political  adventurers, who manipulate  him,  know  his

weaknesses, and therefore, play on them - he  knows  what

these adventurers think of him, and that once the  pawn

has  outlived its usefulness, it will be sacrificed  in

the  interest  of  other more decisive moves.  However,

Sir, I am not interested in the fate of the Member  for

Hong  Lim as such, but only in such of his actions  and

remarks  which,  I feel, would affect the  welfare  and

future  of  this country, because it is not he  who  is

determining events but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



those  who are playing on his weaknesses. In  order  to

understand  the role-that the Member for  Hong  Lim  is

playing,  it is necessary to bear in mind the  analysis

of the alignment of social forces which was made by the

Prime Minister yesterday. Only then will the pieces and

the pawns fall into their proper places, and the Member

for Hong Lim is one such pawn tossed about by forces he

does not quite understand, but which he thinks that  he

is using.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what conscious role his two associates

are  playing, but I do not think they matter very much.

In  his speech yesterday, the Member for Hong Lim  said

that  what  he described as the 16 Hong Lim resolutions

is the charm that will ward off evil from this country.

Both the Party and the Government are interested in any

schemes and policies which they believe will strengthen

the  position  of the Government and help  resolve  the

many difficult problems that confront this country.  No

party  or government would reject measures which  could

be  proved  to be for the benefit of the Government  as

well  as  of  the  country, particularly  so  when  the

suggestions come from a member of the Government who is

one of our colleagues. But during the one year that the

Member  was  in the Government, he did not put  forward

these  magic  formulae for discussion and consideration

by  his  colleagues. As far as I know, these appear  to

have been jealously guarded secrets, something like the

nature  of the atomic bomb formula, which he apparently

felt could not be safely entrusted in the hands of  the

Party  and his Government colleagues. For the last  one

year we never heard of 16,600 or 6,000 resolutions.  We

never  even had intimation that these resolutions  were

coming to birth in the mind of the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first time we heard of this magic

formula - these  convenient  16  resolutions - was  at  the

Party conference last June. But they were presented  in

such a manner as to suggest that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



were  not  so much resolutions to solve problems  as  a

challenge  to  indict and condemn the Party  leadership

and  the  Government. Sir, I need not go into the  long

history  of his manoeuvres inside the Party to  justify

my  contention that the 16 resolutions were part  of  a

manoeuvre   to  reinstate  and  recoup  his   declining

political  fortunes within the Party. These  manoeuvres

have already been exposed in the statement by the Party

announcing  his  expulsion. So I will  not  touch  upon

that.  But what is relevant is the efficacy of  the  16

resolutions which the Party aptly described "as a  balm

or  ointment  which, if applied in  the  right  places,

would  cure our country of all aches, pains and winds."

We  have since then studied the 16 resolutions, because

the  political medicine man claims there  is  magic  in

these  16 resolutions which will save us from disaster.

Even  though  he  never bothered to take  us  into  his

confidence,  we  have, nevertheless, studied  these  16

resolutions  at  great length. We have  searched  every

word in the wrapper, as it were, which covers these  16

resolutions to discover any sense and guidance. But the

magic  formula of the 16 resolutions has turned out  to

be  a  vacuum enveloped in meaningless phrases. The  16

resolutions, on further examination, are discovered  to

be  designed not so much to save the country as to save

the political fortunes of the gentleman whose political

charms  have  faded. The 16 resolutions,  Sir,  if  you

examine  them carefully, are nicely calculated  to  win

the  favour  of all sections of the population  who  he

thinks will be useful to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution one, for example, calls on us to reaffirm

our  faith  in the 1954 revolutionary P.A.P. Manifesto.

It is obviously a bid to win back following from within

the  Party or followers who have left the Party for one

reason  or another. Incidentally, the Manifesto  itself

was  drafted by people who are still in the Party,  and

many  of  them  have turned down the 16 resolutions  as

just   pure   ointment.  The  resolutions  also   offer

something to anti-colonialists, to those who  want  the

Constitution  changed, to those  who  want  merger,  to

those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



who   do   not   like   taxes,  to   taxi-drivers,   to

manufacturers of cigarettes, to moralists  who  do  not

like  yellow  culture  or who think  that  we  are  not

proceeding strongly enough against yellow culture,  and

also  to  those members of the Party who  are  smarting

because  they think they have not risen higher  in  the

Party hierarchy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now closely examine the validity of some of his

resolutions which are supposed to be able  to  cure  us

all  of  all ills. In his speech yesterday, the  Member

for Hong Lim tried to confuse matters by saying that he

was  evicted  from  the Government side  by  force  and

unconstitutionally by the Prime Minister. It  is  clear

from  the  Member's speech in the Assembly and  outside

that  he  disagrees completely with the policy  of  the

Party  and  Government. So what is unconstitutional  in

asking  the Member and his colleagues to move elsewhere

if they cannot quite agree with the Government's or the

Party's  policies? Secondly, Sir, he cannot expect  the

Party members from this side of the House to move  over

to  the other side and let the three of them remain  on

this  side. One thing about the Member for Hong Lim  is

that,  either wittingly or unwittingly, he  uses  words

the  meaning  of  which  he does  not  understand.  For

example, he said yesterday that force was used. He also

remarked elsewhere that force was used to throw him out

of  the  Party. On another occasion he said there  were

secret  police  armed with guns. He has  these  visions

that  things  are being done when they  are  not  being

done. Yesterday he said that he was forced by the Prime

Minister -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Evicted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, evicted by force. I am sure, Mr

Speaker, that is the last thing you would ever allow in

this  Assembly. But I think the Member for Hong Lim  is

not  interested  in  what goes  on  in  this  Assembly,

because  he  can win no regard or esteem here.  But  he

hopes that publication of this debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



in  the  newspapers when read by people  who  have  not

actually seen and known what is going on would win  him

esteem  and  regard. Rumours would now be  spread  that

this solitary anti-colonial government in Singapore was

forcibly  evicted  from one side of the  House  to  the

other  by the Prime Minister. This business of  picking

out individuals for his political attack and to present

these  big  political issues as issues between  himself

and  the Prime Minister is an old propaganda device and

one  which has been elaborated in great detail  by  the

late  Adolph Hitler in his Mein Kampf Hitler says  that

the  masses whom he despised cannot understand abstract

political  issues,  and  so  mass  leaders  must   make

political   agitations  centred   around   individuals.

Therefore, the Prime Minister is presented as the  evil

genius  who  really  expelled the former  Minister  for

National   Development   from   the   Government.   The

impression the Member wants to create is that the  rest

of  the  P.A.P. assembly are on his  side.  The  Prime

Minister, he said yesterday, was now in control of  the

police and the whole machinery of State; otherwise  the

position would have been different. I am not quite sure

what  exactly  he  means  by  saying,  "otherwise   the

position  would have been different", whether he  would

have  been holding and controlling the police  and  the

whole  machinery of State, or whether he  suffers  from

the  delusion  that he would be sitting here  as  Prime

Minister.  But let me say that the position  would  not

have  been different, because all on this side  of  the

House are convinced that the 16 resolutions are a phony

miracle  ointment whose claims no one on this  side  of

the House believes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of the former Minister for National

Development  was  not the act of one  man  but  of  the

Assemblymen  on this side of the House, and  he  is  at

liberty now to challenge anyone of them whether this is

not  so.  But again, as I said, it is an old propaganda

trick. He is not interested in what impact he makes  in

this House, but he is interested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



in  what  appears in the papers so that the reader  who

might  read these things would get the impression  that

the  Prime  Minister is holding back 39 rebellious  and

cowed Assemblymen who really want to join the ranks  of

the  Member for Hong Lim. He alleged yesterday that the

policy  statement  was, to quote  him,  "not  a  policy

statement  of the real P.A.P. Government".  Are  we  to

assume that there are, in fact, two P.A.P. Governments?

The P.A.P. Government and the real P.A.P. Government. I

look  around, I look around, and I look around  to  see

where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



is  the  true P.A.P. Government. There is one  on  this

side.  Where  is  the other P.A.P. Government - the  real

P.A.P. Government? Is it there? [Pointing]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption. Further

consideration tomorrow, I take it, Mr Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.
