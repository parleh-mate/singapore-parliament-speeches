<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>ACHIEVEMENT IN NATIONAL SERVICE AND SCHOLASTIC/</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ACADEMIC/PROFESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Correlation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  whether,  as a result  of  experience  or

through any research studies, there can be  traced

any significant correlation between achievement in

national service on the one hand, and on the other

(i) number of years of schooling previously; (ii)

academic  ability  shown  previously;  (iii)   any

training    (including   professional    training)

acquired   previously;  and  (iv)  previous   work

experience.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, experience shows that there is an

association  between a soldier's  performance  and

his educational background. Army commanders prefer

better  educated soldiers because they  know  that

whether  these men are riflemen, storemen, medical

orderlies,   clerks  or  cooks,   experience   has

confirmed that better educated soldiers are easier

to  instruct,  carry out their  orders  and  daily

chores  with  fewer  mistakes and  generally  pose

fewer disciplinary problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past there have been research studies

conducted   by   the   Personnel   Research    and

Educational Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



of  Mindef to evaluate how useful criteria such as

education  level  and  IQ test  performances  have

proved  in  assigning  recruits  to  various  army

vocations.  Statistical computation shows  that  a

significant  level of correlation  exists  between

performance in course results and education level.

If   we   take  education  level  and  IQ  results

together,  the  correlation is  even  better  than

education level alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1973 the study covered five vocations

-   clerk   (class  II),  pay  clerks,   technical

storemen,  linesmen and recce troopers.  At  other

times similar studies have been made in respect of

other vocations, both in the army and navy as well

as  in the officer cadet courses. As expected, the

association  between performance in these  courses

and education level is statistically significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies will be made available to the hon.

Member if he wants them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second part of the Member's

question, that is, relating to training  and  work

experience,  these  are  taken  into  account   in

assigning    recruits   to   military   vocations.

Naturally, training and experience in a particular

civilian   vocation   would   result   in   better

performance  in  the  SAF  in  related  vocations,

particularly  in  technical  vocations   such   as

mechanics, electricians, draughtsmen, fitters  and

so  on.  However, it often happens that the supply

of  technically  trained  recruits  in  particular

lines  exceeds  the requirement for  that  intake.

When  this  happens, the surplus will have  to  be

assigned to other vocations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

whether national servicemen are assigned to jobs

according to their educational qualification. I

would like to cite an example. A national

serviceman who is an architect is assigned to the

Navy where he is required to teach the men how to

maintain ship's machinery. This assignment is

irrelevant to his line of education. If he were

assigned to the Architect Division, his knowledge

would be put to proper and better use. I hope the

Minister will give consideration to this point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, of course, there are many lines of education

for which there is no equivalent work in the armed

forces. Architecture is one of them. True, we  can

make  use of the architect in a civilian role  but

then  he  will not be doing national  service.  He

will   be   doing   civilian  work.   What   about

Mathematics?  How  do we employ mathematicians  in

the  armed forces as mathematicians? So,  in  many

vocations, they are assigned to do combat work. In

fact, for most University graduates, the policy is

to  assign them to an appropriate combat arm where

they  will be trained in the officer cadet  school

so  that eventually they can provide leadership in

the SAF.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DOCTORS' ATTENDANCES IN GOVERNMENT HOSPITALS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health (a) what is the number of local and foreign

doctors in the Government hospitals; (b) what is

the daily average number of persons referred to

those hospitals and how many doctors attend to

those cases; (c) whether the number of doctors in

those hospitals is sufficient to cope with the

cases referred; and (d) what steps are being taken

to recruit more doctors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the numbers of local doctors and

foreign  doctors in the Government  hospitals  are

319 and 71 respectively. I have given to the Clerk

of  Parliament a list* (*See Appendix, cols 1311-2) of hospitals  which  spells out the number of outpatient attendances,

admissions and the number of doctors allocated  to

each of these hospitals. I presume the Member  for

Anson has been given a copy also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to give these attendance

figures  in greater detail as the amount  of  work

that the doctors are engaged in the hospitals  are

varied  in  character. They,  unlike  the  general

practitioners in private practice, are involved in

looking  after  cases which general  practitioners

are  unable  to  look at, and they  are  therefore

preoccupied with investigative work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of doctors in each hospital

therefore  is  only  part of  the  answer  to  the

question  asked  for  by  the  Member  for  Anson.

Whether  the  number of doctors is  sufficient  to

cope with the cases referred, it is impossible  to

give  a  positive or definitive reply. I am afraid

that  there are no standards against which it  can

be determined whether there are enough doctors for

any  particular type of work. But it is true  that

it  is possible to reallocate doctors so that  the

doctors  are  posted  to  units  where  there  are

shortages and where demand is great.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, may I know whether the figures given in the

list are correct? According to the list, the daily

average  number of outpatient attendances  is  210

for  the  Toa  Payoh Hospital and  1,023  for  the

Singapore General Hospital. I would like  to  know

whether  the figure of 210 attendances for the  Toa

Payoh Hospital is correct or not.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Anson does not

realise that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



the  Singapore  General Hospital  has  1,500  beds

whereas the Toa Payoh Hospital has only 450  beds.

That explains the difference. Secondly, it is true

that   the   number  of  Accidents  and  Emergency

attendances  at Toa Payoh Hospital .has  increased

considerably  this  year as  against  last  year's

figures  for  the  simple  reason  that   we   are

reorganising the Accidents and Emergency Units  in

all  hospitals.  We  know that the  Accidents  and

Emergency Unit is a very sensitive unit  and  that

it  is considered unpopular or is a cinderella  in

all  hospitals. But we are going to make sure that

all  housemen and medical officers spend some time

in  this  unit as it gives them a broad  scope  of

training.  The figures which I have given  in  the

list  apply  to the year 1974. I do not  have  the

1975 figures.

<div align="center"><b>JTC EXECUTIVE FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of CPF contributions to purchase)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Labour

if  he  will  consider the utilisation of  Central

Provident  Fund  contributions by contributors  to

purchase  "Executive Flats" built  by  the  Jurong

Town Corporation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time that

the  Member  for Jurong has raised this  question,

and I am afraid I have to disappoint him again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund is established to

provide  compulsory savings for workers for  their

old  age or when they become permanently disabled.

The  Government has, however, allowed  members  of

the   Fund   to   use   their  CPF   savings   and

contributions to buy publicly built  flats.  Under

the   Central  Provident  Fund  (Approved  Housing

Scheme) Regulations, 1968, members of the Fund are

allowed to use their CPF contributions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



to buy flats built by the Housing  and

Development  Board and the Jurong Town Corporation

for the lower income group. Members of the Fund in

the  middle  income group on the  other  hand  are

allowed under the Central Provident Fund (Approved

Middle  Income Housing Scheme) Regulations,  1975,

to use their share of the CPF contributions to buy

flats  built  by the Housing and Urban Development

Co. (Pte) Ltd. These two housing schemes go a long

way  to  assist  a great majority of  citizens  in

purchasing  a flat. In view of this, it  has  been

decided not to extend the use of CPF contributions

for  the purchase of other properties. I therefore

regret  to inform the Member for Jurong  that  CPF

contributions will not be allowed to be  used  for

the  purchase  of  executive flats  built  by  the

Jurong Town Corporation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if you will recall, when

I raised  this question  some  time ago the situation  was  quite

different. At that time the HUDC had not yet  been

established.  But today the HUDC is  in  existence

and  its  object  is to provide  housing  for  the

middle  income  group. Those in the middle  income

group  are allowed to use their share of  the  CPF

contributions to purchase flats built by the HUDC.

What is the difference between the flats built  by

the  JTC  and the HUDC? The flats are  almost  the

same. And since CPF contributions can be used  for

the  purchase of HUDC flats, why is  it  that  CPF

contributions cannot be similarly used to purchase

flats  built by the JTC? Es this not some sort  of

discrimination  against flats  built  by  JTC  for

people  living  in JTC estates? I  think  that  we

should  not deny people living in Jurong Town  the

opportunity  to -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, what is your supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am coming to it.

My supplementary question is this. On the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



assumption that the Government has no intention to

allow   members   of  the  Fund   to   use   their

contributions for the purchase of executive  flats

built  by the JTC, does the Government then intend

to  allot a piece of land for HUDC to build  flats

for the middle-income group in Jurong Town?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not in charge of the

allocation of land to the Jurong Town Corporation.

The  Member for Jurong should direct his  question

to the appropriate authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same point has been raised by the Member for

Jurong at the time of the last Budget debate and I

think  the  Finance Minister had already  answered

his point. The position has not changed very much.

In  fact,  I  would say the position has  improved

with  the  HUDC  scheme. So I  do  not  think  the

how  many  poultry farmers in the area  have  been

activity and under what terms; and whether he will

consider  making available bigger  land  areas  to

those  poultry  farmers to  expand  their  poultry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to reduce pollution from

pig  waste, it was decided to resettle pig  farms

from the Kranji/Pandan catchment to non-catchment

areas.   For  this  purpose:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;599 hectares in Punggol/Serangoon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;253 hectares in Jalan Kayu and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184 hectares in Tampines have been acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Punggol/Serangoon area has been designated

for intensive pig farming. It is the intention  to

resettle 640 large pig farms from Kranji  to  this

area. They keep a total of 180,000 pigs or 84%  of

the total pig population in Kranji. So far, 214 of

them  have applied for land at Punggol and 67 have

been allocated land there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of 254 hectares for pig farming in

the  Lorong Buang Kok area is almost completed and

resettlement  of  farmers from Kranji  has  begun.

Sixty-live hectares have been earmarked for  large

commercial pig farms. This will offset  any  short

fall  in  pig production that may result from  the

resettlement exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five investors have applied for commercial

lots, nine of whom have been approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of farm holdings has begun and the

pig  farms are expected to be operational by  mid-1976.  Further  allocations of resettlement  lands

will be made as and when the newly developed areas

are ready to take in farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninety-one poultry farms in Punggol are affected

by  the development of the area for intensive  pig

farming.  Sixty-two of them, keeping  a  total  of

406,594 poultry, are allowed to remain subject  to

their  maximising the use of the land for  farming

activities.  They will not be given more  land  to

expand poultry keeping, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



the  priority  for  land  use  there  is  for  pig

rearing.  They will be allowed, however,  to  keep

pigs in addition to rearing poultry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred and ninety-one families including 45

farmers   have  to  move  from  the   area   under

development.  The  total  amount  of   ex   gratia

compensation paid out so far is $1.8 million.  For

the  remaining areas census survey has yet  to  be

carried  out  and, therefore, no  details  of  the

resettlement cases are available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Hon. Senior

Minister  of  State for National Development  will

not  disagree with me that eggs and poultry are  a

basic  necessity of the people of Singapore. Would

he not then consider encouraging the expansion and

development   of   poultry   farming   when    the

opportunity   presents  itself?  In   putting   my

supplementary   question   I   have   taken   into

consideration the second last part of  his  answer

that no more land will be given.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, Singapore at the moment is self-sufficient

in poultry and eggs. In my answer I have indicated

that  62  poultry farms are allowed to remain  and

they  are encouraged to maximise the use of  their

land.  In  this  respect  they  are  expected   to

increase  their  production of poultry,  and  they

should   not   use  their  land  for   non-farming

purposes.   The   Primary  Production   Department

officials  will be available to advise and  assist

existing  farmers on maximising the use  of  their

land for farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plots of land allocated to the existing

farmers   are   sufficient,   according   to   the

statistics that have been surveyed, to allow  them

to  expand  their existing poultry activities.  In

fact,  we will encourage them, if they choose  to,

to  go into pig farming on the existing land.  But

if  they intend to go beyond the small scale  into

commercial pig rearing, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



will  have  to  apply for additional lots  outside

their present lots.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just wondering whether the

Senior Minister of State could inform the House

how permanent would the areas in Jalan Kayu and

Punggol be acquired as an agricultural area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, according to the Master Plan, which is

reasonably  stable,  the area  designated  is  for

agriculture, in particular, poultry and  intensive

pig farming. But what the future will be - whether

the  Master Plan will suffice for five or 10 years

-  is  subject  to periodical reviews  every  five

years.  As  we can see at the moment there  is  no

likelihood  of an alternative in the small  island

of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> As permanent as possible!

Trafalgar Estate and Jalan Seranggong Kechil  will

be  metalled  under the Kampong Roads Scheme,  and

what the cost will be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the metalling of tracks in

Trafalgar  Estate is being carried  out  in  three

phases. Metalling of 1.1 kilometres of tracks  was

completed  in  May 1975 at a cost of  $64,570  and

work  on  another  924 metres  of  tracks  costing

$48,450 is due to start soon. It will be completed

in two to three months' time. The metalling of the

remaining  1.2  kilometres  of  tracks   will   be

considered next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol may be interested to know

that his constituency

against  the  allocated sum of  $79,819  for

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you very much.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> The metalling of 655 metres of tracks at

Jalan  Seranggong Kechil costing $50,250  is

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the Acting

Minister  for  Culture would care to  answer  this

question.  Is  he aware that sometimes  there  are

slip-ups in the reading of the news bulletin  over

the FM stereo service at the 6.30 p.m. as well  as

the  7.00 o'clock news? There was an occasion when

I  heard  the  6.30 news over the FM transmission,

but  when the news was repeated at 7.00 p.m.,  the

reader  said, "The time is now 6.30 p.m.  Here  is

the news."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the main question is about the

turnover  rate  of  Division  I  officers  in  the

Broadcasting Division. If the Member wants to  ask

such  a  supplementary question,  he  should  take

another opportunity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder if the Acting Minister

for Culture considers this rate of turnover to be

high. If so, what are the reasons for such a rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not consider this

turnover   rate   as  high.  Those   who   resign,

especially  officers in Division I,  do  not  give

reasons. They do not have to give reasons. Another

factor  is  that there is too much  attraction  of

better  pay in the private sector. Of course,  the

Ministry   provides  encouragement   to   existing

officers  by giving them opportunities  to  attend

seminars  or overseas training, and we  hope  that

they  will cultivate the spirit of dedication.  We

also  hope  that the Chinese saying Yiu  nai  pien

shih  liang  will  not apply to the most  dedicated

officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if that is the case, would the Acting

Minister  for Culture consider the present  scheme

in  which  certain levels of senior  officers  are

given  extra perks in order to retain them in  the

civil service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, I do not consider the opportunity to attend

seminars  or assignments and training overseas  as

perks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I think the Acting Minister misunderstood

me.  What  I  mean is this. In view  of  the  high

turnover  rate of these Division I officers,  will

he  consider  giving them extra perks  similar  to

those  enjoyed by the other categories  of  senior

officers in the civil service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Sir, if we continue to give perks to civil

servants,  the private sector will top  them  all.

What  will happen then? I think the main  problem,

as  I  have said, is that we expect from the civil

servants  some kind of dedication and interest  in

their work rather than working just for the money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (for the Minister for Law and the Environment)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, all along it has been the policy

pitches. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



same  policy is also being followed by the Housing

and  Development  Board and other quasi-Government

bodies, like the Jurong Town Corporation. This  is

to  prevent  too  many hawkers in  any  area  from

selling  the same type of food or drinks, as  this

will  affect the business of the hawkers. It  also

prevents  the  possible  malpractice  of   hawkers

asking  for a premium or tea money in an  exchange

of  stalls or pitches. In other words, we  do  not

want  stallholders or licensees to indulge in such

malpractice for monetary profit. Hence the  policy

of  discouraging the exchange of hawker stalls  or

this  long-term objective, the Hawkers  Department

has  been  constructing  new  markets  and  hawker

centres  to  house street hawkers. No  action  has

been  taken  against hawkers who  sell  piece  and

sundry  goods inside shophouses. However,  in  the

case  of  cooked food hawkers, they must  sell  in

licensed food establishments. They must also apply

for stall licences. The reason for this policy  is

to  ensure  that food establishments are  suitable

and large enough to house the food stalls and have

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the National Registration Regulations,

1966,  all  Singapore identity cards  have  to  be

thereof before attaining the age of 17 years shall

re-register  within  a period not  exceeding  five

years from the date of his first registration.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



der  Regulation  15  every  year.  Re-registration

under  Regulation 16 will begin next year.  During

re-registration exercises, the identity cards  are

checked  to  verify their rightful ownership  arid

the  holders'  status. Failure to re-register,  as

provided  under  the Regulations,  is  an  offence

which  carries  a  penalty  of  imprisonment   not

exceeding two years or a fine not exceeding $3,000

or  both such imprisonment and fine. A person  who

fails to re-register will not be able to enjoy the

social benefits accorded by the State.

<div align="center"><b>(Transfers of students)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs and Education how many  primary  and

secondary   school  students  have  been   allowed

transfer to another school, because of shifting of

homes,  since  2nd  January, 1975,  and  how  many

applications for such transfer are still  pending;

and if his Ministry will undertake, at the request

of   parents,  to  arrange  for  such   transfers,

especially  of  students  in  the  lower   primary

classes,  instead of the parents having themselves

to  look for places for their children in the  new

school as at present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Sir, parents who wish to transfer their children

from one school to another, whether on account  of

a change of address or for any other reason, apply

direct  to  the school of their choice. They  seek

assistance of the Ministry of Education only  when

they  encounter  difficulties.  Where  parents  so

request, the Ministry will assist in arranging for

the  necessary transfers. Since most transfers are

dealt with by the schools direct without the  need

to   refer   to   the  Ministry,  no   record   of

applications   for  transfer  is   kept.   Figures

relating  to  transfer  on account  of  change  of

address are therefore not available.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, if parents were to go to the school for a

transfer,  the  principal will say, "No  vacancy".

The Ministry of Education, therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



has to direct the principal to take in the student

because he has changed his address.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Anson does not

understand  me.  If parents have  any  difficulty,

they  should  approach the Ministry of  Education.

The  principal  can only say whether  there  is  a

vacancy  in  his school. He will not know  whether

there  are vacancies in other schools. So  parents

should  go  to  the  Admissions  Section  of   the

Ministry of Education where the officers can  help

them  as far as possible to find places in schools

nearest their homes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, that is what I want. A directive must be

given  to every principal that if any boy wants  a

transfer  his  parents can go to the  Ministry  of

Education.

<div align="center"><b>DROPOUTS FROM ENGLISH SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and Education what plans the Ministry  of

Education  has  in regard to the  problem  of  the

large number of dropouts from English schools  who

become  virtually  illiterate  some  years   after

leaving school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many factors have contributed to

the  lapse  of literacy among our school  leavers.

One   of  them  is  the  rapid  expansion  of  our

Education in the past. Another is that many school

leavers  stopped using or learning English because

their  home and neighbourhood make them revert  to

dialect. The emphasis now is on teaching what  the

pupils  can  absorb.  The  restructuring  of   the

Education  system  advocates  pupils  learning  at

their  own  rate (i.e, they will progress  to  the

next  higher  grade only when they are  ready  for

it).  This  allows  pupils weak  in  languages  to

concentrate on one. These measures will help raise

the   literacy   level  of  our  pupils.   Serious

considerations are being given to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



provide  some  form of continuation education  for

dropouts   between  the  ages  of   14   and   18,

irrespective of their language streams.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask a

supplementary   question.  If  a  student's   home

environment  is not conducive to his learning  the

language  in  a particular language stream,  under

our  bilingual policy is it possible  for  him  to

learn  more  in  the  language  in  which  he   is

proficient?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy at the moment is that

parents may decide for their children. If a  pupil

finds  that he can study and understand better  in

one  language, be it Chinese or English,  then  of

course, educationally speaking, it is best for him

to  continue to pursue his studies in the language

in  which he is more proficient. The Ministry  can

only encourage pupils and advise parents, wherever

possible,  but the final decision rests  with  the

parents  themselves.  I  cannot,  therefore,   say

whether  they  will  accept  the  advice  of   the

teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in respect of his reference to the lack of

reinforcement in the child's environment, can  the

Minister  of  State tell us what steps  are  being

considered  to  provide  such  reinforcement,   if

possible? And I think it is possible. Also, in his

reference   to   the   provision   of   continuing

education,  what is he thinking in  terms  of  the

provision of this kind of continuing education  to

the school dropouts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, as for the opportunities for the child to

learn  more than one language, of course, exposure

time   is  one.  Teaching  techniques  and  better

teaching  methods  which the Ministry  is  at  the

moment trying to introduce is another. As for some

form of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



a  continuation education for the  child,  we  are

thinking in terms of language only because without

a  proficiency in language the child is unable  to

study  on  his  own. We do not  as  yet  have  any

definite plan as to what form it will take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Pardon me, Sir, but I would like some

clarification  with  regard  to  the  Minister  of

State's reference to the lack of reinforcement  in

the  child's  environment. I presume this  is  the

:home  environment. Therefore, I would  ask,  with

respect,  Sir, what sort of reinforcement  can  he

contrive  for the home environment to improve  the

opportunities  of  the child learning  the  second

language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the Ministry of

Education  is concerned, we can try  to  find  out

exactly  what the supporting environment  is.  The

supporting  environment  is,  as  the  Member  for

Katong has said, the home environment in which the

pupil  normally speaks a language, whether  it  is

English, Mandarin or any dialect. Therefore, it is

not  possible  for the Ministry  of  Education  to

change the child's environment. However, as far as

possible,  we  can  try  to  tailor  his   studies

according to his ability. For instance, in a class

where there are so many pupils, the teacher cannot

do  very  much for a child who lags behind,  other

than  trying as best she can to see that the child

learns as much as he can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

Ministry of Education might consider reaching  out

to the child's environment through the mass media.

We  have an Educational Television Service and  we

also  have a good Broadcasting service.  Will  the

Minister  of State consider reaching  out  to  the

children  who  are  not  so  good  in  the  second

language through the mass media?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that at the

moment the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



ETV service broadcasts quite a number of hours  of

educational  material, but the Education  Ministry

has no plan as yet to go into this. The reason  is

that  pupils  who  are weak in languages  normally

come  from quite poor families. So even if we were

to  reinforce their environment with increased ETV

programmes,  it is still doubtful whether  we  can

reach them effectively.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister of State

elaborate on his statement about the encouragement

and advice that the Ministry of Education gives to

parents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, can the Member be more specific in his

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, the Minister of State said earlier that the

Ministry  of  Education  encourages  and   advises

parents  with  regard  to  the  first  or   second

language   of   their  choice.  It   advises   and

encourages  them  to send their  children  to  the

right  type of school. Can he tell us or elaborate

on how the Ministry goes about advising parents in

this  regard?  I  have not really noticed  such  a

thing going on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the encouragement or advice

which  I  mentioned  just  now  is  based  on  our

restructured Education system. It has not yet been

implemented, but it is what we plan to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We have just four minutes left for Question Time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have only a very short supplementary

question.  What is the cause of this problem,  and

has   the   Ministry   of   Education   made   any

investigation  into it? Why are the  pupils  found

illiterate  after leaving school? Furthermore,  is

it  because the teachers are not performing  their

duties well, or is it because of short-comings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



in our society or for any other reason?  I

suggest the Ministry of Education should look into

this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the question raised by the

Member  for  Sembawang actually calls for  a  very

lengthy  answer. I think we had better have  first

things first.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Estate  Duty Act that, where one spouse gifts  the

matrimonial  house to the other and  continues  to

reside  in  it rent free by virtue of his  or  her

marital rights, the property is subject to  estate

duty on the death of the donor even when the donor

has  survived the statutory period of five  years,

if  he  will  consider granting an extra-statutory

concession  in such cases to relieve the  hardship

that  could arise where the matrimonial  house  is

the  only asset of any substance in the estate  of

the  deceased  so  that the surviving  spouse  and

other   immediate  members  of  the   family   are

precluded   from  having  to  dispose   of   their

residence in order to meet the death duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no concession is necessary in

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the charges at

playing  field  at Yung Ho Road are  the  same  as

those  charged  for  similar facilities  in  other

parts   of   the   Republic  by  the   Authorities

concerned.  These charges are already concessional

since none of these Authorities pay their way  and

none  of  them charge the full cost.  As  for  the

Japanese  and Chinese Gardens, it is not practical

to  have  different  admission charges  for  local

residents and citizens living outside Jurong Town.

In  any  case,  discrimination is  undesirable  as

these  gardens are meant for the enjoyment of  all

Singaporeans. However, I would suggest that, since

there  are  concessionary rates for large  groups,

and  for combined visits to both the Japanese  and

Chinese Gardens, the Member for Jurong may wish to

consider how such visits at reduced rates  can  be

arranged  through  the  Jurong  Community  Centre,

<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ngee Ann College was established in 1963 with

a  total  enrolment  of 447.  Apart  from  applied

chemistry and telecommunications engineering,  the

courses offered by the College were mainly in  the

liberal  arts and business studies. Following  its

reconstitution   in   1967,  the   College   began

diversifying  its  courses  with  a  bias  towards

technical  studies. The present enrolment  of  the

College  is  1,652, the majority of  whom  are  in

engineering   courses  leading  to  a   technician

diploma. In the next fiscal year, this will exceed

2,500.  The  courses offered by  the  College  now

include  mechanical  engineering,  electrical  and

electronic  engineering, shipbuilding  and  repair

technology,   building   services   and   business

studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the diverse nature of the courses it

now  offers, it is considered necessary to appoint

suitable members to the Council of the College  to

enable  its  diverse interests to be  met.  It  is

therefore proposed to amend section 7(l)  (c)  and

(g)  of  the Act to provide the Minister in charge

with  more flexibility to appoint Council  members

to serve the interest of the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the common seal of the College may

only  be  used or affixed on any document  in  the

presence  of  the  Chairman or  a  member  of  the

Council  and  the  Principal  in  pursuance  of  a

resolution  duly passed at a properly  constituted

meeting  of the Council and duly recorded  in  the

minutes  of  that meeting. These requirements  are

unnecessarily onerous when the common seal is used

on the College's diplomas and cer-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



tificates.  I  propose that  for  the  purpose  of

routine  validation of the College's diplomas  and

certificates, section 12 of the Act be so  amended

as  to  permit the affixing of the common seal  in

the  presence of two officers of the College  duly

authorised by the Council on its behalf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable for the Council to submit annual

reports on the performance of the College  to  the

Minister   in  charge  for  his  presentation   to

Parliament. A new section is therefore proposed to

meet this requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I am taking this opportunity to amend

the   Act  to  satisfy  the  financial  procedures

governing statutory institutions as prescribed  by

the  Ministry of Finance. A new section to the Act

to   prescribe  the  financial  procedures  to  be

followed by the College is therefore proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
