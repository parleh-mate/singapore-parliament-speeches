<div align="center"><h4>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S SPEECH</h4></div>



<br><br><!--Sir William Goode-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Sir William Goode, K.C.M.G.)</b> <i>(In Malay)</i>: Honourable Members-



<br><br><i>Introduction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This session of the Legislative Assembly is

another  step  away from the past.  The  immediate

future is clear and certain. During the next  five

years  a Government elected by a decisive majority

of   the   people  will,  through   peaceful   and

constitutional means, take the social revolution a

step  further. It is a Government pledged to bring

about a more just society.



<br><br><i>Economics and Finance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate task facing the Government is to

place  the finances of the country on a sound  and

healthy  basis.  The  threatened  deficit  of  $14

million for 1959 can be and will be wiped out  and

the  Government  has  not shrunk  from  unpleasant

measures to achieve financial stability. But  such

sacrifices as have been imposed by way of pay cuts

have  fallen on those most able to bear them.  All

development  and  special  expenditure  is   being

scrutinised  and  non-essential  items   will   be

scrapped. When every available economy measure has

been  examined, and if it is necessary further  to

close the gap between revenue and expenditure, the

Government will then see how revenue increases may

best  be  brought about. But it is important  that

all  possible measures of economy be first applied

before  the  public is called  upon  to  bear  the

burden of any tax increases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general economic situation, the

prime  task is to build up a climate of confidence

under  which trade expansion and industrial growth

can  take  place. Already there are  many  notable

signs  of such a build up. The Government  has  in

the  few  brief weeks of office received  numerous

enquiries from foreign and local firms who want to

set up new factories in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large the immediate prospects for economic

expansion are good. The political stability  which

is  a  pre-requisite for expansion and  which  has

been lacking for so long, has been achieved by the

election  with  an  overwhelming  majority  of   a

Government  whose declared policies are  clear-cut

and  unambiguous.  Further,  the  Party  in  power

enjoys  the  reputation of  honouring  its  public

pronouncements  and  the  future  conduct  of  the

Government is therefore predictable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been their declared policy, clearly

enunciated during the election campaign,  to  give

private  enterprise, both of  local  and  overseas

origin, all the encouragement and assistance  they

need  so that they can set up new factories  which

will  create more jobs for our growing population.

The  Government will not impose restrictions  upon

foreign  investors on the transfer of profits  and

capital apart from normal exchange controls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important, the Government will place at the

disposal of private industry, capital in the  form

of short term or long term loans for the expansion

or  establishment of enterprises. This will be one

of   the  principal  objectives  of  the  Economic

Development Board, which the Government  will  set

up as a statutory body. But industrial development

must take account of the economic policies of  the

Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are substantial advantages to be gained

both  by  the Federation and Singapore  by  having

their economic policies integrated. The Government

will approach the Federation Government for closer

co-ordination in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



industrial  development  programmes  of  the   two

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely in any major industrial

development programme that Singapore would be able

to  retain  its  100% free port  status.  Wherever

tariffs are to be erected, this must be done  only

when  the  advantage of increased  employment  and

additional  national income clearly  outweigh  any

possible loss in international trade. It will also

have  to  take  into  account the  market  in  the

Federation and the need for industrial development

to keep pace with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's guiding principle is industrial

peace with justice. Justice implies ensuring their

fair  and  just demands for a reasonable share  of

the  fruits of their labour. At the same  time  we

must  remember that a chronic state of  industrial

unrest  means the wrecking of our economy, and  if

our economy is damaged then workers, employers and

the country as a whole will suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way of ensuring industrial peace is to

encourage  workers  and  employers  to   use   the

machinery  of  collective  bargaining  instead  of

taking direct industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implies strengthening workers' organisations

so  as to enhance their bargaining position vis-a-vis  the employers. This means the emergence of  a

unified labour movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing its declared policy of a unified

Trade  Union  movement,  the  Labour  Ministry  is

consulting  all  the main streams  of  the  labour

movement  to get the widest possible agreement  on

the  structure of the new organisation to  be  set

up.  The  Government will also cancel registration

of   splinter   and   yellow  unions   after   due

investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also proceeding with its

declared  plans  to  establish  a  permanent   and

independent  Court of Labour, whose  findings  and

awards  would be binding and enforceable  on  both

employers and employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unified Trade Union movement under the

leadership   of   a  Trade  Union  Congress   with

executive  powers,  and a  Court  of  Labour  with

powers to enforce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



its  awards,  constitute  the  key  to  industrial

peace.  But in the first instance the channel  for

the  solution  of  industrial disputes  is  direct

negotiations  between  employer  and  Union,  then

conciliation  through the Ministry of  Labour  and

Law, and only finally the Court of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuance of its declared policy the

Government  is proceeding with plans  to  build  a

large  centrally situated Trade Union House.  This

will take some time to complete. In the meantime a

large building in the City area is being renovated

for temporary use until the new one is erected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans for the relief of unemployment on a short

term   basis   are  being  formulated,   and   the

implementation of these plans will be pressed with

the utmost vigour. The Government will concentrate

immediately  on  projects  employing  the  maximum

number   of  unskilled  or  semi-skilled  workers.

Details   are   being  worked  out   between   the

Ministries   of  Labour  and  Law   and   National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that certain statutory

provisions for the protection of workers have been

evaded.  Strong  action will be taken  to  enforce

these provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will enact legislation which,

whilst  recognising existing polygamous marriages,

will  make  it an offence for persons to  contract

other  than  monogamous marriages in future.  Such

legislation will not extend to Muslim marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community and Recreation services provided by

the Government are being reorganised.



<br><br><i>Medical and Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of health the Government will

implement  a  long-term plan in which the  present

emphasis on curative medicine will be modified and

the  emphasis  put  on the preventive  aspects  of

disease.  To secure this, the help of  the  people

will  be  enlisted through carefully-planned  mass

health  education campaigns which will stress  the

importance  of  proper nutrition, informed  social

hygiene, intelligent birth control and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



enlightened maternity and infant welfare  schemes.

The   campaigns   will   indicate   the   positive

contribution the people themselves can make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately, the Government proposes to introduce

a  series  of  short-term measures  of  reform  to

eliminate  obvious inadequacies  existing  in  the

health    services.   Service    in    out-patient

departments  and  clinics will  be  improved.  The

congestion  in Government hospitals'  out-patients

departments will be relieved by extension and a re-organisation  of  the services by integrating  the

existing   clinic   services   provided   by   the

Government   Medical  Department  and   the   City

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give the highest priority to

treating  tuberculosis, the major  health  problem

facing the community. After consultation with  the

experts,   a   scheme   for   compulsory    B.C.G.

vaccination programme for school children will  be

launched early next year. In conjunction with  the

Ministry of Labour and Law, it is proposed to draw

up a list of workers in occupations where there is

a  risk of contracting the disease, and to provide

for  these workers periodic X-ray examination  and

other necessary preventive measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be improved facilities for staff

training and a special emphasis will be laid  upon

kindness,  courtesy and consideration to  patients

and  the  public. These qualities and professional

efficiency  will be taken into consideration  when

making  promotions. In future non-English educated

nurses  and  midwives will also be  allowed  entry

into the service.



<br><br><i>National Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first task of the Ministry of National

Development   is   to  re-organise   the   various

subordinate organs under the Ministry to eliminate

duplication  of functions and wasteful expenditure

and  to step up operational efficiency. Plans  for

the absorption of the City Council departments  in

the Government are being proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the gravest and most pressing problems

facing  the  Government  of  Singapore  today   is

housing. Since 1947,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



when  it  first acted as the Government's  Housing

Authority,  the  Singapore Improvement  Trust  has

constructed a total of only 23,000 housing  units.

The  average  rate of construction is about  2,000

units  per year, and most of these are let out  at

rates  quite  beyond the means of  people  in  the

lower  income brackets. The Government is  pledged

to  make  an  all-out effort to ease  the  housing

problem.  The Government will increase the  annual

output   of   houses   built  by   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will ensure that the welfare and

interests  of  the rural dwellers  are  adequately

looked  after.  To  this end  a  survey  is  being

prepared  to  provide standpipes  for,  and  bring

electricity to, the rural areas. Rural people will

also  be  encouraged to build  kampong  roads  and

assist  in carrying out kampong drainage  schemes.

The  building materials in all instances  will  be

provided by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will make every effort to bring

about  increased production in agriculture, animal

husbandry and fishing. A number of schemes,  based

on  detailed  on-the-spot surveys  and  scientific

studies, have been prepared and are now undergoing

scrutiny, prior to implementation.



<br><br><i>Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy on Education is based on

three main principles. Firstly, acceptance of  the 1955   All-Party

Committee  Report   on   Chinese

Education  of the Singapore Legislative  Assembly.

This  provides for equal treatment  for  the  four

streams  of  education in English, Chinese,  Malay

and  Tamil. Secondly, acceptance of Malay  as  the

national  language. The Government will  encourage

the  learning of Malay by non-Malays, at the  same

time revitalising Malay education itself. Thirdly,

the  present  curriculum will be revised  so  that

emphasis  will  be on practical subjects  such  as

mathematics and science, to meet the needs  of  an

industrialized  society  and  on  the   study   of

languages of our country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey revealed that maximum use has not

been   made   of  present  school  buildings   and

available staff, both administrative and teaching.

In  the  113  Government English  Primary  schools

there  are more than 450 classrooms available  but

not  used. Furthermore, 26 Primary schools (14  in

Rural  areas  and 12 in the City) are running  one

session  only  instead of the usual two.  By  1960

when  a  two-session period is introduced, another

400 classrooms will be available for pupils. There

is   no   question   at  all  that   with   proper

organisation  of  all  available  facilities,  the

Government  can do more to meet the  great  demand

for  education  and  we  shall  do  so  from  1960

onwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic promotion in primary classes will

cease. With proper annual examinations as a  check

both  of the teachers' proficiency and the pupils'

effort  the fear of failing in the common entrance

examination   for   secondary  schools   will   be

diminished.  In  order to provide for  more  study

time  in  schools  for  the  study  of  languages,

mathematics   and  science,  all  elementary   and

secondary schools will be required to start a six-day  week  from the third term of this year,  i.e.

31st  August  for Malay schools and 7th  September

for English, Chinese and Tamil schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work is going apace in the revision of text-books

based on common content and Malayan loyalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1960 all secondary schools, both

Government and aided, will be required  to  be  on

two-session  if the number of pupils  warrant  it.

With  secondary  schools on a  two-session  basis,

consideration  will be given to  convert  some  of

these   schools  into  vocational  and   technical

schools    at    secondary   level.   Transitional

arrangements  for  equipment  and  staff  will  be

worked out.



<br><br><i>Adult Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to launch a mass

literacy and education campaign. The large  number

of  overage  pupils  who  cannot  find  places  in

schools  and the even larger number of adults  who

did  not receive any education at all, makes  this

an   urgent   and  vital  work  of  the  Education

Ministry. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



the  intention of the Government to reorganise and

expand  the  work  now carried  out  by  voluntary

bodies like the Singapore Adult Education Council.

It  is intended to put this into effect from  next

year,  so  that  all pupils will be provided  with

proper  syllabuses  and  receive  training   under

qualified instructors.



<br><br><i>Nanyang University</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Prescott Commission on the

Nanyang  University  will be published  soon.  The

Government will then discuss the future of Nanyang

University  and its graduates with the responsible

Chinese  Educational bodies. The  Government  will

encourage  the  closest co-operation  between  the

Nanyang  University and the University of  Malaya,

as it is in the interest of Singapore that the two

institutions  of  higher learning  work  in  close

harmony.



<br><br><i>Cultural</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political and economic revolution which we

have initiated must be sustained and reinforced by

a cultural revolution as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up a new ministry - the

Ministry  of Culture. Upon it will fall  the  dual

responsibility  of  informing  and  educating  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little was done under colonial rule to establish

a  sense  of  national identity among the  various

races in Malaya. It now falls upon this Government

to  instil in our people of all races the will  to

be a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means stimulation of existing languages and

cultures,  with emphasis on Malay as the  national

language.  It  will help foster the  growth  of  a

Malayan  culture  which while  drawing  sustenance

from  the  communal  cultures now  flourishing  in

Malaya   will   nevertheless   develop   its   own

distinctive characteristics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this end in view the programmes in Radio

Singapore  will be more positive and  creative.  A

great deal more will be done than has been done in

the  past  to break down the barriers between  the

four language programmes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only will there be more pooling of programmes

between  the different language sections of  Radio

Singapore,  but  each  section  will  also  become

ambassadors  of  a national rather  than  communal

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the fullest use will be made of civic

and  cultural associations to further the work  of

creating a Malayan outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every aspect of its work the Ministry of

Culture  will  seek the fullest  co-operation  and

participation  of  the  people.   In   the   final

analysis,  it  is  the people and  not  Ministries

which develop culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library and Museum will be called

upon   to   make   their  contributions   to   the

development  of  a Malayan consciousness.  In  the

field  of  library development, a great deal  more

will  be done to meet the needs of the non-English

reading public.



<br><br><i>Home Affairs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of Singapore lies ultimately in re-uniting with the Federation of Malaya as a state

in  an independent country. It is the Government's

intention during its term of office to create  and

bring about conditions favourable to an early  re-unification  with the Federation.  The  Government

will take firm action to prevent any irresponsible

activities  by  individuals  or  organisations  to

negate  this paramount interest of the  people  of

Singapore  and Malaya. The Government will  always

consider  the views of the Federation  Government.

In   the  same  way,  the  Government  hopes   the

Federation  Government will understand  the  hopes

and  aspirations of the people of  Singapore,  and

the  ways in which this Government seeks to fulfil

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic political situation in Malaya has not

changed  today.  The shooting  war  waged  by  the

Federation  Government and the  Malayan  Communist

Party  enters  the eleventh year. This  Government

has  stated  its  position clearly on  subversion.

"Subversion" is any political activity designed to

further  the  aims and interests not  of  our  own

people but of foreign powers. By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



foreign  powers  this Government  means  not  just

Russia  and  China, but also America and  Formosa,

and  the  Western bloc. The Government will  fight

and  counter  subversion be it from the  Right  or

from the Left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government stands for an independent,

democratic,  non-Communist, socialist  Malaya.  It

cannot  be  pressured  into  deviating  from  this

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Police Force has been regarded as

an  instrument of Colonial rulers and as  a  thing

apart from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the attainment of internal self-government

there  is a significant change in the role of  the

Police.  It  will  no longer be an  instrument  to

further the aims of a Colonial regime. In a  self-governing country the role of the police  will  be

to protect the life and property of the people, to

maintain  peace  and  order  and  to  protect  the

people's  elected Government from being undermined

and  subverted from within and without.  It  is  a

primary  duty  of  this  Government  to  establish

mutual  confidence and respect between the  people

and the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the introduction of the Criminal Law

(Temporary   Provisions)  (Amendment)   Ordinance,

1958,  and  the subsequent detention of more  than

200  gangsters last October, it would appear  that

Secret  Society activities have yet to be crushed.

In   addition   to  preventive  detention,   other

measures  will  be  necessary  to  combat   crimes

committed by the secret societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the entry of immigrants, the

Government  will  constantly  bear  in  mind   the

political  and economic interests of the  country.

It    welcomes    technicians,   scientists    and

industrialists  to Singapore, but will  discourage

those  who come here to compete for jobs with  our

citizens   and  thus  aggravate  the  unemployment

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's immigration policy must be in

alignment  with the Federation's, for  freedom  of

movement across the causeway is of mutual interest

to the people in both territories.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new constitution, external defence is

the  sole  responsibility of  the  United  Kingdom

Government. It is only appropriate therefore  that

the United Kingdom Government should bear the cost

of  all local forces under the operational command

of  the British Services. The new Government  will

therefore  take up this question with  the  United

Kingdom Commissioner.



<br><br><i>Cultural and Trade Relations</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that Singapore is the

focal  point of South-East Asia by virtue  of  its

geographical  position  and  its  status  in   the

commercial  and maritime world. It is,  therefore,

important that it should strengthen relations with

its South-East Asian neighbours, in particular the

Republic   of  Indonesia,  which,  next   to   the

Federation of Malaya, is its closest neighbour.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the first steps of this Government on

the  road towards an egalitarian society.  If  the

past was renowned for the pomp and resplendence of

the  privileged  few  who constituted  the  ruling

class,  let the future be notable for the gracious

manner  in which these privileges are returned  to

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that some of the outward forms and

trappings  of  the past have remained  should  not

blind  us to the very great changes in the content

and  purpose  of  the new Government.  It  is  the

intention of the Government to keep that  part  of

the past which helps the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a personal note:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the last of the British Governors of

Singapore. It is not as Governor and Commander-in-Chief that I deliver this address on behalf of the

first   elected  Government  of  the   people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the need to hand over the reins of the

administration swiftly and smoothly, Her Majesty's

Government  in  the United Kingdom had  laid  down

that I should be the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

It  is my intention to accomplish this within  the

five  months  that are left of my office.  Then  I

shall  hand over my duties and the honour of  this

high office to a Malayan-born who will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



be   more   suited   to   fulfil   the   role   of

constitutional  Head of State in a  society  where

symbols for national identification and solidarity

can play so valuable a part in nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

Speech, Mr Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant at

Arms, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



Clerk, the Clerk-Assistant and the Second Clerk-Assistant, escorted His Excellency out of the

Chamber, and the Assembly adjourned without

question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
