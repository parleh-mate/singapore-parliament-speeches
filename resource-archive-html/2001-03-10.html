<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head Q - Ministry of Home Affairs.

Amendment No. (1), Prof. Chin.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the GPC for Home Affairs will focus primarily on

the Home Team and its relationship with the community in this

Committee  of Supply.  We believe that the Home  Team  should

continue  to  work hard at integrating the community  in  its

efforts to fight crime in Singapore.  Because of the increase

of  public  awareness  in  crime  prevention,  we  have  seen

positive  results in combating crime in Singapore.  We  would

like to see more done in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Team released its major crime report

recently,  indicating a drop of over 17%  in  major  offences

cases.   This  is heartening news indeed and  the  Home  Team

deserves  recognition  for a job  well  done  in  year  2000.

However,  there  are  a couple of disturbing  statistics  and

trends  and I would like to ask the Minister to clarify  some

of  these  for  us.   First,  for  sexual  offences,  namely,

outraging modesty and rape, the decrease has been marginal  - 1.6%  for  rape  and  3.3% for outraging modesty.   In  other

words, these offences are still committed with regularity.  I

am particularly concerned that the two rape/murder cases, one

in  Woodlands and the other in Bukit Gombak, remain  unsolved

to  this  day.  Even more disturbing perhaps is that  we  now

have  sexual  offenders who are using the Internet  and  chat

lines  to establish contact with their victims.  Even  though

the  figures may still be low, eight rapes and two  cases  of

outraging modesty, they are on the increase, and may increase

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



further  if  no  action is taken.  How  will  the  Home  Team

respond  to  this worrying problem?  May I suggest  that  the

Home  Team  embark  on  a publicity campaign,  especially  in

secondary schools and the like, to warn young people  of  the

potential  dangers  of  becoming too friendly  with  Internet

contacts.  Simple measures such as getting them to make  sure

that  their chaperone comes along perhaps should be  told  to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, while I note that house-breaking has registered

a  30%-plus  drop in the year 2000, the number  of  break-ins

into  private properties has actually increased  somewhat   - 134  cases  in  year 2000 as compared with 97  in  1999.   In

percentage terms, the increase is in the region of about 38%.

Could  the  Minister  let  us  know  how  the  Home  Team  is

responding  to this worrying trend?  Has the Home  Team,  for

example, taken any steps, similar to the ones that have  been

taken  in  HDB  estates where police officers  have  actually

visited  the  residential  units to  provide  residents  with

information  and  advice  about  crime  prevention?   Perhaps

similar  steps should be taken by the police with respect  to

private homes and estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I note that foreigners account for roughly 10% of

those  arrested  for crimes in Singapore.  While  this  might

seem  as a small percentage, it nonetheless comes to a figure

of  nearly  1,500 foreigners  -  the majority  of  them  work

permit  holders or on social visit passes.  I should like  to

know  whether  we  have sufficiently tight  controls  at  our

border  checkpoints to prevent such criminals  from  entering

Singapore.  Do we have good relations with the police  forces

of  other ASEAN countries, South Asian countries and China to

improve the screening of foreigners coming to Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the Home Team has made Singapore a

much  safer home for almost everyone.  I hope that this  year

it will be an even safer one for Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

last year, the crime rate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



was  reduced by 14.7% as compared to 1999, and this  is  very

encouraging.  Many people are saying that our Home  Team  has

been doing a very good job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining law and order in our society is just as

important  as  our  national defence,  and  we  need  a  very

effective  force to take care of this matter.  Our  declining

crime rate did not come by chance.  It is  the result of  the

efficiency  of our Home Team.  Last Saturday, I attended  the

annual  meeting  of the review committee on  the  Home  Team,

which  includes  the Police, Immigration  and  CNB  officers.

Every  unit  presented  its  workplans  and  these  are  very

comprehensive and farsighted plans.   That is why I say  that

the decline in our crime rate did not come by chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, generally, the crime rate has reduced,

recently we read from the media that there were many cases of

juvenile  delinquencies, especially young girls involving  in

fighting  and robbery, and there were also a lot of cases  of

outraging  of  modesty and rape.  This gives the  people  the

impression  that there seems to be an increase in the  number

of juvenile delinquency cases.  It is particularly noteworthy

that  an army officer and a teacher were involved in a series

of  outraging of modesty cases.  There was also  one  15-year

old  girl  who  made friend with someone on the Internet  and

subsequently  had  sexual  intercourse  with  a   number   of

strangers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the statistics released by the police

that  there were only two outraging of modesty cases  arising

from  Internet acquaintances, there were eight cases of rape.

This  was  significantly more than last year's  figure.   But

these  were  only reported cases.  We do not  know  how  many

cases went unnoticed, because no police report was lodged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that our young people and students like to

go  on  ICQ  and chat room on the Internet.   And because  of

their curiosity, they become easy prey for the criminals.   I

think the parents and the teachers should take special notice

of this.  Although such cases are not many, it seems to be on

an upward trend.  I think

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



the police should pay more attention to this problem and take

some effective measures to counter them.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, earlier, I spoke about

the  need  for the Home Team to establish a strong bond  with

the  community.  There are several innovative  programmes  in

place to encourage this sort of bonding.  In particular,  the

two-year  old Community Safety and Security Programme  (CSSP)

has taken root in many grassroots organisations.  Even school

children  and  stallholders in markets are  now  involved  in

CSSP.   At  last count, over 500 RCs are involved in  such  a

programme.  This, again, is a major achievement for the  Home

Team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there are grassroots organisations formed, the

bonds  between  the  Home Team and the  community  have  been

strengthened through the CSSP.  However, in the case  of  new

towns, there is frequently a perception among residents  that

the Home Team has not been visible enough, and that they fear

that  there is insufficient protection, especially  when  the

policy  is  now  not  to build any more Neighbourhood  Police

Posts  (NPPs),  but  to concentrate on  the  larger  type  of

Neighbourhood  Police  Centres  (NPCs)  and  mobile  policing

rather  than  static NPP type of policing.   Nonetheless,  it

appears that the traditional concept of the policemen on  the

beat still strikes a chord of security in many residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Home

Team  could look into how police presence can be improved  in

new  estates, where residents have a natural tendency to feel

insecure  in  their  new  environment.   Would  the  Minister

consider the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) reinstate foot patrols or bicycle patrols in new

areas  where there are many new residents and where  the  RCs

have not yet been formed;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) purchase more mobile NPPs and station them on a

regular basis around the new neighbourhoods; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) start house visits early to new residents; in

fact,  as  soon as they move in and, in any case,  not  later

than 6-8 months.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such visits and patrols increase police presence

significantly and add to the sense of security and well-being

among the residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Community Safety

and  Security  Programme (CSSP) was started in 1998,  and  it

brings  together the grassroots organisations, the  CDCs  and

residents with the help of the Home Team to address  specific

areas  of concern pertaining to security.  I think there  are

sound   principles   that   underlie   this   approach.    It

fundamentally   emphasises  that  safety  and   security   is

everyone's responsibility, and it nurtures the spirit of self-help  and  mutual support within the community.   So  on  all

those counts, it is very consistent with Singapore 21 and the

idea of active citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I have for the Minister is, given that

the  programme has been in place for over two years now,  how

well  received is it on the ground, particularly amongst  the

RCs.   Also, last year, there was the suggestion that it  was

going to be extended to schools, and I would like to know how

the schools have responded to this initiative, especially  as

there  were  some  concerns that schools  might  be  somewhat

reluctant    because  they  may  be  stigmatised  as   having

particular problems and that is why they are participating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also interested to know how the Ministry

assesses  the  effectiveness of the CSSP.  Is  it  purely  by

input  measures,  such as the numbers participating,  or  are

there  other  ways  that we can measure  the  efficacy?   For

example,  the latest crime statistics show that  the  elderly

have  been  particular  targets for cheating  offences.   Has

there  been  a  response through the CSSP to this  particular

form of problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the related issue is police presence which the GPC

Chairman,  Prof. Chin, has also spoken on.  Even as residents

come  forward to do their bit, they do look to the police  to

continue to maintain vigilance and protection on the  ground.

In  this  regard, police presence and visibility is  crucial.

The feedback is that residents see less of the men in blue on

the ground.  They attribute this to closure of NPPs and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



also perhaps to a greater emphasis on police patrols by cars,

rather  than  by foot or bicycle.  Sir, I do not  think  that

this  is confined to just the newer estates.  In general,   I

have  received  this  feedback from  various  quarters.   The

visibility of the police has an important deterrence value to

would-be criminals but perhaps, more importantly, it  has  an

important   assurance  value  for  residents,  assurance   of

security and general safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what measures are

in  place  to ensure that the police continue to  maintain  a

certain  level  of visibility on the ground, particularly  in

those  areas  of high human traffic where visibility  through

foot patrols or bicycle patrols will be much more effective.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now, our GPC

Chairman,   Prof.  Chin,  talked  about  a   scheme   whereby

Neighbourhood  Police Posts (NPPs) are closed down  with  the

opening   of   Neighbourhood  Police  Centres   (NPCs).    My

constituency is one of those affected by this scheme,  and  I

would like to reflect some of the feedback I have got from my

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1980s when we first started this concept of

Neighbourhood  Police  Post, the NPP has  become  a  familiar

feature  in  our neighbourhood,  and it has given the  people

the  impression  that the Police is very  friendly  and  pro-residents.  Very good relationship has been built up  between

the Police and the residents,  and it has given the residents

a sense of security living there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with this new concept of Neighbourhood Police

Centre  being implemented, many of these NPPs will be  closed

down  and many people are feeling a sense of loss, as  though

with the closure of these NPPs, they would lose this sense of

security.   They do not understand why the Police  must  make

these  changes.  Some people are concerned that by so  doing,

it  would  affect the law and order in the area and would  go

back to the situation before these Neighbourhood Police Posts

were  set up.  The good relationship previously built  up  by

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



policemen  in  the  NPPs  and the  residents  would  then  be

dampened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would answer these queries.

<br>10.15 am

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,

I  thank the Members for their comments on the good work done

by  the  Home Team, and in particular the Police  which  they

talked  about  -  their presence and their relationship  with

the  community,  that  there is now  a  very  wide  level  of

acceptance of the Police friendliness and the way  they  have

been  helping  the  public, and serving  their  security  and

safety needs on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Chin has mentioned, crime rate has indeed

dropped very significantly last year.  Last year was in  fact

a  very  good year for the Police in that the crime situation

was  under  control,  although we still have  something  like

30,000 cases of seizable offences reported last year.  But as

a  percentage,  this is a significant drop of something  like

15%  from that of 1999.  On a per hundred thousand basis, the

drop  is  even  more significant, from 924 to 764  cases  per

100,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, eight of the nine index crimes fell,

compared to 1999.  Index crimes are those offences which  are

used  for  international comparison purposes on the situation

of  crimes  in other parts of the world.  These are  selected

for  their  reliability and higher reporting rates.   In  our

context,  the nine offences in the index crimes  are  murder,

rape,  outraging  of  modesty, robbery, housebreaking,  motor

vehicle thefts, snatch thefts, cheating-related offences  and

rioting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property offences such as housebreaking, robbery, motor

vehicle   thefts   and   snatch   thefts   also   fell   very

significantly, between 14% and 36%.  The offences of  murder,

cheating-related offences, outraging of modesty and rape also

declined.   But  the  offence of rioting  recorded  a  slight

increase of 4%, after having dropped by close to 33% in 1999,

compared to 1998.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang was concerned about youth crime and

the  situation of young people not knowing about the  dangers

of  Internet chats, and so on, the same concern as  expressed

by  Prof. Chin   -  that young girls are caught unawares when

they  engage themselves in IRC chats and eventually get taken

advantage of.  There has been a slight increase in the number

of  such cases reported, but the number is still very  small.

But  the main part really is in not just Police having public

education  campaign  on  the young  people  but  the  parents

themselves  must play a very important part in ensuring  that

their  children,  when they get involved in  Internet  chats,

know  what they are doing and educate them of the dangers  of

meeting strangers in strange places and unaccompanied.  There

is  a  Parents Advisory Group on the Internet led by  private

citizens and the Police will work closely with them, together

with the Education Ministry, on educating our young people on

the dangers of such Internet chats, which may eventually lead

them to trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the whole, talking about crimes committed by

youths,  such as shoplifting, theft, rioting, causing serious

hurt, these have decreased very significantly.  The number of

youths  arrested for shoplifting, which is a major  component

of the number of crimes committed by the youth, has decreased

by  16%,  from 1,300 cases to 1,100 cases in the  year  2000.

The  number of youths arrested for theft, which also includes

shoplifting,  has  also  fallen from 2,400  youths  to  1,900

youths, and that is a decrease of about 23%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have seen a significant decrease in the number of

youths  arrested  for  shoplifting or  theft  which  includes

shoplifting.   While that is still quite a  large  number,  I

think  that  with enough of publicity effort on this  on  the

part  of the Police to educate the young people, particularly

working  very  closely with the schools to  ensure  that  the

students  know  the rights and wrongs when  they  go  to  the

shops, and not just be too quick with their fingers and pinch

things  that do not belong to them and not paying  for  them,

the crimes involving youths and young people have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



actually not increased.  But I think the perception  that  we

have  a  problem  among the young people  that  there  is  an

increase  in  youth crime probably is due  to  the  publicity

given  by the media whenever a case happens, and when  it  is

reported, people get excited about it.  When these cases  are

highlighted,  then, of course people will be concerned.   But

from  the number of young people arrested for crimes, we have

not seen an increase but we have seen a significant decrease.

Nevertheless, we pay very close attention to making sure that

young  people do not go wayward and we try to do as  much  as

possible  to  educate  them about the dangers  of  committing

crimes.   In my Ministry, we have formed an Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on  Youth Crimes, chaired by Prof.  Ho  Peng  Kee,

working together with the Education Ministry, the Ministry of

Community  Development and Sports, and  the  other  voluntary

organisations.   The whole idea is to engage  the  community,

plus  all  those  Government agencies that  are  involved  in

educating  young people or making sure that they do  not  get

into trouble, like MCDS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This multi-agency approach actually has worked quite

well in that they have come up with many new ideas to cope or

deal  with  this  problem of young people committing  crimes.

They have also worked with this Parents Advisory Group on the

Internet.  So we should leave it to such initiatives and  not

get the Police thoroughly involved in every activity or every

crime  that  may impact the public.  Really, in the  case  of

young people, the parents themselves should play an important

part  in educating their own children and not leaving  it  to

others alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a concern expressed by Members that the

Police  seem  to  withdraw themselves from the  community  by

setting  up Police Centres and closing down police posts,  as

Mr  Goh  Choon Kang said.  Actually, this idea  of  a  Police

Centre  increases the presence of Police on the  ground.   It

does  not  reduce the presence of Police on the ground.   The

NPPs  in the past, we still have them  -   and by the  middle

of this year, we would have concluded the phasing over of the

Neighbourhood Police Centres taking over a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



large  part  of the NPC system  -  we still have  these  NPPs

until  July, and thereafter we will have the NPCs  being  the

key  nodes of the Police presence on the ground, supplemented

by  some  other  NPPs that are still in operation.   But  the

difference between the NPP and NPC is that in the  past,  the

NPPs  were very static operations.  NPP just involved  a  few

officers sitting in the post and from time to time, they went

on  house  visits, they went on their feet  or  patrolled  on

their  bicycles.  And even when they were requested to attend

to a crime scene, they just went there and watched and waited

for  their  divisional officers to come.  So we thought  that

was  not  a  very  good use of Police resources.   For  every

trained  Police Officer should really be right there  on  the

ground  the  moment something happens and do something  about

it, and not just waiting for an investigator or somebody else

to come from the Division to start the investigation work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this NPC system has allowed us to pool more of our

Police officers together in 32 NPCs, so that with the number,

they  can then do their job more thoroughly when they respond

to  a  particular event or incident.  Let me  assure  Members

that with the phasing over to the Neighbourhood Police Centre

system,  there  is  no reduction in Police  presence  on  the

ground.   In fact, the level of Police presence has increased

with  the NPC.  And the Police will make their presence  felt

in  the  form  of  foot  patrols,  bicycle  patrols,  vehicle

patrols, as there are now more vehicles on the road than when

we  had the NPP system.  These vehicle patrols also allow our

Police  officers  to  reach a wider  area,  instead  of  just

walking  on  foot and reaching a small part  of  the  estate.

With  the  communication equipment available  in  the  Police

vehicles, the patrol vehicles are also deployed to respond to

`999'  calls  whenever  there is an  incident  reported.   In

addition,  the  Police  Task Force  operations  and  the  dog

patrols also complement this regular Police force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the NPC system, we have four officers from each

NPC  conducting patrols

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



compared  to practically no one doing foot patrols under  the

NPP  system.  By July this year, we will have more  than  124

officers  from  the NPC performing such foot patrols  island-wide.  So the public should see an increase in the number  of

officers on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about the temporary police post that we

have  deployed, or actually we call them mobile police  post.

We have deployed these temporary or mobile police posts since

1997.   They  are basically vehicles and they make  stops  at

selected  locations at different times of the day.  They  are

deployed to meet some very transient or very seasonal demands

for  Police  presence, such as when there  is  a  crime-prone

area, we will set up a temporary or mobile police post in the

particular  area.   We have now three such  temporary  police

posts,  and  by  the end of this year, we will  have  another

three  more.   So  we will increase the number  of  temporary

police posts by the end of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin mentioned that the residents of new housing

estates are concerned about the sense of safety and security.

Let me assure him that the Police is very mindful of this and

that  is why we will try to build the Police Centres  in  the

new  towns  such as Sembawang and Chua Chu Kang  as  soon  as

possible.   By  the year 2003, Police Centres  will  also  be

built in Sengkang, which is another new housing estate.  Even

before  the Police Centres are set up, the Police  will  make

sure  that  their presence is felt through the deployment  of

these  temporary police posts.  I have also asked our  Police

Officers to try to work together with HDB to find out who are

the  new  residents who move into the new estates  and  visit

them  as  soon  as possible, to assure them that  the  Police

knows that they have moved in and that they are around and if

they  need help, there is a particular number which they  can

call  to seek assistance.  So that is well in hand.   Let  me

assure  Prof.  Chin and his constituents that the  Police  is

well  aware of their concerns and they will do what they  can

within the resources to cope with their demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the sense of public safety in Singapore is

quite high.  At least in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



last   survey  that  the  Police  conducted   -   the  Police

commissioned  a private survey firm to conduct  a  survey  in

late 1999  -  almost 96% of the respondents, including  those

from  the new housing estates, feel that the general security

of Singapore is good or, if not, better.

<br>10.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang is worried about the closure of the

police posts when we set up police centres.  We have to  look

at  the overall deployment of the force, including the siting

of  the  police  centres  and the police  posts.   In  a  few

instances, I have noticed that the police post is just  about

200  metres away from the new police centre.  In fact,  there

is  one instance where the police post is just 20 metres away

from  the  police centre.  It does not make sense to  have  a

police centre and the police post almost within one minute of

walking  distance.  So these posts would have to  be  closed.

For  example, the one in Braddell Heights will be closed when

we set up a new police centre there.  But the residents there

need  not  be  too worried because the police  presence  will

still be felt on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of residents in areas where we have the

police  centres  seems to suggest that they  now  feel  quite

comfortable  with the new police centre system.  And  indeed,

in  those  areas where we have the police centres, crime  has

fallen  and  more  residents are  also  getting  involved  in

ensuring  the safety and security of their own neighbourhood.

Two surveys conducted in 1999 and 2000 showed that almost 90%

of  the  residents and grassroots leaders who live  in  these

areas  where  we  have  the  police  centres  supported   the

introduction  of  the police centres.  They also  appreciated

the  fact that police centres deliver more services and  have

more  police presence on the ground than before when we  have

the  police post system.  This means that this system is  now

gaining  acceptance and it is only in the old areas where  we

do  not have police centres yet, and people are very used  to

the  police posts where they can just go and chat up with the

friendly  policeman, that they feel a bit uncomfortable  when

they see a bigger station

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



with  more officers and they do not know who to keep in touch

with, and so on.  Let me assure the Member that when we  have

a  police  centre,  we will also delegate  officers  to  work

closely  with  the grassroots leaders so that the  grassroots

leaders  will know who to contact when they have any  request

to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were also asked about the Community Safety and

Security  Programme and how much more involved are  residents

now  in  the  safety and security of their own neighbourhood.

As  Prof. Chin has cited the numbers, there are now more than

500 such Community Safety and Security Programmes.  This is a

programme  to  directly  involve the residents  concerned  in

dealing  with  the problems of their own areas  because  each

neighbourhood faces different problems.  And it is better for

the  residents themselves to find out how to deal with  those

problems by working closely with the authorities, whether  it

is  the police or whether it is some other Government agency.

And  the  police  will, together with  the  other  Home  Team

partners, give them whatever resources they need to do  their

job.  But the primary initiative must come from the residents

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran's area in West Coast, for example, has a few

Community  Safety and Security Programmes.  But they  can  be

much  more  active than what they are now.  With Mr Iswaran's

support and involvement in encouraging them to be more active

in  looking  out for issues and problems that  concern  them,

they  will  be  more  effective in increasing  the  sense  of

security  among  the  residents.  It  is  important  for  the

advisors on the ground also to play their role, and not  just

leave it to the RCs and the community organisations, to  take

their  own initiative.  If they take an interest, I  am  sure

their residents will take an interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of schools, a year-plus ago, I have asked

the Education Ministry to see whether we should not introduce

a  scheme like that to the schools so that, at least,  within

the  school community, they can help to improve the sense  of

safety and security among the students and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



teachers.  And the Home Team took this to the schools, to the

Education  Ministry,  spoke  to  the  principals   and   many

principals  were very supportive.   Now, we have  42  schools

directly   involved  in  the  school  safety   and   security

programme,  and  they  have come up  with  many  initiatives.

Quite  a  number of them have been publicised, including  the

safe  drive zone within the school's neighbourhood to  ensure

that  when the children come to school, or when they go home,

and  when  there are too many vehicles in the school compound

and  in  the vicinity of the school, how they can ensure  the

safety of the children who leave or come to the school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But numbers alone are not enough, of course. We need to

have quality programmes.  With these new initiatives and when

they  come  from  the  residents, they feel  that  they  have

identified  the  problems and found the solution,  they  feel

quite proud when they have achieved something.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quote an example here. In March last year,

Blks  55  and  56 of Telok Blangah Drive in West  Coast  GRC,

which  is  also  Mr Iswaran's GRC, were hit by  a  series  of

deliberate fires that caused substantial damage to the common

areas.   More seriously, the fires were potential threats  to

the  elderly residents living there.  So the West  Coast  GRC

leaders  and the town council, together with the Bukit  Merah

West  Neighbourhood Police Centre, implemented this Community

Safety and Security Programme to deal with this threat.  They

found  that there were many discarded mattresses, newspapers,

furniture which had given the arsonists a lot of materials to

burn.   So  they  realised  that  these  materials  had  been

discarded by the residents at the staircase landings and lift

lobbies,  partly because the elderly residents  cannot  carry

these  materials,  like mattresses and  newspapers,  down  to

discard  them  in the proper places.  So once  the  principal

source of the problem was identified, all the residents  came

to help and they quickly cleared the staircase landings and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



lift lobbies of all these flammable rubbish.  Since then,  no

fire  has occurred in these two blocks, Blks 55 and  56,  and

the  elderly people there now feel much safer.  So this is  a

simple  example and yet very effective way of  how  residents

can  be involved in their own safety and security without too

much of the police presence on the ground, or too much of the

civil defence involvement in this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin expressed concern about foreigners committing

crimes.   Let  me assure him that the great majority  of  the

foreigners,  who  come and work here legitimately  with  work

permits,  come here to earn a living.  They do  not  come  to

commit   crimes.   It  is  only  those  who  try  to  smuggle

themselves in illegally and they eventually cannot find food,

lodging and employment that they may resort to crime.  I will

talk  about the illegal immigrant situation afterwards.   But

even   then,  taking  into  account  that  group  of  illegal

immigrants, immigration offenders plus the legal workers, the

number  of  foreigners who were arrested for crimes  actually

went down from 1,700 to 1,450, a drop of almost 16%, and they

accounted  for  about  9%  of the  total  seizable  offences,

excluding immigration offences.  And this has been about  the

same over the last five years.  So there has been no increase

in  the number of foreigners arrested for crimes committed in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how we can tighten border control, like improving

security screening, for example, we have a very porous border

and  people  can come in easily by hiding themselves  in  car

boots  and  we have tens of thousands of vehicles  coming  in

every day, it is not an easy task.  But we will acquire X-ray

machines  by the end of the year at our Woodlands  Checkpoint

to   help  us  combat  this  problem.   But  even  with   the

installation  of the X-ray machines, we cannot  screen  every

vehicle.   Because to do so, we will definitely have  a  very

long traffic jam stretching all the way to Johor Baru.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have dealt with all the points raised by the

Members.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the other areas

that the GPC has mentioned as a subject that should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



brought up is the use of technology by the Home Team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is an instrument for both good and evil. In

today's world of supercomputers and broadband communications,

both  law  enforcement agencies and criminals are  locked  in

battle  using the latest and most sophisticated  equipment  - one,  of  course,  to prevent detection,  and  the  other  to

improve detection.  Technology these days allows fingerprints

to  be  lifted  off  fabrics, DNA profiles to  be  determined

through saliva or a sliver of hair, faces to be reconstructed

with sophisticated software and computers.  At the same time,

technology  allows  criminals  to  hide  their  tracks  using

encryption, and to coordinate their activities to  use  clone

phones, to jam communications or radar equipment or to create

counterfeit currency or false documents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister how technology has

been  utilised  to  assist  the Home  Team,  particularly  in

criminal investigations.  For example, the Minister mentioned

on  a  previous  occasion the possibility of starting  a  DNA

database for those with criminal records.  Could he update us

on  how  far  this project has gone?  And how  this  type  of

database would render perhaps other types of criminal records

unnecessary?  Could he also let us know how the Home Team has

been  reorganised to fight the techno-crooks?   How  has  the

Home Team leveraged on technology to make them more efficient

and more effective in the investigation of crime?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> I am not speaking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Prof. Chin asked how technology can

be   used   for  crime  investigation  and  crime  detection.

Certainly,  as criminals become more sophisticated  in  their

methods, the Singapore Police Force must also do likewise  by

making use of technology.   And indeed, the Police will  have

to stay ahead of the criminals in order to do its job well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent initiative which the Police has undertaken to

improve a crime investigation method, which is the old method

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



of  photo-fit,  manual  photo-fit,  is  to  come  up  with  a

computerised photo-fit system. In the past, Police took  many

hours  to  ask  the victim or the witness to reconstruct  the

possible  facial  features of a suspect  and,  painstakingly,

Police  has to search out for the many pieces before  it  can

come   to   a  composite  photo-fit.   But  now,   with   the

computerised system, it has reduced the amount of time  taken

to arrive at this photo-fit in a much faster time.

<br>10.45 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police is also updating and upgrading the automated

fingerprint  identification system, and this new system  will

have  features  that add greater value to  the  investigation

process.  For example, again, like the computerised photo-fit

system,   it  will  take  a  much  shorter  time   to   match

fingerprints  than  the previous method of  checking  on  the

fingerprints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned some time ago that the police will set up a

DNA database to complement the use of fingerprints and photo-fits  as  forensic  investigation tools  against  crime.   By

having  a  DNA system, it does not obviate the need  for  the

other traditional systems because we may not have DNA samples

available all the time for analysis.  So we may still  depend

on  other  crime  investigation techniques  like  fingerprint

search  and photo-fit.  The police is working to set up  this

DNA  database  by the latter half of this year.   DNA,  as  a

blueprint  of  living  things, is  a  very  powerful  aid  to

criminal  investigation, provided of course we get a  sample.

With  the  setting  up of this database,  DNA  profiles  will

analyse from evidence lifted from the scenes of crime and  be

matched  against  those  stored in  the  DNA  database.   DNA

evidence  is  helpful  not  only towards  solving  major  and

serious crimes, but also routine crimes as well.  DNA samples

will be taken from persons arrested for registrable offences,

suspects in relation to registrable offences who were  placed

under  arrest, and also people, eg, the police  officers  who

have access to the crime scene, so that they do not rule  out

any  particular  group  of  people,  and  they  can  have   a

comprehensive set of DNA prints for matching.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police is now working with the Attorney-General's

Chambers, the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, and

other   relevant  agencies  to  sort  out  the   operational,

technical, as well as the legal issues involved in setting up

this DNA database.  The database will be ready this year  and

will greatly enhance the police's investigative capabilities,

especially  in solving criminal cases that have few  physical

leads and few eye-witnesses to rely on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology will not only be used for crime investigation

and  crime detection but also for many other aspects  of  the

Home  Team's  work.  In our departments like  Civil  Defence,

Central   Narcotics   Bureau,  the   Prisons   or   Singapore

Immigration  and Registration, there are quite  a  number  of

these  examples  where technology has been deployed  to  good

use.   One  is the new Light Fire Attack Vehicle or  what  we

call   the  "Red  Rhino",  the  small  compact  fire-fighting

vehicle.  It is the result of the use of technology where  we

now do not store the water in the water tank to be carried to

the scene of fire, but rather to make use of fire hydrants at

the  scene itself, and then have the pumps and motors to  get

the water from the hydrant to the fire scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Coast Guard also, for example, has made use

of  surveillance and radar equipment, electro-optic  cameras,

and thermal imaging equipment to detect intruders at sea, and

imaging  x-ray equipment to be purchased by SIR.   Similarly,

for  the Prisons, the electronic tag is one example,  and  we

are  now  looking  at the new version of the  electronic  tag

which may not be so large as the one that is being used now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Members may want to note that we are

falling behind schedule on this amendment.  Prof Chin.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, according to the

statistics, there is still a substantial problem in Singapore

in illegal immigration.  The Home Team has arrested more than

16,000  immigration  offenders and overstayers  in  the  year

2000.  I understand that the Home Team has stepped up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



enforcement  action against such offenders.  However,  it  is

quite clear that these numbers will grow, unless we can  also

take  firm  action against those who bring them in,  ie,  the

traffickers  or smugglers; those who provide them  with  food

and  shelter, ie, the harbourers; and those who provide  them

with an incentive to come, ie, the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister whether the situation

concerning  the  harbourers  and  the  traffickers  is  under

control.   I  am particularly interested to know whether  the

number  of  harbourers  has  gone  up,  despite  the  immense

publicity that was given to the issue when this House debated

the  problem last year and the year before.  Sir, we have  to

live  on a different planet to avoid knowing about the  harsh

penalties  not just for immigration offenders, but  also  for

those who help them.  Yet, the perception is that the problem

has become worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the media has reported on deacons,

academics  and old ladies who are arrested and convicted  for

harbouring.  Very often, the defence is that they were either

duped by forged documents, or that they relied on the housing

agent.   Sir,  these  reports tugged at the  heartstrings  of

readers  who see only the personal trauma of the deacon,  the

old  lady and the academic.  Perhaps, what is needed is a new

procedure  on  vetting the bona fides of  foreigners  seeking

accommodation.  Can a one-stop agency, either at MOM or  SIR,

or  preferably both, be set up where, for a fee,  say,  about

$50,  a  validation of a prospective foreign  tenant  can  be

determined?   If a certificate is produced by the authorities

that  such  a  person  is a bona fide visitor  or  worker  in

Singapore,  then  it  can be presumed  that  the  person  has

entered and stayed in Singapore legally.  In this way, for  a

fee,  the worries of would-be landlords can be assuaged,  and

the  prosecuting authorities also would have  a  much  better

idea of whom to prosecute and whom not to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope that we can look into the legislation

to see whether there is a case for making housing agents, who

are charged with the duty of verifying the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



status of potential tenants, primarily liable for the offence

of  harbouring,  rather  than charging  them  as  aiders  and

abettors.   Sir,  may  I  suggest  that  the  legislation  be

amended, for example, to shift the burden of proof on to  the

landlord  to exculpate himself or herself, by simply  showing

that  he  or  she has asked a housing agent to check  on  the

status.   If he satisfies this on a balance of probabilities,

then  the  housing  agent, and not the  landlord,  should  be

charged with the primary offence.  In this way, justice would

be  done,  and  the  primary  wrongdoer  would  be  convicted

instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I commend the Home Team for their efforts

in  controlling the immigration offender problem, but I  hope

that the Minister would take further steps, as suggested,  to

buttress the law even further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, as Prof. Chin

mentioned,  last year 16,000 illegal immigrants were  caught.

Although the figure cannot be deemed to be very alarming,  it

remains  to  be  a very worrying problem for a small  country

like  ours.   With  some  of  our neighbours  having  serious

economic  and political problems, the situation can only  get

worse.  Apart from security problems, illegal immigrants have

also  become  a  peace and safety problem for  our  citizens.

Whether this fear is real or perceived, somehow it has always

been in the back of our mind that they pose a threat to us in

terms  of  our personal safety, as well as to our properties.

It  is  also  clear that apart from the problem  of  tracking

them, if they happen to engage in criminal activities, it  is

also  known that the crimes they commit are more violent  and

serious in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard a lively exchange between my

colleague,  Mr Shanmugam, and the Minister of  State  on  the

subject   of  mandatory  jailing  of  harbourers  of  illegal

immigrants.   While  I agree that stringent  laws  to  punish

offenders  who  knowingly  and persistently  harbour  illegal

immigrants  are necessary, I would like to know  whether  the

Home  Team has put in their best efforts to ensure that every

means  is  being explored to prevent these illegal immigrants

from entering Singapore.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



fully  appreciate that Singapore, being an island-state,  has

many possible entry points to be guarded, and it would be  an

extremely  difficult task to ensure that these  entry  points

are made impermeable.  And I must commend the Home Team for a

job well done so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have to make sure that this problem is

brought under control and not let it escalate.  Therefore,  I

would  like  the  Minister to inform us what new  initiatives

have  been  introduced, apart from increasing  the  stringent

checks on the checkpoint at the Causeway, constant patrolling

of  our shores, and the tough laws against illegal immigrants

as well as those who harbour them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, our

control  over  the foreign workers has been fairly  stringent

all  the  while.   Therefore, employers  who  employ  foreign

workers have to apply for work permits from MOM and to ensure

that  when  the  permits expire, they have to  take  all  the

necessary action to repatriate the foreign workers.  However,

there  are  some  foreign  workers  who  are  overstaying  in

Singapore  and  there are some Singaporeans  who  unwittingly

rent their premises to these overstaying foreign workers  and

are arrested and sent to prison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I have a resident in my constituency who

encountered this problem.  He advertised to rent out  one  of

his  rooms, and a foreign worker came with a photocopy of his

passport and asked to rent this room.  My resident took  this

copy of the passport and checked with the relevant authority.

He was informed that the passport was in order.  But not long

after,  the police came and arrested him for harbouring  this

foreign  worker who had overstayed in Singapore, and  he  was

charged  in  court.  .  He came to see me.  I  requested  the

police  to  further  investigate the  matter.   Finally,  the

police  found out that this foreign worker who had overstayed

had  actually  used a photocopy of his friend's passport  and

put  his  photograph on it.  As a result, he  committed  this

crime.   I  was  very  glad that the  police,  after  further

investigation, had withdrawn the charge against my  resident.

I would like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



to  know  whether the Immigration Department has looked  into

this  matter  and see how their system of checking  could  be

improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when we joined National Service, we

would surrender our identity card to MINDEF, and MINDEF would

issue a military IC to us, the NSmen.  Perhaps we should  use

the  same  system  for the foreign workers.  The  Immigration

Department  could consider using this system.  Any  foreigner

who wishes to work in Singapore must present his passport  to

SIR.   The  SIR  would then issue a special permit  with  his

particulars and photograph on it for him to carry it  as  his

personal identity card throughout his stay in Singapore.  The

work  permit holder would have to present this special permit

to  the  landlord when he applies to rent a room.   When  his

work  permit expires, and when his stay in Singapore  is  not

extended,  this  foreign worker would have to surrender  this

special  permit  to SIR to recover his passport  so  that  he

could proceed to go home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could also use new technology to examine whether

these  foreign workers have overstayed in Singapore,  and  to

track them down for serious charges to be taken against them.

I  feel  that with such a control system we would be able  to

reduce the unnecessary social problems to our citizens.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Chen said that the illegal

immigrant situation is not alarming but it remains  a  matter

of concern.  Certainly it is a deep matter of concern for the

Home  Affairs Ministry.  I am sure it is also a great  matter

of concern for many Singaporeans, particularly if they have a

neighbour  who has rented out such properties  to  a  foreign

worker  and they are not sure whether the foreign worker  has

proper  work  papers to work in Singapore or if  he  is  just

simply an illegal immigrant, and they are always very worried

that  something would happen in their neighbourhood.  So this

problem  of the immigration offender situation is still  with

us although I would say that it is in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



way  under control.  The numbers are still quite large.   The

number  of  immigration offenders arrested was  about  16,500

last year.  This is only marginally less than the 17,000 that

we  arrested in 1999.  So, there is still a big problem  with

us  and,  in particular, if you look at the number of illegal

immigrants  who  are  arrested - they  are  not  overstayers,

overstayers  are  the  ones who come in with  proper  papers,

passport  and  so on, but they just overstayed -  the  number

actually has not changed very much compared to 1999.  It  has

increased very slightly from 11,500 to 11,650.  Here, we  are

only  talking about those who were arrested.  There could  be

others who were not arrested.

<br>11.00 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On overstayers, we have seen a decline by about 10%,

from 5,400 in 1999 to about 4,850.  Mr Chen asked whether the

Home  Team  has done enough to stop these illegal  immigrants

from  coming in.  I think we have done quite a lot.  We  will

continue to do more.  But Singapore is a very porous place in

that  there  are  so  many checkpoints and  we  also  have  a

coastline that is not easy to keep watch on, particularly the

stretch of water between Johor and Singapore, is barely three

minutes away by speedboat.  Despite that, we will do our best

in making sure that the problem does not get worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as Singapore's economy continues to grow and so

long  as  there are employers and landlords willing  to  give

jobs  to  or harbour these illegal immigrants, we  will  have

illegal immigrants coming to Singapore, especially when it is

so  lucrative  for the traffickers to bring  them  in.   When

these  people come in, they do not know what they are in  for

until they are arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we done with regard to enforcement? We have

got  daily  police operations to conduct spot checks  on  the

ground  against the suspected immigration offenders in public

places   or   wherever  these  foreign  workers  or   illegal

immigrants  are likely to congregate.  We check them  because

legitimate and illegal foreign workers do mix around.  These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



daily  checks by the police resulted in the arrest of  15,000

immigration  offenders last year.  And altogether,  the  Home

Team  mounted 228 immigration offender operations  throughout

the  whole  of  last  year. Last year,  the  Home  Team  also

crippled two syndicates that smuggled illegal immigrants into

Singapore.  These illegal immigrant syndicates  provided  the

illegal  immigrants with forged documents to find  jobs.   17

syndicate members and 215 immigration offenders were arrested

in these two operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sea, the Police Coast Guard has kept up its

enforcement,  both in the southern, as well as  the  northern

part  of  Singapore.   We  have got  high-speed  interception

boats,  together with the latest surveillance equipment.   We

deploy  the  latest radar surveillance systems  and  electro-optic  cameras  at  strategic  locations  to  detect  illegal

landings  at night.  Last year, we detected 71 such  landings

and sea interceptions, compared to 52 in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Woodlands Checkpoint, there are more checks now

on suspected vehicles which bring in illegal immigrants. That

resulted  in  the arrest of 87 illegal immigrant traffickers.

Of  course,  many of the leaders of traffickers are  not  the

ones who bring these illegal immigrants in.  These syndicates

operate in the northern part of Singapore, Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no action is complete if we, say, just target

illegal  immigrants.  We have to also target those  who  give

jobs  to  the  immigration offenders, as well  as  those  who

harbour  them.   Last  year,  590 people  were  arrested  for

harbouring immigration offenders, compared to 306.  So  there

is  an increase.  That is in answer to Prof. Chin's question.

572   were  arrested  for  employing  immigration  offenders,

compared  to  388 in 1999.  This increase in arrests  can  be

attributed  to  the information provided by  members  of  the

public,  the  neighbours and others who know or  who  suspect

that  the  employer  or the landlord has  given  jobs  to  or

harboured  the  immigration offender.  Here, I  cannot  over-emphasise the critical role that the public plays in  helping

themselves  and  the Home Team to deal with this  problem  of

immigration offenders.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many avenues already available for homeowners

and  employers  to  check  the immigration  status  of  their

prospective tenants.  Prof. Chin suggested a one-stop centre.

While  the  law  requires due diligence  requirements  to  be

exercised  by  checking the passport, the original  documents

and  also  checking with the employer, last year, I announced

that the Manpower Ministry and the Singapore Immigration  and

Registration   Department  would  also  provide   information

through the Internet for employers or landlords to check  the

status of these foreign talents.  Since April last year, both

MOM  and  SIR  have  received about  5,300  and  3,200  phone

enquiries  respectively.  And since  April  last  year  also,

2,500  of  them have gone to SIR personally to check  on  the

immigration status of the tenants and 4,500 have gone to  MOM

to verify the authenticity of the work permit cards and other

employment  passes of the tenants.  People are  now  becoming

more  aware,  and that is good.  If they do not  want  to  go

personally and they cannot make a phone call, they  can  also

directly  access  the Internet.  Since the launch  in  August

last  year,  15,000 users have already accessed the  Internet

system.  SIR has also directly, or through the Inland Revenue

Authority, distributed pamphlets to all homeowners to  advise

them  on what to check when they let out their properties  to

foreign tenants.  We have done as much as we could, but I  am

sure  that there could be other ways of solving this  problem

or  helping  us  to  reduce this problem and  I  welcome  any

suggestions that Members may have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin suggested that we shift the burden to the

housing  agent  whenever a landlord employs a housing  agent.

We  are going to amend the Immigration Act to also enable the

prosecution  to prosecute the housing agent  if  he  plays  a

major  role in helping to secure that tenant, and that tenant

happens  to  be an immigration offender.  But that  does  not

obviate  the  need  for the landlord to  check  the  document

himself  because when the case goes to court, it is sometimes

very  difficult  for one side to believe the other  when  one

side's story is just as plausible that "He never asked me  to

check, etc."  We would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



require  both  parties to be responsible.  We  are  also  now

looking into amending the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has a few suggestions. One of his

suggestions  is  that  we  retain  the  passports  of   these

foreigners  who  come  to Singapore  to  work.   Firstly,  no

Government  authority can retain the passport of a  foreigner

unless it is through a court order, because that passport  is

the property of a foreign government.  Even if the law allows

us  to  retain  the  passport of a  foreigner,  there  is  no

guarantee  that the person would not overstay.  He can  still

run away.  He can still disappear.  And what it would mean is

that  we  are landed up with passports which we do  not  know

where to find the persons.  The best thing is to ensure  that

we have a different method of making sure that the foreigners

who  come  to  Singapore go home.  For a foreign worker,  the

employer  has to provide a bond to the Manpower Ministry.  He

can  only  take  the  bond back when the  foreign  worker  is

repatriated.  So, he has got to prove.  The moment  the  work

permit  is  cancelled, the foreign worker would  be  given  a

special pass of seven days, and then the employer has got  to

bring  him to the airport and send him home.  At the airport,

immigration  would check and take back the  embarkation  card

and  special pass from the foreign worker.  Then that  clears

the  record  that that person has left.  Those who  have  not

left  would then be the number of overstayers who  were  once

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at 4,800 overstayers arrested by the

police, we found that more than three quarters of them  (77%)

were those who came in with a social visit pass.  That means,

they  came in as visitors and were given 2-4 weeks, and  they

overstayed.   The  number of foreign workers who  overstayed,

including  some who were given special passes, is  only  23%.

So  the  problem does not lie with the foreign workers.   The

problem lies with the social visitors.  We have more  than  7

million  social visitors in Singapore.  How do we decide  who

to  go  after?  If he comes in, which is really for pleasure,

etc, how do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



we  ensure  that  he  provides a bond or that  he  keeps  his

passport  with us?  I do not think Mr Ang's suggestion  is  a

very practical idea.  We have to find other ways.  If Mr  Ang

has  better  suggestions to help us  solve  this  problem  on

overstayers, I will be very happy to hear it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform Members that I

will end discussion on this amendment at 11.35 am.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, we are

planning for a population of 5.5 million people.  We  have  a

population  of 4 million today, out of which only  3  million

are  Singapore  citizens.   I suppose  we  could  take  about

another   half  a  million  to  one  million  more  Singapore

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizenship is a much sought after commodity.

We  only  need  to  talk to people from China  and  India  to

realise  this.   Given the limited numbers available,  it  is

understandable that we should be selective in  whom  we  give

citizenship to.  I would like to ask the Minister if  he  can

tell  us what are the key criteria for Singapore citizenship.

The process has never been very transparent.  At my meet-the-people  sessions, I have frequently come across cases that  I

thought  worthy and deserving, but were rejected  time  after

time.   Many  of  these  cases  involved  relationships  with

Singaporeans,   spouses  and  children   born   overseas   of

Singaporeans living in Singapore who have often been rejected

for  citizenship without reasons being given.  Some of  these

involved  Singaporeans who have done their  national  service

and  they become bitter over these rejections for their loved

ones.   In  some cases, we lose them all, as they  decide  to

move overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to be more sympathetic in

cases  involving  relatives and loved ones  of  Singaporeans.

Singapore can only be our home if our loved ones are with us.

Otherwise, it is as good as telling them all to emigrate.  We

have given PR and Singapore citizenships to families who have

not  contributed to Singapore yet.  We took them in on  their

potential.  We should review our policies involving Singapore

citizens with roots

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



here  and  have already contributed to the country's progress

and prosperity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin is not speaking. Mr Wong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I would like to assure Mr Lew and his

constituents  that  SIR  is  always  very  compassionate   in

granting  citizenship to Singaporeans who marry  a  foreigner

and  who  happens to have children who are born overseas  and

requests for citizenship for their children are normally very

favourably  considered.  Just looking at the  data  over  the

last   three  years,  it  shows  that  about  90%   of   such

applications have been approved, whether it is a  Singaporean

woman  or a Singaporean man married to a foreign woman  or  a

foreign  man.   Only  in  certain  instance  when  there  are

irregularities  in  the marriage or where they  cannot  prove

that  they were married that SIR takes a closer look  to  see

whether indeed the child belongs to that Singaporean or  not.

There  was one case referred to by Mr Lew and, unfortunately,

I  am not at liberty to disclose all the details here, but  I

think  that  particular resident did not fully  disclose  his

relationship with his so-called wife, who bore him  a  child.

Unfortunately, in that case, SIR could not grant  citizenship

to  that child.  But, in general, SIR always looks favourably

in  such  cases and grants them citizenship, unless there  is

some doubt as to the legitimacy of the marriage.

<br>11.15 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But SIR will take it one step further, and they have

done  so  in  a  number  of cases by asking  the  Singaporean

applicant whether he or she is prepared to undergo a DNA test

to  prove his or her relationship with the child or not.  And

if  the  person agrees to do so, and if the test  shows  that

indeed he or she is the natural parent, then SIR will be very

sympathetic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, in February 2001, the CNB

had  successfully mounted an operation which resulted in  the

arrest  of  eight drug traffickers and 113 drug  abusers  and

seized  heroin,  cannabis and Ecstasy  tablets.   Altogether,

they have carried out three such operations.  I am

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



sure  this  is the major factor leading to the drop  in  drug

abuse cases reported last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although drug abuse cases cannot be a zero sum game, no

decrease in such cases can be considered sufficient.  As long

as there are crimes involving drug trafficking, there will be

a  drug  problem.   In  many  nightspots,  drug  abuse  still

prevails.  These places are mainly patronised by mostly young

people  and, if not checked, can create a very serious social

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disturbing development is the increase in cases

involving catamine or Ice.  As this is a very potent type  of

drug,  I would like the Minister to inform us the reason  why

this  particular type of drug offenders is on  the  increase,

and  also give us an update on the profile situation of  drug

addicts in Singapore.  Is the situation under control?   And,

in  the  case of drug rehabilitation, can we achieve a better

recovery rate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was also news that many Singaporeans

were  arrested  overseas  for drug trafficking.   The  reason

given  was  that foreign syndicates recruit Singaporeans  for

drug  trafficking  because Singapore is  deemed  to  be  very

stringent  in  the  law  against drug  trafficking,  and  its

citizens  are  subject  to less stringent  search  when  they

travel  abroad.  Is the CNB monitoring the situation, or  has

any follow-up action been taken to trace their connections in

Singapore?   Has any syndicate, engaging in recruiting  these

traffickers, ever been apprehended?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the drug situation has indeed

improved  quite  significantly over the last few  years,  but

that  does  not mean that we have no more drug  problem.   It

just  means  that  it  is well under control,  and  CNB  will

continue to work very hard to crack the syndicates that bring

in  the  various types of drugs.  The majority of  the  drugs

brought  in  are actually heroin, although we  now  see  some

increase  in  the  trafficking of  Ice  and  Yaba.   But  the

percentage  of  Ice traffickers is actually not  very  large.

Last year, only 9% of traffickers arrested trafficked in Ice.

But  the  increase of Ice traffickers arrested last  year  is

74%.  Ice is primarily brought in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Filipinos who come to Singapore.  So far,  it  seems

that   this  drug  is  very  much  confined  to  the  foreign

community,   just   like  Yaba  for  Thais,   although   some

Singaporeans  are  also  involved in  it.   Singaporeans  are

mainly involved in heroin, cannabis and Ecstasy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as rehabilitation goes, CNB, together with the

other  agencies in the Home Team working with the  community,

the  voluntary  organisations and the half-way  houses,  have

seen a significant improvement in the rehabilitation rate  of

our  drug  addicts.  For example, the relapse rate  has  gone

down,  from  80% or thereabouts many years ago to just  about

44%  last year.  But, definitely, more can be done by working

very closely with the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen is concerned about drug trafficking in the

nightspots,  nightclubs  and so  on.   The  National  Council

Against  Drug  Abuse (NCADA) is fully aware of that  problem.

But  let  me  say  a  word  of caution  here;  it  is  not  a

significant  problem.  NCADA has launched an anti-drug  abuse

initiative  this  year in collaboration with the  nightclubs,

discos,  KTV lounges, bars and pubs to promote this anti-drug

abuse  message among these nightspot goers.  Ever  since  CNB

took  a  very  strict approach with the nightclub  operators,

they have been very cooperative in reporting any sign of drug

trafficking among their clients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singaporeans trafficking overseas, yes,

indeed,  there  was  an  increase of  Singaporeans  who  were

arrested  overseas for drug related offences.   Between  1998

and  1999,  there was a significant increase from 65  to  132

last  year.   Last year, 98 were arrested overseas  for  drug

related   offences,  of  whom  53  were  arrested  for   drug

trafficking.    Because   of  the   lucrativeness   of   drug

trafficking   -   very  good  for  making  money    -    many

Singaporeans  do get tempted to be involved as  couriers  for

trafficking  drugs for other people.  But we will  work  very

closely   with  the  drug  enforcement  agencies   of   other

countries,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



like  Australia,  America, Thailand and so  on,  to  help  in

minimising this problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I ask the remaining Members who want

to  speak  to  confine  themselves to asking  their  specific

questions,  so  that  we can try to cover  as  many  cuts  as

possible?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in an effort to help

individuals who have been on the wrong side of the law and to

turn  over  a  new  leaf and, as a society,  to  become  more

forgiving, transparent, yet fair, I think we should fine-tune

our  criminal  registration  process.   Currently,  a  person

carries  a criminal record if he is convicted of any  of  the

scheduled  offences listed in the Registration  of  Criminals

Act.   He may have been punished for his crime, gone to jail,

served his sentence and even rehabilitated.  But certain jobs

are still closed to him, because of his criminal record.  For

example, if he applies for a vocational driving licence to be

a  taxi or bus driver, the licensing authority will conduct a

screening  with the Police Criminal Registration Office,  and

his  application will not be approved if the applicant has  a

criminal  record,  even records of minor  offences  committed

many,  many  years  ago.  He may apply to be  employed  as  a

security guard, and that will be turned down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the rationale for this stance taken by

the   licensing  authorities.   Clearly,  a  person  who  has

committed  robbery should not be allowed  to  be  a  security

guard,  bus or taxi driver.  However, for certain more  minor

offences  and  especially if he has not committed  any  other

offences  for, say, a period of 10 years, he should be  given

the  benefit of doubt that he has indeed turned  over  a  new

leaf  and  committed to embark afresh  on  a  new  life.   To

deprive him of this opportunity would be to condemn the petty

criminal for life, forcing him to go back to a life of crime,

as  he  would  not  be able to secure a  good  job  to  start

building a good life.  In a sense, he would be paying for his

crimes forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, for certain serious criminal

offences, such as sexual

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



offences, molest and rape, robbery, drug-related offences,  I

believe  the  public  has  the right  to  know  the  person's

background.   Presently,  we  have  to  rely  on  newspapers,

reports  or  gossip  to find out whether the  person  we  are

dealing  with, or intending to deal with, has been  convicted

of an offence in the past.  The screening process of checking

a  person's criminal records is not open to the public,  even

on  a need-to-know basis.  It is only available to Government

authorities.  Why should that be so, especially in  this  age

of transparency and full disclosure?  There may be situations

where a person has the need to find out another's background.

If you are considering whether to do business with someone or

to  rent  a  room to someone, or even when you  are  thinking

whether  to  let someone take your daughter out for  a  date,

surely  you  would want to be able to find out  whether  that

person was a trickster or molester.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing private or confidential about a

person's  criminal record or background.  For his crime,  the

accused is charged in open court, and evidence is produced in

open  court.  It is not something that he should be  able  to

hide.  I would like to suggest that these criminal records be

available, not just to the police, but to any person who  has

a  need  to  know through a process similar to the bankruptcy

searches  that one can do with the Supreme Court registry  to

find  out  whether a person has been declared a  bankrupt  or

not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Government has

announced that it will encourage recruitment of persons  with

criminal convictions in the service.  With this first step, I

think  the Government can go further than just making such  a

directive.   It should introduce legislation to  expunge  the

criminal  records of persons after a certain number of  years

have elapsed for some kind of offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon to come across people who did foolish

things when they were young, such as shoplifting, joining  in

a  fight after a staring incident, illegal betting, littering

or even being caught for selling illegal pirated VCDs.  These

are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



minor offences, done at a moment's folly or weakness.   If  a

person  has  repented by not repeating the same  offence,   I

think  his criminal record should be expunged after a  number

of years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a constituent who has been trying very hard to

expunge  her  shoplifting record, because she  believes  that

this will help her heal psychologically.  She was accused  of

stealing  from  a supermarket a compact powder  costing  less

than  $15  sometime in the mid-1980s when she was just  fresh

out  of  school.    She had pleaded guilty  under  tremendous

pressure   from  her  accusers  who  were  security   guards.

Although she later pushed this incident into the recesses  of

her  mind and went abroad to study, this unfortunate incident

came  back  to  haunt her and she abandoned her  studies  and

returned to Singapore.  She was emotionally scarred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has tried many avenues, including making an appeal

to the Ministry of Home Affairs, to expunge her record but to

no  avail  because, currently, there is no law  to  authorise

this.   Legally  speaking,  her  case  had  closed  upon  her

conviction, as the time to appeal had long lapsed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it appears that the records kept at the CRO

are  made  available  to all and sundry, and  all  Government

departments.   I  wonder if this is correct.   I  have,  from

experience,  applied for my constituents who  failed  to  get

passes just to enter the airport and the seaport, even though

they have got employment with transport companies.  They need

the  passes  to  get into such places.  As a result  of  some

minor  offences  in their records, several people  have  also

failed to get taxi driver's licences and there seems to be an

internal   checking  process  in  Government.    Hence,   the

seriousness  of  such  a record for no matter  how  small  an

offence  cannot be overstated  -   it will bar a person  from

gainful  employment for the rest of his life.   I  wonder  if

this is the right approach, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, Mr Ong and Mr Chng are concerned that

disclosure of criminal records would make it difficult for ex-prisoners to get jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, criminal records are kept by the police to

facilitate police investigations.  They are also referred  to

by the courts when sentencing repeat offenders.  They are not

for  public  information.  Therefore, as  a  general  policy,

police has not released them to prospective employers.   This

approach   assists   ex-prisoners  in  their   rehabilitation

efforts,  and this answers also Mr Ong Kian Min's  point.   I

think  we  should  keep the present practice  where  criminal

records are made available to Government departments, not  to

all  employers.  The current practice is for employers to ask

for  a declaration from job applicants whether they have  got

court convictions.  I think that is the right approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, I think there will be curiosity seekers. He

gave  an  example of a father who wants to screen prospective

suitors.   But  I think once you go that way, the  boundaries

will  expand  and other people will also make  all  kinds  of

enquiry.   So  for  the purposes of helping  ex-prisoners  to

rehabilitate, we should keep our present practice.

<br>11.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police provides screening information to employers only

for  jobs  that  have public safety or security implications.

Let  me  assure Members that this is not to put obstacles  in

the   integration  of  ex-prisoners  but  to  protect  public

interest  and safety.  Mr Chng cites some of these  jobs,  so

has  Mr Ong   -  jobs relating to the taxi trade, jobs  where

people  have  access  to the airports and  ports,  which  are

sensitive places where theft can take place and this can  mar

Singapore's reputation.  So these people who are  working  in

these  areas  will  be  screened, not just  directly  in  the

airport  and  port, but also employees working  in  companies

with  access to these places.  Because the principle  is  the

same  - they have access to these places where further  crime

can be committed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me assure Mr Ong and Mr Chng that people who are

barred from doing these jobs are not barred forever.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



are  guidelines  where after a certain period  of  time,  the

debarment is lifted.  Let me also assure Mr Chng and  Mr  Ong

that  my  Ministry is constantly reviewing the categories  of

people and the periods of debarment so that if need be,  over

time,  we can make it easier for people to get back into  the

workforce in these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point Mr Ong and Mr Chng made was whether or

not records could be expunged after a certain period of time.

Sir,  in  fact, currently the Commissioner of Police  already

has  the  discretion to expunge criminal  records  for  minor

offences.   This  is under section 7 of the  Registration  of

Criminals Act.  Indeed, he has expunged some of these records

in the past.  But the point is whether more can be done.  Let

me  also inform Mr Chng and Mr Ong that we are reviewing  the

Act  to see how the discretion given to the Commissioner  can

be  widened.   And  when  we  do this,  we  will  take  their

suggestions into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, in Singapore, we

believe   strongly  in  ensuring  and  maintaining  religious

harmony  and  that religion is not misused to  fulfil  vested

interests.  I would like to ask whether the Government has  a

screening  mechanism for preventing non-religious  groups  or

political   groups  to  register  as  a  religious   society.

Recently,  we have seen cases where companies and restaurants

use  religious  names,  causing  discomfort  among  religious

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that the Government consider making

it  mandatory for all religious groups to be registered to be

cleared  with the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony?

This  will help to ensure that all societies registered under

the name of religion are truly religious in nature.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let me assure Mr Yeo that the

Societies Act ensures that we do not allow any group to carry

out   undesirable  or  objectionable  activities   that   are

detrimental to society's interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are basically two levels of checks. First,

pre-registration; and second, post-registration.   While  any

group of 10 or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



more   persons  can  apply  to  register  a  society,  before

registering the group the Registrar will check to ensure that

the  proposed society's objects and activities would  not  be

contrary  to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore

or  national  interest.  He also consults relevant  agencies,

such as MCDS, if it is a religious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-registration, the society's activities would still

be subject to our laws.  If the society is found to have been

used  for unlawful purposes or purposes prejudicial to public

peace, welfare and good order in Singapore, the Minister  may

order the dissolution of the society under the Societies Act.

Hence,  we  do  not generally have a problem with  registered

societies in these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo, however, is concerned that some companies and

restaurants  registered with religious names may have  caused

discomfort  among religious groups.  Before  registering  the

name  of  a  company,  business or  society,  the  respective

Registrar will consult the relevant authority, such as Police

and  MCDS.  For example, if the name contains Islamic  words,

the  Registrar will consult MUIS.  If a complaint  concerning

the registered name is received, the Registrar will evaluate,

in  consultation with the relevant authorities,  and  if  the

complaint  is  a  valid  one, the  Registrar  would  ask  the

organisation to change its name.  In fact, just recently  the

Straits  Times  carried  a report on the  Singapore  Buddhist

Federation's concerns that some organisations are using names

associated  with  Buddhism.  It was also  reported  that  the

Singapore  Buddhist  Federation  planned  to  write  to   the

Registrar  of  Societies on the matter.  While  indeed  if  a

society  is using a name that is objectionable or misleading,

the  Registrar of Societies will, after consulting  with  the

relevant  authorities, if necessary, direct  the  society  to

change its name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last suggestion of Mr Yeo was to refer all such

applications  to  the  Presidential  Council  for   Religious

Harmony.   I think the Act designates different purposes  for

this Council and as I have assured Mr Yeo already, there  are

enough mechanisms and checks in place.  So I do not think  we

should load the Council with more work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been cases recently where some

individuals  who  have borrowed money from loan  sharks  sold

their  flats to new owners.  However, they did not bother  to

change the addresses in their identity cards and continued to

borrow  money from the loan sharks.  So when they are  unable

to  pay up the money, the new owners unwittingly have to bear

the brunt of the harassment caused by the loan sharks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to

double  their enforcement and come out with a more  effective

way  to  arrest these loan sharks.  I also would like to  ask

the  Ministry  to consider revising the law  to  punish  this

group  of  irresponsible  people who  intentionally  did  not

report the change of the addresses in their identity cards so

that  they will be spared from the harassment caused  by  the

loan  sharks.  In doing so, this would render justice to  the

innocent and the victimised new owners of the flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong is not speaking. Mr Ang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

the Seventh Month Festival is celebrated very extensively  in

Singapore every year.  The highlight of the Festival  is  the

auction of auspicious articles.  In most cases, proceeds from

such auctions are donated to charity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, the amount collected from such

auctions could be as much as $8 million.  However, last year,

the  Ministry restricted the auction bids to not  later  than

<br>10.30 pm each night. This has affected the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



proceeds  of  the  auctions.  Some festival  organisers  have

approached me to ask the Minister to allow them to extend the

auction  time by another quarter of an hour, till  10.45  pm.

We  could  perhaps designate the extra 15 minutes as "charity

time" when all auction proceeds collected would be donated to

charity.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the option of

prosecuting  borrowers was considered but not taken  up  when

the Moneylenders Act was reviewed in 1993 and again recently.

We  felt  that it would be counter-productive because illegal

moneylending  would  not be eliminated but  would  merely  be

driven   underground.    Currently,  Police   already   faces

difficulties from borrowers who are reluctant to cooperate in

the  investigations  and  in  any subsequent  prosecution  of

lenders.  If borrowing is made an offence, no borrowers  will

come  forward to give evidence against lenders.  Police  will

in fact not have an accurate picture of the ground situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Yeo highlights a type of borrower - a person

who  has  borrowed and changed his address, but then did  not

report  the  change  of address, so that  the  buyer  of  the

premises  gets  harassed  by the  loan  sharks.   In  such  a

situation,  first  and  foremost,  the  borrower  would  have

committed  the offence of not changing his address under  the

National  Registration  Act and  is  liable  to  a  fine  not

exceeding  $5,000  or imprisonment for a term  not  exceeding

five  years.   The question really is to find him.   I  think

this  is  one  situation where we may need  suggestions  from

Members.  Indeed maybe some press publicity will be good,  so

that  if  you  can  find  him, then you  can  deal  with  the

situation  and stop him from borrowing further and using  his

former address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng wants to raise the time limit for

Seventh Month dinners from 10.30 pm to 10.45 pm, so that more

money  can be raised for charities.  Currently, the  time  is

<br>10.30 pm, which is also the time in place for all other

events on the ground, such as wayangs and other events.  This

is a matter of balance.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



are  people who want a longer time, particularly the  Seventh

Month  organisers and participants.  There are also residents

who  live nearby who will say 10.30 pm is a good time.  So  I

think it is a matter of maintaining this balance.  This  time

limit  has  been there for a long time, and we have  enforced

it,  although with some flexibility.  I think it should  stay

at 10.30 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question that less money is raised for

charities, I would suggest that Seventh Month organisers, and

many of them already have done this, use other means to raise

funds,  both  in  the Seventh Month setting and  out  of  the

Seventh  Month  setting.  Indeed, one good  way  for  Seventh

Month  organisers to ensure that more funds are raised is  to

start  the event early.  Over time, this is happening on  the

ground.  So let us keep it at 10.30 pm.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of immigration offenders apprehended

last  year was 16,500.  The number of apprehensions has  been

going  down  since  1998 of 23,000.  The  number  of  illegal

immigrants has shown a similar trend, from 1998 of 14,700  to

11,650  last  year.  So also for overstayers, declining  from

8,300 in 1998 to 4,800 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems like great news. Perhaps we are beginning to

have  the problem licked.  However, with the ongoing economic

and  political problems of our neighbours, and the continuing

economic growth of Singapore, it is hard to imagine  that  we

do  not  continue  to attract an increasing  number  of  such

offenders  who are prepared to sacrifice their  lives  to  be

here.  The question which comes to mind naturally is:  Are we

becoming less effective in enforcement action and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



offenders  are becoming cleverer, as the statistics  suggest?

In  other  words, if the number is going down, does  it  mean

that  we  are doing a better job at controlling this problem?

Or  is  it because we are not able to really apprehend  these

people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I shall like the Minister to elaborate why he

thinks the control measures are sufficiently effective at the

source,  meaning  the  points  of  entry  and  not,  as   the

statistics  suggest, which is that we are less  effective  in

apprehending  such offenders.  The question to be  raised  is

the  amount  of effort we had done in 1998 versus last  year,

ie,  did  we have more raids in 1998 than, let us  say,  last

year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Police conducts raids from

time  to time and I have mentioned earlier on, they conducted

about 280 or 290 operations last year, specifically to target

at  these areas.  But in their normal patrols, they also look

at  the places where foreigners tend to congregate and,  from

time  to  time, check on those to see whether they  are  here

lawfully  or  not.  So the Police has done as  much  as  they

could.  But the Police cannot spend all its resources just to

look  for  illegal immigrants and overstayers because,  as  I

have  mentioned,  a lot of people come through  the  Causeway

every day, and even if we check everyone who travels with his

papers,  we  also  have  others  who  hide  in  vehicles  and

specially-constructed compartments in trucks and  containers,

and  so  on.   Unless we stop all vehicles  and  check  every

vehicle,  it  is simply not possible to screen  out  all  who

attempt to come in one way or another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the Member here that we will do everything

possible but within the constraints of our resources to  deal

with  this problem.  Ultimately, it must depend also  on  the

public to help  -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head F of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having suffered the guillotine yesterday, let me

speak  in  "CNN  style" and give three brief  points  on  the

Nominated Members of Parliament.  The criteria for  NMPs  are

settled  by the Constitution, and interpreted by the  Special

Select  Committee of the House that sits to decide who should

be  NMPs.   I believe, Sir, there is one important  criterion

which  is  not  set out in the Constitution that  should  be.

This important criterion is that NMPs should be non-partisan,

that is, not a member of any political party, whether of  the

PAP  or  of an opposition party.  In contrast, this criterion

is especially set out for the Elected President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point is that, I believe, this criterion

is  actually a very important one.  This is the best  way  to

ensure  that  NMPs  do indeed represent a wide  diversity  of

views  as the scheme intends.  It is also a safeguard against

the  NMP  scheme  becoming  a  backdoor  to  Parliament,   as

expressed by some concerned MPs when the scheme was first set

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point, Sir, is that I would urge Parliament,

and  especially the committee, to require that all candidates

for  NMPship  declare whether they are members  of  political

parties.   They should weigh very heavily against anyone  who

is.   More  when a candidate has been a member of a political

party  but  has since resigned, they should favour those  who

have resigned some time ago, rather than those who resign  on

the  eve  of  nomination.  There should, in  a  sense,  be  a

cooling-off period.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



Those  who  belong  to a political party,  Sir,  should  seek

elected  office.   NMPs should not be a training  ground  for

MPs.   They  should  be non-partisan and  seek  to  represent

independent views from diverse sectors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the question of whether an NMP

should  be  non-partisan or not, and whether this  should  be

clearly  stated in the Act, was fully debated in  this  House

when  the  Bill  was  first read  in  1989.    The  Bill  was

subsequently submitted to a Select Committee.  We deliberated

the  matter quite extensively and, finally, we came  back  to

the  House for the Third Reading, and the matter was  debated

again in March 1990.  And as the Prime Minister said, we want

the Nominated MPs to be non-partisan and that we would prefer

that   to   be  written  in  the  Constitution.   But   after

deliberation  in  the Select Committee, the Select  Committee

felt  that it was not necessary to have it written into  law,

but we should evolve this through practice and convention  to

make sure that the candidate or the person being nominated to

be an NMP should not belong to a political party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from the nomination form whether a person

belongs  to  any political party or not, because  I  remember

there  is  a  particular column that requires  him  to  state

whether he is a member of a political party.  There had been,

in  the past, some candidates or nominees who were members of

a  political  party and they had, by practice, resigned  from

the political party before they became an NMP.  But to be  so

purist to say that we should not have anyone who has belonged

to  a political party to be even considered for an NMP unless

he  has resigned from the party for a certain period of time,

I think we are just minimising the pool of people that we may

have  available  who may represent a certain segment  of  our

population  from being present in this House to speak  up  on

their  behalf, or to state their views about certain  issues.

So  while we want to evolve this, we should at the same  time

guard  against  limiting ourselves not finding  the  suitable

candidate just because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



the  person happens to be a member of a political  party  for

some time and has only recently resigned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most backbenchers, like myself, are working people.

We  have  to juggle between work in the office, parliamentary

work,  grassroots  work  and family.   We  need  support  for

research  and  other  secretarial  duties  so  that  we   can

discharge  our  political responsibilities  and  duties  more

fully.   I  am sure you like us to be more active in debating

Bills in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, allowances for legislative and

secretarial  assistants were introduced to help  backbenchers

to  employ  help.   We started with $500  for  a  legislative

assistant and $250 for a secretarial assistant.  Since  then,

the amounts have gone up to $550 and $275 respectively, which

is  10%  increase in 10 years.  This works out  to  about  1%

increase per year.  This amount includes the employer's share

of  CPF  which  means that the net amount they take  home  is

substantially lower after deduction of CPF.  It is  difficult

to  employ anybody with relevant experience with these  small

sums nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many Parliaments overseas, I know that MPs get

allowances for the full-time employment of two to three aides

and  assistants.  I am not asking for that right now.  But  I

think we can afford a little more so that we can employ  some

part-time  assistants with more experience  and  quality.  It

would certainly uplift the quality of our work which seems to

be  increasing  all the time.  The volume  of  our  work  has

increased with the formation of town

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



councils,  the GRCs, the Community Development Councils,  and

so  on.  We are now even doing charity work as well, that is,

fund-raising for charity.  I do not know what would be  next.

But  I  know  that it will not get any lighter.  I  hope  the

Minister will review this sympathetically.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we recognise that the last

revision  of  the  legislative  and  secretarial  assistants'

allowance  was  way back in 1993.  And when we first  started

this  scheme  in 1989, or thereabout, it was  only  $250  for

secretarial  assistants and $500 for legislative  assistants.

Even  in those days, the $750 would not enable the Member  to

employ somebody who is fully qualified to do the job for  him

in  researching  materials for his speeches,  etc.   So  that

allowance  is actually a small sum of money to  help  him  to

defray  part  of  the wages that he pays his legislative  and

secretarial  assistants.  It is not  meant  to  be  the  full

salary for a staff assistant for him.  Of course, after eight

years,  I  should say that we will look into that  again  and

find an opportunity to increase the sum of money.  But I hope

that  Members do not expect that we will revise  the  sum  to

such  an  extent that will enable them to pay  for  the  full

salary of the assistants.  Members have an MP's allowance  as

well.   Please make use of that as well to help  in  whatever

constituency work that they need to do.

No. (1), Mr Bernard Chen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget of the Ministry of Health for financial

year  2001  shows an increase of 30% over the previous  year.

The amount of $1,600 million is probably the highest that the

Ministry  has  received so far, indicating the priority  that

the  Government  has placed on healthcare  for  Singaporeans.

Whatever   the  various  indicators  may  say,   whether   as

percentage of GDP or per capita medical expenditure, the fact

remains  that  the Government is devoting considerable  funds

and resources to meet the health needs of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue however is not one of how much we spend on

healthcare, but do we spend the funds allocated,  whether  we

are  getting  the desired impact or we are just  wasting  the

resources.   I  note  that  of the amount  allocated  to  the

Ministry,   $1,200  million  is  in  the  form  of  operating

subventions to the restructured institutions of the  National

Health  Group  and  the Singapore Health  Services.   Between

them,   they  are  responsible  for  all  the  public  sector

hospitals,  national  centres  and  polyclinics.   They   are

autonomous  bodies  responsible for their own  bottom  lines.

What  may not be evident to the public is that they are  very

substantially   subsidised  by  the  Government,   especially

patients from a lower income category.  It would be useful if

the  Minister can elaborate on the main components  of  these

subventions  to  the  two restructured institutions  and,  if

possible, highlight the extent of the subsidies to the  lower

income groups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, can I move to the next item?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will propose the question first.

[Question accordingly proposed.]  Mr Chen, please continue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> The increase in health expenditure is

as  inevitable  as  the sun rises.  The major  part  of  this

expenditure  is  on manpower.  Doctors and nurses  and  other

operational  staff  have to be paid at  market  level  wages.

They have to compete with other demands for the scarce labour

resources.   With  our  extremely  tight  labour  market   in

Singapore,  we are not talking about single digit  increases.

The  days  of regular small increases are over.  We  have  to

consider not only salary increases but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



bonuses  as  well.  We can try reducing labour usage  through

higher productivity and mechanisation.  In healthcare,  there

is  a  limit  to  mechanisation,  as  healthcare  is  a  very

personalised affair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases in manpower expenditure will continue to drive

health  costs higher over the years.  Increases in  fees  and

charges will not be able to cope with these increasing  costs

which  would lead to more subsidies.  I would be grateful  if

the  Minister  can  give  us an idea  how  the  increases  in

manpower expenditure have impacted the budget, especially  in

terms  of  the  increases in subsidies, to  meet  the  rising

costs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> In the ensuing years,

Sir, we can expect increased demands on our healthcare system

as  a  result  of  higher needs of a fast ageing  population,

higher expectations of an increasing affluent population  and

higher usage of new medical advances.  The cost of healthcare

will  be  a  cause  for concern as we face the  challenge  to

ensure  the  affordable quality healthcare that  Singaporeans

have grown accustomed to.  Sir, planning and spending now  to

address  the  issue will save us millions of dollars  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has increased the FY2001 budget

allocation  for  the  Ministry of Health  by  31%.   This  is

heartening  and I would like to urge the Minister for  Health

to  spend not only on immediate healthcare needs but also  on

the  foundations that will take care of our future healthcare

concerns.   In  this respect, I have several observations  to

make as follows:

12.00 noon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Healthcare Expenditure, which formed about

3.1%  of GDP in 1999, amounted to $4.4 billion or $1,370  per

capita.  The public healthcare expenditure is 1.1% of GDP and

the  private healthcare expenditure is 2% of GDP or twice the

amount spent by the Government.  This contrasts significantly

with that in England where the private share is only 1/6,  in

Australia where the private share is only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



half,  and  in  Hong  Kong and Malaysia where  the  ratio  is

roughly one to one. Sir, the healthcare burden on the  people

is high in Singapore and we should try to lessen this burden.

The  Minister  may  like to consider having  more  healthcare

benefits for children.  Such a reduction of healthcare burden

on the people may induce more couples to have more children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we cannot arrest the rising medical demands and

the  increasing costs of healthcare, our challenge is to find

all  avenues  available  to lessen  the  need  for  expensive

medical  care.  It would appear that the basic tenets  for  a

good  and  affordable healthcare system seem to rest  upon  a

system that enables us to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. maintain our population as healthily and for as

long as possible;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. ensure the elderly population remains as

independently as possible;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. ensure the appropriate use of our medical care

without wastage; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. emphasise on self-help and that people are

responsible for their own health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must go beyond rendering remedy only when

sickness strikes.  We need preventive care.  It is crucial to

promote preventive care with more resources provided for  it.

The Community Health Screening programme, embarked by MOH for

citizens  above 50 years of age, is on the right track.   The

challenge  now is to facilitate those diagnosed with  any  of

the  chronic  diseases  to  go for long-term  follow  up  and

treatment.   Failure here would make the  whole  programme  a

waste of time, effort and money.  Perhaps, we should consider

subsidy,  either through MOH or CDC, to defray  some  of  the

costs for those who really cannot afford long-term treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had previously asked in this House that more help be

given to voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) so that  they

have  less fund-raising burdens.  Fund-raising can be a  very

tedious  task  indeed.   It  gets  harder  each  year,   with

increasing numbers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



of fund-raising events.  It detracts the VWOs from their good

work  in  caring  for  their charges.  I sincerely  hope  the

Minister  for Health will accede to my request to  give  them

more help.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, Dr Lily Neo has

already touched on our public expenditure on healthcare being

1.1% of GDP and that the private expenditure was 2%, giving a

total  of 3.2% in 1999.  This is indeed lower than what other

countries  had  spent  during  the  same  stage  of  economic

development as we are.  Yet the Minister has pointed  out  in

the  House, during the debate on the constitutional amendment

on NII, that if we measure the outcome of healthcare delivery

system,  in  fact, our healthcare delivery system ranks  very

high  against  the  various  international  benchmarks.    It

strikes  me  that  Singaporeans must  be  very  efficient  to

achieve  such  a  high  standard when we spend  comparatively

quite a little amount in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question is: what are we doing right that others

might  not be doing?  One possibility is that ours is a city-state   with   limited  geographic  areas,   and   thus   the

infrastructural  costs of the public health  delivery  system

must  be  low  compared to other countries with  large  rural

areas.  Another possibility is that perhaps our environmental

health  is  very good, thereby minimising the expenditure  on

actual   health   delivery.   But,   maybe,   another   third

possibility  could  be  that  we  might  be  underpaying  our

healthcare workers, such as nurses and doctors in the  public

health  delivery system, thereby leading to  low  morale  and

high  attrition.  There were reports indeed in the newspapers

several  months back that some of our doctors are  regretting

their career choice, for having chosen to become doctors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that in the FY2001 Budget, the operating

expenditure allocated for the Ministry of Health is going  to

$1.46  billion,  a whopping 34.5% increase  over  last  year.

This is, in fact, the highest increase in percentage terms of

all  Government  ministries, and I hope  that  part  of  this

increase would go towards

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



salary adjustment in the public health sector so that doctors

and  nurses could look forward to some recognition  of  their

contribution.   The  question I would like  to  pose  to  the

Minister is a simple one.  How did we spend so little and yet

achieve so much?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I want to bring a

practical  approach to this issue.  We have given the  people

the  assurance that healthcare is affordable to all.  We have

Medisave, MediShield and other insurance coverage to pay  for

health   bills.    Yet  we  get  the  common   refrain   that

Singaporeans cannot afford to fall ill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at some of the hospital bills and I am

convinced  that, as a Government, we have actually  done  our

best  for  those patients in C and B2, where the  subsidy  is

substantial.  Let me give you an example.  A two-day stay  at

NUH  for the investigation of a chest pain in a 6-bedded ward

costs  $1,272.   However,  after the  Government  subsidy  of

$1,026,  this patient paid only $244, which was paid  by  her

husband's  Medisave.  So in the end she did not have  to  pay

any  cash top-up.  Similarly, when she was admitted for a day

surgery  to do a coronary angiogram, she only paid  $5  cash.

Her husband's Medisave deduction was $519 although the actual

cost to Government was $1,890, a subsidy of $1,365.  In other

words, there is a substantial subsidy for C class patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we hear Singaporeans complaining of having to pay

huge hospital bills, including outpatient hospital bills.  It

could  be  that  such  patients do not have  enough  Medisave

savings,  or  they  do  not know the system  well  enough  to

maximise its full benefits.  And this is where I will try  to

give  some  advice  to  some of these patients,  and  I  will

explain  this  later.  The above patient is my taxi  driver's

wife  and  he knows the healthcare delivery system well  and,

thus,   avoided   the  many  pitfalls  that  many   unknowing

Singaporeans get into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two categories of patients seeking

hospital  treatment.   One,  the acute,  ie,  the  very  sick

patients,  and  the less acute, or the cold  cases.   In  the

acute cases, the patient goes to the A&E Unit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



His  frame  of  mind is one of anxiety and fear.   He  cannot

think  straight  and  he is eager to get  hospitalised.   His

relatives are equally worried and stressed, and this is where

his  choice of ward, which should be C or B2, is upgraded  to

B1  or even A class.  Children of the patient are prepared to

use  their  Medisave to help out and so, at that moment,  all

caution is thrown to the wind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission to B1 or A, without any subsidy, would be very

expensive.  Thus, instead of having to pay only $244 for a 2-day  stay,  like my taxi-driver friend's wife,  this  patient

would  have  to pay $1,272 for a similar 2-day stay.   In  an

acute case, it is quite understandable for someone to make  a

wrong choice of hospital wards, because the circumstances are

one  of  urgency.  Nevertheless, it could be avoided if  they

are  aware  of  the implications.  However, in a  cold  case,

going to get admitted to A or B1, when you cannot afford,  is

wrong and, in fact, stupid.  Ill advice by relatives, who are

not  paying  the bills, is quite common.  Some  children  put

their  parents  in  A  or B1 because  they  think  they  have

Medisave,  and  they  want to give the  best  care  to  their

parents.   This is very laudable.  Some do not want  to  lose

face  if  they  stay  in  C or B2, or  relatives  might  pass

comments.  The ones I dislike most are those giving the  most

expensive advice and they are not paying the bills.  Choosing

the wrong wards can be very costly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having opted for the expensive wards is not the end

of the story.  Many are not aware that this is not a one-time

cost.   A  subsequent  follow-up at the  specialist  clinics,

after  they get discharged, is also not subsidised, and  they

cannot  use  Medisave and this is where  those  on  long-term

follow-up, like those with hypertension, diabetes  and  heart

cases will continue to pay high specialist consultation  fees

and  high cost of surgical and medical procedures done at the

outpatient  level.   This policy of no downgrading  once  you

have  opted for the expensive wards, like A or B1, is closely

adhered to by most hospitals.  This is where I appeal to  the

Minister to consider

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



downgrading  those  who are retrenched, lost  a  job  through

stroke or accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know that this has been given, but of course more

can be done.  For example, many workers who opted for A or B1

class  while working, because of insurance coverage by  their

companies, lose this privilege when they retire.  This is one

group  of  workers  who should be allowed to  downgrade  upon

retirement.   My  advice  is:  Singaporeans  must  ask  about

costs.  Know the healthcare system well.  And, as doctors, it

is our responsibility to explain to patients the cost options

of  a  direct  referral to hospital specialists, or  indirect

referral  through  the outpatient clinics  to  hospitals.   A

direct referral by a general practitioner to any restructured

hospital  is  a  very  expensive way.  An  indirect  referral

through the polyclinic is the least expensive route.  At  the

hospital end, counter staff at A&E must pay special attention

to  explain  to  patients the difference in  pricing  of  the

various  hospital  wards  before  admission.   At  Government

level,  Singaporeans must be assured that C class  wards  are

given equally good medical care but without frills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one area which I would like to talk about - that is over-prescribing of drugs. Many a time, a patient

will  bring a plastic bag full of medicine from the hospital.

They  are  not  cheap drugs, most having to purchase  at  the

hospital  pharmacy, and the supply is usually a  month  to  3

months.  It costs hundreds of dollars at times, especially if

the  patient is multi-diseased, ie, they receive  drugs  from

the  cardiologist,  from the diabetic  specialist,  from  the

kidney  specialist.  The poor patient is  usually  so  groggy

after  the drugs he has to take and, sometimes, when I ask  a

patient whether he informed the various specialists about the

different  kinds  of  drugs he has to  take,  invariably  the

answer  by the respective specialists is, "You just  take  my

drugs."   If  there is a drug interaction, that can  be  very

serious.   Usually  such  patients,  unfortunately,  are  not

educated, and they have no ways and means to argue  with  the

doctor or to seek better advice from the doctor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most specialists or some specialists guard their turf

too closely and, at times,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



I am sure, inter-relationships between physicians break down,

at  the  expense of the patient.  My suggestion is  that  the

clinical pharmacists should alert the physicians if they come

across  such  cases,  so  that a more  rational  approach  to

management can be achieved.  Moreover, it is not wise to give

them  one to two or three months' supply.  I think we  should

start  off by just giving them two weeks of medicine to  find

out whether they do agree to the medicine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation, however, is sometimes complicated with

the  patient  seeing  doctors from two  different  hospitals.

And, now, with the two clusters, from two different hospitals

in  two  different clusters, this is where we  will  have  to

quickly rationalise how we are going to manage such patients.

My  suggestion  is  that there must be a transparent  medical

record  system to help overcome such problems so that medical

records  of those in one hospital can be passed on to another

doctor  of  a  different hospital in a different cluster  for

better patient care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, is that doctors are now practising

defensive medicine because of the fear of being sued ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Tan, you have used up your

time.  Mr Shanmugam is not here.  Mrs Lim.

<br>12.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, as my colleague,

Dr  Neo  has  mentioned, the Singapore population  has  grown

increasingly affluent and their medical needs have  risen  in

tandem.   Given our small size, and unlike elsewhere, medical

attention  is  always within easy reach and there  may  be  a

tendency to over-consume.  Yet, there is an expectation  that

medical  services must remain affordable.  I  would  like  to

raise  some  common  concerns and  perceptions  and  ask  the

Minister  to  clarify  the philosophy behind  each  of  these

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the role of restructured hospitals. Many

Singaporeans  feel that restructured hospital  services  must

remain affordable as they are, after all, owned by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



Government  as  they always have been.  Many  are  not  clear

about  the positioning of the restructured hospitals,  vis-a-vis  private hospitals.  In fact, some, especially the  older

persons, continue to view the difference as that between  the

polyclinic and the general practitioners or specialists.  The

confusion  could  have  stemmed  from  the  co-existence   of

subsidised services at restructured hospitals.  I would  like

to  ask  the Minister whether there is any merit to  creating

separate   identities  to  help  differentiate  the  services

although   operationally,  there  is  the  same   degree   of

integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, the financial model of a restructured

hospital can be a challenging one, in that there is the  risk

of  presenting  a  moral  dilemma for doctors.   Restructured

hospitals   presumably   require  all  employees,   including

doctors,  to  be  conscious of the bottom line.   Unless  the

subvention for subsidised patients were accounted  for  in  a

way  as  to  make  the difference between the  revenues  from

subsidised  and  private patients less  marked,  there  would

always  be  financial pressure to achieve  a  higher  mix  of

private  patients.   Could the Minister  please  clarify  the

philosophy behind the role of restructured hospitals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the choice of wards and services. Sir, like

Dr  Tan,  I  have encountered numerous cases where  residents

checked  their parents into a higher class ward only to  have

to  appeal  to the hospitals to have them downgraded  as  the

costs  turned out to be beyond their ability to  bear.   Most

requests  for  downgrading, as I understand, would  typically

fail.  On the flip side, there are also cases where admission

to  a higher class is sought in order to jump the queue, with

a subsequent request made to be downgraded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This downgrading phenomenon raises several issues.

Firstly,  many Singaporeans are guided by emotions when  they

are  confronted with an urgent decision on ward class, as  Dr

Tan  has elaborated on, for a loved one.  Not to opt for  the

best  class  for  an  elderly parent when there  are  several

children with Medisave funds appears to be a less-than-filial

act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as many do not use hospital services on a

regular  basis,  as  to  what a ward  class  entails  can  be

somewhat mysterious.  Many have equated a lower ward class to

poor or inferior care.  It would be good if the Minister  can

clarify  what the suite of services are for each  ward  class

and  what  the  differences are,  as  well  as  what  minimum

standards   would   be   maintained  regardless   of   class.

Furthermore,  like  Dr Tan, I would like  to  ask  that  some

counselling  be given to guide family members in  making  the

most appropriate and rational financial decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the degree of subsidy. Currently, the needy

are  being helped via the Medifund administration. The  lower

income  groups  have  of  late raised  concerns  about  their

ability  to afford healthcare service. This chorus is  likely

to  intensify  with  the ageing of the  population.  In  this

context,  I would like to ask the Minister whether  there  is

merit  to determining by way of, say, a means or income test,

the degree of subsidy at restructured hospitals.  Admittedly,

this  would be difficult to administer but it would hopefully

extend subsidised care equitably.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, in Singapore, we have

established a good healthcare financing system based  on  the

philosophy  of  individual responsibility, coupled  with  the

Government's  subsidies to keep basic  healthcare  affordable

for  all  people.   Through  the  years,  we  have  developed

Medisave, MediShield and Medifund that will ensure that every

Singaporean will have access to basic medical care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these systems still need to be fine-tuned and

reviewed from time to time.  I would like to inquire  whether

the  Ministry  of  Health  will be reviewing  its  policy  on

MediShield.  I have seen cases where people find it difficult

to claim for MediShield due to the stringent criteria set for

the claim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also review the deductibles. The present

policy  states  that MediShield will start  paying  when  the

total claimable medical expenses exceed the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deductibles. Deductibles are currently set at $500 and

$1,000 for patients in C and B wards respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic restructuring and the recent development

in medical science, it is timely for the Ministry to consider

reviewing  the  policy to make MediShield more responsive  to

the needs of our people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

patients  who  wish to  go to the specialist clinics  at  the

Government  hospitals  must  be referred  by  polyclinics  to

qualify  as  subsidised patients.  But referrals  by  private

doctors do not qualify the patients for subsidy.  So, if they

have  to  be admitted to the hospital, they would be sent  to

"B1" or "A" class  wards where the medical costs are higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health must have some reasons for doing

this. But, what are these reasons?  Does it mean that private

doctors  are  not  as good as Government doctors  in  judging

whether the patients need to consult specialist doctors?   If

the  principle for patient subsidy is based on the  patient's

financial needs, then how do you determine that all those who

go to polyclinics need the subsidy financially?  Furthermore,

at  the  polyclinic, the waiting time is normally very  long.

Do  the  patients  need to suffer the inconvenience  just  to

qualify  for Government's subsidy?  Can MOH consider allowing

patients referred by private doctors to qualify for admission

to the subsidised wards as well?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the Medical Endowment Fund set

up  by the Government would help older Singaporeans to defray

the  cost of medical treatment after the Government hospitals

were  restructured.  Yet, when we talk to the retirees,  many

of  them  are  fearful  of their ability  to  pay  for  their

treatment  and  this has been reflected by previous  speakers

before me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Tan pointed out, this could be an irrational fear.

It is possible that many of these retirees are unaware of the

existing  Medifund or whether they are eligible  for  such  a

subsidy.  In this year's Budget, FY2001, another $100 million

is added to the Medical Endowment Fund, bringing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



the  total to $800 million.  This is a laudable move  by  the

Government  and demonstrates this Government's care  for  the

elderly.   Yet,  Sir, at 4% interest, the  Fund  yielded  $28

million  last  year and would yield another $32 million  this

year,  a  mere $4 million increase this year over last  year.

To  meet  the needs of the elderly in Singapore,  $4  million

increase per year seems a pretty meagre sum to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several questions for the Minister. Firstly, for

the   years  since  the  Medical  Endowment  Fund  has   been

established, what has been the utilisation rate of  Medifund?

Secondly,  whether MOH has a programme to publicise  Medifund

and help people understand how they could qualify for such  a

fund.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, casemix was

born  out of a desire to increase hospital efficiency through

appropriate  funding and also as a tool for cost  containment

which was the Government's major concern in the context of  a

rapidly aging society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix is here to stay. However, we must be aware of

the  weaknesses and be cautious of extending it  to  Medisave

based  claims.   I have spoken to many in the profession  and

these are some of the expressed concerns on casemix.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in increasing the efficiency of hospitals, we

must  be  mindful  that, given our standard  and  quality  of

healthcare,  our GDP spending must be one of the  lowest,  if

not  the  lowest  in  the  world, for  comparable  healthcare

services. Even though casemix is overall subvention  neutral,

it  will  increase  the  impetus  for  doctors  to  discharge

patients  earlier as hospitals will be penalised if  patients

stay  longer than the so-called "appropriate length of stay".

I  remember that in all my years of service in a restructured

hospital, we often had to do an extra discharge round on  top

of  the routine ward to discharge even more patients so  that

we  can create more bed space.  If we push the limits further

by  putting pressure to further limit the hospital stay,  the

losers are the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix puts pressure on hospitals to reduce high

outliers, that is, those patients

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



who  have  exceeded  the  perceived  cut-off  point  for   an

appropriate length of stay.  The reality of medicine is  that

you   are  dealing  with  human  beings  who  are  not   only

biologically different, but also socially different.  In  the

National  Heart  Centre, the percentage of  cases  with  high

outliers  was  as  high  as  20% and  the  second  and  third

commonest DRG had 12% and 13% of outliers respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix has also created new concerns by itself. It has

created a new clinical coding profession and this itself  has

produced   new  problems  by  increasing  cost   through   an

additional layer of administration and by a shortfall of well-trained  and  experienced coders.  A shortfall of  experience

and  trained  coders  can affect data  collection  and  hence

interpretation of the casemix data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A central tenet used in our casemix model is flawed.

The  definition  of principal diagnosis (PD) currently  being

used is that of the Australian definition where the principal

diagnosis is a diagnosis of condition established after study

to  be  chiefly  responsible for the patient's  admission  to

hospital.  Feedback received from hospitals suggest that  the

present  definition of PD may not be fair and equitable.  The

Casemix  Project Office (CPO) has rejected the definition  of

PD  as a diagnosis that requires the most resources, although

they  stated that it was logical as actual costing  would  be

required  to determine each individual condition  to  compare

them  with.   They  considered it too costly  and  too  time-consuming.  This would involve getting real cost data and not

just  historical data.  It will be time-consuming to get true

cost  data  and  this will require more years  than  a  short

period we are taking to implement this.  The Australian  took

years  to  implement the system but yet we want to do  it  in

such  a  short time.  Are we ready or are we using historical

data   rather   than  true  cost  data  because   there   are

implementation  timelines to meet?  How then  can  equity  of

subventions be addressed with a flawed definition?   The  CPO

tries  to  justify this by saying that the level of resources

for patients is not kept to each individual patient, that is,

no specific cap

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



at  the  individual level.  No patient should be denied  care

because they cost more than the average patient.  What really

matters  is  that  hospitals are  adequately  subvented.   In

theory,  this sounds statistically acceptable.   In  reality,

there will be pressure on everyone to reduce outliers as this

is  the  purpose  of casemix, which brings  me  to  the  next

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are saying that the level of resources is not

capped to each individual patient, how then can one justify a

Medisave based system, since Medisave is personal to each and

every patient?  The CPO has visited private hospitals and has

made  no  bones that they would implement a balanced  billing

Medisave based casemix system.  There are real concerns about

a  balanced billing system in the private sector.   How  does

balanced  billing cater for new treatments as there  will  be

significant time lag for administrative changes? Would  there

be  sufficient  flexibility in the proposed system  to  allow

rapid  adaptation  to increasing costs due to  new  effective

treatments  which  are  necessary to maintain  a  world-class

medical  support  system?  How do we solve  the  problems  of

outliers  in  a balanced billing system for patients  in  the

private  sector when the percentage of outliers  is  even  as

high  as 20% in the restructured hospitals?  Casemix may work

to some extent in the public sector because it is possible to

average  out the cost of large numbers of patients.  Outliers

are,  therefore,  compensated on a statistical  basis.   This

does not work out in the private sector where each individual

specialist  has a few patients of a particular  DRG  and  the

number is not anywhere large enough for statistical averaging

to be meaningful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix does not recognise the difference between public

and  private  medical treatment.  The quality of personalised

care  with  time taken, conducted exclusively by consultants,

is  also  not  acknowledged.  In the  private  sector,  where

hospitals' and doctors' bills are separate, how would casemix

be able to apportion the fees in a fair and equitable manner?

Many issues remain unresolved.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would end by sharing with the Minister the sentiments

expressed  by a prominent doctor after a recent meeting  with

the  CPO team. He said, "The dialogue was a farce.  The  team

took  the  view  that casemix in private is a  fact  of  life

already  and they are only looking to see how to tweak  it  a

little  bit based on feedback.  This is a mockery of the  S21

process  and openness of Government.  In this case,  even  if

very  fundamental  flaws cannot be solved,  casemix  will  be

rammed  through regardless of consequences."  Unlike  him,  I

have  better  faith in the Government and the Ministry.   The

Minister  has always been extremely thorough and has  a  good

grasp of issues.  I am not looking for answers today as these

are  complex issues, but rather to place these real  concerns

across.   Casemix  is here to stay but let us  resolve  these

issues  so  that we can have a good system and not  a  flawed

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, I want

to  thank  the  Members for raising the issue  of  healthcare

costs and the affordability for Singaporeans.  This gives  me

the  opportunity to reassure Members that the  Government  is

indeed  committed  to  providing good  and  affordable  basic

medical  services  to all Singaporeans.  This  commitment  is

clearly set out in the 1993 White Paper on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



Affordable Health Care and we intend to meet this commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must say that I am very happy with my

Ministry's budget this year.  It has been increased  by  30%.

Mr Bernard Chen has asked how we intend to use the additional

funds.   We  will put the additional money to good  use.   We

will  increase  the  budget of our two  healthcare  clusters.

Specifically, we will increase the budget of the primary care

sector  by  28%,  the acute medical sector  by  14%  and  the

psychiatric  medical  sector by 26%.  The  additional  budget

will  be used to offset increases in manpower cost.  I  think

several  Members raised the importance of paying our  medical

staff  appropriately according to market  rates.   The  money

will  also be used to strengthen quality assurance programmes

and to also implement new initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also increase the budget for health

promotion  activities by a very significant 68%.   The  funds

will  be  used  to  strengthen preventive healthcare,  health

promotion  and  public  education, to prevent  the  onset  of

chronic  diseases.  This is what Dr Lily Neo  said,  "setting

the foundation to keep future healthcare cost down."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will also set aside $75 million for

specific  national  programmes, such as the  health  services

development   programme,  setting  up  the  various   disease

registries  and  so  on.   Funds  will  also  be  set   aside

specifically   to   train  our  medical  undergraduates   and

specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to healthcare expenditure. Dr Lily Neo

and  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen have commented about our low level  of

national healthcare expenditure (NHE), which is about  3%-odd

of  our GDP compared to other major developed countries which

can  range  from about 7% in UK to 14% in the US.    Dr  Wang

asked specifically how we can spend so little and yet achieve

so  much.  I must first say that we cannot claim full  credit

for  this  performance.   There are several  factors  in  our

favour,  some of which have been pointed out by Dr Wang.   We

are  an  urbanised  society, compared to many  big  countries

which have a rural sector, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



will  cost quite a lot more to service.  We have, right  from

the  onset, laid a very good foundation in very stringent and

good environmental health, and that has, of course, given  us

a  good  starting point, and public healthcare  is  therefore

lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, another key factor is that we have a

relatively  young  population,  compared  to  many  of  these

developed countries.  Our aged population, those aged 65  and

above,  constitutes  about  7%.  In  many  of  the  developed

countries,  it is closer to 10-12%.  We have a  much  younger

population.  So we can expect that when our population  ages,

the     national    health    expenditure    will    increase

correspondingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is our strong economic growth in the last

20  years, which averaged about 8% per annum, compared to our

population growth of less than 2% per annum.  In this way, we

could  enjoy significant improvements in our healthcare every

year  without the percentage share of GDP going  up  by  very

much.   But  as we move forward, as our economy  matures  and

growth  slows down, we can therefore expect  the  NHE,  as  a

percentage of GDP, to correspondingly increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important reason is our prudent policies in

the provision and financing of healthcare.  This has played a

significant role in containing healthcare cost increases.  If

we  lose  this discipline, we can expect healthcare  cost  to

soar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, I can say that our national healthcare

cost  is  low and indeed we should be happy that our national

healthcare  cost  is low, because this correspondingly  means

that  the  average Singaporean household needs  to  pay  only

about  3%  of their household expenditure, or about  $93  per

month, on healthcare services.  Based on an average household

size of 4.2, each household member therefore spends about $22

per  month  on healthcare.  To put this in perspective,  this

amount  is  less  than the average amount  that  the  average

Singaporean  spends  on  recreation and  entertainment.   So,

because  our national healthcare cost is low, the  burden  on

individual household is also low.  Of course, this is looking

at the macro

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



level.  When we look at the individual level, we have to make

sure  that  our  medical financing framework caters  for  the

family  who  has to pay a high bill because of  a  particular

episode.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members agree that we should not look at how

much  we  spend to evaluate our healthcare system.   When  we

evaluate  whether  a national healthcare  system  serves  its

citizens well, we should not look at the inputs but we should

look at what we achieve.   I think there are many parameters,

which I will not go through in detail. I would just say  that

these   parameters   are  adopted   by   the   World   Health

Organisation.  They did an assessment of all the countries in

the  world.   Among 191 countries, they came to a  conclusion

that  our  healthcare system is ranked 6th  in  overall  cost

effectiveness.   That means they looked at  our  output,  the

clinical  outcomes of service, our waiting  times,  sense  of

equity,  sense of accessibility.  They looked  at  all  these

factors and looked at our inputs, and they ranked us 6th.  So

I think we have done well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key macro parameter which Dr Lily Neo and Dr

Wang  pointed  out  is  the  public  share  of  the  national

healthcare expenditure.  They observed that the public  share

is  about  a  third, compared to other countries  which  will

range from probably half for the average to maybe 70-80%  for

countries  which  adopt  a national  health  system  kind  of

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look at the healthcare systems around the

world,  we probably can put them in a spectrum.  On  the  one

hand,  we  have  a  very equitable, open  to  all,  everybody

enjoying the same type of service, epitomised by the National

Health  Service of the UK.  On the other end of the spectrum,

you  probably look at the voluntary health insurance  system,

as practised in the US, and somewhere in between, most of the

other  systems will fall in.  Most of the developed  European

countries  will be closer to the British end of the spectrum.

Because of that approach, the share of the public sector will

be higher.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the public sector share is one third.

This  is  because  of  the  way we  organise  the  healthcare

financing.   We  ask  every Singaporean  to  pay  into  their

Medisave and then they pay the bills from their Medisave.  If

you  can  imagine that instead of contributing  6%  into  the

Medisave account we ask them to pay 3% of their salaries into

a  national insurance system,  as a medical payroll tax,  and

that  is then used to fund the system, you will see the share

of  the  public sector going up.  So I do not think we should

read  too  much into this sharing of the national  healthcare

expenditure between the public sector and the private sector.

It  is how you organise the medical financing framework.   It

is more important to look at the output.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I said about our low national

healthcare expenditure, I do not think we are complacent.  We

know that the pressure on healthcare cost is relentless,  and

many  Members  have  spoken  about  this.   The  increase  in

healthcare cost is a world-wide phenomenon.  Singapore cannot

be  insulated  from  the trends and developments  around  the

world.  Medical technology continues to advance and we expect

new  developments in diagnostics, biomedical devices and drug

development.  In the US, for example, drug prices have  risen

by  as  much as 15% a year.  Also, as our standard of  living

improves, Singaporeans will have higher expectations.  Demand

for  healthcare services will correspondingly  increase.   In

particular,  we are undergoing a major structural  change  in

our  demography.   So  we  are under tremendous  pressure  on

healthcare  cost.  The challenge for us is  how  do  we  keep

abreast of this challenge so that to the average Singaporean,

healthcare continues to remain affordable.  Mr Bernard Chen's

comments  on health cost is spot-on, 60% of our  cost  is  in

manpower,  15%  of  our  cost is  in  medical  supplies,  the

majority  of  which  is  imported and therefore  out  of  our

control.  So the cost pressure is there.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so far, we have done reasonably well. We have been

able to contain the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



increase in healthcare cost to within the range of 6%  to  8%

per year.  Looking forward, we cannot keep still.  We have to

adjust  and  refine our financing framework so  that  we  can

continue  to  enjoy sensible improvements in  our  healthcare

service,   while   still  keeping  it   affordable   to   all

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the whole framework of financing - we

call   this  the  3M  framework  (Medisave,  MediShield   and

Medifund) - and how the 3M framework has allowed Singaporeans

to be able to pay for their medical bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Medisave. I agree with Members that there is a

general  perception  that  the  use  of  Medisave  is  rather

restrictive.   There are many suggestions to extend  Medisave

to  outpatient  treatments.  While  the  original  intent  of

Medisave  is  to  help Singaporeans cope with hospitalisation

expenses,  we all agree that the trend is towards  ambulatory

care.   Medisave is already allowed for day surgery and  over

time,  we  will extend Medisave to more outpatient treatments

where  appropriate.  However, I must say that we must proceed

cautiously  because an overly liberal use of  Medisave  would

necessitate higher monthly contribution rates.  So we need to

strike a balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will be making adjustments to the Medisave

withdrawal limits so that most Class B2 and C patients  would

be  able to pay their hospitalisation bills through Medisave.

We  will  also  increase the Medisave withdrawal  limits  for

certain  expensive outpatient treatment, such as chemotherapy

and renal dialysis, to help alleviate the financial burden on

Singaporeans.  Details of these adjustments will be announced

soon.  But I would just want to dampen expectations.  We know

we  need  to  make  the  change, but we  will  have  to  move

cautiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MediShield. My Ministry is also looking at

relying  more  on  medical insurance  to  complement  medical

savings  to  improve  the efficiency of  the  entire  patient

finance  structure.  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has  pointed  out  the

problem  of  low  payouts  of  MediShield.   My  Ministry  is

currently reviewing MediShield with a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



view  towards  enhancing  its  features,  in  particular  the

claimable  amounts.  We are also looking at the  deductibles.

This is to ensure that MediShield is able to provide adequate

protection  to the elderly and other Singaporeans  who  incur

high  medical bill sizes.  Again, we need to strike a balance

between  enhancing the features of MediShield whilst  at  the

same  time  keeping  MediShield premiums  affordable  to  all

Singaporeans, especially the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third "M" in our 3M structure is Medifund. Dr Wang

Kai  Yuen  asked  about the utilisation of Medifund  interest

income.   The average utilisation is about 77%, and  this  is

despite  the approval rate for Medifund which is consistently

being  above 97%.  97% of applications that come  to  us  are

routinely  approved, and even then we only  use  77%  of  the

funds  available.   So  I want to assure  Members  here  that

Medifund is more than adequate to meet the needs of the  low-income  Singaporeans.  In fact, it is a very effective safety

net.   As  we  all  know, Dr Richard Hu  announced  that  the

Government  will  inject  a further  $100  million  into  the

capital  sum  of  Medifund, bringing it to a  total  of  $800

million.   I  agree  that  we should  publicise  the  use  of

Medifund  more deliberately so that people who face financial

difficulties will seek recourse to Medifund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that we have medical social

workers  in  all  our hospitals.  Whenever they  come  across

cases  of patients facing financial problems, they will  take

up  the  cases  and  apply  for Medifund  on  behalf  of  the

patients.   I  do  not think we will find  very  many  people

falling through the Medifund safety net.  As I have said many

times  here in this House, if any Member comes across genuine

deserving  cases that require Medifund assistance, feel  free

to  write to either my Parliamentary Secretary or myself, and

we  will  take up the cases.  But from my experience  in  the

last  years, the Ministry has shown that the Medifund  safety

net is a very effective safety net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the 3M framework has served us well. I

think what we need are refinements and adjustments.  What  is

our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



target?  Our target is that all Singaporeans who make regular

contributions  to  their  Medisave and  who  are  covered  by

MediShield would not need to pay out of pocket, if they  stay

in  a B2 or C ward.  If their Medisave accounts run out, they

can  apply to Medifund to help pay for their bills.  So  that

is our target, and by and large we have achieved that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must caution that Singaporeans who choose to go

for  higher  ward  classes  or who  wish  to  go  to  private

hospitals  would  have to pay out of  their  pocket.   It  is

therefore    important   that   Singaporeans   who    require

hospitalisation choose their ward class prudently.   This  is

why  financial counselling is a mandatory requirement in  all

hospitals, both in the public and private hospitals.  This is

a  requirement  before they are allowed to use  Medisave  for

their patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua when she spoke about the

importance  of  financial  counselling  which  would   enable

patients   to   have  a  better  estimate  of  the   expected

hospitalisation charges so that they can choose the  type  of

ward  class according to their means.  I think Dr  Tan  Cheng

Bock also made several very timely and wise remarks about the

role  that doctors play in helping to keep health cost  down.

I think it is worth reiteration, and these remarks would have

to be more widely transmitted to the professional community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture try and respond to some of the

other points raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.  We have some rules

in the way the subsidies are given.  If a patient opts for  a

B1  or  A class ward, he or she can ask for a downgrade,  and

most  times this would be acceded.  The only exception is  if

you  go  to  a  private hospital and then later you  want  to

transfer  to  a  public  hospital, we will  insist  that  you

transfer to a B1, that means, a non-subsidised ward.  But  if

you  are within the public hospital system, if you ask for  a

downgrade, this would be considered with one condition  -  we

will ask that you go for means testing.  So if you enter the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



health system and at the point of entry you choose B2  or  C,

no  questions are asked, we would let you have the subsidies.

But  if you opt to be non-subsidised and later on you ask  to

be subsidised, then we insist that you go for a means test so

that  we know that the subsidy is correctly targeted  at  the

low  income  families.  So that is the  only  rule.   If  you

cannot afford to pay the fees, you can ask the medical social

workers  in the hospitals and they will undertake  to  review

your  case.  And the hospitals have some means to  waive  the

fees, if the case is genuine, or to seek Medifund assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also asked that we prescribe shorter duration for

drugs  rather than giving out one to two months'  supply.   I

think we would have to depend on the doctors to exercise  the

judgement.  In some cases, it is more sensible to give one to

two  months' supply so as to make it more convenient, and the

patients do not have to come back so often.  At other  times,

it  may be sensible, as he suggests, to just give one or  two

weeks' supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this whole issue of Government subsidies, again,

let  me  stress  that  the Government basically  assures  all

Singaporeans  that they will have access to affordable  basic

healthcare.   The  same package of basic medical  service  is

available  to all classes of wards.  The key differences  are

that  in  the  unsubsidised wards, you enjoy the ambience  of

fewer  patients  to  a  room  and  you  can  name  your   own

consultants.  But other than that, between a B2 and a A ward,

the Government will extend the same basic level of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members also remarked about the high level of

subventions to the hospitals.  As you well know, the  highest

share  of  medical  expenses  occurs  in  our  hospitals  and

therefore  this results in a higher proportion of subvention.

Government  subvention  to the restructured  polyclinics  and

hospitals  has therefore increased significantly every  year.

In FY1999, it was $580 million.  In FY2000, it was revised to

$700 million and this year, we will increase it to just about

$1 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government is prepared to increase the

subventions, we must make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



sure  that we target the subventions appropriately.  I  agree

with  both  Mr  Low  Thia Khiang and Mrs Lim  Hwee  Hua  that

subsidies should be directed at those who are most deserving.

The  most  direct way to channel the subsidies to the  lower-income  group,  which may eventually be necessary,  would  be

through some form of means testing.  However, as pointed  out

in  the  1993  White  Paper on Affordable  Healthcare,  means

testing  is  an administratively clumsy procedure  which  the

public will take some time to get used to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current rules allow you to enjoy subsidies if you go

through  the polyclinic system and then you go to the  public

hospitals.   We  keep  these rules.  But  if  you  enter  the

hospital  through the private GP, at the point of entry  into

the hospital, whether or not you are in the A&E ward, you can

choose the ward that you want to go to, whether it is  B2  or

C.   If you choose B2 or C, then obviously you will enjoy the

65%  subsidy  and  80% subsidy accordingly.   The  choice  is

available  at the point when you are admitted.   If  you  are

referred to the Specialists' Outpatient Clinic by the private

sector GP, then as a starting point, we will treat you  as  a

private  patient.   If you are referred to  the  Specialists'

Outpatient Clinic by the polyclinic, we will treat you  as  a

subsidised patient.  But if you cannot afford to pay the fees

in  the  Specialists' Outpatient Clinic, you can  ask  to  be

reclassified and we will require you to be means tested.   So

it is a win-win situation for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody who wants to enjoy subsidised healthcare can go

to  a polyclinic and then go to the SOC, and no questions are

asked,  we would not require you to be means tested, and  you

can  enjoy  subsidised  fees.  But if you  enter  the  public

healthcare  system through the private GP and you think  that

you deserve subsidised healthcare because you are from a low-income  family, then you ask to be means tested.  And if  you

do  qualify, then you will enjoy the subsidy.  So that  is  a

fair system.  It may not be completely effective, because  as

Mr  Low Thia Khiang suggested, you will allow rich people  to

enjoy subsidies by going through the polyclinic system.  So I

hope Mr Low Thia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



Khiang will continue to plug the line and when the population

is  ready to accept means testing, we will use means  testing

in a wider way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim raised some concerns about casemix. I do

not  want  to go through the details because this is  a  very

specific issue.  All I want to say is that we would take  his

comments  and review them.  I want to assure the  House  that

casemix is intended to be a more effective and efficient  way

to  allocate resources.  It is not intended to cause  doctors

to  discharge  patients earlier.  The  casemix  provides  for

outlier  cases, as Dr Michael Lim raised, that  means  people

who  need to stay longer than what is provided for in casemix

subvention.  We allow the outliers to continue to stay in the

hospitals  if the doctors deem it necessary and we will  then

subsidise  those  outlier patients on a per  day  basis.   So

there  is  no change in the way we continue to subvent  these

patients.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members that casemix will not result in

doctors  coming  under pressure to discharge  their  patients

prematurely.  Casemix is still in its initial phase.  We need

to  build up confidence and I am sure people would have  more

confidence in the system as we implement it.  As we  get  the

costing data sorted out, people will feel that the costing is

more  reflective  of the real cost, and the  system  is  more

equitable.  So we are not rushing the system.  We are  making

sure  that the system is well implemented, the cost  data  is

well  researched.  So far, of course, we have seen  that  our

local cost data, when we compare it with the Australian  cost

data,  is very close.  So there is no reason to believe  that

we are costing our system wrongly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have an ongoing process where we review the

costing methodology with the hospitals.  We will look at  the

subvention rates every year to take into account the changing

pattern  of resource utilisation.  So I just want  to  assure

Members here that, before casemix is fully enforced, we  have

the safeguards in place

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



and we will make sure that it will be implemented properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua raised some very fundamental questions

about  the role and philosophy of our restructured hospitals.

Let  me just say that we cannot just deal with the increasing

healthcare   costs  by  simply  increasing   the   Government

subventions  every year.  If we have to, I am  confident  the

Minister for Finance would provide the additional budget,  as

he  has  done this year with his 30% increase.  But,  at  the

same time, for all of us in the healthcare sector, we have to

continue  to  be  more  efficient, more productive  and  more

responsive to the patient's needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key strategy in containing healthcare costs and yet

providing  quality healthcare has been the  restructuring  of

the  private  healthcare  delivery system.   Since  the  late

1980s, we have been restructuring our public hospitals one at

a  time,  starting with the Singapore General  Hospital.   By

October  last  year,  we  have  successfully  completed   the

restructuring exercise, with the restructuring  of  Alexandra

Hospital, Woodbridge Hospital and the polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that some Singaporeans are concerned that

restructuring  of  public  sector hospitals  and  polyclinics

could  lead  to  higher  charges  because  they  are  private

companies  out  to make a profit.  I would like  to  reaffirm

that making profits has never been the main objective of  our

restructuring  exercise.  We restructure so that  we  can  be

more efficient, more productive and more responsive.  In this

way,  we  bring the costs down and offer a better service  to

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make our position on this explicit.

SingHealth and NHG would therefore be repositioned as not-for-profit  entities.   As  not-for-profit entities,  their  main

objective is not to maximise profits, neither are they  under

pressure   to  pay  dividends  to  their  shareholders.    To

underscore  this  "not-for-profit status", the  Minister  for

Finance  has  agreed to exempt the two clusters  from  paying

corporate tax.  Instead, the tax savings and any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



surpluses  generated  as a result of their  efficiency  gains

will  be  ploughed  back for medical research,  training  and

patient care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the concept of not-for-profit is relatively new in

Singapore, it is well established in the US. In the US,  some

of  the  very  well-known medical centres, such as  the  Mayo

Clinic Foundation in Minnesota and Johns Hopkins Medicine  in

Maryland  are  operated as not-for-profit organisations.   By

modelling  themselves  as not-for-profit  organisations,  our

restructured  hospitals will have a different  organisational

culture   from   the  private  hospitals.   Our  restructured

hospitals  will  continue to preserve their sense  of  public

service.   Let me clarify that not-for-profit does  not  mean

that  our  restructured hospitals do not have to worry  about

costs.   The not-for-profit organisation must still  exercise

financial  prudence, cost their services accurately,  control

their costs and improve productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the difference, you may ask? For the private

patients in Class A wards, they will continue to pay for  the

full  costs  for the healthcare services they  receive.   The

difference is that the profit is not taxed and the profit  is

not   meant  for  disbursement  to  the  shareholders.    For

subsidised  patients,  they will continue  to  enjoy  a  high

quality  of  medical care that is heavily subsidised  by  the

Government.   The  difference is that the hospitals  will  be

more efficient and more service-oriented than if it is run as

a Government department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the staff, they will continue to be part of a

dynamic medical institution with high standards and a  strong

reputation.   The  difference is that any surplus  they  make

will  be  channelled back for medical research, training  and

patient  care,  ultimately, for the benefit of  the  patients

they   serve.    This   would  therefore  differentiate   our

restructured  hospitals from the other private hospitals  and

Singaporeans  will  continue  to  enjoy  a  good   affordable

healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I would say that the 3M structure has

given Singaporeans a good affordable healthcare.  We need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



continue  to  make  improvements  primarily  to  extend   the

Medisave  withdrawal limits so that Singaporeans do not  have

to  pay out-of-pocket expenses.  We need to extend MediShield

and medical insurance so that the risk is better pooled among

the population.  And we need to implement casemix sensibly so

that we can achieve better allocation of our resources.   And

by   repositioning   our  two  clusters   as   not-for-profit

organisations, we want to reaffirm the importance  of  public

service  in  the organisational structure of our restructured

hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in the debate.  Sir, like the demographic

changes  to Singapore, some of us here are elderly, including

myself.   Others  are going to be elderly and  some,  in  due

course, will become one.  So there is no escape from this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that the Minister in fact is going to

reposition  the hospitals to be not-for-profit organisations.

This  is  indeed enlightening.  And I hope that the hospitals

will  be more patient-centred and be able to render more help

and more support for the growing elderly population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, healthcare cost for the elderly is and will be an

increasing  burden  to families.  All families  with  elderly

members  are likely to be affected, most of all,  those  with

elderly    who   are   chronically   ill.    Sir,   prolonged

hospitalisation of these elderly is costly.  And as you know,

they  are  likely to remain in hospital for a long  time  and

there  will  be  difficulties  to  discharge  them.   It   is

obviously not a cost effective solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, admission to private nursing home is also not

affordable, particularly to the lower middle income  families

because  they do not have the funding to be able  to  do  so.

Many  do  not  qualify to get into the nursing homes  run  by

voluntary welfare organisations.  Care in community hospitals

is equally costly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are indeed a few issues for healthcare of the

elderly that we need to urgently review.  First, the referral

system by general medical practitioners.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical care of the frail and the elderly, we need to relook

at  the issue because many frail elderly are unable to get to

the  polyclinic.   As  they  are quite  familiar  with  their

general  practitioner, therefore, their first line of defence

is  to  go  to see their private medical practitioners.   And

referrals  of these to specialist care and others  land  them

with  having  to be in B1 class ward or A class  ward.   This

costs quite a lot for many of them, particularly, those  with

chronic ill health conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the adequacy of step-down healthcare

provisions.  I would like to find out what active  plans  are

going  to be implemented to help the chronically ill  elderly

as  quickly as possible.  The third area is the more flexible

usage  of Medisave funds, particularly for those with chronic

illness because it is going to be a long-term healthcare cost

for them.  There is a need to review this as that would in  a

way reduce the burden for healthcare cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there is a need to revise the current

income criterion of $2,000 and below for subsidy because many

families  are  within this sandwiched group.   Therefore,  it

becomes  quite  difficult  for these  families  to  meet  the

healthcare cost if any of its members are chronically ill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Although the Minister

has given the assurance that everyone in Singapore can afford

the  medical charges, I feel that I still need to reflect  to

him  the worries of the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That medical fees are expensive is a fact. That is

because of the high treatment costs.  Nowadays, many  of  the

elderly patients prefer to see the specialists, such  as  the

cardiologist,  the neurologist, the dental  specialist,  etc,

instead  of the general practitioners.  Of course,  the  fees

charged by the specialists  are higher than those charged  by

the general practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are other reasons why people are worried

about the high medical expenses.  First, because they are not

fully  aware of the 3M healthcare framework that incorporates

the  characteristics of  personal saving,  medical  insurance

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



Government  assistance,  as  mentioned  by  the  Minister   - Medisave,  MediShield and Medifund.  The majority  of  people

know  only  Medisave.  In fact, until today, many people  are

not  aware  of the existence of Medifund.  They thought  that

once  they are hospitalised and if they cannot pay  the  high

medical bills, that will be the end of the road for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many people are still not fully aware of the

differences  between  the  subsidised  wards  and  the   non-subsidised wards.  They only know that the higher  wards  are

more  expensive.  It is only when they receive the bills that

they have a shock of their life, "Wow, so expensive!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are real cases where people could not

afford  the medical bills.  But there has not been a case  of

anyone  being  driven to the wall.  In my constituency,  from

1997  to  2000, there was a total of 54 people who could  not

afford  the  medical  bills, and  received  assistance.   The

amount owing totalled about $200,000.  Medifund paid for  the

$200,000 medical bills.  There was one patient whose  medical

bill  was  more than $10,000 per year.  Over four years,  his

hospital  bills from Tan Tock Seng Hospital totalled $52,000.

He  had no money to pay any of these bills.  All these  bills

were settled by Medifund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say, "You can die, but you cannot be sick.". As

a  Member  of  the  GPC for Health, I would  say  this  is  a

ridiculous  statement.  I would not say that our   healthcare

system  is  perfect.  In fact, I think the greatest challenge

for  the Ministry of Health is how to eliminate the worry  of

the  elderly  people  on this problem of  escalating  medical

fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should have some system in place to enlighten

the  elderly people of all the types of assistance available.

We  should  let these people know more about our Government's

3M  healthcare framework.  For those who do not have Medisave

or  have  no  income, particularly the older Singaporeans,  I

think we should give them more care and more concessions.  In

fact, most of the older

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans have no Medisave and not much income.  We should

give  them more practical assistance.  For those who have  no

income,  I  think  we should give them better  discounts  and

perhaps  we  should  consider raising  the  age  ceiling  for

MediShield coverage in line with our aging population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the downgrading of the wards, we should be

more  flexible.  Some people who opted for the  higher  class

wards  may not know that at the end of their stay,  the  bill

would  be  an  astronomical figure.  Therefore, I  think,  we

should  have  more  counselling to the  patients  upon  their

admission, so that they know what to expect and how much they

would have to pay for their hospitalisation charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should also check to see whether there is

any  way we could help them to settle this problem.   At  the

point of admission, the patient could  afford to stay in  the

ward  class of his choice, but something has happened in  the

meantime,  resulting  in  his  inability  to  pay  the  bills

subsequently.  For example, if he suddenly becomes unemployed

or   his   income   is   substantially   reduced.   In   such

circumstances,  the  hospital  should  be  more  flexible  in

dealing with his application for downgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a case where a patient was a former nurse.

About  10  years  ago, she had some heart problem.   At  that

time, she had an income and because of special treatment as a

hospital staff, she was admitted to class A ward.  Some years

later, she stopped work and hence had  no income.  She  asked

the  hospital for downgrading to a lower ward, but it was not

approved.   So  every time when she went back for  treatment,

she had to pay class A charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister said perhaps we could have a means

test   to   see  whether  this  patient  could  qualify   for

downgrading.  I think we should make known to the public  the

details of this means test.  Perhaps the Minister could  give

us more details as to how the Government is going to meet the

needs  of  the elderly people in Singapore, whether there  is

some master

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



plan to help these elderly to pay for their medical expenses.

I  think this will help to alleviate their worries about  the

escalating medical expenses.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, there is little doubt that one of the

biggest  challenges  for the Ministry of  Health  now  is  to

ensure that healthcare for the elderly will be efficient  and

affordable  in  the years ahead.  We should be  proactive  in

planning  and  we  must  start  laying  the  foundations  for

eldercare with urgency to ensure success in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a favourable outcome in this aspect will make the

inevitable escalation of healthcare costs a lesser burden for

the  people  and the Government.  It will also  make  life  a

happier  and  healthier one for our elderly  population.   We

must  be especially painstaking at putting in place a  scheme

to  cope  with the very old, those aged 75 and above.   There

will  be an almost three-fold increase of this group that  is

most  likely to depend heavily on our healthcare  and  social

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A one-stop diagnosis and care-plan centre is essential.

At this centre, a standardised and holistic assessment can be

done  according to the patient's needs.  Having  the  correct

diagnosis  and the choicest management for each illness  will

not  only result in a better outcome but also save us  money.

Referral  to the correct doctor and discipline for  treatment

are  essential for a reduction in hospital admissions.  There

must be help to promote independence by supporting people  to

achieve  their  best  potential and strengthen  families  and

communities    by    supporting    family    and    community

responsibility.   To do this, we have to start  training  for

more   medical   personnel.   They   include   geriatricians,

physiotherapists, community nurses and home-care  nurses  and

care-givers.  New courses need to be conducted to  teach  the

various  types  of care, especially community healthcare.   I

feel  MOH  should not hesitate in organising a team  to  look

into establishing such a centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for MOH on the care of the elderly will be

in assisting them to live

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



as  independently and for as long as possible  in  their  own

homes, with appropriate support.  Sir, the aim is to maximise

independent  living and social functioning, and  to  minimise

avoidable  hospital  admissions and  premature  or  avoidable

dependence  on  long-term  care  in  institutional  settings.

There should be appropriate support services to help maintain

the  frail  elderly in the community for as long as possible.

Home-care  with  domiciliary  services,  and  day-care   with

rehabilitation  facilities as well  as  occupational  therapy

services with the equipment and adaptations at homes,  should

be  made  readily available.  It is also necessary to  garner

ample community help and community volunteers to deliver  the

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive care should remain the hallmark of eldercare.

MOH   should  facilitate  further  in  this  area  with  more

campaigns  through  the doctors and healthcare  workers,  the

grassroots, VWOs and the media, to encourage Singaporeans  to

go  for  early health-checks and treatment.  MOH must provide

early  treatment for the sick elderly.  An important  message

for  this target group will be "disabilities in old  age  are

often due to disease, and early treatment of the disease  can

prevent disabilities".  Upon this basis, it is necessary  for

MOH  to ensure that those with chronic diseases can get their

regular long-term medications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a preventive care scheme is not provided for

those  elderly  who are well, illnesses causing  disabilities

will occur more frequently.  This will, in turn, lead to more

hospitalisations  and higher costs.  If  the  community-based

services  are inadequate, more re-admissions to hospitals  or

institutional-care centres will again lead to  higher  costs.

I hope, therefore, that the Ministry of Health will look into

these issues soonest possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

first of all thank the Minister for Health, Mr Lim Hng Kiang,

for  accepting my proposal of providing health checks for the

elderly  people.  The comprehensive health check for all  the

elderly above the age of 55 has gained good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



support  from the people and they really appreciate  it.   In

the long-term, this kind of health-check will help to prepare

them for preventive health care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good plan. Unfortunately, there are some snags

in  the implementation of this health-check exercise. Some of

the elderly people who have registered, failed to turn up for

the  health-check at the appointed time.  I  have  done  some

house-to-house visits to find out the reason why they  failed

to  turn up for the health-check.  Some of them told me  that

they were afraid that the health check would reveal something

wrong with their health and they would have to take drugs for

a  long  time,  and  taking drugs for a  long  time  is  very

expensive.  So they simply bury their heads in the  sand  and

pretend  that there is nothing wrong with them. This  is  the

way they try to run away from reality. We must find some ways

to relieve them of this psychological burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Health seriously

consider that some  discount of, say, 30% to 50%, be given to

the  senior citizens, particularly the retirees,   when  they

purchase  their  medicine  from the  Government  polyclinics.

Secondly, the health checks should be extended to those  aged

50  and above, instead of the minimum age of 55.  This  would

enable  people  who  are  above 50 years  old  to  start  the

practice of preventive medical care earlier, and ensure  that

they would live a longer and healthier life after retirement.

I hope the Minister will consider these two points.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>2.08 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

would  say  that  the Government has done well  in  providing

healthcare  for  the  elderly.  Recently,  we  announced  the

subsidized  health  screening for  the  elderly  costing  the

Government  $6.6 million and also a provision of $11  million

basic MediShield plan for the elderly.  All these schemes are

intended to ensure that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



our elderly are well taken care of in the event they have  to

be hospitalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am concerned over the recent increase in

charges  for  specialist treatment in  hospitals.   Will  the

increase in charges make it more difficult for the elderly to

seek  treatment?  Even if their children are willing to  pay,

it  would cause undue financial burden to them, especially if

they come from lower-income families.  This is especially  so

when  the elderly are more prone to illness due to their  old

age.   As a result, they may require more extensive and long-term treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polyclinics have done well by providing affordable

outpatient   treatment  and  by  giving  the   elderly   sick

concessionary rates.  However, in hospitalisation cases,  the

MediShield plan should be able to take care of the main  bulk

of  the  cost,  while, in certain extremely difficult  cases,

Medifund will chip in to help.  My main concern is how we can

make  sure  that  in  the  event the  elderly  patients  need

specialist  consultation at the hospital after referral  from

the  polyclinic, they will not stop seeking treatment due  to

the  high  cost  of such treatment. If they do  not  want  to

burden  their children, they will cite reasons such  as  high

cost or others, and ask for traditional and cheaper types  of

treatment.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to  consider

imposing  a  cap on the amount that could be  charged.   When

they  seek specialist treatment, the amount should be a token

sum  as  a  gesture of goodwill in recognition of their  past

contributions to the society during their younger  days.   In

this  way,  they will know that their charges are capped  and

they  would not have to worry whether they have the financial

resources to pay for continual treatment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We welcome the

Minister's  announcement  that  the  restructured  Government

hospitals  will not be profit-orientated and that  they  will

serve  the  people, irrespective of their affordability.   We

all  know  that  we  are  facing  the  problem  of  an  aging

population.  With an aging population, the number of  elderly

admitted  into nursing homes will also increase.  At present,

most of the nursing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



homes are run by VWOs, with subsidies from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government provided a piece of land for

building a nursing home with a lease of 30 years only.   This

was  open  for  the private sector to tender and  the  tender

price  was  close to $7 million.  With 30 years' lease,  plus

construction costs, investment in infrastructure,  I  am  not

sure  how  much the nursing home will charge the patients  in

order to recoup its capital and make some profit.  Given  the

high  costs of setting up nursing homes and the need for  the

operators  to  make some profits on top of  the  recovery  of

their  cost, it is inevitable that the burden on the patients

will  increase  if  they  are admitted  into  nursing  homes.

According  to  reports,  the  Government  will,  in   stages,

continue  to  allot 13 to 17 pieces of land for tender.   The

plots  of  land will be conveniently located in  HDB  housing

estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the change in policy mean that there will be a

change  in the Government's attitude towards the care of  the

elderly?   The  report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee  on

the  Aeging Population states that every Singaporean must  be

responsible  for  his  health when  he  gets  old,  including

financial  planning  for  his old age  needs.   I  have  some

questions.   What would be the Government's attitude  towards

the  elderly who need medical care but who do not have  their

own  resources  to  pay for such care?   Secondly,  will  MOH

continue to allocate land to encourage VWOs to build  nursing

homes  and,  at  the same time, provide them with  subsidies?

Thirdly,  what  is MOH's long-term plan for the establishment

of  nursing  homes?  What will be the ratio  between  nursing

homes  run by VWOs and those run commercially by the  private

sector?

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it has been a

little  over  a year since the Ministry of Health  introduced

revised  funding principles for nursing homes, in  which  the

homes  are  required to utilise at least  80%  of  their  bed

capacity for category 3 and 4 patients who need a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



higher  level of nursing care and the new category  1  and  2

residents, that is, those needing a lesser level of care  and

assistance  would not qualify for MOH's subsidy.   While  the

principle   behind  this  move  to  ensure  the   appropriate

utilisation  of nursing home resources is certainly  correct,

there  is cause for concern for the care delivery system  for

these  frail  senior  citizens is  currently  not  yet  well-developed to provide adequate support and assistance to these

elderly  persons  and their families.  In  other  words,  are

there currently any other affordable residential institutions

that are able to accept the new category 1 and 2 patients, or

is it the intention that they should be looked after at home?

If  they  should  be looked after at home, are  there  enough

agencies,   I   would  expect  essentially  VWOs,   currently

providing  home  healthcare  services,  available  to  assist

families  to cope with this responsibility?  May  I  ask  the

Minister if he would give us an update of the situation  with

regard to whether there have been cases during the past  year

of  category  1  and  2  patients who have  had  difficulties

finding placement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to home healthcare services, are there other

present services we thought would be sufficient, if not, what

initiatives  have  been  put  in  place  to  encourage   more

providers to come forward?  I believe a new funding framework

has been or just about to be put in place which seeks to fund

step-down  care  through  approved  community  hospitals  and

nursing homes.  Are these institutions able, at this point in

time,  to  rise  to the challenge of undertaking  to  provide

these  new  services?  Will this move unwittingly  result  in

retarding the speed of growth of step-down care services?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister moves with his usual relentless efficiency.

One  is just concerned whether the VWO sector is able to keep

up  with him.  The Inter-Ministerial Committee on the  Ageing

Population has recommended, in its report, that MOH and  MCDS

review  the present division and responsibilities for  health

and social care services to ensure that planning and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



development  of these services, will facilitate  the  service

providers  who  want  to  look at  providing  community-based

services  and  in  the future development  of  more  holistic

models  of  eldercare.  May I ask the Minister if  there  has

been any progress in this area?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let me again assure Members here

that the healthcare for the elderly is a very key item in  my

Ministry's agenda.  I would just like to say that whatever  I

said  just  now about the whole financing structure  for  the

country applies equally well, if not more so, to the elderly,

because  the  elderly  consumes  a  large  portion   of   the

healthcare services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have also been making special provisions

for  the elderly but I must stress that the elderly must play

their  part  and  come  forward and  make  full  use  of  the

healthcare facilities and services that have been set up  for

them.   What  can the elderly do?  First of all, they  should

try  and  maintain  a  healthy lifestyle,  eat  sensibly  and

exercise  regularly.  Second, they should take  part  in  the

Community Health Screening Programme that we started in  July

last year.  The cost is minimal. The elderly pays only $5 for

the   screening,  which  costs  us  about   $20.    In   many

constituencies, in fact, the elderly is only required to  pay

$3 or $2 and, even in some constituencies, just $1.  But only

18%  of the eligible residents turned up to be screened.   Mr

Ang  Mong  Seng said that one reason for this low turnout  is

the  fear  of detecting medical problems which are costly  to

treat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the Members here and our elderly citizens

that  most  of  the  problems that the elderly  face  can  be

managed at the polyclinic level.  And at the polyclinics, the

elderly  enjoys a subsidy of 75%.  So it is very  affordable.

For  those who cannot co-pay the 25% portion, they can  apply

to  the polyclinic for their fees to be waived.  I agree with

all Members here who made the point that prevention is better

than cure that if the elderly were to manage their conditions

properly, this would prevent severe complications and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



disabilities  down  the  road,  which  would  be  even   more

expensive  to  treat and lower the quality  of  life  of  the

elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polyclinics run the Comprehensive Chronic Care

Programme (CCCP) to improve the management of diabetes,  high

blood  pressure and high blood cholesterol.  The  polyclinics

will  remind those who are on this programme when the follow-up dates are due.  Dr Lily Neo asked for a one-stop diagnosis

and  care planning centre.  In fact, our polyclinics  already

serve this function.  As I said earlier, most of the kind  of

problems that the elderly face can be managed quite  well  at

the polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also experimented by co-opting private sector

GPs  in a pilot scheme to make healthcare more accessible  to

the elderly.  This is working well in the four areas that  we

have  started  the pilot scheme, and we will extend  this  to

other  areas.   The elderly can look forward to seeing  their

regular private GPs and continue to enjoy the same subsidy as

they do in the polyclinics, if they meet the means test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also assure Members that referrals of these

elderly  by  the  participating GPs to specialist  outpatient

clinics  will  also be at the subsidised rate.   In  time  to

come, the elderly will continue to enjoy subsidised rates  at

the specialist outpatient clinics, regardless of whether they

go  through  the polyclinic or their private sector  GPs,  as

long as they meet the means test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is acute care. We all know that

hospitalisation  bills can be expensive and, therefore,  last

year,  we  offered  to pay the MediShield  premiums  for  the

elderly  for  two  years.  Making sure that  our  elderly  is

covered  by  MediShield will ensure that they will  be  in  a

position to pay for their hospitalisation bills.  As  I  said

earlier, the safety net provided by Medifund is also working.

The  elderly  takes up between 25% - 30% of our  restructured

hospitals'  Medifund disbursement.  I think  the  elderly  is

well  looked after in the primary care sector, as well as  in

the acute care sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the step-down care sector. Today,

the VWOs provide about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



60% of the market share in the nursing homes.  The Government

funds  90%  of  the  development  cost  and  last  year,   we

introduced a new 3-tier subsidy level for the nursing  homes.

We  recognise that there is a shortage of nursing home places

and,  therefore,  we have taken steps to build  more  nursing

homes.   My Ministry is currently working with VWOs to  build

another  seven nursing homes. They will be ready in the  next

one   to  two  years.   The  Government  funds  90%  of   the

development of these seven nursing homes, which is about  $75

million.  At the same time, we have put up plots of land  for

private nursing home development.  Our long-term intention is

to  allow  the  private sector to take up 40% of  the  market

share  by  the year 2010. Today it is 70:30, and by the  year

2010, we hope to achieve 60:40 the share between VWOs and the

private sector.  We believe that this 60:40 share will better

serve   the   different  socio-economic   segments   of   our

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Jennifer Lee and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about

the  other  provisions for nursing care and  step-down  care.

Let  me just say that for the other forms of step-down  care,

essentially  home medical and home nursing, we  have  several

VWOs  providing  this  service. Today,  there  are  six  VWOs

providing  home  nursing to more than 4,000  patients.   Last

year,  we  worked  with  the various VWOs  to  integrate  the

services  provided by the VWOs.  In July,  we  announced  the

framework  for  integrated health services for  the  elderly.

This  is  a long-term plan to guide the developments  of  the

various  VWOs  in providing step-down care.  I  am  not  sure

about my relentless efficiency, but I would like to assure Dr

Jennifer Lee that since we are at the initial stages  of  the

development  of the plan, we will review this each  year.  So

far,  the  feedback  has  been very good  and  the  VWOs  are

confident  that  they  can step up their  provision  of  home

medical and home nursing services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the whole idea is to divide Singapore into

three  regions,  each  supported by the geriatric  and  other

departments of each regional general hospital. Then, the VWOs

will run the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



community hospitals and the nursing homes and the other forms

of  step-down care - home medical and home nursing  services.

The  Government will provide the funds, the training and  the

other  resources  for them to do so. We are  working  towards

this. We will proceed at a pace that the VWOs can deliver the

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that in the next 10 years, with this

framework,  we  will be able to build up  all  the  necessary

facilities  to look after the elderly.  The other element  of

this is, of course, the financing framework.  Having built up

all  the facilities and services, we must also make sure that

the elderly can afford to pay for it.  Again, in addition  to

what  I  said  earlier  about the  financing  framework  that

applies  to the elderly, there are four things which we  have

done  to  make  sure that the elderly can  afford  all  these

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, we established the Eldercare Fund last year. This

is  an  endowment  fund built up by the  Government's  budget

surpluses.  The Government will inject another  $250  million

into the Eldercare Fund, bringing it up to $750 million.   We

are  progressively building up the Eldercare  Fund  and  this

will  provide  subventions  to  the  various  step-down  care

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we implemented means testing and the 3-tier

funding for the nursing home residents since July last  year.

I  am  happy to say that this 3-tier subsidy scheme has given

more  support to the nursing homes.  The funding  of  nursing

homes  receiving  Government funding under  this  new  3-tier

system  has  increased  by over 20%, as  more  residents  now

qualify  for funding and at higher funding rates than before.

The Government's recurrent subsidy to step-down facilities is

$31 million last year and we estimate that this will increase

to  $100  million by the year 2010 and that  is  why  we  are

building up our Eldercare Fund quite aggressively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third area, I am pleased to announce that we will

extend Medifund to the residential step-down facilities  with

effect from this year.  This measure will supplement the fund-raising  efforts of VWOs.  For this fiscal year, we will  set

aside $1.7 million from the Medifund

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



interest  income  for this scheme.  Let me clarify  that  the

extension  of  Medifund to VWOs is not meant to displace  the

role  of the community in raising funds for the VWOs, but  it

should be seen as complementing their efforts.  This is  part

of our "Many Helping Hands" approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final component to make sure that healthcare is

affordable  to  our  elderly will be to  establish  a  Severe

Disability  Insurance  Scheme to  help  defray  out-of-pocket

expenses  in the event of severe disability. This  payout  is

not  only  for  those  in institutional care,  but  also  for

disabled  elderly who are cared for at home, using community-based services or home care services.  Our intention is  that

Medisave  can  be used to pay the premiums of this  insurance

scheme.   We  are actively working out the key parameters  of

this  policy and we hope to be able to introduce this  scheme

in the fourth quarter of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have assured Members here that my Ministry

has  put  in place a comprehensive package for looking  after

our  elderly.   We  have  a  framework  to  set  up  all  the

facilities.   We can assure you that these facilities will be

adequate in number and of an adequate standard, and that  the

services will be seamlessly integrated.  At the same time, we

have  also  put  in  place the financing  framework  for  the

elderly,  and  we  can assure you that the services  will  be

provided  at a price that the elderly can afford and sustain,

and  also  at a price that we, as a society, can  afford  and

sustain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I seek a clarification from

the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister in his answer said

that  seven more nursing homes will be built and run by VWOs.

I  would  like  to  know where are these homes  going  to  be

located.   Will  they  be  located in  convenient  places  in

housing estates?  Or only nursing homes run by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



private  sector, and the land tendered out at a  high  price,

are going to be located in convenient places in HDB estates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> All our nursing homes will be located

close   to  our  community,  because  that  is  an  important

consideration.  By the year 2010, we expect to have about 70-80  nursing homes.  So we can expect practically one  nursing

home  in  every constituency.  That is the kind of facilities

we need to have, because of the ageing population.  Today, we

have  50  nursing homes.  We are building another seven  more

over the next two years, and we are going to tender land  for

a  few more private nursing homes.   Our plan calls for 70 to

80  nursing  homes by the year 2010, which practically  means

one  nursing home in every constituency.  So Members will  be

able  to  serve their residents quite well with  one  nursing

home per constituency.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, my parliamentary

colleagues   before  me  have  spoken  about  the  healthcare

services  for  the elderly, and the Minister has  assured  us

about the funding policy and the facilities.  But the key  to

any  healthcare  policy  will be the doctors  themselves  and

without  good  doctors, it will be difficult to  deliver  any

form of quality healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructured hospitals have had a large number of

their medical officers and specialists leaving the hospitals.

I  am  glad  that adjustments have been made to the salaries,

and   with  these  adjustments  in  salaries  and   also   an

increasingly saturated private sector, the pull factors  have

diminished.  Also, the administrators that we have now appear

to  be  much  more equipped to cope with the changing  health

environment,  and it is time to address some  of  these  push

factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical officers work extremely long hours and are

the work horses of the department, doing the bidding of their

Registrars  and the consultants.  If they do  not  intend  to

specialise, there is no career path for them, and there is no

systematic  training for them.  With such working  conditions

and  no career development opportunities, there can be no job

satisfaction.  We need to look into this area and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



what we need is a department that will look after their needs

and future.  This is not just an administrative department to

deploy  them in one hospital or in one department, but beyond

that,  to  look  after their career plans, to look  at  their

training  programmes and to help them seek  job  satisfaction

and  job security.  Perhaps the Ministry may want to consider

setting up a medical officers division in each cluster, which

will look at the deployment, career planning and training for

medical officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to retain specialists. Some of the

problems that  specialists  face  include, for example,

workload. The  workload in the restructured hospitals  is

extremely  high.  There is also pressure on the doctors  from

the  Ministry to meet certain  "lead times"; in other  words,

the  time  from when the appointment is made to the time  the

doctor sees the patient, and also to reduce the waiting  time

for  patients.  When placed under pressure, doctors  work  in

very  difficult  conditions.   One  surgeon  in  one  of  the

restructured hospitals told me that it is a norm for his team

to  see  between 40-60 new patients a morning,  or  at  least

attempt  to see.  So you can imagine what sort of quality  of

care  he can deliver.  When one tries to impose certain  time

lines  on the doctors, certain things will give.  And as  the

consultants are  so  busy  with  delivering  the   clinical

services, there is not much time that can be apportioned  to

the  training of more junior doctors, and these doctors later

on  in  life will become consultants.  So this is  a  vicious

cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of specialists in the hospital is not

even.   For  example, some hospitals like  NUH  will  have  a

higher portion of consultants in a department as compared  to

junior  doctors, whereas some hospitals like  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital  will  have  comparatively fewer  consultants,  even

though  the workload would be comparable.  Hence, across-the-board,  on paper, it may seem that you may have an acceptable

ratio  of doctors to patients for different specialties,  but

there  is  a significant asymmetry or disparity from hospital

to  hospital.  Perhaps the Ministry or the clusters may  want

to take a more proactive approach in redistributing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



the specialists so that the workload is evened out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also inter-departmental differences and these

are  often  resolved at the medical board level  (differences

between  departments, differences between specialties).   And

because  the medical board is an internal board, many doctors

or  departments may feel that if their head is not holding  a

significant position there, they may not have a say.  One may

want  perhaps  to  consider  either  a  board  of  appeal  or

seconding  doctors from outside that hospital to sit  on  the

medical board to give it a more unbiased perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is time for us to relook at some of

these issues because, ultimately, retaining good doctors will

help  to  improve the quality of healthcare in our healthcare

services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, there has been quite a lot of

publicity  lately  on  doctors in  the  public  sector.   The

Government has initiated various measures to stem the  exodus

of  experienced  doctors from the public  service.   Doctors'

salaries   have   been  raised.   The   Ministry   has   also

reintroduced  a faculty practice plan which allows  selective

senior  consultants  to  do part-time  work  in  the  private

sector, and allows a reverse flow of similar doctors from the

private sector to the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some private doctors have indicated that these measures

are  not  enough  to stop the exodus.  They claim  that  many

doctors left not because of pay.  Although I have yet to know

any  one, including doctors, who openly admit that they leave

their  jobs  because of money, it is always  something  else.

This  includes  working conditions like  having  long  hours,

unappreciative bosses and family sacrifices.   To  a  certain

extent, these grouses may be true, as there will be in almost

every  profession.   Within the constraints  of  the  system,

however,  remedial  measures can be taken  to  resolve  them.

This  could, however, be the chicken and egg situation.   For

example,  to  reduce the long working hours, we  can  recruit

more  doctors.  But this is one snag against the  outflow  of

doctors  to  the  private sector.   It  boils  down  then  to

managing a balance of resources

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



and  constraints.   I  think there  can  still  be  room  for

improvement.  I would like to know the measures the  Ministry

has  taken,  apart from salary adjustments, to make  it  more

conducive for doctors to stay in the public sector, given all

the operational constraints.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, doctoring is becoming a

difficult profession.  Many have read in the papers  recently

that even doctors now are subject to abuse by members of  the

public.   Quite often, not surprisingly, almost  every  other

month, you will read something in the papers that would carry

negative and sensational comments during legal suits  against

doctors,  and  these reports put doctors in a  very  negative

light.   And  during  legal  suits, usually  the  sensational

comments   put  up  by  the  prosecution  would   always   be

highlighted and the defence side is always so boring, because

they just relate the facts and are usually not carried.   And

that  gives  a  distorted image of how doctors perform  their

duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not forget that doctors are human beings. Yes,

they can prolong life, but they are unable to ensure that all

outcomes  will  be  what  patients  expect.   Even  the  best

surgeons  in  the world cannot ensure that all  his  patients

will  have good outcomes.  We need to put the work of doctors

in  the right perspective.  Doctors work long hours and  have

very  little  social life.  It is one of the few  professions

that they have to work virtually every day, including Sundays

and  public  holidays.  Doctors do their  best  to  give  the

patients  the  best of care.  But due to the  constraints  of

time, the constraints of the workload, they may not always be

able to give the best that they want to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I am a visiting consultant to one of the

hospitals  -  Tan Tock Seng Hospital  - and I can see that in

a  hospital like that, where the workload is extremely heavy,

they  have  very few consultants.  And because of  that,  the

Registrars  and  the medical officers do not get  any  formal

training programme.  Unless we improve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



the  services,  we will not be able to lighten the  workload,

improve  the  quality  of  care.  One  must  understand  that

doctors  have  a  very  difficult time  in  the  restructured

hospitals.    And   the   recent  newspaper   report,   which

highlighted the routine of the doctor, does help to give  the

public  an insight into what sort of time lines doctors  have

to  meet.  The perception is always distorted because, to the

doctor,  he has 60 patients to look after.  But to a  person,

his  relative is the most important person, and why  can  the

doctor not give him that due attention and that due time that

is needed for his relative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Health has allowed a reverse

brain  drain, tapping the private sector expertise,  and  has

actually brought in some specialists from the private  sector

back  into  the public sector.  This has generally been  well

received  by  the public for beefing up the services  in  the

restructured hospitals.  Ultimately, the aim is to tap on the

talent  pool so that if we can draw either foreign talent  or

local  private sector talent, we will be able to improve  the

workload.  And that will mean that there is increased quality

time  for  patients, and we will also be able to improve  the

training of doctors, which means that they can deliver better

care  to  the  patients.  Perhaps the Minister  can  tell  us

whether  there  are  any  other  plans  to  perhaps  tap  the

resources  outside  the  public  hospitals  to  improve   the

workload on the doctors in the public service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on primary healthcare. Because of

our  involvement in new towns, we began to learn a bit  about

how  primary healthcare delivery is done in the new town.   I

was  surprised  that when we had a population  of  more  than

20,000 households, which would be equivalent to roughly  half

the  size of Ang Mo Kio town, we only had two clinics  tucked

in one corner of the estate.  In other words, all we had were

two  clinics  providing  primary healthcare  service  to  the

entire  estate.   When  I  raised  this  with  the  different

Government  departments, it appeared that  everybody  thought

that  it  was  a good thing to locate clinics  only  in   big

shopping malls.  But I raised the point that when people  are

sick, they do not want to take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buses. They do not want to drive a car to a shopping mall

to see a doctor.  They want to be able to walk to the nearest

clinic which is within walking distance to seek treatment and

relief  for their illness.  At the meetings that we had  with

the  Ministry,  I was given to understand that  the  Ministry

does  not  have any planning advice or planning norms  as  to

what sort of number of clinics that we should provide in  the

new  housing estates.  Perhaps the Ministry may  want  to  be

more  proactive  in  this  area in  coordination  with  other

Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as a town grows, there is a growing need for a

public  primary healthcare service in the form of polyclinics

or  other forms of public primary healthcare service,  to  be

provided in this growing new town.  Perhaps the Minister  can

help  enlighten me as to what the Ministry's  plans  are  for

this new town.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I intend to stop discussion on this

amendment  at 3.00 o'clock.  So I think we have to  press  on

with relentless efficiency.  We want to give other Members  a

chance to speak.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir,

Parliament  recently passed the Health Promotion Board  Bill.

With  the formation of a new statutory board, ie, the  Health

Promotion  Board,  Singaporeans can look forward  to  a  more

focused,  integrated  and concentrated  approach  for  better

health  outcomes.  The Board will spearhead health education,

promotion  and  prevention  programmes  to  overcome   health

problems in children, adults and the elderly.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the functions of the Board is to provide

medical,  dental, health screening and immunisation  services

to  school children and all other persons.  I believe this is

a  good  move by the MOH because they can monitor the medical

history  of  all  Singaporeans.  I wish to ask  the  Minister

whether the Ministry could set up a central registry  of  all

the medical records of all Singaporeans from birth until they

reach  old  age.  This move will allow Singaporeans  to  know

more about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



their  medical history.  They can also provide  this  medical

history  to  their respective doctors who are treating  them.

This  may  save  them  time and perhaps  cost  while  getting

treatment for their present illnesses.  The doctors can  also

advise them to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent  their

previous illnesses from recurring again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could comment on these points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, on the premise

that  our people are our key resource in the country,  it  is

incumbent   upon   the  Government  to  ensure   that   every

Singaporean, regardless of age, stays as healthy as  possible

throughout  his life.  I believe there is no  better  way  to

ensure  this than to inculcate healthy living habits so  that

Singaporeans ultimately embrace a healthy lifestyle and  lead

a balanced life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a recognised fact that from the student bench

in   our   schools  to  the  workbench  in  our   workplaces,

Singaporeans, young and old, are subjected to an increasingly

competitive and stressful environment.  Adoption of a healthy

lifestyle  can  help  Singaporeans  cope  better   with   the

pressures  of  life,  provided they  know  how.   It  is  not

uncommon for us to stumble upon reports of increasing obesity

among  students  in our schools, higher incidence  of  breast

cancer  among our women, and Singaporeans' increased exposure

to coronary heart disease.  Much of these may be attributable

to  stress, poor eating habits and lack of physical exercise.

I  am particularly happy to note the Minister announcing  the

68%  increase  in health promotional programmes  earlier  but

would  nevertheless like to pose the following  measures  for

the  Minister to consider, so as to increase awareness of the

importance  of  a healthy lifestyle while also enhancing  the

already  available infrastructure so that Singaporeans  could

benefit from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Health Ministry should consider forging a

strong  and  compelling healthy lifestyle vision  to  achieve

this  objective.  I know Sports for Life was launched several

years ago but I think this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



is not comprehensive enough for a healthy lifestyle vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Ministry's preventive healthcare and health

education programmes should be beefed up and publicised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in conjunction with the Ministry of National

Development, more health clubs or exercise facilities  should

be built in HDB and industrial estates to encourage people to

exercise  more  and  stay  fit.  Facilities  should  be  made

available and easily accessible for Singaporeans to  exercise

at  or  near  their homes or workplaces.  Wherever  possible,

make  these  available for free or levy very  small  fees  if

absolutely necessary to charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, facilities in housing estates should be family-friendly to encourage whole families to indulge in healthy

lifestyle.   When  entire  families  begin  working  out   in

community health clubs, they not only do something for  their

health  but  also meet other families doing the  same  thing.

This  also  achieves the much desired effect of strengthening

community bonds within the neighbourhood.  It is like killing

two birds with one stone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Health Ministry should seriously

consider implementing the recommended two-pronged approach to

looking  after  the healthcare needs of the elderly,  as  put

forth  by  the Inter-Ministerial Committee on healthcare  for

elderly: firstly, health promotion and disease prevention  to

enable   the  elderly  remain  healthy  and  active  in   the

community; secondly, when disease and disability set in,  the

system must be able to provide appropriate and cost-effective

healthcare according to each elderly person's needs so as  to

achieve maximum functional capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further help the elderly, the Government could

consider giving them special rebates when they buy healthcare

products,  such  as vitamins and special food supplements  to

keep themselves healthy and fit.  Perhaps the Health Ministry

could  work with NTUC Healthcare for consideration of special

discounts when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



senior  citizens  purchase health products in  their  stores,

considering the fact that the aged have to fork out  more  in

healthcare expenditure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last year, the

Government  announced that it would embark  on  a  systematic

health  screening programme in collaboration with  charitable

organisations   to   detect   diabetes,   hypertension    and

cholesterol level in people who are aged 55 years and  above.

I  wholly support such a programme as I think it will benefit

us  greatly  in  the long term.  At a personal  level,  early

detection  and treatment can help stave off the complications

that  may  arise from such medical conditions.  On the  other

hand,  from  a  national standpoint, such  measures  help  to

reduce   the  long-term  cost  of  medical  care  which   the

Government  will  have to shoulder.  As an illustration,  the

cost  of treating stroke patients can be very substantial  as

many  of  these  patients require long stay in hospitals  and

extensive rehabilitation.  However, we know that the risk  of

getting stroke can be reduced significantly if blood pressure

and  the  level  of cholesterol in the body is monitored  and

controlled regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much as I welcome the Government's initiative in

this  regard, I do have one request.  Perhaps the  Government

should  consider  extending health screening exercise  beyond

just   monitoring  diabetes,  hypertension  and   cholesterol

levels.   Presently, there are tests that are available  that

will  enable one to detect other forms of serious  illnesses.

For  instance,  there are blood tests that  will  screen  for

certain   forms  of  cancer,  and  we  can  identify  certain

residents with a predisposition towards such illnesses,  from

family   records  perhaps,  and  refer  them  for  additional

screening.  The cost of such screening may be higher than the

screening  that  is  presently  offered  under  our  national

programme.  However, I believe early detection and  treatment

can  help  the State to spend less on healthcare in the  long

run.   The  principle is simple.  It may be better  to  spend

more  now on health screening than to have to spend  a  whole

lot more in treatment later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the Government to

consider extending the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



scope  of  our  health screening programme to  include  other

forms of illnesses as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Obviously, there is not very much

time  for  me  to deal with all of the many good suggestions.

So  I would seek Members' indulgence that we will follow this

up  in greater detail after this session.  Let me just in the

next  six  minutes  respond to some of the key  points  which

Members have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think managing doctors is a very important task. It

is not just a HR management issue.  The medical profession is

a  demanding profession which requires very committed  people

working  under very difficult conditions.  So I take  in  all

the suggestions raised by Mr Bernard Chen and Dr Michael Lim.

Obviously,  our  approach towards this  is  not  just  salary

adjustments.  We know that we have to keep up with  the  pay,

but  it  is  also  a  whole host of other  things  -  working

conditions, training, sense of public service, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members that we are working at this.

We  intend to keep our fair share of talent.  But just to put

all  these  reports in perspective, there are two  groups  of

doctors  that  we  are  dealing with.   One  is  the  medical

officers  (MOs) whom we have to train and who have  to  serve

five  years  of  bond  with  us.   The  other  group  is  the

consultants, who after their training, can either  stay  with

us  or  go  to  the private sector.  Dealing with  these  two

groups,  of  course, requires different considerations.   For

the  MOs,  we want to make sure we give them a good grounding

in training, so that if they leave us and become GPs outside,

they would have a good exposure to all the key departments in

the  hospitals so that they would be good family  physicians.

But  while they are with us for the five years, we should not

treat  them  as cheap labour.  We should pay them competitive

rates  and  we should treat them as we should treat  all  our

employees.  So this requires a bit of a mindset change in the

hospitals  and  I can assure you that we are working  towards

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the consultants, whether they stay with us or not,

really we have to manage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



them  just  like  any other employees that  we  manage.   The

hospitals  have  put in place several measures  to  make  the

restructured  hospitals  a more attractive  place  for  these

consultants to work in.  This faculty practice scheme is  one

way  to  remove  this very sharp divide between  the  private

sector  and  the  public sector.  We will  have  to  continue

working  at  different measures to make sure that the  public

sector  has  a fair share of talent and provides the  service

that is required or expected by Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to primary healthcare. On this point

about  setting up clinics in new towns, our preference is  to

let  the  private sector determine the setting up of clinics.

I  think it is very hard for the Ministry to dictate how many

clinics  should be set up by the private sector in  each  new

town.  So the private sector will obviously respond once they

know  that  Sengkang is building up.  If there are  only  two

clinics  and people there have to be served, you  can  expect

more private sector GPs to set up clinics there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as polyclinic is concerned, our policy is to

develop  a  polyclinic when the population in  the  new  town

builds  up to a certain level.  Therefore, I am happy to  say

that  Sengkang is building up nicely  and we are planning  to

build a polyclinic there, and we will build it in due course.

Of  course, it will not appear overnight.  It takes three  or

four years for us to plan, locate the site and actually build

the  polyclinic.  But I can assure you that a  polyclinic  in

Sengkang will be built in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ibrahim asked whether the Ministry will set up a

central registry of medical records.  Today, the records  are

already  in  a  few key areas.  When you are in  school,  the

school  health system has a record.  When you enter  national

service, MINDEF has a record.  When you enter any one of  our

two clusters in the public sector, we have your records.   So

I  think  we should improve the record-keeping in  these  key

areas  first.  Whether we combine all of them into a  central

registry, we have to proceed a bit more carefully, because we

have to be very careful about privacy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



of  information, particularly of medical information.  I know

the  technology allows us, but we would prefer to  proceed  a

bit  more  carefully,  to make sure  that  there  are  enough

safeguards  to  preserve  the  confidentiality  of  all  this

information before we embark on this central registry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad posed many good suggestions about preventive

healthcare and health promotion.  I think we will hoist  them

in.   I  just want to respond to his suggestion about special

rebates  for  vitamins and supplements for the elderly.   The

doctors  tell me that if the elderly eat sensibly, they  have

all  the necessary vitamins and supplements they need to live

a  long  and healthy life.  So they tell me that a rebate  is

not  necessary.   The  only case they  tell  me  is  probably

calcium supplements to make sure their bone mass is good  and

they  do not have early osteoporosis.  I am told that calcium

supplements are not very expensive.  So, again, there  is  no

need for special rebates.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann suggested that we undertake screening in

a  more  aggressive  way.  Let me assure  him,  that  is  our

intention,  provided it makes sense.  We  have  done  so  for

diabetes, high blood pressure and blood cholesterol.  But for

a  national screening exercise to be effective, we must  look

at  the  whole scale plus the payoff.  And for these  chronic

illnesses,  there is a good payoff, and therefore,  based  on

the  evidence  and  research, we are  embarking  on  it.   Of

course,  our  community health screening  process  is  barely

started.  We need to plug at it, and I am sure in five to  10

years'  time, we will start to enjoy the fruits of that  very

massive national screening exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific examples of cancer, there are some

cancers  which  are amenable to national screening  exercises

and  some which are not.  Colorectal cancer, for example,  is

not  amenable to a national screening exercise.  But we  will

identify the high risk groups and alert

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



these  high  risk  groups to go for  screening.   Breast  and

cervical  cancer is amenable to mass screening, and  this  is

where we are concentrating our efforts for the time being.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have stretched the discussion of this

amendment  by  at  least  five  to  six  minutes.   Any  more

stretching,  the  other $10 cuts will suffer  and  I  do  not

intend to do so.  Mr Bernard Chen, would you like to withdraw

the amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code PA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term healthcare. Sir, many Singaporeans are

concerned  about rising medical costs and this is  especially

so  for the elderly folks in our midst who have no income but

have  increasing  medical  needs.   In  time  to  come,  this

increasing  burden will affect even more people  due  to  our

fast  ageing population.  I would therefore like to urge  the

Ministry of Health to have good plans, insurance schemes  and

various  safety  nets put in place to ensure  the  affordable

long-term healthcare for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we observe the 10 basic

tenets for such long-term healthcare as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The culture of self-reliance and taking personal

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The premise that early preventive measures are

preferable  and  more effective than later  interventions  at

points of crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The view that the family unit, with adequate

support,  is  the principal way to provide care in  the  home

environment rather than residential care.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The recognition that residential care is costly and

causes loss of independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The need to involve the communities to facilitate

the elderly to stay in the communities and at their own homes

for as long as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Funding for long-term healthcare must be fair,

equitable  to all generations and sustainable over  the  long

term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A combination of services may be required, including

personal  or medical care, equipment, transport and  domestic

support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Older people often have a variety of inter-related

needs,  including nutrition, nursing, medication and mobility

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The importance of support for family and other

informal caregivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The role of the different professions in delivering

cost effective and life enhancing care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister for Health to

incorporate the above important considerations to ensure  the

success  of the care of long-term medical needs.  Success  in

this  area  will  lessen the burden of Singaporeans  and  the

state in the long run.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you carry on with your next cut, Dr

Neo?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Yes, Sir. Nurses constitute an integral

and  important  part  of any healthcare system.   Success  in

training  nurses  and training enough of them  is  vital  for

sustaining the excellent and efficient healthcare  system  we

now enjoy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nurses who are well trained can do a lot and they

contribute  not only to better care of patients but  also  to

lower  costs in healthcare delivery.  It is very much cheaper

to  maintain  a nurse as compared to, let us say,  a  doctor.

Well-trained  nurses  can carry out many functions  otherwise

performed  by  doctors and this frees the  latter  for  other

duties.   A  nurse in a community clinic can  be  trained  to

check patients and assess them for appropriate referral, give

post-operative care, make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



domiciliary   visits  and  monitor  patients   with   chronic

illnesses.   Nurses can be trained to provide  care  in  very

specialised  situations too.  They can  be  trained  to  look

after   vexing  psychiatric  and  dementia  patients,  taxing

bedridden  and  incontinent  stroke  patients  as   well   as

disheartening terminally ill patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we try to cope with our ageing problem, nurses

will be required in even greater numbers.  The challenge  for

us  is not only in having adequate numbers of nurses but also

in  training  enough  of them for the  impending  demands  of

eldercare.   As  our  policy will be to assist  older  people

remain  as  independently for as long as possible, preferably

in  their  own homes, more courses are needed to  train  more

nurses for the community care setting to achieve this end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from training the nurses, the Ministry of Health

should  also have courses that cater for healthcare  workers.

These  healthcare  workers can be full-time  paid  personnel,

family  members,  community  volunteers,  and  so  on.   Such

healthcare workers can be trained in a matter of a few weeks.

In  England, it takes only three weeks of intensive  training

to  equip them with the necessary skills.  They are certified

at  the  end  of  the course which teaches them  in  assisted

feeding,  catheter care, prosthesis use, simple dressing  and

simple grooming as in toenail cutting for non-diabetics using

sterile techniques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still very short of nurses in Singapore. Whilst

I  feel  that the Ministry of Health must seriously  consider

training  more healthcare workers to help ease this shortage,

I urge that we have to do much more to increase our supply of

nurses.   I am glad that the Ministry of Health has  taken  a

step  in  the  right  direction with an  upward  revision  of

nurses' salaries from 1st June this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not only necessary to make the nursing

profession noble; it is also necessary to make the job family-friendly  and  lucrative in terms of both career  development

and monetary unions.  Shall I go on to my last cut?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Rehabilitation. Sir, everyone who has had

an  illness or accident needs some time to recover.  In other

words,  they  need  rehabilitation.  Older  people  who  need

rehabilitation usually suffer from a wide range of conditions

and their needs are often complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitation involves restoration to the maximum

degree  possible, either of function (physical or mental)  or

role  (within  the  family,  social  network  or  workforce).

Rehabilitation  usually  requires  a  mixture  of   clinical,

therapeutic and social interventions that also address issues

relevant  to  a  person's  physical and  social  environment.

Effective rehabilitation needs to be responsive to the  needs

and  wishes  of  the user and has to be purposeful  with  the

involvement of a number of agencies and disciplines.  It must

also be made easily available when required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is strong evidence that comprehensive

assessments,  followed by implementation of  individual  care

plans,  can reduce the risk of older people being re-admitted

to  hospitals or placed in long-stay care.  It also  improves

survival rates and physical and cognitive functioning.  To do

all these, we need the involvement of relevant therapists, in

particular,  we  need  occupational  therapists,  speech  and

language therapists and physiotherapist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Health if he

would  ensure that we have enough of such therapists to  give

patients the ideal rehabilitation they require and whether he

would expand this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, it is very easy to answer Dr Lily

Neo's questions.  We agree with everything that she says.  We

agree that her 10 tenets are very useful guidelines.  We will

try  to incorporate them into our plans.  We also agree  that

we  should  ensure  that for the professionals,  an  adequate

number   of  them  should  be  trained  and  made  available,

including nurses as well as therapists.  As far as nurses are

concerned,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



we  would  like to say that, currently, we have  an  Advanced

Diploma in Gerontology and Community Health Nursing available

at  the Nanyang Polytechnic.  Today, we have a core group  of

300  registered  nurses who have received  formal  post-basic

training in this subject, and we expect to train a further 90

nurses in these two areas in the next four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also agree that there is a need to train community

health  workers,  including family members in  elderly  care.

And in fact, Dr Lily Neo will probably know that we currently

have  a  project  working with her Kim Seng community  centre

grassroots  leaders to train family members and, so  far,  62

volunteer nurses have been trained to undertake such training

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to expand the scope to work with more

voluntary  organisations as well as grassroots  organisations

to  train  our community so that they are better equipped  to

care for a more aged population.

Secretary for agreeing with all my suggestions.  I beg  leave

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgery by beauticians. Sir, we pride ourselves for

having  a  first-class medical healthcare system with  world-recognised and well-qualified surgeons who will carry out the

best  operations for their patients.  We also  have  all  our

doctors  under  surveillance  to  provide  the  best  medical

practices  and  bring  them  to justice  for  any  misdoings.

Whilst  we  ensure  medical ethics and  excellence  with  the

medical professionals on one hand, we allow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



beauticians,  who  are  not  competent,  to  freely   perform

surgical procedures, on the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reports made to the media and the Consumers'

Association suggest that some methods used by beauticians are

invasive  and  come  with  attendant  risks  of  injury   and

infection.   Laser devices are being used  freely.   This  is

borne  out by the profusion of advertisements promoting  hair

removal  by  beauticians using "FDA approved light  activated

systems".  It is likely that Class 4 Laser Devices are  being

used  for  this  and  this  would  contravene  the  Radiation

Protection  Act  which states that non-medical  professionals

are  licensed to operate only Class 1, 2, 3a and  3b  lasers.

Other  procedures  performed by beauticians include  silicone

injections  to the nose and breast, removal of tattoos  using

CO2 lasers and blepharoplasties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do they contravene the Medical Registration

Act,  these beauticians also pose potential hazards when they

"operate"  on  unwary clients.  Sir, many  beauty  treatments

have  gone  horribly  wrong because  people  have  been  ill-informed   and   were  taken  in  by  misleading   and   bait

advertisements, especially for blemish removal, eye-lids  and

nose jobs.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of what use are the Acts if such illegal activities

continue  to  flourish unchecked?  Medical professionals  are

brought to task for advertising themselves, let alone  making

misrepresented advertisements, but beauticians  are  free  to

advertise,  lure and treat customers.  Sir, these beauticians

are  not  authorised to perform invasive  surgery,  and  they

should  be  stopped.  I would, therefore, like  to  urge  the

Ministry   of  Health  to  pursue  and  address   the   stark

discrepancy in this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I think we can also agree with

everything that Dr Lily Neo says, except that the beauticians

are  not  free  to  advertise, lure and treat  customers  for

unauthorised surgery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we would like to advise members of the public that

the  Ministry  takes  a  very,  very  serious  view  of  such

cosmetic   surgery  and  surgical  procedures  that   require

cutting, stitching and putting in of implants should only  be

done by qualified doctors and surgeons.  And the public would

not  be  lured, unless they want to be lured.  The public  is

therefore advised that they should not subject themselves  to

the  risks of such procedures being undertaken by unqualified

persons.  Like what Dr Lily Neo says, unqualified persons who

perform  such surgeries would be committing an offence  under

the  Medical Registration Act.  And, if these procedures  are

performed in places not authorised for such procedures,  they

would  be  committing an offence under the Private  Hospitals

and Medical Clinics Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any member of the public is aware of such procedures

being  performed,  either  by  unauthorised  persons  or   in

unauthorised  places,  I would urge them  to  report  to  the

Ministry  of Health's Licensing and Accreditation  Department

at telephone number 3252612.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. Can I ask

the  Parliamentary Secretary whether the Ministry would allow

it, if no stitching, cutting, etc, are involved?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, it is not very clear what

procedures the hon. Member is talking about - no cutting,  no

stitching.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Done by world-class beauticians, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> If in doubt, he can always call the

department and ask.  We need details.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek clarification, Sir. May I ask

the  Parliamentary Secretary whether the Ministry would  take

any  further  action  to cope with these prevalent  surgeries

done  by beauticians, and what else could be further done  to

improve this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> We are unable to act unless we know

specifically  that  the  surgeries  are  done.   If   it   is

advertisements, and we read about them and suspect that  such

surgeries  may  have  been done, then investigations  can  be

initiated.   But, essentially, as I have just said,  we  need

specific

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



information in order to be able to act effectively.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I seek further clarification? To

reiterate,  advertisements  are  put  up  freely   by   these

beauticians.   If  you  say the Ministry  would  pursue  this

matter,   why  has  it  not  acted  earlier  on   all   these

advertisements?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> If the advertisement is a general one,

then   we  are  not  able  to  act  on  this.   But  if   the

advertisement says, "You come here, we can do a double eyelid

on  you", or "You come and we can put some injection on you",

then it is a different matter.  We will investigate.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, in fact, the advertisements were in

that  category.  Advertisements have also been made for  hair

removal by FDA-approved light activated systems but they used

probably Class-4 laser device.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I do not have those

advertisements with me at the moment.  Perhaps Dr  Neo  could

pass them over and we would follow up.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Prof Toh.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code PC 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of my colleagues in this House have asked me

why  I am so passionate about hair dyes.  Let me assure  them

that  I  do not need them personally even though I  may  need

some  other hair products.  Perhaps a hair restorer would  be

more appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question arises because, since June last year,

there  has  been  an  expose  by  CASE  on  some  laxity  and

inconsistency in the administration of the Poisons Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



To  refresh the mind of Members, they did a survey of  retail

pharmacies in Singapore to see how many were selling  certain

hair dyes over the counter.  These hair dyes contain diamine,

or  its  derivatives, which is listed  as  a  poison  in  the

Poisons  Act.   A  high  proportion of  the  pharmacies  they

surveyed  did  not  have  control  procedures  in  place,  as

required by the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paraphrase and re-raise the questions that were

mentioned then, which have not been answered by the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Is the level of diamine in hair dyes so high that

they  pose a danger to users?  Other countries in the  world,

including  those  in the developed countries  of  Europe  and

America,  permit the sale of such hair dyes over the counter,

without  requiring the supervision of pharmacists.  They  are

also freely available over the counter in Malaysia, and Johor

Baru is just a short drive away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If they are really so poisonous, why were the

pharmacists so lax in the control of these sales?  And if the

control  of the pharmacists is so critical, then  why  is  it

that  untrained and unsupervised hairstylists in hair saloons

can   use  these  dyes  without  any  safety  procedures   or

documentation  of  use?  The Ministry promised  to  prosecute

errant  pharmacists, but there has been no news of  any  such

prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Why is such a common cosmetic item being sold under

lock  and  key?  Why are we adding a layer of very  expensive

professionals for the sale of something that everywhere  else

in  the world is sold over the counter?  Are we unnecessarily

creating  a statutory monopoly to help pharmacists make  ends

meet?  Why are we inconveniencing consumers, who can only buy

these  items at times when the pharmacists are in, ie,  their

office hours, and this means strict hours of 10.00 am to 5.00

pm, Sundays and holidays excluded, and with a 2-hour lunch in

between?  Such artificial restriction on supply, in the  face

of  increasing  demand and the intervention of  professionals

who  do not serve any purpose, will only serve to jack up the

final price of the product.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Is there no other way of warning consumers to use

the  product carefully without using pharmacists, such as  by

appropriate  labelling on the packaging  and  a  minimum  age

requirement for the purchase of these products?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can address these questions without

any further delay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, unlike the beauticians, in this

case, we agree with Prof. Toh.  So the Ministry of Health  is

now  in  the process of completing the legislative amendments

to  allow for the declassification of hair dyes that  contain

diamine, and we expect this work to be completed some time in

April.  The appropriate announcement would be made shortly to

the public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Toh, are you happy?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I am glad that my

passion  does get me some places.  I am not always emotional,

and  I  would  like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary  for

being so agreeable.  I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
