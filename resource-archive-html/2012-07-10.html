the Police and the Courts take a variety of factors into account
to assess the flight risk of the accused. These include the gravity
of the offence, the extent of the accused person's roots in Singapore
and whether the person has attempted to abscond previously. Ultimately,
given that guilt is yet to be established by the Courts, a balance
has to be struck between ensuring that the accused person will be present
to face charges, and not unduly curbing his movement. </p>

the bail sum pledged by the surety may be forfeited. The Police
will arrest the wanted person if he is still in Singapore. In the
event that the accused person flees overseas, Police may issue an
INTERPOL Red Notice. Police forces in INTERPOL member states will
then help to locate and arrest the accused person. The wanted person
may then be extradited back to Singapore. Absconding from bail is
also an aggravating factor which could result in a higher sentence
when the accused person is later brought back to face charges against
him.</p>

Speaker, I thank the Second Minister for the assurance. There is
some disquiet amongst Singaporeans over the several incidents involving foreigners
injuring Singaporeans, and had absconded. I can empathise with the Singaporeans'
feeling of a sense of injustice and rage as guilty foreigners flee
after committing a crime. How may we strengthen the legal process,
including our courts system, to ensure that justice is done? May
I ask the Second Minister if he would consider tightening the Criminal
Procedure Code to prevent a repeat of future flight of probable
suspects involving crime of causing grievous hurt?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I believe the second point was an exhortation. I will deal
with the first, which was a question. Can we tighten the Criminal
Procedure Code (CPC) and what can be done? I would like to go back
to the point I made in my answer to re-emphasise it. Bail is an
important part of the criminal justice process that we have. In
establishing bail and conditions applicable to it, the Courts have
to reconcile two important considerations. On the one hand, it has
to ensure that the interest of the criminal justice system is served
and perpetrators brought to task. On the other hand, it also has
to respect the presumption of innocence and the right of free movement
of the individual until he or she is proven guilty. This is an important
process. The Police works with the prosecution to make sure all
the facts are brought before the Courts, so that the Courts can
make a full and informed decision on the matter. What it also means
is that in the process, there may be some instances where you may
have flight. The objective of the exercise is to minimise flight
risk so that we do not have such incidents. </p>

MHA continually review the process and we will also look at whether
the bail system and the CPC can be enhanced to tighten this specifically.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir,
in March this year, Deputy Prime Minister Teo informed the House
that the Police was conducting an internal inquiry to establish
the full facts of how the Suntec case was handled and whether there
were any lapses or negligence on the part of the officers handling
the case.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-92bb4f48-6b22-4658-b09d-5b3c4958835d">

its internal inquiry, and has charged the Investigation Officer
who handled the case with neglect of duty. A Letter of Warning has
also been issued to his supervisor.</p>

the lapse was due to the error of an individual rather than to any
systemic shortcomings. In general, the framework for the management
of investigations is sound. The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
require supervisors to conduct regular checks on investigations
and give directions, as appropriate, to ensure that there is progress.
If there is error or neglect in following established processes,
the responsible officers will be taken to task, as is evident in
this case.</p>

I thank the Second Minister for the update and clarification. I
am heartened to know that the Ministry is taking a very serious
view from a systemic point of view to make sure that the officers
discharge their duties responsibly and seriously. I would like to
ask a supplementary question, which is also related to the first
Parliamentary Question that hon Member, Mr David Ong, had asked. </p>

in light of foreigners who have caused hurt to Singaporeans and
who have absconded and jumped bail, would the Ministry consider putting
in as an SOP a mandatory impounding of passports, so that the accused,
though they have not been proven to be guilty, will remain in Singapore
until the judgement is made? Impounding their passports would not
restrict their freedom of movement in Singapore, but it would ensure
that when the Courts need them, or when the judgement is made, they
are in Singapore to receive the judgement. This is important in safeguarding
the safety and interests of Singaporeans who might have, inadvertently, become
victims of such unfortunate crime.</p>

First of all, our laws are quite clear – they are impartial in the
way they apply to all individuals who are within our jurisdiction.
Regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or alleged perpetrator
of the crime or the nationality of the victim, our laws apply equally.
I want to stress that.</p>

foreigners are not over represented in our crime statistics. Whilst
there may be some isolated cases which are highlighted, the fact remains
that it is generally not disproportionate. What we need to do is
to make sure that our systems and processes are well equipped to
deal with the challenges.</p>

idea that if a foreigner is charged – not convicted but charged
– with an offence that we make it mandatory to impound their passports.
As I have said, this is really a decision that we should leave to
the Courts, and not make it mandatory because there are so many
considerations here. The nature of the crime, the gravity of the
impact, the nature of the individuals' own ties to Singapore and,
most importantly and fundamentally, we have to strike that balance
between his or her right to freedom to move, especially before he
or she is judged or found to be guilty. That trade-off and that
judgement have to be left to the courts. What the Police and prosecution
do is to do their best to make sure all the facts are produced before
the courts so that the courts can make an informed decision.</p>

the Member's intent behind this, which is to ensure that we have
a more robust regime. That is why, as I mentioned earlier, we are
reviewing the processes, as we do from time to time. We will see
what else can be done to strengthen the framework and the procedures.</p>

a police officer in charge of this case with neglect. I wonder whether
he is able to elaborate at this stage and give us details of what

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State
for her comprehensive reply. My clarification, Sir, is borne out
of the great significance of these two historic sites. If one visits
them, one would be able to see <em class="ph i">Kempeitai</em> writings on the
walls of "Battle Box" and also a discussion leading to the surrender
of Singapore which is very important for our National Servicemen
to understand. Therefore, arising out of the 50% cost cap and the cap
of $100,000 for running costs, in my humble view, it is quite low,
especially given the important historical nature of the ammunition
dump in Labrador Park and the "Battle Box" at Fort Canning. Would
there be an open ness on the National Heritage Board or MICA's front
to raise that quantum? I have visited both sites and I have seen, unfortunately,
a depreciation in the quality of the experience over the last few
years, especially for visitors.</p>

Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to clarify. I think
I see two questions here. One is the quantum of the programme itself
and the other is the state of maintenance. I would like to clarify
to the House that for these two projects, we have been speaking
or discussing the possibility with the operators. So far, the operators
have not expressed any interest in tapping on the Government funds.
So, the issue about funding has not arisen, and has not been addressed
because we need to get them interested to want to co-invest with
us in this exhibition. The reason for the co-investment is that
we like to see private museum operators taking an interest in having a
stake in the site so that there is an investment, so that there
is an ownership of the exhibition.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you. I do not want to belabour the point,
I would like to ask a clarification on if there is no private operator
who is willing to do this, then it would be my humble view that
MICA does their bit and actually continues to keep these sites open,
notwithstanding a private operator not wanting to have a go of it
and not being able to make a profit out of it. If I am not mistaken,
the ammunition store in Labrador Park does not run tours anymore
unlike a few years ago. I hope that for military heritage's sake
in Singapore that these sites will be opened, notwithstanding private
operators not willing to operate them. </p>

an annual grant for TTFS, which is disbursed by Yayasan Mendaki

for eligible Malay students in IHLs. No deserving Malay student
will be denied a tertiary education because of financial difficulties. </p>

criteria which have taken effect this year will not affect Mendaki's
financial provision for TTFS. This is due to how the Government
grant is computed each year. In fact, the revised criteria means
that more Malay students are now
eligible compared to the past. Previously, only Malay students from
a family with a monthly household income of $3,000 and below qualify.
With the introduction of the per capita income in the new criteria,
Malay students in a typical four-member household with a monthly
income of $6,000 and below would now qualify. Mendaki expects about 7,000
new and existing students to apply for TTFS this year. </p>

Sir, the TTFS is a Government scheme, not a Mendaki scheme. At the
moment, it is restricted only to students doing undergraduate and
diploma courses in local institutions. Postgraduate funding – no
institutions actually fund this other than scholarships given by
the institutes. So, the TTFS is meant only for students studying
locally as undergraduates, and at the polytechnics.</p>

Sir, for the last four years or so, the number of Malay students
eligible for TTFS stands at about 2,200. As I mentioned in my reply,
we would expect the number to increase to about 7,000. Sir, let
me explain to the House that the scheme is actually quite benign
towards being in favour of the students rather than towards the
Government or Mendaki. If you are in the scheme, despite changes
to your family income, you continue to qualify. If you are out,
and there is a change in your family income and you qualify, you
will come in. So, the reason as to why the numbers will go up would
be simply because of students in the past who were not given the
TTFS under the old criteria, would now qualify under the new criteria
and they can apply. So, we expect many more students to qualify
for TTFS this year. This will have, obviously, an impact on the
reserves which I mentioned earlier that goes towards the EDF. </p>

has been somewhat constant in the last few years, the reserves that
we have been getting, in fact, have been coming down and they will come
down significantly this year because of the fact that many more
Malay students will qualify. As to whether or not this will impact
Mendaki's reserves, this matter is being studied very closely by
my staff. We have to wait until the new set of criteria is fully implemented
this year. By the end of this year we will have the complete numbers
for us to really understand its true impact, but initial calculations
show that there may be a chance that we have to dip into our reserves
in order to maintain our programmes. This is something in which
we have to study very carefully because our commitment to the community
is that all the programmes that we are implementing will continue
to be implemented because they are important for the community.</p>

Sir, as I have mentioned in my reply, the reason why we have undisbursed
funds is because the way the numbers are computed by the Government.
The Government looks at the number of Malay students, looks at the
total fees and then computes the total amount, but not all of them
will get the subsidy. The reason is very simple – the Government
wants to help Mendaki to run more programmes, and the money from
the undisbursed TTFS goes into Mendaki's Education Development Fund
to run other programmes which are extended to all Muslim students, and
not only to Malay students. In that way, Mendaki can run more programmes. </p>

Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for the
reply. From the financial reports of the two Integrated Resorts,
I understand that the profit of Marina Bay Sands (MBS), in terms
of EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation) between
the second quarter of 2010 and the first quarter 2012 – in just two
full years' of operation – is about US$2.6 billion or about S$3.3
billion. Similarly, Resorts World Sentosa's (RWS) profit, in terms
of EBITA between the first quarter 2010 and the first quarter 2012,
is also in the region of about S$3.3 billion. Quite a coincidence. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9268b44-0e5d-44f2-9ad6-b763df7b278a">

year are as strong as the first quarter this year, the total accumulated
profits, in terms of EBITA, will reach or exceed S$5 billion by
the end of this year. This means MBS would have recovered all its
initial investment of S$5 billion in less than three years. This
is far better than the prediction by the Sands' President which
was reported in <em class="ph i">The Business Times </em>on 31 May 2006, whereby
Sands expected to get its money back by 2017.</p>

                  </span>: Yes, Sir.
The two IRs have made very good profits and contributed to Singapore's
economy because of the tax they pay. In view of the above, I have
two supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Government consider persuading
the IRs to do more Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity
by helping the low-income group, especially those Singaporeans that
are affected financially and emotionally by their family members
who patronise the IRs? Secondly, would the Government consider channelling
the penalties paid by the IRs into a separate pool of fund, in the
event disciplinary actions are taken against the IRs, to help to
fund this same group of low-income people who are affected by gambling
ills? I would usually direct these questions to MCYS. Since the
Minister of State for Finance is taking care of this question now,
I hope she can answer us in a whole-of-Government approach [<em class="ph i">Laughter</em>].</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
I would also want to thank Mr Ang for expressing the concerns of
many Singaporeans with regard to problem gambling. Mr Ang has highlighted
the profitability of the Integrated Resort operators because of
the patronage of the casinos. I thought that perhaps, it would be
useful to highlight that in tandem with the increase in profitability,
the tax revenues that we collect from the casino operators have
also been quite considerable. And perhaps just to provide a sense
of perspective, in fact, the net increase in tax revenues from the
IRs was about $900 million for FY2010 and for FY2011, the figure
was about $1.1 billion. So, yes, the casino operators have made
more money but, at the same time, they have contributed to our tax
revenues. And through these tax revenues, the Government is able
to provide support for Singaporeans in many areas and expand our
resources, in terms of care, for Singaporeans. That is the first
point I want to make.</p>

Speaker, to say that actually his questions are going to be more
adequately addressed by MCYS. I would like to assure him that, in
fact, his questions which relate to whether we are doing enough
to deal with problem gambling are being looked at seriously. Now,
before I say more about that, Members will be familiar with the
stringent social safeguards that have already been put in place
to minimise the impact of casino gambling. Now, these include –
of course, not just the casino entry levy – but also the minimum
age limit of 21 years for entry into the casinos as well as Family,
Voluntary Self and Third-Party Casino Exclusions. For exclusions,
for example, there are about 93,000 exclusions that are currently
in force. In fact, two out of three exclusions are Self Exclusions.</p>

to contain gambling ills. This pale in comparison with the $1.1
billion of tax collected from the two IRs in 2011 and also the $93
million of casino entry levies that we collected for the first six

more funds to help the society to combat gambling ills.</p>

I would like to thank Mr Ang for raising the point again. If the
problem can be resolved by us putting aside more monetary resources,
that would be the easiest thing to do because we are not short on
the commitment to resourcing this set of measures and safeguards
that needs to be put in place. What we are, however, mindful of
is that it is not just putting aside the monetary resources. It
is really about identifying the interventions that will be most
effective and helpful in curbing the gambling addiction. I take
Mr Ang's point, and I would like to assure him that we will set
aside sufficient resources and the Government is committed to doing
so.</p>

work processes to suit the physical abilities and skills of an ageing workforce.
This will enable employers to be attractive to older workers in
this tight labour market. We will also continue to encourage companies
to adopt fair employment practices through the Tripartite Alliance
on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP). I would emphasise that especially
given the tight labour market, companies should seriously look at

Sir, I thank the Minister of State, for his response. I have three
questions. Would the Minister of State agree that the typical jobs
in which less educated or uneducated elderly Singaporeans are placed,
are usually physically demanding jobs like the cleaners in different
settings, either in their estates, in the public areas, in school
settings or food courts? Second question is, would the Ministry
consider proactively setting up a taskforce to look into creatively
developing different types of jobs for this age group either by
redesigning or ring-fencing some jobs so that they have more options,
other than the cleaner jobs that many of us refer them to? Third
question is, if that is acceptable, when can we expect some action
or deliverables that can be visibly felt on the ground for those
of us, and I am sure the Ministry too, who want to help this group?</p>

                  </span>: I
thank the hon Member for her concern. This is something that many
of us in this House share as we do meet residents who are older,
less educated and less skilled and who actually do want to find
jobs. Indeed, due to the profile of the older workers, we do find
that there are certain sectors that they tend to congregate in.
One of the areas that we have highlighted before, in terms of the
low-wage workers sector, we also do find older workers there, particularly
the cleaning sector as well as the security agencies. Having said
that, there are jobs available elsewhere as well – office jobs,
administrative jobs – depending on the skill levels. </p>

profile, but this is something that will change over time as education
levels have improved. With every corresponding passing of years,
you will have older Singaporeans who actually will be better skilled
and better educated. So, more jobs will be available. The challenge
really is dealing with the here and now. For the older workers today,
can we explore more jobs being created in other sectors, whether
by ring-fencing or redesigning to provide employment? This is something
that the Member has raised, and whether we should set up a taskforce
to look at it. We do encourage companies to look at redesigning
their work processes to encourage older workers to come back into
the job market. Having said that, a lot of these jobs probably may
not fit the profile of the older workers that she is talking about, but
if the Member has very specific ideas and initiatives that we should
pursue, this is something we can discuss further, to see whether
it is something feasible to explore, and whether the market could
end up creating more jobs in specific areas for this segment of
workers.</p>

I mentioned, I would appreciate it if we could follow up on this
discussion to understand what are the specific ideas that the Member
might have. We could explore whether it is something feasible. The
main priority right now is identifying workers who do need jobs,
and how do we match them. Her concern is whether they should have
more options beyond the cleaning jobs and the security jobs. Those
are perhaps more onerous. Whether we could create more of these
jobs, rather than the ones that she had described earlier. That
is something that we could discuss and we could take a look at whether
it warrants setting up a taskforce and a specific study on that
basis.</p>

I would like to ask the Minister of State what more can his Ministry

Currently, the issue is the supply side. What else can the Ministry
to get more employers to come forward to offer, not just the rank

                  </span>: Generally,
in terms of the effort that we have put in, both from the Government
encouraging the industries and companies and the response by the
companies themselves, we have seen, for example, the employment
rate for residents aged 55 to 64 actually rising to an all time
high, 61.2% in 2011. We foresee that the numbers would increase.</p>

in place include the Retirement and Re-employment Act that we have
just recently introduced this year. We do expect as a result of
that employment of older workers would rise across the board. We
have also enhanced the Special Employment Credit to provide further
incentives to companies to hire and retain older workers. We also
have incentives such as to create more age-friendly workplaces and
environments through the ADVANTAGE! Scheme. The Scheme will continue
to provide generous funding and support to help companies train
older workers, and redesign jobs and work processes at workplaces.
This is something that might be feasible to help older workers who
might be able to be retrained and to be upskilled to take on different jobs.
And for some of these companies to design the jobs so that they are
actually suitable for these older workers as well. Therefore, by
improving the fit between older workers and jobs, companies can,
we believe, also maximise productivity and at the same time, with
the tight labour market, continue to attract older residents who
are not working, into the workforce. </p>

for older workers to upgrade their skills, to remain employable.
The companies and low-wage workers can tap on the Workfare Training Support
Scheme which provides generous training subsidies. WDA also works
closely with tripartite partners in industries with a high proportion
of older workers to provide targeted training assistance and support
for older workers.</p>

effort. The issue at hand, coming back to Ms Denise Phua's earlier
point is whether for particular segments, especially the lower educated,
lower skilled older workers, these measures would have sufficient
impact. I believe there would be some impact. The question is, whether
we are able to, in a very comprehensive way, uplift these workers
so that in some sense we can open up the vista to better jobs rather
than the present ones that they are looking forward to. We can discuss
further and take a look at whether there are more concrete measures
we can carry out.</p>

to make sure that the measures we have in place are effective. We
are quite happy to take on suggestions and, more importantly, to
do the job placements so that those who want to work can find work.
The next question is, are we able to qualitatively improve the range
of work and jobs available? So that is something we can look at
and see whether there are practical measures we can put in place,
over and above what we have today.</p>

                  </span>: Flexible
work arrangements are an important means for employees to manage
both work and personal needs. Properly implemented, we believe that
flexible work arrangements can improve employee engagement and enhance
their sense of well-being
and provide flexibility all round. The provision of flexible work options
also avails employers to a larger pool of potential workers who
might otherwise find it difficult to join the workforce. This is
an important point to emphasise. We do know that there are people,
especially women after having the children, are looking to re-enter
the workforce but are also looking for flexible work arrangements.
Given the tight labour market, we do encourage employers to consider
adjusting the work arrangements to make it flexible so that you
can attract a portion of Singaporeans to come back into the labour
market. This can be mutually beneficial for both employers and employees.</p>

arrangements, the Government has in place a range of initiatives.
This includes funding assistance schemes, such as the Work-Life
Works! Fund, and Flexi-Works! Scheme, where employers receive Government
co-funding when they put in place flexible work arrangements that
would directly benefit their employees. These include professionals,
managers and executives. More than 840 companies and their employees
have benefitted from these two programmes so far, and we encourage
more companies to participate and come on board.</p>

has been working with the Employer Alliance, under the Singapore
National Employers Federation (SNEF), to organise more fora and
dialogue sessions to share effective work-life practices amongst employers.
The Employer Alliance is enhancing its Work-Life Tool Kit and developing more
case studies to better help employers recognise the value of enabling
work-life harmony for their workers, and at the same time, to implement
flexible work-life strategies. This year, the TriCom is also organising
the Work-Life Excellence Award to showcase employers who have put
in place good work-life practices and to encourage others to follow
suit. And many of these practices are indeed practical and replicable across

in Singapore, the Public Service is taking the lead in offering flexible
work arrangements to its officers. There are various schemes to
help public officers better balance their work and personal needs,
which can include looking after their parents, young children or
dependants. Many agencies have both flexi-time and flexi-place practices
that give officers options, in terms of how they carry out work alongside
their personal needs. The option of a reduced-hour work week is
also available to officers who are not able to take on a full work
load due to their personal commitments. These flexible working arrangements
complement the range of childcare and parental care leave that public
officers can tap on for their care-giving responsibilities. </p>

leveraged its Work-Life Network to build a culture of workplace
flexibility. The Network meets regularly to share good practices
and has fora and learning journeys to enhance capability in the
area of flexible workspace. In addition, the Public Service also

I would like to thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive
response. I have a supplementary question. I would like to mention that
I am also the Vice Chair of the NTUC Women's Committee. The NTUC
Women's Development Secretariat has been helping some 12,500 women
over the past five years to rejoin the workforce.</p>

is a tight labour market right now. Many of these jobs for the women
are rank and file jobs. I would like to also add that increasingly,
there are more demands for the PME jobs. We would like to ask the
Minister of State what more can be done, together with the tripartite
partners, to improve the situation. Although we have been encouraging
the companies but the take-up rate has not been as encouraging as we
had hoped. I would like to ask if there are any further plans to
look into providing a more holistic and flexible support for companies
to provide more flexible work arrangements for workers, including
the PMEs, and also to reduce the dropout rates from the workforce
and to retain the women within the workforce.</p>

ideas about new initiatives that we can put in place to incentivise

do note that in terms of trends, flexible work arrangements are
increasing. For example, as mentioned, the public service in a quite
significant way has been embracing it, and trying to encourage it.
It actually varies from sector to sector. A lot depends on the nature
of the jobs, whether it allows for flexible work arrangements. But
we do believe that there is still a lot of scope. For example, we
do know that in the F&amp;B industry in the developed countries,
there is a lot of part-time staff. And they surge the staff numbers during
peak hours, for example, during lunch time and dinner time. That
kind of flexible work arrangements encourages a lot of women to come
back into the workforce, who are looking at coming back to work,
but perhaps not looking at full-time work. We do not notice many
companies embarking on those practices here.</p>

the tightening labour market, we hope that that, in itself, would
incentivise companies to take that leap and to make that change.
The transition, I think, is not easy. Culturally, we have used to
operating on a particular basis for a very long time. We find that
along with other productivity efforts, there is sometimes a bit
of inertia in moving along those lines. The natural process will
come from the tightened labour market and companies would begin
to explore.</p>

is to actively promote this. We need to highlight companies that
have successfully implemented these practices in place, so that
other companies can realise that it is actually quite feasible and
to emulate it and to try it out. We do not have any other particular
initiatives right now. We have put in place a number of programmes
as highlighted earlier. We will be quite happy to take on board suggestions
from Members of this House and from the public as to whether there
are other measures that can be put in place. My sense is that as
the labour market tightens, and companies are beginning to feel
the effects, I would encourage companies to explore, for those that
can, flexible work arrangements for their staff.</p>

Thank you, Speaker, and to the Minister of State. I am very happy
to hear that you are open to new suggestions to encourage the hiring
of women and flexi-work arrangements. For a start, will the Ministry
consider having the public sector share the age profile and gender
profile of all the employees as an effort to encourage the hiring
of workers of all ages, all gender and the proportion or share of flexi-work
arrangements in the workforce?</p>

Mr Speaker Sir, MTI and our agencies promote and develop high value-add

Singaporeans, and to equip our local workers with the necessary
skills to seize these opportunities.</p>

work with various agencies – Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry
of Manpower (MOM), Workforce Development Agency (WDA) – to develop
the manpower and skills needed for our industries. First, we work
with MOE and MOM to align the curriculum in local educational institutions
with industry needs so that young job-seekers graduate with skills
that are in demand. Second, we work with MOM and WDA to put in place
training programmes so that our workers can continuously upgrade their
skills and take on higher skilled and higher-paying jobs. Third,
we work with companies and co-fund efforts, such as training schemes
and attachment programmes, to ensure the transfer of knowledge and
expertise to locals, particularly in new sectors and industries where
our workers may not initially have the relevant industry experience.</p>

for new jobs for Singaporeans. It would be too prescriptive and
inefficient to do so. However, we do set overall skilled job creation targets
for key clusters. For instance, in 2012, Economic Development Board
(EDB) expects to create between 18,000 and 21,000 skilled jobs.
Likewise, Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore
(IDA) also sets skilled job targets for the Infocomm sector. As
part of its Intelligent Nation 2015 Masterpan, IDA plans to boost
the number of infocomm jobs by 55,000 from 2005 to 2015. This approach
has worked well in helping Singaporeans secure the good job opportunities
created in the economy.</p>

2011, more than 75% of the Professional, Managerial, Executive and

jobs when the projects are fully implemented, and the majority of
these jobs will go to locals. Based on the Census of Manufacturing
Activity, more than seven in 10 skilled jobs in the manufacturing

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, in general, I would say that our overall economic strategy
is to move towards higher value-added activities, across all sectors.
So, even within sectors where we historically perhaps may have been
doing some lower value-added activities, EDB's efforts and, in general,
the MTI agencies' efforts, have moved us up the value chain to higher
value-added activities.</p>

an example, there used to be electronic contract manufacturing,
large scale, low margin, high volume kind of businesses. Over time, these
have been phased out, but instead, we have higher value-added activities
in the same sector. That includes micro-chip design, product design,
semi-conductor activities, and so on. I would say that as a broad
rule, we are moving in the direction of higher value-added activities
across all sectors. Some of the newer sectors we have targeted, such
as biomedical sciences, are examples of areas where there are also
opportunities to be had in terms of high value-added jobs.</p>

is to emphasise that it is not just in the new sectors, but even
in our existing sectors, there is hope to create good, high value-added
jobs for Singaporeans.</p>

                  </span>: Thank you,
Sir. Any person guiding tourists in Singapore for remuneration has
to be licensed by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). Licensing ensures
that tourist guides in Singapore are knowledgeable about our heritage, geography
and tourism offerings, and have the requisite language proficiency
and professional conduct. As at 31 May 2012, there were 2,312 licensed
tourist guides in Singapore. Ninety-six percent of these guides
were Singapore citizens or permanent residents. This proportion
has held steady since 2007. Many of the non-Singaporean guides are
guiding in foreign languages.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f6e3e29a-eb3c-47bc-b480-4fdf1f8f86b6">

of illegal guiding and takes enforcement action against unlicensed
activities. Unlicensed guides who are first-time offenders are issued
stern warnings in lieu of prosecution, and encouraged to undergo
proper training and licensing. Travel agents that engage such unlicensed
guides will be similarly warned if they are first-time offenders.
In addition, these travel agents will be required to implement measures
to ensure full compliance, and will also be subjected to closer scrutiny
by STB.</p>

guiding had not been high in the past: there were only 11 suspected
cases of unlicensed guiding out of all enforcement checks conducted between
2007 and 2010, with Singaporeans accounting for about half of these
cases. However, such activity has become more apparent in recent
years, which may be partly attributable to the rapid growth in our
visitor arrivals. For example, feedback to STB on unlicensed guiding

than doubled the frequency of enforcement checks, to 200 spot-checks
in 2011. In addition, STB has also mounted large-scale raids at
key tourist spots. Three such operations have been conducted since
2011, yielding a total of 152 suspect cases. To date, 38 individuals
and companies have been issued warning letters and advisories, with
locals and foreigners making up about an equal share of these first-time

some inherent limitations to STB's enforcement capabilities today,
which we are addressing. First, the provisions of the Tourist Guides
Regulations today
are defined quite narrowly, making detection and enforcement challenging. Second,
illegal guiding is neither a seizable nor compoundable offence.
This means offenders cannot be penalised on the spot, and foreign
offenders in particular may leave the country before investigations
are complete. Third, the current penalties for illegal guiding were
set in 1985 and we need to update them to maintain their deterrent
effect.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I thank the Member for her question. Firstly, I think it would
be wrong to assume that all unlicensed guides are foreigners. Indeed,
as I quoted from the statistics, it is roughly in equal proportions,
Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans or foreigners. So, we should bear
that in mind when we approach this. Secondly, on what number has
been displaced, I think it would be hard for me to guess because
it depends on factors that are unknown to us and we really do not
know how many are actually involved in this.</p>

of this, we need to be very clear that our objective is to make sure
that the tourism experience in Singapore is an authentic one for
the visitors. Therefore, we want to ensure that, by and large, Singaporeans
and permanent residents are the ones who are providing this – specifically
Singaporeans, because they would have the experience, the knowledge
and the feel for the country, which is what tourists seek when they
visit a country. I think that is our primary objective. But I cannot
quantify the displacement effect simply because it would be difficult
to do so. We really do not know what is out there other than what
is revealed by our enforcement statistics.</p>

I am glad that the Second Minister shared earlier that his Ministry
is considering more deterrent penal sanctions against unlicensed
guides, including even considering whether to make the offence seizable.
I have two supplementary questions: firstly, in this enhancement
of the enforcement provisions, whether it also extends to meting
out penalties to travel agents who hire these unlicensed guides.
Secondly, STB – as what the Second Minister mentioned – in stepping
up enforcement, has its limitations. Has STB considered outsourcing
some of these enforcement functions? And if so, may I also suggest
that those outsourced to conduct their enforcement checks should
have the relevant experience in detecting these unlicensed guides
because it is an industry which is quite unique and it is not easy to
detect. As what the Minister has said earlier, I hope his Ministry
or STB does work closely with the NTUC's Tourist Guide Chapter in
the detection and prevention of these unlicensed guides.</p>

his questions and suggestions. I omitted in my earlier response
to address a point raised by the Member Dr Lily Neo, on the timing
for the introduction of measures. There is a quite range of issues
that we have to deal with, so it will take us time. The intention
is really to review and progressively introduce the measures. The
sooner we can, and where we can move faster, we will do so. Then,
there will be other elements which may require perhaps changes in
regulation or legislation, in which case it may take a bit longer.
Overall, I expect that in the next 12 to 18 months, perhaps a bit
longer for some of the provisions, we should be able to address
some of them.</p>

about whether we will enhance the enforcement provisions, and to
address travel agents as well, the answer is "yes". It will be a comprehensive
look at the range of issues and the stakeholders in the industry.
I want to inform Members that, today, the regime is such that we
do have penalties against those who are illegal tour guides, those
who are employing illegal tour guides and the travel agents as well,
that is, the companies, the body corporate. The penalties range from
fines to, in the case of travel agencies, even imprisonment and
revocation or suspension of their licence.</p>

STB is outsourcing its functions. In fact, today, STB already outsources
its enforcement activities. The key here is to make sure that we
are adequately and well resourced, and the enforcement is well targeted
to ensure it yields the best outcomes. And I take the Member's point
that we will continue to work every closely with the industry and
other stakeholders to address some of these issues.</p>

there is an opportunity for different types of jobs in the sector,

Sir, l thank the Member for the opportunity to clarify this point.
The process is a simple and straightforward one, which is equally
applicable to whether you are a Singaporean, PR or foreigner. Essentially,
first, you have to undertake a course which is conducted by two
approved entities – one is the Tourist Management Institute of Singapore
and the other is the Singapore Chinese Chamber Institute of Business
– if I remember correctly. They conduct the courses, and typically
these are part-time courses which take about six months. Thereafter,
they have the aspiring tour guides take a multi-choice question
test, and then they have to take a simulated practical as well,
where they will be judged for their competence. In the case of a
Singaporean, he or she can then proceed to apply for their tour
guide licence from STB.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5a9ef088-5f07-46e6-b3f9-b132426a24ab">

is a foreigner, he or she will also have to secure employment with
a travel agent who will then have to get the appropriate clearances from
MOM before the individual is licensed as a tour guide for Singapore.
So, there is actually an additional hurdle when it comes to a foreign
tour guide; otherwise the rules are all the same.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Teo Chee Hean</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, many
European countries are addressing their population challenges by
pursuing a mix of pro-parenthood and immigration policies. Nordic countries
such as Sweden, Denmark and Norway have relatively high Total Fertility Rates
(TFR) of between 1.88 and 1.98. These countries have a broad array
of pro-parenthood measures such as good childcare systems, generous
leave provisions and financial
support for child raising costs. We have been studying their policies
in the course of developing ours.</p>

may vary across countries due to differing cultural and socio-economic
conditions. The Nordic countries have higher Government spending
on pro-parenthood measures, but they also have significantly higher
tax rates. The personal income tax rates in the Nordic countries
range from 29% to 63%, and most people pay income tax there, compared
to Singapore's personal income tax rates which range from 3.5% to
20%. In fact, most Singaporeans do not pay income tax because the income
level at which our income tax kicks in is quite high.</p>

vary between different countries. I mentioned that in Sweden, Denmark
and Norway, the range is between 1.88 and 1.98. Among other European countries,
such as Germany and Italy, they vary between 1.39 and 1.41. Germany
is 1.39, Italy is 1.41. The US has a TFR of 1.93. So, it is not
so easy to relate directly the policies or the amount of expenditure
to the TFR because there are many other factors at work. </p>

though, in the Nordic countries which do have a higher TFR of 1.88
to 1.98. A high proportion of births are to women who are not married
to the father of the child. This is one main difference between
their TFR and those of other countries at similar levels of development.
Based on OECD reports, out-of-wedlock births made up about half
of all births in Sweden, Denmark and Norway in 2010. In contrast,
Asian societies, including Singapore, continue to value having children
within the context of marriage. Creating a supportive environment
for Singaporeans to form families and raise children remains a key
Government priority. </p>

Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister
for the comprehensive answer. Definitely we are not encouraging
more births out of wedlock. A good childcare system is very important.
I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether there would
be more support given for childcare centres because there is a lot
of feedback that there are insufficient childcare centres, and also the
fees have gone up tremendously over the last few months.</p>

I think Er Dr Lee is quite correct, childcare is one of those issues
which have consistently been identified by young parents as an issue, which
if we could make more accessible, more affordable, would be helpful
to them. There are already currently childcare subsidies. The Baby
Bonus is there and it can be used for that. The Child Development
Account is also used by many of the parents to help to defray the
cost of childcare. Sir, in fact, childcare is one of the main ways
in which the Child Development Account is used today. But we are
looking at this issue again to see whether there are areas that
we can improve on.</p>

I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the extensive reply. Will
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) consider extending paid maternity
leave, or better still, having paid parental leave, for both mothers
and fathers? Because if you look at the Nordic countries, or even
the European countries, such as Germany, Sweden and Norway, their
paid parental leave is more than 40 weeks for both parents compared
to our 16 plus three days.</p>

is talking about parental leave, not maternity leave? Maternity
and parental leave – yes. The last we looked at maternity leave,
we were very careful because there was also another group of persons
who were very concerned that this would impact upon the employability
of women. That was a fairly large area of concern. We wanted to
make sure that we did not, through making maternity leave provisions
more generous, impact on women being employed – as a result of which
it would be harder for women to be employed. That is not what we
want to have happen as well. And that is why we have this balance
where the one additional month of the maternity leave is actually
paid for by the Government. </p>

a very controversial question of the Deputy Prime Minister. Would he consider "Baby
Drop", since Malaysia is doing that and we are having this population
problem of not having enough babies? And since the child is born from
God's love and not the fault of the parents, is it possible that
the Deputy Prime Minister would consider a "Baby Drop" for Singaporeans
to drop their babies off in cases where the child is born out of
wedlock? </p>

Sir, I think this is – as Mrs Chiam says – a controversial area.
We must be very careful when we implement such measures whether
or not we end up inadvertently encouraging unwanted pregnancies
and births, and causing greater problems as a result. So, I think
we need to be very careful about this. </p>

Sir, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his response. My supplementary
question is with regard to the strategies that Singapore employs.
Irrespective of marital status, just looking at a whole country's
statistics, can Singapore not continue to model after the Nordic
countries in terms of employing strategies that could also work
in Singapore? Irrespective of how we calculate the statistics, whether
it is birth out of wedlock or within the family context? </p>

been talking about the statistics, comparing the Nordic countries
and Singapore, and how the main difference is in calculations. I
mean the Nordic countries count out-of-wedlock births as legitimate
births, whereas in Singapore we are looking at encouraging baby-making
within the family structure. What I am trying to say is, can we
not look at models across the board and strategies that have worked
in Nordic countries in any case?</p>

are certainly looking at that, but we have to be very careful. I
raised the issue of marriages out of wedlock only because we have
to be careful about how we implement the measures. There may be
collateral side effects. There are major cultural differences. When
we look at the urbanised East Asian societies – Japan, Taiwan, Hong
Kong – they also have low fertility rates. They have also tried
measures of various kinds. While we will certainly look at all these
measures, we have to be careful of the collateral side effects,
the unintended side effects on our society. And we also have to
be realistic about what we can achieve.</p>

Sir, two supplementary questions for the Deputy Prime Minister.
These are proposals which I have raised several times over the last
few years. The first one is concerning a group of people who want
to have children but for various reasons are unable to. IVF – can
we do more for them? I know we are already extending some subsidies.
Could these be further increased because this is the group of couples
who want to have children?</p>

question is something very uncontroversial. It is relating to paternity
leave. I have argued several times in the House, I have been pushing
to legislate paternity leave. I recognise the other angles, the
business costs of it. But I think we should make a start somewhere,
and legislating it even for as short as one day. It is an important
signalling effect from the Government. After all, all of us recognise
that parenting is a shared responsibility by both the mother and
the father. Having talked to many residents, young couples, many
of them have cited that paternity leave is something that is important
to the family. I believe it is important to push that and allow our TFR to go up. I
hope the Deputy Prime Minister would consider these two suggestions. </p>

Sir, I thank Mr Baey Yam Keng for his supplementary question and
for giving us this opportunity to clarify. The textbook review process
was adhered to in the production of the history textbook, <em class="ph i">The
Living Past</em> – <em class="ph i">History of Ancient India, China and Southeast
Asia,</em> second edition. It was pointed out that there is an error
in this textbook on the use of the term "<em class="ph i">shi</em>" to refer to
a group of landowners in China's feudal system. Let me clarify that
no Chinese character was used in the textbook. Instead, the <em class="ph i">hanyu
pinyin</em> "<em class="ph i">shi</em>" was used.</p>

when the person who spotted this, translated and interpreted "<em class="ph i">shi</em>"
as in the Chinese character "<em class="ph i">boshi</em>" ("博士"). Our consultations
with the authoritative sources have revealed conflicting interpretations
and translations of "<em class="ph i">shi</em>" which could either be "<em class="ph i">shi</em>"
("士") as in "<em class="ph i">boshi</em>"("博士"), or as in the other character "<em class="ph i">shi</em>"
("氏") as in "<em class="ph i">xingshi</em>" ("姓氏"), the latter referring to a broad
category of nobility, including landowners. This latter usage of
the word "<em class="ph i">shi</em>" is an ancient usage and it is not commonly
used today. Although the textbook presentation of "<em class="ph i">shi</em>" could
be retained, to prevent
further confusion, MOE has decided that the word would be amended

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, in January, I delivered a
Ministerial Statement in this House on the service disruptions that
took place along the North-South Line on 15 and 17 December 2011.
More than 200,000 commuters were affected and the severity of the
incidents was unprecedented. </p>

was convened on 29 December, led by Chief District Judge Tan Siong
Thye, with two other members, Prof Lim Mong King and Mr Soh Wai Wah.
It was tasked to investigate the causes of the disruptions, as well
as other factors that might have contributed to them. Based on the
findings, the Committee would make recommendations to minimise the
recurrence of similar incidents, and improve the management of such
incidents. </p>

my deep appreciation for the Committee's hard work. The inquiry
was demanding and challenging, given the technical nature of the
issues. Prior to the start of public hearings, the Committee had
to expend time and effort to equip itself with contextual and technical
information in preparation for the inquiry. The public hearings
started on 16 April, and lasted six weeks, concluding on 25 May.
During this time, a total of 116 witnesses were called to the stand. </p>

members, I must also thank the team that supported the Committee,
including but not limited to its secretariat, resource persons,
officers from the Attorney-General's Chambers, and investigators
from the Criminal Investigation Department

who testified at the inquiry, including expert witnesses, LTA and
SMRT senior management and staff, as well as members of the public.
Without them, the inquiry would not have been successfully completed. </p>

LTA too fell short. I will also speak about the improvements that
LTA must make, particularly with regard to how it regulates the
public transport operators. </p>

immediate cause of the stalling of the trains in both incidents
was damage to their Current Collector Device (CCD) shoes, due to
contact with a sagging third rail. The third rail, or power rail,
runs along the MRT tracks and supplies electrical current to the
running trains, which draw this power through the shoes mounted
on the trains. During both incidents, sections of the third rail
were found to have sagged and multiple claws dislodged. These claws
are a key component of Third Rail Support Assemblies (TRSAs), which
hold the third rail above the track. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6f91298e-e72f-4349-ae55-91f788d0612e">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-6f91298e-e72f-4349-ae55-91f788d0612e"><!--a--></a>The incident on 15 December
was initiated by a defective fastener on one of the TRSAs. This
caused the claw of that TRSA to dislodge and the third rail to sag.
Although trains continued to pass the sag, it rendered the two adjacent
TRSAs more vulnerable to vibration. Over time, these two TRSAs,
which insulators were coincidentally also defective, failed gradually.
By the evening of 15 December, the third rail sag had gone beyond
the tolerance limits of the trains' shoes, damaging the CCD shoes
on trains passing the incident site. Some trains stalled after passing
the site as they were no longer able to draw sufficient power from
the third rail. At the incident site, multiple trains impacting
the sagging third rail eventually caused three more claws to dislodge, such
that a stretch of the third rail came to rest on the track-bed.
This segment of the track then became impassable to all trains.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-385a8dc8-0d88-4069-ba75-74f65bbdefc4">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-385a8dc8-0d88-4069-ba75-74f65bbdefc4"><!--a--></a>The COI attributes the incident
on 17 December to one, or possibly more, "rogue train(s)" that suffered
CCD shoe damage when they passed the 15 December incident site as
the third rail there was progressively sagging. The damaged shoes
of these rogue trains destabilised the third rail system at other
locations along the North-South Line on 16 December, causing one
third rail claw on the south-bound track between Newton and Orchard
stations to dislodge and the third rail to sag. On 17 December morning,
there was a train, which was traced to Train 119, that made unusually
forceful contact with the third rail at the incident site, causing
an adjacent claw to also dislodge. And now, with two adjacent claws
dislodged, the third rail sagged further, and caused damage to the CCD
shoes of this Train 119 and the trains that passed after it. Some
of these trains subsequently stalled as they were no longer able
to draw sufficient power.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c720b58a-8c99-43e1-94f4-c302d7e9c4e1">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-c720b58a-8c99-43e1-94f4-c302d7e9c4e1"><!--a--></a>On incident management, the COI recognised
the complex challenges that SMRT and LTA faced on the two days,
given the trying and unprecedented circumstances. While commuter
safety was not compromised, there were lapses and gaps in the management of
the incidents. Individual SMRT staff generally did their best, but
the overall incident response was skewed towards train safety and
operational considerations, resulting in insufficient attention
to the well-being of passengers in stalled trains and stations. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-22c6cf8d-99a7-484c-a310-3d76a5f13f26">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-22c6cf8d-99a7-484c-a310-3d76a5f13f26"><!--a--></a>The COI's key conclusion
is that the incidents were preventable, had adequate maintenance
measures and checks been carried out. The COI found shortcomings
in SMRT's maintenance work culture, and in its overall maintenance
and monitoring regime. In particular, the COI agrees with the expert
witnesses that the material defects in the fastener and insulators
likely took time to develop before the 15 December incident. However,
they were regrettably not identified and remedied by SMRT's maintenance
efforts. After the first incident on 15 December, SMRT's checks,
including the checks done after MRT operations the following night
− so they had two night windows − failed to detect the damaged CCD
shoes on the rogue trains and the third rail sag. This allowed the
17 December incident to take place.</p>

House through the COI's key recommendations to improve MRT reliability.
Let me assure Members that we will follow through on all the recommendations.
SMRT and LTA have already implemented or decided to implement many
of the recommendations, while some others require further feasibility
study. SMRT has given its initial response last week on how it is
already improving its maintenance and monitoring regime and work
processes. LTA, as the MRT regulator, will provide its detailed
response later today. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2dae1658-306d-478f-b2e1-fad47f2ec697">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-2dae1658-306d-478f-b2e1-fad47f2ec697"><!--a--></a>The COI has made a number
of recommendations specifically on the third rail system as this
was the source of the problem in the December disruptions. We need
to avoid a situation where we have two or more adjacent claw drops,
as the third rail will then sag beyond the tolerance limit of the
CCD shoes. This means that we must identify third rail sags and
fix the sags in a timely manner. In this regard, SMRT has accepted
the COI's recommendation to enhance the maintenance regime for the
third rail system. Full maintenance requirements in the original
MRTC maintenance manual, which includes annual TRSA inspections,
will be implemented. Non-destructive tests such as ultrasound scanning
have already been carried out at vulnerable stretches of the third rail,
to pick out cracks on third rail joints. LTA and SMRT are reviewing
the upgrading of SMRT's current Multi-Function Vehicle (MFV). The
review will be completed by August this year, at which point SMRT
will call for tender to upgrade the MFV. A new MFV will be acquired
on top of this current MFV. In the meantime, the MFV that is deployed
on the Circle Line will be redeployed for use also to the North-South
and East-West Lines (NSEWL). </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-449f352f-c574-4ded-ab7a-6e707caa36f8">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-449f352f-c574-4ded-ab7a-6e707caa36f8"><!--a--></a>SMRT will explore capabilities
to detect third rail sags via the installation of sensors on selected
trains. Installation and testing of this mode are expected to begin
by the end of this month. In addition, SMRT will study a camera-based
system so that the third rail can be monitored on a real-time basis.
As an interim measure, SMRT will implement stainless steel capping
on TRSAs with cable ties at higher-risk areas such as high speed ramps
of tight turn-outs. This will further reduce the likelihood of claw
dislodgements. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e64c6a7a-b8e0-4174-91c3-5f64685752b9">

that the design of the TRSAs be reviewed. Those in the older parts
of the NSEWL are over 20 years old. There are now better and more robust
designs which have more effective locking features. SMRT will undertake
a change-out programme
for the older TRSAs on the NSEWL. Fifth generation claws will be
installed on the sections of Floating Slab Tracks (FST), where several
of the dislodged claws were found in December. This will be completed
by August. Thereafter, the current speed restrictions that we have
imposed on these segments since the incidents last December will
be progressively lifted. In addition, SMRT and LTA will continue
to study plans to replace TRSAs for the rest of the network, and
make a final recommendation on the type of TRSA that will be used
before the end of the year. </p>

also contributed to the December incidents, in particular, severe
vibrations caused by wheel defects. SMRT will monitor the condition
of train wheels through the use of a Wheel Impact Loading Detection
(WILD) system which automatically picks up wheel defects. This system
is already in place on the Circle Line today. It will be implemented
on the compass lines by December. In addition, SMRT will procure
additional wheel lathes for wheel re-profiling to rectify wheel
defects. To monitor all this, LTA will require the MRT operators
to introduce formal processes to track indicators and analyse faults,
including the number of trains in queue for wheel profile works.
LTA and SMRT will also study the COI's recommendations to improve
the maintenance regime for CCD shoes, and to explore means to detect
defective shoes.</p>

specific components, the COI has emphasised the need for SMRT to
strive for maintenance excellence. SMRT has assured me that it will improve
its maintenance and monitoring regime. I understand that it is already
taking steps to enhance its engineering and maintenance capabilities
and resources, and that it has put in place a more robust maintenance
regime overall. </p>

the regulator. Sir, it is the responsibility of LTA as the regulator
to hold the operator accountable for delivering a reliable system
for commuters. LTA fell short in this regard. It must do better.
LTA must re-look how it can better fulfil its duties as the regulator.
It must work with and also supervise more closely the operator,
and strengthen its regulatory framework. </p>

of the compass lines have been in operation for some 25 years. Given
these ageing assets and the added strain of increased ridership,
the quality and robustness of the maintenance regime, especially
preventive maintenance, become even more critical. Rather than relying
on a corrective approach to rectify problems, we must adopt a systems
approach towards maintenance to pre-emptively identify potential
areas of concern. </p>

will therefore need to work even closer than before, on key preventive
maintenance and upgrading plans, starting with the NSEWL, but eventually
extending this same approach to all other lines as they too will
age. </p>

both LTA and SMRT to set up a Joint Team, comprising engineering
and maintenance experts from both sides, to look into reducing disruptions and
enhancing the reliability of the compass lines.</p>

me twice on its findings and recommendations. They plan to reduce
the number of train service withdrawals by 30% by 2013, to adopting
a systems-based preventive maintenance approach and tackling key
areas like, for example, the pneumatic compressors, the propulsion
systems, and the brake control units of different generations of
trains. The Joint Team has also identified additional areas of improvement,
including systematic upgrading and replacement of infrastructure
and operating assets. This illustrates LTA's evolving role. While
LTA in the past would have largely left it to the operator to decide
on what components to change-out as part of mid-life upgrading of
the trains, LTA will henceforth jointly work with the operator on
critical aspects of such upgrading programmes. </p>

with the operators, the LTA will also strengthen its regulatory
framework. LTA's regulatory approach in the past has been outcome-based, with
selective intervention on safety-critical aspects. Going forward,
its regulatory framework will be enhanced to be more prescriptive
and also to exercise greater oversight on areas that affect reliability
and commuter comfort. </p>

effective oversight over the train operators' maintenance and operations,
LTA will require operators to track certain indicators so that early detection
of problems and timely preventive actions can take place. This includes indicators
such as the Mean Time between Failure (MTBF) of train propulsion
and braking systems, incidents of dropped claws, misaligned third
rails, and the number of trains in queue for wheel re-profiling
works. These will give the regulator a better sense of the operator's
maintenance efforts. In addition, the operators will be required
to submit to LTA trend analyses and improvements plans with specific
timelines to arrest and reverse faults. </p>

that LTA impose a requirement on SMRT to conduct a Maintenance Management
System audit, to identify areas of possible improvement in their
maintenance regime. I fully agree. LTA will require SMRT to engage
independent experts to audit their maintenance processes every three
years. I have also asked SMRT and LTA to work with and consult their
counterparts overseas who have to operate and regulate older MRT
systems, to see what preventive measures we should put in place, and
what useful lessons we can learn from them.</p>

the COI has called for greater clarity in the roles of stakeholders,
and for improved coordination between stakeholders; improvements
to various aspects of the incident management plan with an emphasis
on the well-being of passengers; and ensuring incident management
readiness. LTA and SMRT have taken steps to address the gaps and
the lapses that were identified with regard to incident management
even prior to the release of the COI report. And I am confident
that both parties are better equipped today than they were a year
ago to handle similar incidents. </p>

the lead to better integrate stakeholders' and transport emergency

Since the December incidents, LTA has worked with the operators
to harmonise their incident classification levels to be consistent
with LTA's. This ensures that appropriate support from all parties is
rendered in accordance with incident severity. LTA will continue
to review and refine these plans, and robustly test these against
realistic exercises and challenging scenarios. </p>

improve the incident management plan with an emphasis on passenger

were looking into the improvement of contingency plans for train
service disruptions, particularly with regard to bus bridging services
and the improvement of communication to in-train commuters and to
the general public. Since then, LTA has worked with the operators
to provide regular bus services free of charge at designated points
nearest to affected stations in the event of an extended MRT service
disruption, to improve signages at the stations, and to develop
more robust and comprehensive station-level plans to deal with such
incidents. </p>

key aspects of incident management such as incident reporting by

via regular and comprehensive announcements, the detrainment of
passengers from stalled trains, and bus bridging services. The introduction
of a COP relating specifically to incident management signals its
importance and will raise standards of incident management. Beyond
the COP, the rail operators will now be required to seek approval
from LTA for their Rail Incident Management Plan (RIMP). </p>

to look into the causes of the December disruptions and to make
recommendations to minimise the recurrence of such incidents, as
well as how on future incidents should be managed. The COI has delivered
on their Terms of Reference, and done so in a manner which is open,
transparent, and fair in allowing for due process. This also means
that it is to be expected that the parties involved will hire good
lawyers and credible experts as part of the inquiry processes. More
importantly, I believe that the COI has taken an objective, fact-based
and thorough approach in its inquiry, with a clear emphasis on being
constructive and forward-looking. MOT is satisfied that the Committee
has met its objectives and our expectations. </p>

enabled us to get to the root of what happened on 15 and 17 December
as best as we can, given that unfortunately, some of the information
was not preserved or available by the time the Committee started
its work. We will therefore have to implement more effective forensic
investigation procedures as recommended by the COI, so that we can
learn useful lessons whenever we have significant incidents and
disruptions. Nonetheless, as a result of the COI's thorough and
systematic work, we now know much more about the vulnerabilities

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I thank Mr Cedric Foo for that excellent question. Let me first
of all talk about some of what SMRT is doing. I think when both
the chairman and the interim CEO talk about re-engineering the company,
I am very much heartened by the fact that it is not just about re-jigging
the organisational structure but putting a renewed emphasis on engineering,
maintenance and its role in providing an essential public service. </p>

this is felt on the ground. When I visited SMRT, talked to the people
on the ground, the people doing the maintenance and operating the
systems, they too sensed that there was that renewed emphasis on
engineering. And I urge SMRT to continue this because ultimately
it is, I think, the culture of the organisation that will set the
direction and for the team thereafter to effect these changes. </p>

its regulatory role seriously. It tries to strike a judicious balance
between being the designer and developer of the MRT system as well
as regulating the system. In that sense, I think it has done reasonably
well in both. </p>

emphasis had been on an outcome-based approach, and the focus had
been on safety-critical aspects. And it has realised that it needs
to do more in this regard, not only working in closer cooperation
with the operators on an ongoing basis but also to revise the regulatory
framework to pay more attention to not only the safety-critical aspects
but also to reliability-critical aspects and commuter comfort. There
are also other regulatory changes that I have mentioned, and on
which LTA will provide greater detail later. And I believe that,
overall, this will strengthen the regime within LTA. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for his
comprehensive explanation. I have two broad questions: first, the focus
on the PTOs that has arisen from this incident; and, secondly, how
much leverage LTA has over them. First question – we have seen from
the report that there have been shortcomings in the maintenance
work culture and the COI recommended that SMRT focus on being an
engineering company, which suggested that it was not really focused on
that before. So, is this due to the setup of the structure of this
system where there is a focus on making profits rather than engineering,
which is a cost centre? Engineering is the cost centre for SMRT
at this point of time and it will be for the foreseeable future. Second
question – what leverage does LTA have over the operators? The Minister mentioned
that there are plans to increase the fines and there are also plans
to work together more with the operators and have more performance
metrics. Besides all these things, I think underlying the whole
thing is just the fines that are going to be increased. Is there
any other leverage that LTA has over the operators to ensure that
they do what they are supposed to do?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. Let me deal with
the second one first, which is on the leverage. In addition to working
with them, fines and so on, there is also the issue of a licence.
What happens is that we have a licence that is for a limited duration.
For the North-South-East-West Lines (NSEWL), the licence expires
in 2028. </p>

than one operator in the system, we do have – as we had done for
the Downtown Line earlier last year – the possibility of putting
out the lines for tender and getting the best offer from potential
operators to run these lines. So, it is not as if SMRT will be able
to run these lines indefinitely. They have a licence. The licence
is for a fixed duration and it will be up for renewal. In the very
extreme situation, of course, if they are egregious in breaching
the licence conditions, then LTA can take other actions against
them, based on the licence conditions.</p>

question which is on the focus of the operators, because I think
that is a fair question to ask. They have to find the balance between
being a commercial entity as well as being an engineering company
that provides an essential public service. The COI – and I agree
with them – felt that going forward, the SMRT needed to pay more
attention to the engineering aspects. Has there been an over-emphasis
on the commercial aspects and should we strip it out from the operator altogether?
That probably is the gist of the question. If I could continue the
discussion from yesterday on buses and extend it to trains now –
and we look at what is happening in different parts of the world
– back to this issue of whether public transport should be nationalised?
Should it be single operator concentrating solely on not the commercial parts,
but the engineering and delivering the service? I think you will
find that there are different models. The two models that I thought
maybe worthy of bringing to the attention of the Members of the
House is that adopted by London tube and the New York subway. Both
of these systems are run by nationalised entities that focus only
on the delivery of the essential service. I do not think it is in
our interest to emulate the outcomes or the standards that are provided
by both the London tube and the New York subway.</p>

have a profit motive in the equation, it actually engenders certain
behaviours in the operators that require them to be more efficient,
to be more productive. And when a new licence comes up or the existing
licence comes up for tendering, they have to put in the best possible
bid, as we have seen for the Downtown Line. There is that pressure
on them to be efficient and that is a helpful ingredient that I
would like to see in our public transport network. </p>

is not the debate of whether SMRT should stop its retail business,

it is not to do away with the retail or the commercial sensibilities

on the second point that the Member mentioned with regard to bandwidth, and
where SMRT is focusing its orientation, that is indeed a very valid
point. At the end of the day, just like LTA, with the need to balance
between being a designer, developer and a regulator, likewise, the
operators will also need to balance their dual roles. In that sense,
it is a fair point and we will need to constantly remind both the
management as well as the board that they should not pay undue attention

Sir, I noted that the Minister has worked hard in response to the
December incidents. I have two clarifications. One is I wonder whether the
profit nature of the operators, which forces them to look after
the bottom line, has resulted in the consequence of a lack of focus
in the maintenance. Secondly, I would like to seek clarification
on incident management. The Minister earlier said that there is
now a new incidence classification system that is in sync with both
the SMRT and the LTA. I would like to know what the new classifications
are and what happened in the past. I also understand that there
is now a new code of practice on incident management. So, may I
know what can commuters expect if the December incidents were to
happen again?</p>

                  </span>: I thank
the Member for the questions. Like I said, we really do need from
time to time to review and to re-orientate where the balance is:
for the regulator, balancing between designing and developing and
regulating; for the operators, balancing between the commercial
and the engineering aspects. This is something that we have the
commitment from SMRT to look into. </p>

of the management team, especially at the senior level as well as
the culture of the organisation. Over time, the culture shifts. It
will take time, I think, for the culture of the organisation to
shift towards paying a lot more attention on the engineering as
well as the maintenance aspects. </p>

to the people on the ground, those who are really directly working
on the systems, what we find is that the management team is paying
far more attention, going down to the ground and understanding some
of the issues, the challenges that they face, the resources that
they need to support it. </p>

on incident classification: in the past, the SMRT used a six-level
classification whereas the LTA used a three-level classification.
So, you can imagine that sometimes, there is not a lot of clarity
between the six different levels, nor a lot of alignment between
the six and the three. After the December incidents, LTA has worked
with both the operators to make sure that we have a common alignment,
a harmonisation of the incident classification systems. It is important
that we can not only communicate clearly between the operators and
the regulator but also reach out to the other stakeholders like
TransCom, SCDF and other agencies that might be able to provide
support. </p>

before the December incidents, there was already an SOP, where the
operator could draw on support from all these stakeholders. It is
not as if, prior to December, there was no such mode of requesting
for help and support. It is just that after December, there is a
clearer harmonisation and, hopefully, less confusion of the different
roles and responsibilities going forward. </p>

and what commuters can expect to have: one thing we require them
to look at is their detrainment procedures to make sure that the
decision is taken in a more timely manner, that passengers are not
kept in the train without knowing what is happening and not too
long a time is taken before the detrainment processes start. That
is one of the areas. Two, is that we require announcements to be
made, not only at the station that is affected by the incident,
but across the entire line and over the whole network as well as
to make sure that the general public is properly informed, especially
if it is a severe incident. There are some of these different measures
and processes that are spelt out as well as, of course, the free
bus bridging services and what the stations ought to do better in
terms of preparing themselves for such incidents. </p>

for his statement. It is significant that the LTA has been deemed
to have fallen short, and that there will be legal penalties meted
out to SMRT. My question relates to what sort of penalties will
there be for the LTA. We have a classic question now of who regulates

                  </span>: I thank
the Member for the question. If I take it at a deeper level, I guess
that it is really a question of whether we should have a separate
entity altogether to look at the regulatory aspects, separate from
what LTA is doing. It comes back to the question of whether we are
better off dividing the limited expertise into two organisations
or to house them centrally. Within the LTA today, we have made clear
a separation between the design, the development arm and the regulatory
arm, even though
they are housed under the same organisation. Part of it is really
because we think that there is a great deal of value in making sure
that the people who have had some experience in design, development
and the building of the system are able, for some of them, to transit
into the regulatory arm and therefore spend enough time there before they
move back to developing a new line or a new network altogether. </p>

of the Ministry to make sure that LTA performs as we expect of it,
both in designing, developing, delivering the new networks that
we have planned, rolling them out on time and safely, as well as
regulating the operators to make sure that they deliver on the standards
that we expect of them. This includes the operating performance
standards, the incident management, as well as the maintenance and
safety regimes. </p>

would we expect to see some changes in the top management and the
board of SMRT – that is, reinforcing the board or bringing in somebody
who has engineering experience and background? Question four: besides
imposing more fines on PTOs, would the Ministry think of some other
ways that benefit commuters more directly, for example, giving the
commuters a free ride for the day when the train is down?</p>

Sir, there has been a line of questioning that the quest for financial
viability/profits by the PTOs is incompatible with running a reliable
system. I would like the Minister to comment on that, or whether
or not indeed the reverse is true, that only with financial viability
as one of the necessary conditions can the PTOs have funds to maintain
and make it reliable. </p>

I understand LTA is looking into increasing the quantum of the penalties
but I would like to ask the Minister whether he feels that the thresholds
that PTOs will be held to should just be on outcomes of the standards
of service, or should these thresholds also include whether they
successfully pass audit regimes for maintenance. This way would
be more preventive, rather than allowing the breakdowns to occur
and the harm done.</p>

relates to incident management. Earlier the Minister mentioned about
the fact that going forward – or maybe that has already been done
– the various agencies will harmonise their classification of incidents.
There was a media report on Saturday in <em class="ph i">The New Paper </em>where
former CEO of SMRT, Ms Saw Phaik Hwa, mentioned that under the critical
incident protocol that SMRT had signed up to at that time, the agencies
such as the Police and the SCDF could only be activated if there was
a death. I would like to ask the Minister: one, is this true; two,
if true, was this approved by LTA; and, three, going forward, will
this change because if it is true, I think it is a very worrying
protocol to have.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, a question
for the Minister. Some of the SMRT ground crew that I spoke with
have said that following the December incidents, there have been
many visits by the senior management on the ground to engage them,
to get feedback from them and to also render support to the hard
work they have been putting in. They have been asking if such ground
level encouragement and support will be sustained and whether or
not LTA, or even if I daresay the Minister, would also be involved
in such engagement to get views from the ground.</p>

best as we can.</p>

I would say that I am less interested in "heads rolling". I am more
interested in heads being fixed on and focused on the problems and
the issues, which means carrying out thorough checks, doing systematic
analyses, and doing a proper follow-up. I know SMRT is actually
doing its CEO search. It has been doing so for some time. I will
leave them to carry out the due process but I think Mr Tan Ek Kia,
to his great credit, has actually done a lot for the company. </p>

to benefit commuters more directly: I accept her point. I will ask
LTA to see if there is some possibility of looking into maybe a
compensation regime and in what form. We will have to learn from
what other countries and other operators are doing and see whether
there is room for us to adopt it. </p>

is going to be. I know the other question is, is this cost going
to be passed on to the commuters? That is probably the question
in our minds. Let me say that the Fare Review Committee is looking
at how the fare formula is going to be going forward – Mr Magnus
and his team are now currently looking at it. But if I look back
into the past at what the fare formula says, the fare formula is
premised on three areas: one, is on inflation; two, is on the wage
index; and the third, is on a productivity dividend that comes back
to the commuters. There is no formula or factor in the formula that
says that if they spend more on maintenance that will come out as part
of the fare review. Okay, so I assure her on that.</p>

question. Thank you. On financial viability, I think it is important
and it is part of the PTC's role not only to set fares, not only
to make sure the standards are upheld, but also to make sure that
over the longer term, indeed the operators are financially viable.
If they run inefficient regimes, if they are unproductive and have
losses, ultimately it is the Government, the taxpayers, the commuters themselves,
who have to pay for it. To me, efficiency is important. Giving them incentives
to be more productive is important. In the fare formula, there is
a productivity extract and so they have to meet that. Anything that
is more productive, they get to keep it. So, I think there is that
incentive in there as well. </p>

we should impose penalties: we can consider this but I look at audit
regimes more as helping us uncover potential shortcomings and making improvements
rather than as penalties that we want to impose on them. I dare
say that whether it is financial audits or, in this case, engineering
audits, people are likely to be more cooperative if they know that
it is all in the process of helping us uncover shortcomings and
improving on them, which is ultimately my main priority. We will have
to look at that a little bit more closely.</p>

an account by Ms Saw Phaik Hwa in <em class="ph i">The New Paper. </em>As far as
I understand it and as I mentioned earlier, there is an SOP. The
SOP existed before December. The SOP allows the operators to call
on TransCom and other Government agencies for assistance. During
the course of the incidents on 15 and 17 December, SMRT was probably
preoccupied and so LTA took on the responsibility of calling the Government
agencies and asking for resources to come in to provide support.
So the Police was in. LTA itself sent people on to the ground, and
helped to monitor the system, and changed the traffic lights – for
example, the timings in order to allow more time for the buses,
and so on. There is an SOP in place. I do not believe that she has
gotten the account accurate. </p>

– I am gratified to note that the visits by the senior management
are being felt on the ground. I had myself visited SMRT to talk
to the maintenance people themselves and also to express my appreciation
to a small group of them. Hopefully, the message will be passed
on to a larger group, that I really appreciate the hard work and
the dedication that they are putting in under very trying circumstances.
I hope they will be sustained. I would like to believe that they
will be. And I take the commitment of the Chairman and as well as
the interim CEO that they want to re-engineer the company. Certainly,
we already see some of that emphasis being felt down on the ground.</p>

Sir, I would like to, first, commend the Transport Minister for
his level-headedness and diligence by which he has tackled this
whole challenge. I had some concerns when there was talk about the
shift in focus from a commercial focus to an engineering focus.
I want to ask the Minister, post-COI, if there is a risk of an over
skewing towards engineering and maintenance versus the other priorities?
I believe that engineering proficiency or even elegance is just
a means to an end, and that public transport is, after all, a public
good. The business has to be customer-centric, user-centric. What
the public wants is not just engineering elegance, but what it wants
is timeliness for the daily travel, the commute; reasonable fares;
and accessibility and connectivity. That is my question to the Minister:
if there is going to be an over skewing of focus towards engineering?</p>

Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, since the PTOs will now be closely audited,
and PTOs being profit-oriented entities, would the Minister consider mandating
that they set aside certain amount of money for repairs and maintenance costs?
As I was going through their financials, I saw that in FY2011, the
repair and maintenance costs actually came down. The reason cited
was due mainly to lower scheduled repairs and maintenance costs.
Going forward, we are going to have more trains and the ridership
is going to increase. Maybe the Minister can look into this.</p>

                  </span>: Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Let me take the questions in turn. Firstly, from Mr
Seng Han Thong. Yes, I agree with the COI Report that the incidents
could have been prevented. Whether it is making sure that the MFV
is functioning properly, making sure that the vibration level is
being tackled through more regular profiling of the wheels, picking
up sags in the third rail at the appropriate times. There were a
number of recommendations by the COI on how to improve the situation,
going forward. On his point about recommendations, they are all
important. It would be remiss of us not to pay attention across
the board to all the recommendations because we are trying to eliminate
as many of the weak links as possible. We really need to tackle
this on multiple fronts. The whole purpose really is to try and
minimise these severe disruptions as much as possible. On the point
on system audits: let us do them first and, if necessary, we will do
them on a more frequent interval during the early years.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e37b25af-543a-49ec-b567-ce2479f5c326">
                  <a name="ministerial-statement__id-e37b25af-543a-49ec-b567-ce2479f5c326"><!--a--></a>I agree with Ms Denise Phua.
Engineering is only the means towards an end. Therefore, the emphasis
on engineering is towards a more reliable system, fewer breakdowns,
fewer train withdrawals so that the journeys of commuters are not interrupted.
I have asked them to pay special attention to disruptions during
the peak hours. When you have a train withdrawal during peak hours,
really, the impact cascades for quite a while simply because commuters
that are detrained need to move on to the next train and the next
train coming in is already reasonably crowded. The whole idea of
making this more reliable is so that commuters can have greater
assurance that they will
have a predictable journey. It is not really because engineering
is now the item that the management is paying attention to – and
they should – but it is really because we want to deliver a better
system.</p>

they should set aside more money or whether the regulator should
require them to set aside more money: it is not the amount of money because
they do have the money. They are declaring profits. It is really
what standards we hold them to. The standards that we hold them
to and impose on them would subsequently translate into the extent
and the amount of work that they have to do. It is not for us to
say, "Better set aside another $10 million" and so on and so forth.
I am not so sure we want to micro-manage them to that extent. We
will ratchet up the standards, making sure that we pay attention
to the right areas, doing the regular audits to throw up aspects
that we may not be aware of. These will already require them to
put more emphasis and resources, including financial resources into
the right areas.</p>

Sir, I have two questions. The first was somewhat answered by the
Minister, but I still hope to make a point regarding the composition
of the board. Going through the list, I noticed that it comprises members
who are trained mainly in accounting, finance, economics and law.
I do not think there is anybody with transport engineering background
originally. I want to ask who will look eventually into the suitability
of board members, not just at SMRT but at the other public transport
operator as well, to ensure that this emphasis on better engineering
is across the board.</p>

during the COI, there were views that the burden of changing of
the claws should lie with LTA as the ultimate asset owner. Such
views may persist in future. The COI recommended that SMRT and LTA
reviewed asset management framework which included many things,
including maintenance. My question is, how much money the Minister
foresees LTA may have to bear as a result of this requirement for
better maintenance and infrastructure, from the point of LTA as
the ultimate asset owner.</p>

would like to clarify that I am not asking for heads to roll, as
the Minister mentioned. I agree that the interim CEO has been doing
a lot. What I was trying to say was: will there be more people with
the engineering experience and background being brought into the
board and the top management in order to strengthen the team?</p>

they would add to the costs of the whole system, and, eventually,
whether there will be a fare increase.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
Lui Tuck Yew</strong>
                  </span>: There are comments on bringing the
right expertise into place at the management level and at the board
level. And indeed, over time they have been doing that. For example,
since 2010, they have got somebody from the engineering side attending
the board meetings. Not as a board member, but attending the meetings
so that the board itself pays the appropriate amount of attention
to engineering matters. I believe also that beyond the composition
of the board, they do refer to expertise outside of the board that
may be able to advise them on specific issues related to engineering or
other aspects altogether.</p>

Mr Teo Siong Seng and Mr Yee Jenn Jong mentioned them as well. Who
bears these costs? Is this going to be passed on to commuters? Let me
assure you, as I have answered earlier, that the fare formula as
in the past, really is dependent on macro factors of inflation and
wages minus the productivity dividend. It is not dependent on how
much extra they spend on maintenance and so on. I do not expect
that additional costs that they will spend on claws or whatever
it is are going to be passed on to the commuters as a result.</p>

Jenn Jong is who bears which part of the costs. There is an agreement
in the licence agreement on the apportionment of the costs, whether
it is on the fixed infrastructure or it is on the rolling stock
or on additional rolling stock in order to cater to, for example,
ridership growth. It is a reasonably complicated matter. I do not
really want to go in depth into this. To be fair, there is a portion
that the Government is required to bear, for example, renewing ageing
infrastructure. Which is why when SMRT announced that they were
going to spend $900 million on re-signalling as well as changing
out the sleepers and so on – we are still discussing on what is
the exact apportionment of the costs between the SMRT and the Government.
There is responsibility from the point of view of the Government
that we have to bear part of the costs.</p>

your point on the Bukit Panjang LRT. There is a commitment from
SMRT. They were going to spend about $3 million over the coming
years – we announced that last year – to improve the BPLRT. Still
not quite satisfactory. I agree with the Member on that point, and
we ought to do more and see greater improvements going forward.</p>

property (IP) is a vital component of the global economy. The total
number of patent applications filed globally has increased significantly.
This increase is particularly marked in Asia. East Asia has now
overtaken North America and Western Europe in the number of Patent
Cooperation Treaty (PCT) international applications filed. The PCT
is used for the filing of patent applications in multiple jurisdictions
and its increasing use is indicative of the global nature of patent protection
today. </p>

First, the Patents (Amendment) Bill amends the Patents Act to replace
our current self-assessment patent system with a new positive grant patent
system. All applications for patents must undergo a search and examination process.
Under our existing self-assessment patent system, patent applications
need not, however, fully fulfil Singapore's patentability criteria
in order to be granted. This means that patents may be granted without
a fully positive examination report. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0d2c8617-325d-4fd0-a5aa-692bbde8fb12">
                  <a name="id-3d31e6b0-65d7-4437-8a86-ba5d6372dd44__id-0d2c8617-325d-4fd0-a5aa-692bbde8fb12"><!--a--></a>This was a pragmatic approach
recommended by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)
when Singapore started its own patent system in 1995. Such a system
allows inventors to decide whether they have made adequate adjustments
to any objections raised by the examiners, or to disagree with the
examiner's assessment of their claims, before proceeding to seek
a patent grant if they wish to. We had also decided then not to
commit to the substantial investment which would have been required
to build domestic patent search and examination capabilities.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-41940948-82d1-476b-bd51-c5fc720f3589">
                  <a name="id-3d31e6b0-65d7-4437-8a86-ba5d6372dd44__id-41940948-82d1-476b-bd51-c5fc720f3589"><!--a--></a>Over the past five years,
the proportion of Singapore patent grants based on fully positive
examination reports has climbed to over 90%. In 2011, 95% of Singapore
patent grants were based on a fully positive examination report.
We feel it is now timely to make the move to the positive grant
patent system. </p>

grant patent system, only patent applications which fully meet patentability
criteria can be granted. The positive grant patent system will, first,
raise the overall quality of patents granted in Singapore; second,
align our patent system closer to that of established patent offices
like the European Patent Office, Japan Patent Office, the UK Intellectual
Property Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office;
and, third, strengthen business and investor confidence in our patent regime. </p>

there are many valuable inventions generated in Singapore today.
For example, a Singapore SME, Aurigin Technology, patented a soldering
device used in semiconductor manufacturing. With its patent, the
company successfully defended itself against an infringement claim
by Hong Kong-based semiconductor manufacturing giant ASM Assembly
Automation and even managed to successfully revoke the ASM patent.
IPOS runs an IP Management for SMEs programme to guide companies
in implementing a viable and cost-effective IP management strategy.
To date, more than 250 SMEs have benefited from this programme. </p>

grant patent system will minimise the occurrence of weak patents
being granted in future, enhance the standing of Singapore granted
patents, and give increased assurance to companies and investors
of the quality of Singapore-granted patents. Because investors have
increased assurance of the quality of Singapore-granted patent, local SMEs could
find it easier to raise funds on the basis of their Singapore-granted
patents to take their patented inventions to market. </p>

will grow the range of patent capabilities found here, and enable
Singapore to better service the growth in demand for such services
in Asia. By positioning Singapore as the "go-to" place in Asia for
procuring patent services, we aim to grow the overall market for
patent services in Singapore. This will benefit all patent professionals
in Singapore and create more jobs for Singaporeans. </p>

intellectual property will grow in importance given Singapore's

to ensure that the service providers in Singapore's IP sector can
service the growth of the sector – not just in terms of the growing
demand for the various IP services but also to widen the suite of
IP services and expertise available here in Singapore. </p>

to a "positive grant" patent system is long overdue. It is now 17
years since we first started our patent system. To continue with
the self-assessment patent system only stifles our development as
a key node of patent agency work. Pragmatism, which characterised
the 1995 patent regime, must now give way to greater ambition, meaningful
sophistication in our legal framework, and hard work in developing
our capacity and capability in the IP sector. Only then can Singapore become
a "go-to" Asian IP hub. As it stands, I feel that we are still very
much in the periphery. </p>

To be an IP hub, the human capital dimension is crucial. As it stands,
where the IP sector is concerned, this lack of an indigenous talent
pool for patent services is the missing link in our IP eco-system.
We must address this promptly or we will continue to seek the easy
but retrogressive step of outsourcing, or opening up the IP sector

Sir, it is indeed timely for a review of the Patents Bill, to enhance
and strengthen our regime. This must also align with our efforts to promote Singapore
as a centre for intellectual property transactions in today's global
marketplace. Companies and organisations competing at the international platform
need IP protection for their innovations and inventions. For inventors
who have to spend money and procure the patent, we need to ensure
that their investment of time and financial resources is worth it. </p>

amendment is in the correct direction, in us, first, changing from
a self-assessment to a positive grant patent system; and, two, the
liberalisation of the patent agent sector to allow patent agents
to register in Singapore. These steps will enable us to align closer
with international norms, moving towards patents which are novel
and with the potential for industrial applications.</p>

on the expertise and synergy brought about by the positive grant
system to build a more vibrant patent agent and regulator eco-system,
where it permits the regulator, that is, the Intellectual Property
Office in Singapore (IPOS), the chance to learn from the mingling
and interaction with an added pool of expertise and experienced
patent agents, instead of restricting them to local patent agents
and licensed advocates and solicitors from the courts, as proposed.</p>

and mutual understanding gained by both parties, for example, in
the defence or prosecution of a patent claim, can create some sparks

up our local patent profession and experience. </p>

there a need to restrict foreign patent agents to only offshore patent
agency work? Conceivably, by doing so, an investor trying to file
in the USA, EU, Japan and Singapore will require two different patent
agents, that is, one who is an expert in offshore patent laws and
another who can file with IPOS. My concern is that this will add
to the cost of procuring the patent. I have had personal experience
in this application process and feel that it can be very long drawn,
costly and requires much time coordinating with various parties
involved. </p>

of inventors is exploitation of their patent. To do this, they need
to be cognisant of, first, which attorney, patent agent and law

out the examination; and thirdly, what claims have been accepted.</p>

know if the claims are defensible in court after purchase, and often
the reputation and expertise of the grant agency dictates whether
it is worth the investment and resources to file in that jurisdiction.
Therefore, my suggestions are that: (1) we keep the costs affordable
for inventors and investors; (2) permit foreign patent agents to
file with IPOS as well; (3) continue to pursue continual alignment
with international norms; and (4) create the infrastructure which
can ensure budding investors and inventors are allowed to work with
the best patent agents they can afford and with a credible regulator,
who can start them off on the correct platform. With that, Sir,

Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier this year, we debated on the Budget. The
Budget was the latest in a series of initiatives by the Government to raise
productivity and innovation in Singapore. Innovation has to do with
the development of new ideas, new products to reap better economic
business. New inventions and innovative ideas can be harnessed and
put to use in improving the operation of the business or it can
be exploited by the innovator by selling the idea or invention or
by licensing it to third party.</p>

must have an effective, strong and robust patent system. All local
SMEs, in particular, have been encouraged to innovate and find new
ways to increase performance and productivity, and this has happened.

to the Patent Act. These amendments seek to underpin what the Minister

that are being made to the Patent Act and to other IP-related legislation,
and I will focus on the change from a "self-assessment" system to
a "positive grant" patent system. This is a significant change.</p>

have in place has been used since 1995. It is, as the title suggests,
a system which relies on the applicant seeking patent possession
to ensure himself that it has met the patentability criteria. Thus,
a patent could well be granted regardless of the outcome of the
examination report and without necessary compliance with the patentability
criteria which are three things: novelty, inventive step and industrial
applicability. Under the old system or the present system, the examination
reports of the patent grant are made public and it is then up to
the interested party to apply to challenge it. This system was adopted
in 1995 when Singapore started its own patent system because of
the then limitation in our domestic patent search and examination
capability. We also wanted to make it easier at that time to encourage
applicants to apply for patents in Singapore.</p>

remains unique in Singapore. The disadvantage, however, was that
patent granted in Singapore was therefore less robust and, in some
ways, less recognised. With the increase in IP creation, particularly
in Asia, this is no longer viable. We must enhance our patent grant
system so that any patent granted in Singapore will be well recognised,
robust, reliable and have good standing. The amendments that this Bill
seeks to introduce will achieve this by doing away with the self-assessment
system. In its place, the Bill introduces the positive grant system.
Under the system, only applicants who have fully satisfied the patentability
criteria will be granted patents. This requires the applicant to obtain a clean
examination report, with no unresolved objections. If there are
such objections, the applicant can apply under the proposed new section
29B for an examiner to review the examination report.</p>

these changes will enhance our patent system. A successful applicant
with a Singapore granted patent will hold the patent for which an
examination has been both thorough and rigorous. And more importantly,
a third party dealing with such applicant or patent will know that
it has been granted only after a thorough examination. This can
only lend greater certainty and promote increased confidence in the
quality of locally obtained patent. In addition, these amendments
also bring Singapore's patent system in line with many established
jurisdictions, such as the US, the UK, Australia, Japan and also
Malaysia. If we do not make these amendments now, we will risk falling
behind. </p>

step in the enhancement of Singapore as a regional or even global
hub for IP services. We have to build our infrastructure and offer
a robust patent system and other incentives for global entities
to set up shop in Singapore, develop manufacture and export their
patents here. Much in the same way as the Government has successfully
developed Singapore as a leading arbitration hub over the last few years.</p>

the amendment, but I would like to urge the Ministry to bear in
mind that while we strive to ensure or enhance the robustness of
the system, that we do not unintentionally hinder our own local
SMEs, our own local individual inventors from obtaining patent protection
for their own deserving invention. Sir, as the Minister for Law
noted in March this year, local companies are creating more IP,
can the Ministry elaborate on whether the new positive grant system
could result in a delay in the grant of deserving patents in these
cases and whether the cost about filing such patents will rise and
what assistance can be offered to these SMEs or individual inventors
who want to proceed to register their patents. With that, I support
the Bill.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir,
I thank all the Members who have spoken in support of the Bills
and for tracking the growth and development of our IP landscape.
I shall start by responding to Assoc Prof Fatimah's point, as she
has been a personal user of the various IP systems. I agree with
her that companies do need IP protection for their innovations and
products to compete on the international platform. Indeed, we have observed
a trend for companies to file for patent protection in multiple
markets outside of their home market. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-14cf7369-2b07-4c58-9eb3-8128818eee95">

of the patent agents sector, we hope to attract more patents firms
with international expertise and build a larger pool of patent agents
who are capable of providing expert advice on the patent laws and
practices across various jurisdictions, and this will benefit Singapore
inventors. </p>

alluded to, the presence of a wider range of patent agents in Singapore
would facilitate greater collaboration and knowledge transfer between practitioners
who are qualified to practise across different jurisdictions. I
agree that this would help build our local patent profession and
add to the vibrancy of our IP landscape.</p>

why foreign qualified patent agents are restricted only to offshore
work. Every national patent system is different and not all foreign
qualified patent agents may be familiar with Singapore's patent
law and practices. It would thus not
be in the interest of Singapore inventors or companies if patent
agents who are not qualified in Singapore are allowed to file Singapore
patent applications or advise on Singapore patent law.</p>

Singapore qualifications as well, and we hope this trend will continue
even under the new regime.</p>

about the need to develop the local patent profession and grow a
strong pipeline of talent. This, indeed, has been an area of focus
for MinLaw and IPOS since the profession was started a decade back.
Over the past five years, the Government has been running the Mentorship
Funding Scheme to support local patent agent firms in hiring experienced
patent agents to guide and mentor local patent trainees. We are
currently reviewing the scheme, with the aim of enhancing the training support
and building a bigger pipeline of local patent agents. In addition,
we are also exploring ways to support the continuing professional
development of qualified patent agents. Foreign patent firms that
have spoken to MinLaw have expressed intentions of employing and
training Singaporeans as patent agents. So, that is some news for
Asst Prof Eugene Tan.</p>

agencies like EDB and IE Singapore to support local patent firms
to grow their offshore markets. Taken together, what this means
is that more Singaporeans will enjoy the opportunity to join the
patent agent profession and be exposed to the patent laws and practices
of different jurisdictions. In addition, IPOS is building up a new
team of patent examiners in-house and this new team will also help to
enlarge the IP eco-system and provide an additional pathway to the
patent agent profession, as we have observed in other countries.</p>

thriving IP industry in Singapore as part of our ambition to be
an agent IP hub, we are confident that we will create more high-value
jobs for Singaporeans across the different IP professions. These
jobs are a good fit for the Singapore workforce as they require
people who are technically proficient and have a good command of
English. Indeed, I think it is very much the type of high value-add
jobs that Mr Gan Thiam Poh was speaking about just now during his
Parliamentary question.</p>

least, I think awareness of IP as a good career to go into is also
key, and I would be glad to encourage Asst Prof Eugene Tan in raising
awareness among his many students of this field as a very rewarding
profession possibly to develop into.</p>

as Assoc Prof Fatimah, have pointed out that we need to be mindful

indeed, were amongst our key considerations.</p>

would be manageable. Under the "positive grant" system, only patent
applications with a fully positive search and examination report
can be granted. The
applicant may opt for the examination review step if the applications
have outstanding objections. However, 95% of patents granted already
have a fully positive search and examination report and would not
be affected by the changes. The new supplementary examination is
also only required for patent applications that rely on a foreign
search and examination report. Patent applications that rely on
a local search and examination report will not require it. On the
issue of potential delays and costs, while the examination review
may add a few months to the patent application process, this would
only affect the 5% of applicants who currently do not have fully
positive examination reports. Nonetheless, it is important to note
that patent protection starts from the date of filing the application
and not the date of grant of patent. There would be additional fees
for those who require these additional examination processes, but
we will ensure that the fees are kept reasonable.</p>

I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his questions. Indeed, as he has pointed
out quite rightly, patent lawsuits can be very technically complex, sophisticated
and very involved affairs. As to whether or not we expect to see
more patent or IP litigation in Singapore, I think this is also,
to a large extent, linked to the size of our market. As with our
efforts to expand the range of IP-related services – this may, for
instance, also include arbitration – we hope that the entire suite
of services, including legal support for companies who need this
recourse in order to protect their IP, will grow and that our capabilities
will also grow in tandem.</p>

The Government takes a strong stand against corruption. Corruption

partners or sole proprietors. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: Specialist
Outpatient Clinic (SOC) waiting times for new appointments vary
across hospitals and across specialties within each hospital. Fast-tracked
referral arrangements between polyclinics and SOCs have enabled
our hospitals to keep median waiting times for subsidised patients
with urgent cardiac and suspected cancer conditions at eight and
six days respectively. For the emergency cases, they will be attended
to immediately at the A&amp;E departments. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2a4d346c-7454-4e5d-a5c6-78edb017426d">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-2a4d346c-7454-4e5d-a5c6-78edb017426d"><!--a--></a>For less urgent referrals,
the overall median waiting time for first appointment was 24 days
in 2011. For these referrals, some specialties such as orthopaedic
surgery, gastroenterology and renal medicine, have longer median
waiting times of between one and two months. A small minority –
about 0.1% of subsidised patients waited six months or longer for
new SOC appointments in 2011. While such long waiting times are
not the norm in public hospitals, it is natural for these patients
to be anxious as they would like to be examined by the specialists
as soon as possible. We have thus been working actively with the
hospitals to reduce waiting times at the SOCs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-794fd2f2-35a4-4c9f-b4ba-323314863c42">

approach to reduce waiting times. First, hospitals are taking steps
to improve the efficiency of the appointment system by reminding patients
of their appointments via phone calls and text messages and also
enabling patients to make changes of appointments more easily through
dedicated central SOC appointment call centres. In this way, they
can help reduce "no-show" rates, where appointments are made but
patients fail to show up. Second, hospitals are also working closely
with Polyclinics and GPs to continue the care of patients who no
longer require specialist care at the SOC, and to minimise unnecessary
referrals to SOC in the first place if the patients can be adequately
cared for at the polyclinics and private GP clinics. This way, we
can reduce the unnecessary patient load at the SOC and free up more
capacity for those who really need specialist care. Third, as announced
during the COS debate earlier this year, we are setting up more
Medical Centres (MCs) in the community. In addition to Jurong Medical
Centre which opened since 2006, more will be set up over the next
few years. MCs are designed to provide broad-based specialist care
in a community setting. Patients who need specialist care in selected
specialties will be able to see specialists in an MC nearer their
homes. With the support of specialists in these MCs, GPs can co-manage
patients with more complex but stable conditions in the community

                  </span>: At the national level, MOH plans healthcare
infrastructural capacity and healthcare manpower staffing in tandem
to ensure that there is sufficient manpower to meet service expansions.
Over the years, we have been growing the supply of doctors (both
specialists and non-specialists) through increasing local medical undergraduate
and postgraduate training pipelines. The medical school intake had increased
from 230 in 2005, to 336 in 2011, between NUS Yong Loo Lin School
of Medicine and Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School. With the Lee Kong
Chian School of Medicine opening in 2013, the three medical schools
will train 500 doctors annually, in the steady state. The specialist
trainee intake had increased substantially from 176 in 2009 to 451
in 2011, with the roll-out of the Residency postgraduate training
system in 2010. We are also attracting overseas Singaporean doctors
and foreign professionals to work in Singapore. </p>

private hospitals to draw some specialist manpower from the public
hospitals as they are the largest employer of specialists. In the
first half of 2012, the attrition rate of public sector specialists
who indicated 'joining private sector' or 'personal reasons' as
their reasons for leaving the public healthcare clusters was 2.1%,
which was slightly higher than the 2% average attrition over the

taken steps to minimise the impact of specialist attrition. Firstly,
they increased their specialist staffing by 34%, from 1,618 to 2,164,

public sector doctors to be more competitive against the market.

                  </span>: Our regulatory

to structure their operations as appropriate to meet the required service
standards. This includes the setting of bus drivers' salaries and
terms of employment. Ministry of Transport does not directly intervene

Programme (BSEP), the Government will fund 550 new buses to improve

public transport operators (PTOs) will add at their own cost. As
a result, we expect that
the two PTOs will have to recruit about 1,600 more bus drivers in
total. This is a significant increase in the manpower requirements
of the public bus industry, and the PTOs will have to offer competitive
terms to be able to attract sufficient new drivers. </p>

Code ensures that operators adopt proactive measures to improve
the resiliency of their mobile telecommunication networks in order
to prevent widespread service disruption. In the event that such
disruptions occur, it also ensures that operators take all necessary
measures to restore services as quickly as possible. The QoS framework
requires mobile operators to meet certain performance measures,
such as providing network coverage at outdoor and in-buildings areas,
as well as in road and MRT tunnels, under normal operating conditions.
It also requires minimising dropped calls. Where operators fail
to comply with the requirements set out in the Resiliency Code or
fail to meet certain performance measures under the QoS framework,
IDA is empowered to impose financial penalties. In the past year,
IDA has penalised mobile operators that have failed to comply with
these Codes of Practice, with financial penalties ranging from $300,000
to $400,000, in relation to mobile network outages.</p>

regulatory measures and taking into consideration Singapore's fully
liberalised telecommunication landscape, we have left it to the operators
to commercially determine how best to compensate their subscribers
for the inconvenience caused by a service disruption. The level
of compensation is a commercial decision by operators for the purpose
of retaining their customers' loyalty, which may be too subjective
for IDA, as a regulator, to determine. For example, in the case
of M1's service disruption in May 2011, IDA understands that M1
had proactively and voluntarily offered free local calls, SMSes,
and MMSes for a full day on 25 May to all its subscribers, including
those unaffected by the service disruption. </p>

Laws are in place to ensure that employers resolve wage claims filed

Act, employers are required to pay the salaries of both their local

the Labour Court. The Court does not differentiate between local
and foreign workers in the recovery of salary arrears. </p>

on time, for both local and foreign workers, constitutes a serious
offence. Errant employers may be liable upon conviction to a fine

not rank our Primary schools by the number of students with a PSLE

many Members, including Mr Yee, have previously voiced their concerns
about focusing too narrowly on academic success in education. The
Ministry shares these concerns and is taking steps to broaden the
definition of success, and to emphasise holistic education, with
character and values at the centre. Ranking schools based on the number
of pupils with high PSLE scores will undermine these efforts, with
potentially adverse impacts on our schools and our students. </p>

                  </span>: Healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs) are infections that patients acquire during their
stay in healthcare facilities, like hospitals. Our hospitals take
HAIs seriously as it could delay and complicate a patient's recovery. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d116fddd-a5e4-42b1-ac9e-92396d93df49">

factors for HAIs. For example, HAIs could occur during surgery when
a patient's skin, the body's natural defence against infection,
is breached. The use of in-body medical devices, such as urinary
catheters, can predispose a patient to infections arising from such
devices. Patients with conditions, such as diabetes and kidney failure,
are also more susceptible to infections because of their lowered
immune status. Some treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer,
may also lower a patient's immunity thus increasing the risk for
HAIs. HAIs often occur as a result of a combination of factors.
It is therefore not conclusive that high bed occupancy rate (BOR)
directly leads to higher HAIs. In fact, a recent study of BOR and
Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) shows that there
is a lack of consistent correlation between them. </p>

of bacteria and reduce HAIs, our public hospitals have instituted
strict infection control measures. These include stringent adherence
to hand hygiene practices among healthcare staff, contact precautions
to minimise physical contact and contact with medical devices, implementation
of evidence-based infection prevention practices during treatment
procedures, and regular surveillance of HAI rates in special care
areas, such as the intensive care units (ICUs). These infection
prevention measures have reduced HAIs in our hospitals. </p>

ICUs, through stringent infection control measures, the ventilator
associated pneumonias had decreased from 2.61 per 1,000 ventilator
days in 2004 to 1.04 per 1,000 ventilator days in 2010. Similarly,
blood stream infection associated with central lines (these are
catheters inserted into patients' veins for treatment and monitoring)
in these ICUs had decreased from 0.97 per 1,000 central line days
to 0.58 per 1,000 central line days over the same period. However,
it is increasingly challenging to stem the rise of bacteria that
are resistant to multiple antibiotics - infections caused by these
bacteria are difficult and expensive to treat.</p>

of antimicrobial resistance related to HAIs, my Ministry set up
a national taskforce in 2009, comprising infectious disease specialists,
infection control experts, pharmacists, microbiologists and public
health experts to develop and implement measures to reduce drug
resistant HAIs in our healthcare institutions. These measures have
been progressively implemented in the hospitals. One such measure
is the setting up of antimicrobial stewardship programmes which
will be progressively rolled out to seven public hospitals over
the next four years to enhance the appropriate use of antibiotics
thus reducing antimicrobial resistance in our hospitals. Some hospitals,
such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital, have piloted innovative ways to
better control HAIs. Measures that work and are cost-effective will
be rolled out across all our hospitals.</p>

measures to restrict the number of visitors in order to reduce the
risk of transmission of infections. We can also play our part in reducing
the transmission of HAIs by washing our hands before and after visiting
our friends or relatives in the hospitals.</p>

                  </span>: Since 2008,
the Ministry has been promoting early detection and better chronic
disease management through the Chronic Disease Management Programme
(CDMP) and the Integrated Screening Programme (ISP). Through ISP, Singaporeans
are encouraged to visit CDMP GP clinics to be screened for common chronic
diseases (diabetes, hypertension and lipid disorders), cervical,
breast and colorectal cancer, and we provide subsidies to lower
income Singaporeans. To date, over 48,000 persons have been screened
under ISP, out of which over half (53.2%) were detected with one
or more chronic diseases. HPB is currently working towards improving
the screening programme through an Enhanced ISP, which will customise the
tests to be taken based on the individual's age, gender and risk
profile, and also provide better follow-up.</p>

to have abnormal screening results, they can be followed up at the
CDMP GP clinics or polyclinics. CDMP not only allows patients to
use their Medisave to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for the
outpatient treatment of their chronic conditions, but also ensures
a more systematic monitoring and treatment of these chronic conditions,
in accordance with international best practices. CDMP coverage has
been expanded from the initial three conditions (diabetes, hypertension and
lipid disorders) to also include stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), schizophrenia and major depression, dementia
and bi-polar disorder), to benefit more Singaporeans. In January
2012, we increased withdrawal limit for outpatient treatment of
chronic conditions from $300 to $400 per account.</p>

                  </span>: Commencing
May this year, the Police has been implementing the Community Policing
System (COPS) progressively across different parts of Singapore.
While I can understand the Member's desire for implementation to
be expedited, let me explain why we need as many as three to five
years for the full rollout.</p>

Police will be increasing its manpower by 450 new posts. We should
not rush the recruitment and training of such a significant number
of police officers. Otherwise, the quality of recruitment could
be compromised. </p>

will allow Police to methodically plan and deploy the resources
needed for the new Crime Strike Force and other key components of
the reorganised Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs). It will also
allow Police to progressively build upon lessons learnt in the earlier
phases of implementation.</p>

of Police Cameras is a large-scale initiative that will cover all 10,000
blocks and multi-storey car parks in HDB estates. The installation

the Sembawang – Nee Soon Town Council, will have some blocks installed

The Government does not condone the discrimination of female employees
due to their pregnancy or maternity. The Employment Act (EA) today
already allows any employee, including female employees in any stages
of pregnancy, to appeal to the Minister for Manpower if they feel
that they have been unfairly dismissed. If the Minister finds that
the employee has been dismissed without just cause, he may then
reinstate the employee or order compensation to be paid to her. </p>

may be tempted to dismiss their pregnant employees before their
due date, the EA further requires an employer who dismisses a pregnant
female employee without sufficient cause within the last six months
of her pregnancy to pay her the maternity benefits that she would
otherwise be entitled to under the Act. </p>

pregnant female employees against unfair dismissals, we must also
be mindful that employers will be less inclined to hire women of
childbearing age if we over-prescribe the protection of pregnant
employees in our laws. This ultimately affects the employability
of a wider group of workers.</p>

                  </span>: There are
planning rules governing such development. Briefly, only single-house
land plots in estates not safeguarded as Landed Housing Areas but
are zoned for non-landed residential use, can be developed into
flats and condominiums. In addition, the allowable development intensity
of these estates, which is reflected in the Master Plan, will have
taken into account the capacity of local infrastructure and potential
amenity impact on existing residents. </p>

introduced additional guidelines to evaluate redevelopment proposals
for non-landed housing. Since last November, proposals for new flat
developments must have a minimum site area of 1,000 square metres.
This requirement ensures that there is sufficient space for landscaping
and communal facilities, such as car parks, to meet the needs of
residents. This requirement also facilitates the design of more
open spaces within and between developments. </p>

minimum site area, the URA will also examine the height, bulk and
intensity of a proposed development to ensure liveability of the
estate. The URA will guide developers if necessary to improve their
proposals before planning approval is granted. In some cases, developers
may also be required to carry out detailed traffic impact studies
and adopt traffic improvement measures to avert potential congestion. </p>

areas, the URA has found it necessary to also cap the maximum number
of units that can be allowed for flat and condominium developments. This
cap ensures that the redevelopment will be at a pace and density
that the local road infrastructure can accommodate. The URA and
LTA are studying whether an even more stringent cap is needed specifically
for the Kovan, Hillside and Rosyth area, similar to what was done
for Telok Kurau. </p>

our Institutes of Higher Learning do not condone any action or behaviour
that disrupts religious harmony or disparages any community in Singapore

immediately counselled the students involved and explained to them
how others could be offended by their actions. The students promptly
removed the offending materials from campus and their website, and
apologised for their actions on their website. The activities of
the NUS Campus Crusade for Christ have since been suspended, and
police investigations are still ongoing. NUS management also took
the occasion to remind the wider NUS community of the importance
of being respectful to others' beliefs and views.</p>

                  </span>: Current
laws do not target cyberbullying specifically. However, there are
existing laws that can apply against cyberbullying. For example,
cyberbullying may amount to criminal intimidation under the Penal
Code. This is an offence which carries a penalty of imprisonment
and/or a fine. In cases involving serious threats, such as threats
to cause death or grievous hurt, the penalty is more severe, with
a longer term of imprisonment. Other offences, such as extortion
or insulting the modesty of a woman, can also apply. </p>

the Ministry of Law and MICA to consider whether cyberbullying needs
to be targeted more explicitly. In addition, we are reviewing other criminal
legislation enacted before the Internet age to ensure that undesirable
acts perpetrated via electronic means can similarly be punishable
as criminal offences. </p>
