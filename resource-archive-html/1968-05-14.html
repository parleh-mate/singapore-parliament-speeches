<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the following Address in reply to the

express  our  thanks  to the  President  for  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government at the opening of the First Session of

this Parliament.".'.- [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as I was saying yesterday when the House

adjourned, it is time to reorganise our

educational system to keep pace with our

industrialisation success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us review our present position. Last year, of

the 144,000 students in secondary schools, only

18,000 were in technical and vocational schools.

The ratio is about seven to one. Last year, we

produced 417 engineers and scientists as compared

with 178 at the sub-professional level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compare very poorly with other industrialised

countries. Take Japan for example; for every five

secondary school students, two are in the

technical and vocational schools, and for every

professional engineer they produce, there are

about five supporting skilled technicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we need skilled workmen to

build and repair ships and sailors and officers to

man them, personnel to run our hotels, builders to

meet the demands created by our plans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



on housing, urban renewal and development. In

short, in order that our plans on

industrialisation and economic development may

continue to be successful, as it has been, we must

have sufficient and capable human talent in the

top strata, but, more important, we must also

provide a much larger group of supporting

personnel in the lower echelons. We need to

reorganise our educational system to meet this

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I digress a bit? When we

reorganise our secondary education system, we also

keep in mind the womenfolk of this country. I can

assure the Member for Delta that the only outlet

for women is not in bars as waitresses or as dance

hostesses. For example, at the Productivity Centre

of the Economic Development Board, a course is run

exclusively for girls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come back to the main issue. Sir, may I be

permitted to go briefly into the types of

personnel that we require to meet our industrial

needs? We have engineers, planners, etc, at the

professional level, and down the ladder, we have

senior technicians, technicians, craftsmen and

operatives. The senior technicians, whom we

generally call technical assistants, are trained

at the Singapore Polytechnic for the Technician

Diploma. Already, we have the cream of the

secondary school students taking these courses.

Some of them even have the Higher School

Certificate. Last year, for example, the

Polytechnic received about 2,000 applications for

about 700 vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have technicians and craftsmen, such as

the Craft Diploma graduates of the Singapore

Vocational Institute. Already two such institutes

are being built and more will be constructed in

the next few years. They are, in fact, the key

personnel in factories, and we are very short of

them. Lower down, we have the vocational schools

which unfortunately are considered to be for the

"drop-outs". We will rectify this. After leaving

school, these students will have a period of in-plant or industrial training to qualify as

operatives specialising in one type of trade. The

institutional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



training in a vocational school provides a

general background education, while the in-plant

training will be so orientated as to meet the

requirements of our industries from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to attract the best brains to

technical education and industry, we must ensure

that there is a continuous ladder to the top for

those who are capable and those who want to go

into this stream. We must provide a parallel

outlet to the present academic stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a new department created within the

Ministry of Education to plan, co-ordinate and

administer our technical education and industrial

training at the sub-professional level. This

department will be supervised by a Cabinet

Committee, as outlined in the Addendum to the

President's Speech under the head Ministry of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are already being drawn up to launch a

crash programme for the training of craft teachers

to man the new vocational institutes and training

centres which I have just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Serangoon Gardens

that the computer does not play a very important

part in the selection of applicants. In case there

is a large number of applicants, it comes in only

in the grading of applicants and the preliminary

short-listing. All applicants will be interviewed

as in the case of other teachers-in-training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-professional stream of the Polytechnic,

that is the technician course, will be enlarged,

and there will be more vocational institutes. The

present vocational schools will be reorganised,

converted and their syllabuses modified. They will

no longer be regarded as schools for drop-outs.

Industrial Training Centres will be established to

provide the in-plant training facilities to

complement the institutional training. We hope

that by next year we will be able to see

physically the first of these changes, and by

1971, we will have some 30,000 students in the

technical and vocational streams. By then, the

ratio will be in the region of three and a half to

one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are embarking on a very bold and

ambitious programme to develop our human

resources. They are vital to our plans on

industrialisation and economic development and,

therefore, our very survival. We are confident

that we will succeed.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

while perusing the memorandum presented to this

House as an Addendum to the Speech by the

President, I must say that it is physically

impossible for me to analyse all the salient

features in his policy speech. I can only touch on

certain problems which I feel should be tackled

with caution and understanding by the Government

so that it will not fall or falter. It is my

intention to speak on the proposed policies of the

Ministry of Labour on matters connected with

fringe benefits, employer and employee relations

and labour productivity with a view to promoting a

better industrial climate essential for our

economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the 51 Members in the last Parliament

and 58 Members in the present Parliament

representing a cross-section of the people, I must

confess my bias for labour matters in the past.

But in the new context of our circumstances and

the gravity of our nation's problems, I feel that

one should speak without bias or prejudice on

problems connected with labour in this House.

Hence in the course of my speech, I hope to be

able to drive home my views in meeting the call

made in the President's Speech for sensible

relations among employer, labour and management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is fast making a change from an

entrepot economy to an industrialised State. In

this process, she has to make this island State

sufficiently attractive both to indigenous and

foreign capital. Singapore must keep the cost of

production to the minimum so that her products can

be highly competitive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



She also has an unemployment problem

with 10 to 15 per cent of the economically active

unemployed. This figure can be expected to

increase with the complete withdrawal of the

British Military Forces from Singapore by 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one in his right senses will say that

organised labour is not aware of this glaring

difficulty. There is today an effective trade

union organisation which is capable of

comprehending fully the social and economic

problems of our nation. I am sure it will hasten

to respond favourably to whatever measures the

Government may propose to take to solve the

nation's economic ills, provided such measures are

reasonable and sincere, and labour interest is not

unfairly jeopardised. Under the circumstances, I

am sure the organised workers in Singapore will be

eager to know what new labour legislation the

Government is going to introduce to regulate the

terms and conditions of employment of all

employees. But before more detailed information is

available, it is unwise for me to comment on the

merit and demerit of this proposed Bill.

Nevertheless, I have certain observations to make

on the aforementioned areas of fringe benefits,

employer/employee relations and labour

productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Government's intention to

eliminate fringe benefits which, they say, are

likely to be abused, may I caution the Government

that it must make a genuine attempt to distinguish

carefully between abusive and genuine fringe

benefits. Any attempt at indiscriminate slashing

of fringe benefits will bring about much injustice

to the workers and defeat the very purpose for

which it was intended. Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are, as you know, in Singapore certain well-established firms whose profit margins are very

high and where, as a result of labour efficiency

and economies in production, they are likely to

move still further towards a better position.

Under such circumstances, a reduction of fringe

benefits would be most unjustified and the union

leadership would not be in a position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



to advise the workers concerned to accept the

proposed terms. Further, labour productivity will

definitely be adversely affected if such an

arbitrary measure is enforced by legislation,

especially when labour realises that there is no

reward in putting additional efforts to improve

the financial position of the firms and

industries. This will lead only to unhappiness, a

sense of social injustice and a feeling of

exploitation, resulting in a deterioration or

rupture of the existing good employer/employee

relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must realise that there is a

positive and a negative way to increase labour

productivity. The negative way is to tamper with

the existing fringe benefits, especially those

which have been granted to the workers with the

full consent of the employers and the jurisdiction

of the Arbitration Court. This approach is bound

to boomerang on the Government. On the other hand,

the more desirable positive approach would be to

give labour a chance to show their capability for

responsibility. In this connection, I call for a

more decentralised approach to solving problems,

and to persuading labour to exercise restraint. In

this way the Government will not be accused of

interfering with freely negotiated agreements

arrived at by mutual consent between the employees

and the employers. In other words, instead of

legislation, the working groups of management and

the workers should be allowed to make on-the-spot

decisions with regard to a particular firm or

industry if conditions there warrant any

modification in the terms and conditions of

service. The Government should exhort management

and labour to get together in a spirit of sincere

co-operation to identify problem areas and tackle

them jointly. For example, management and labour

can be encouraged to co-operate in exploring ways

for more efficient utilisation of work force,

increasing the workers' efficiency through

enlargement and improvement of job skills,

elimination of unnecessary overtime and

restrictive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



job demarcations, and reorganisation of work

methods to reduce production costs. Certainly it

is only through such positive measures that

positive results can be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the issue of labour productivity in

more detail, it is also my contention that

Government and management must not fall into the

nasty habit of making labour the scapegoat for low

productivity and business failures. Increased

productivity is not something that labour alone

can achieve. If in a firm or industry there is low

productivity, it does not necessarily mean that

labour is at fault. It might be due to inefficient

management, especially when we have unqualified

family management which used to employ their

nieces and nephews.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> And uncles!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It might be due to other

bottlenecks in the industry, wrong predictions

made by the entrepreneurs, excessive investments

on overheads, large inventories due to lack of

understanding of the markets, absence of

specialised skill due to faulty training

programmes of the industry and so on. These are

all factors which might affect productivity, and

it is rather naive to suggest that labour should

be held responsible for lower productivity. But

surprisingly enough, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government has been less vociferous in exhorting

employers to do their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over and above all this, I

concur with my other trade union colleagues in

recognising the over-riding need for the

Government to consult with the trade unions before

passing laws affecting the interests of the

workers. The best thing to do, I feel, is to set

up a tripartite council of management, labour and

Government representatives to discuss in detail

the Government's proposed Acts. Any arbitrary

legislation, or any attempt by the Government to

bulldoze its way with the comprehensive Employment

Bill will result in a deterioration rather



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



than an improvement in the industrial climate now

existing. The Government must not make the mistake

by thinking that higher productivity can be

acquired by merely passing Acts in this Parliament

and choosing to ignore the opinions of labour

representatives. You can lead a horse to the

water. You can push its head into the water. But

if you duck its head in too long -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> It

will die.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> - it will fight for its life.

Eventually it may lose in the struggle and die.

Labour incentive to co-operation and higher

productivity can also be similarly smothered.

Therefore, in keeping with our democratic

aspirations, whatever arrangements the Government

has in store for the workers must be reached not

by compulsion but by mutual consultation and

consent. I hope the Government will understand

that healthy union co-operation does not mean the

latter's mute acceptance, lock, stock and barrel,

of all Government's demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate

myself with the Prime Minister in expressing my

appreciation and thanks for the President's

Speech.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

Member for Ulu Pandan has raised two important

issues during the current debate on the

President's Speech which fall within the scope of

my new portfolio, the Ministry of Communications,

may I be permitted to inform the House, as well as

members of the public, of my views on these

subjects? I have arrived at these views in the

short period of four weeks since assuming my

portfolio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is nationalisation of bus companies in Singapore

the answer to our transport problem as proposed by

the Member for Ulu Pandan? Is this the panacea to

our transport problem?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was, in fact, one of the recommendations of

the Commission of Enquiry set up by the former

Labour Front Government in 1955, under the

chairmanship of Mr L. C. Hawkins, a member of the

London Transport Executive. Even if the former

Labour Front Government had wanted to implement

this proposal, it could not have done so because

Singapore's reserves had been run down to such a

low level, and there was no second Christmas

Island to be sold to Australia to find the tens of

millions of dollars which would have been needed

to nationalise the bus companies then operating in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the People's Action Party assumed the

government of Singapore in 1959, nationalisation

of bus companies was not one of its platforms and

rightly so, even to this day!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the question of money alone which

deters us from opting for this solution. The whole

tenor of the President's Speech gives a grim

picture of the future which lies ahead of us, the

great efforts and sacrifices demanded from every

one of the two million people of Singapore to gird

themselves to face the immense economic problems

which we must overcome in order to survive. We

will be hard put to it to find the hundreds of

millions of dollars which will be needed to build

up a credible defence force of our own by 1972,

and the further hundreds of millions of dollars

which will be needed for massive counter-recession

public works that have been and will continue to

be launched, as a set-off against the consequences

of the accelerated British military pull-out by

1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we have the funds available to

nationalise the bus companies in Singapore, are we

sure that we can provide a more efficient public

service after nationalisation? The experience of

other countries has shown that bureaucracy will

not only worsen the situation but, worse still,

more losses will be sustained which will have to

be borne by Government. The end result



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



of nationalisation would be a worse service,

employment perhaps of more bureaucrats, and the

country will have to carry the burden of heavier

losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of urban renewal of Singapore, it

is not the intention of Government to take on this

gigantic re-development scheme all on its own.

Private enterprise is and will continue to be

encouraged to play its part, with Government

offering adequate and attractive incentives all

along the line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concede that the public transport service of

Singapore is not what it should be. It can and

should be improved, and this can be done within

the powers already contained in the various Acts

or Ordinances at present in force. If these powers

are not enough, I shall seek fresh powers through

new legislation. It will be my duty, during my

term of office as Minister for Communications, to

make a proper study of the transport problems

first, and this takes some time. And when I am

ready, I will suggest ways and means for its

improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of many public complaints regarding

the inefficiency and poor service of our bus

companies. The Member for Kallang has expressed to

me verbally how dissatisfied he is with the

inadequacy and inconvenience experienced by him as

a bus traveller, and I have promised to look into

the matter. The Member for Katong recently drew my

attention to a complaint from his constituents

regarding the curtailment of the Singapore

Traction Company night bus service route 20-B,

along Tanjong Rhu. The explanation given by the

S.T.C, was curious, that stoppage of the night

service was due to a "misunderstanding between the

Managing Director and Traffic Manager"! However,

the night bus service along Tanjong Rhu, which

stopped on 21st April. 1968, was resumed on 12th

May. 1968, after a written warning was issued to

the General Manager of the S.T.C, by my Permanent

Secretary, in his capacity as Chairman of the

Omnibus Services Licensing Authority, drawing

attention to the fact that bus companies can have

their licences suspended or cancelled if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



they fail to provide an adequate service on an

approved route.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, the decisions which

I shall be making in the near future in an attempt

to improve the public transport service in

Singapore will be only short-term solutions. As

for long-term solutions of our transport problems,

this needs the attention of better qualified

professional experts and planners. As stated in

the Addendum to the President's Speech, besides

the two senior officials from the London Transport

Board who have been invited under the Colombo Plan

Technical Co-operation Scheme "to make a

preliminary study of possible new measures to

improve and expand Singapore's mass transport

facilities", there are at present a team of United

Nations advisers attached to our State and City

Planning Office "to study the long-range aspects

of providing a mass rapid transit system for

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan next suggested that as

"pirate taxis" are providing service to the public

which the bus services are not able to cope with,

therefore such pirate taxis should he allowed to

operate legally as "express taxis" and that pirate

taxi operators should, at most, be subject only to

a fine when caught and that their motor vehicles

should not be confiscated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the pirate-taxi problem came into

being for two reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the growing problem of unemployment in

Singapore so that those who do not wish to

go on the dole - that is, to seek Social

Welfare assistance - turn to hawking or

become pirate-taxi operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the inability of the bus companies to

provide an efficient, regular and adequate

service for bus travellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the above two problems are resolved, the

pirate taxi problem will remain with us for some

time to come, as both the problems of unemployment

and a better organised bus transport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



system will need considerable time and effort even

to prevent the situation from worsening still

further before attempting to resolve the problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What differentiates the pirate taxi operator from

the properly licensed taxi operator? At the

moment, the number of licensed taxis is limited to

3,800. Licensed taxi-owners pay their share of

road tax to the Registrar of Vehicles. There is a

limitation on the number of passengers carried,

depending on the size of the motor vehicle. They

are subject to a half-yearly mechanical inspection

of the road-worthiness of the vehicle and they

have to pay a higher insurance premium to cover

liability for passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the pirate-taxi operator only

pays the lower road tax applicable to private

cars, but evades payment of at least $500 per

annum which is the additional tax payable for a

proper taxi if a diesel-driven vehicle, which is

the usual type used. They evade the half-yearly

mechanical inspection of the road worthiness of

the vehicle and thus neglect proper maintenance of

the car to the peril of passengers and road users,

and there is no effective insurance cover for

passengers in case of an accident. In other words,

the pirate-taxi operator is an unscrupulous person

who seeks to earn his income through unfair

competition with licensed taxis by shirking

payment of his share of taxes and expenses of more

than $1,000 per annum. It is akin to the nefarious

activities of smuggling, for high profits

obtainable through evasion and non-payment of

customs or excise duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suggest legalisation of pirate taxis is

equivalent to suggesting legalisation of smuggling

activities! If we want law and order to prevail, I

am afraid we have no alternative but to take firm

action against the activities of pirate taxis.

Because of them, the earnings of licensed taxis

and of bus companies have been affected. Pirate

taxis do "cream" away business which is the

legitimate due of licensed taxis and buses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although over 1,000 pirate taxis have been

confiscated by the police and disposed of, there

are, unfortunately, many thousands still at large,

and they must continue to be severely dealt with

by the police, as they must learn to play

according to the rules and abide by the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of the social-minded and patriotic

attitude of licensed taxi-owners and taxi-drivers

as compared with pirate taxi operators, they have

recently organised themselves and donated one

day's earnings to our National Defence Fund



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - which I understand came

close to the very respectable figure of $100,000.

I would like publicly today to commend the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social

Affairs (as there are two Parliamentary

Secretaries in that Ministry, may I say that I

refer to the Member for Jalan Besar) and the

Member for Changi for their outstanding work in

organising this excellent drive for funds for our

National Defence Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I say that I shall be

guided by three general principles in the

discharge of my duties in the Ministry of

Communications:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to ensure dependability of transport

service, i.e., to provide a regular, efficient,

clean and courteous service to the public;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, speed of service, i.e., as quickly as

possible consistent with safety for passengers and

goods; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, lowest cost to the paying public, subject

however to both workers and management maintaining

high productivity and ensuring a reasonable return

for the capital invested.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's

Speech in this House on 6th May has indicated to

us the probabilities to be met with in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



the coming five years. Difficulties and problems

will arise by the end of 1971 when the British

finally withdraw all their armed forces. However,

plans have been made and will be carried out. In

fact, some of the plans have already been

implemented to overcome the problems and

difficulties to be faced. These are based on three

main objectives. The first objective is to ensure

the security o, the Republic. To achieve this, the

Government has taken positive steps to build up an

effective defence capability at minimum cost by

mobilising our youth in the National Defence

Forces. Every citizen between the ages of 18 and

21 is mobilised for part-time and full-time

service in the National Defence Forces. I fully

support this scheme which has already been carried

out. Not only is this a practical scheme that

ensures the security of the Republic, but by this

means the Government is also able to cut down

expenditure for economic development and progress

of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my fellow workers and I will

surely support the second objective of the

Government, which is to effect greater economic

growth, higher productivity with the elimination

of restrictive practices, more efficient

management, and to limit fringe benefits, Indeed

this objective will be of benefit to the employers

if it will provide more jobs and the workers'

interests can also be safeguarded; that is to say,

if all three parties - the employers, the

Government and the workers can benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to carry out the objective, it

would appear that it is the workers who will

suffer in consequence, and their day-to-day

livelihood will be affected, for in the memorandum

presented to Parliament as an Addendum to the

President's Speech, it is stated that a

comprehensive Employment Bill will be introduced

to standardise a working week of 44 hours for all

employees, to regulate overtime work and to limit

certain fringe benefits. This should be carefully

examined.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have stated earlier, my

fellow workers and I will surely give our

wholehearted support to the scheme if it will

truly benefit all the three parties concerned. But

what is feared is that this much awaited

opportunity will be seized upon by the employers

to exploit the workers by taking away all their

fringe benefits. The benefits which have been

enjoyed by the workers are a 39-hour week for non-industrial workers, a 44-hour week for industrial

workers, annual leave of at least two weeks for

workers under the Clerks Employment Ordinance, and

at least one week for workers under the Labour

Ordinance, 16 public holidays for clerks and 11

days for labourers, and other fringe benefits. So

for every nine non-industrial workers working 44

hours a week instead of 39 hours a week, one

person will be redundant. Similarly, annual leave,

public holidays and other fringe benefits will be

affected. This means that the scheme is not going

to provide more jobs to lessen the number of those

already unemployed as a result of retrenchment on

account of redundancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme of the Government, the effect of

which will be keenly felt by the workers, is with

regard to contributions to the Central Provident

Fund for all employees to enable them to buy

Housing and Development Board flats. This is an

excellent scheme and I support it a hundred per

cent, as employees will be able to buy Housing and

Development Board flats from their contributions.

However, we must also think of the pay they take

home every month which will be that much less by

the amount of the contribution. This means that

they will have less money for their day-to-day

expenses; even with their present earnings, they

can hardly keep pace with the rising cost of daily

necessities which can be seen in the Monthly

Digest 01 Statistics. I quote from Volume VII, No.

4 of April 1968:



<pre>

            Siam polishd rice 100 per cent

                 - 42 cents per katty in January 1967.

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<pre>

            Siam polished rice 100 per cent

                 - 50 cents per katty in January 1968.



            Siam polished rice, five per cent broken

                 - 39 cents per katty in January 1967.



            Siam polished rice, five per cent broken

                 - 47 cents per katty in January 1968.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other items such as -



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> What about wheat?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The price of wheat

has also increased:



<pre>

            47 cents per katty in January 1967.



            48 cents per katty in February 1968.

</pre>



Even ikan belis, which is the common food of the

ordinary worker, has risen from 92 cents per katty

in January 1967 to $1.01 per katty in January 1968

- an increase of nine Scents per katty. There are

many items which have increased in price from day

to day.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> What about blachan?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The price of

blachan has also increased from 51 cents per katty

in January 1967 to 56 cents per katty in January

1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> What about Indonesia and

Japan?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The charges for

hospital care for patients who have hitherto been

treated and fed free, and the increase in

outpatient charges will affect the livelihood of

the workers. Perhaps employees will get free

medical treatment as one of the fringe benefits

granted by employers as a result of the hard fight

put up by their trade unions. This scheme may not

be enjoyed by all employees if it is withdrawn by

the employers in view of the Government's scheme

to limit fringe benefits! But the wife and

children and other dependants of workers in need

of hospital or outpatient treatment will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



surely be made to pay the charges according to the

new scheme, and this will mean that the workers

again will suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my capacity as a trade union leader and

representative of the residents of Kampong

Kembangan, I very often receive accounts of the

hardships experienced by them, for in Kampong

Kembangan and the areas around, such as Kampong

Ubi and others, 90 per cent of the residents are

workers or wage-earners and they live in under-developed areas. The drains are choked with

overgrown grass and stagnant water. The Government

has not paid much attention to clearing the grass

from the drains so that the water will drain off

and mosquitoes will not breed. Rubbish is not

properly removed, thereby causing flies to breed.

These are sources of ill-health and sickness. That

is why I believe that the Government Outpatient

Clinic at Still Road is the best patronised of

Government clinics because of the lack of health

service amenities in the area! At this point, I

would ask the Ministry of Health to furnish this

House with the number of patients treated at every

outpatient clinic throughout the Republic for the

period 1st January, 1968, to 30th April, 1968, so

that we will be able to study the problem and know

which constituencies have many patients attending

the clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I trust that the Government, in

drawing up the new Employment Bill and planning to

increase hospital and out-patient charges and to

impose other taxes, will not adversely affect the

livelihood of workers with small incomes. The

Government should have prior consultations with

the national trade union movement in Singapore and

discussions with the National Trades Union

Congress, and I hope that their suggestions and

views will not be cold-shouldered by Government.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that those workers who

are members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



unions led by non-Communist leaders are patriotic,

have a strong sense of national consciousness, can

adjust themselves in the national interest and are

willing to place national interest above personal

or group interest. This can be seen from their

response to the Government's call to build a

strong and rugged society. A good number of our

workers have received training at the Youth

Training Centre at Buona Vista Road and many of

them have given a day's pay in response to the

call for contributions to the National Defence

Fund. Some have sacrificed one day's pay for work

done on a public holiday. My own union, the

Singapore Telephone Board Employees' Union, will

be donating a day's pay, and the Race Course

Workers' Union will be donating a day's pay for

work done on a public holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I support the Address moved 'by the Prime

Minister to thank the President for his speech in

the House. The Minister for Communications has

stated that the Member for Jalan Besar took pains

to get donations from taxi-drivers to the Defence

Fund. But apparently other hon. Members,

Parliamentary Secretaries, Ministers of State and

Ministers have not contributed. So I suggest that

they contribute a day's pay to the National

Defence Fund.



<br><br>3.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I touch on some of the

points brought up by Members of the House, let me

restate the salient points on educational policy

in the President's Speech to Parliament. These are

(a) more secondary students are to be diverted to

technical and vocational education; (b) a

concerted effort to be made to produce bilingual

school-leavers; (c) more attention is to be paid

to quality in education at all levels; and (d)

integration of schools is to be extended to aided

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we propose to achieve these targets? At

this stage, I can only tell the House what we have

already done so far which is consonant with the declared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



objectives. What we propose to do

specifically to attain the objectives will need

careful thinking and refining before

implementation. The machinery to bring about the

swing towards technical and vocational education

has already been set in motion. The Ministerial

Committee has already held its second meeting. The

beginnings of a separate administrative unit have

been identified and an executive director has been

appointed. Eventually the executive arm of the

council will have its own offices, its own staff

and its own budget. It will take over all

technical and vocational schools, vocational

institutes and co-ordinate technical courses at

Ngee Ann College and the Polytechnic below degree

or professional diploma level. It will reorganise

the curricula in technical and vocational schools

to lay more emphasis on practical training. It

will create new types of training establishments

for those who have left formal schooling and link

them up with existing training schemes such as the

dockyard training scheme of the Port of Singapore

Authority. In short, the Council will formulate

the policy, implement the decisions and co-ordinate the activities of all forms of technical

education and vocational training both within and

outside the formal school system at all levels

below tertiary institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target of making all school-leavers bilingual

is not a new one. But it is in the approach

towards this objective that we hope to break new

ground. Way back in 1965 we announced that a

second language would be made compulsory in the

secondary schools. Next year the first batch of

School Certificate students affected by this

decision will be sitting for compulsory second

language papers. These papers are compulsory in

the sense that candidates must sit for them. They

are not compulsory in the sense that a pass in the

second language is a "must" for passing the School

Certificate Examination as a whole. The rationale

behind our desire for bilingualism is really quite

simple. We are a small nation of only two million

people but we have no less than four official

languages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously we cannot make everybody quadrilingual.

On the other hand, if we are to remain

monolingual, we shall not be able to make

ourselves understood to one another, let alone

build a nation together. Bilingualism is,

therefore, not only a compromise but also a matter

of survival. What have we done for bilingualism so

far? I would say quite a lot, Mr Speaker, Sir,

but much of it is unpublicised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years past we have been sending teachers

abroad to undergo specialised training in the

teaching of English as a second language. They

have come back to pass on their expertise to other

teachers. Together with two British experts they

have been conducting in-service courses for all

teachers of English in non-English schools. This

exercise is now coming to an end, but fresh

courses will soon be organised for other teachers

who want to specialise in the teaching of English

as a second language so that a relief pool of such

specialist teachers can be built up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education

Council's Regional English Language Centre, an

interesting experiment is currently being

conducted to test the effectiveness of a new

language teaching technique involving the use of

sophisticated teaching machines. Our Educational

Television Service is diverting much more of its

limited resources to the teaching of English both

as a first and as a second language. If only the

planned expansion of the E.T.V, service were

allowed to proceed, much more could be done. Our

syllabus for English as a second language is being

over-hauled. Revision of the primary syllabus has

been completed and revision of the secondary

syllabus is in progress. We have also experimented

with the teaching of Mathematics using English as

the medium of instruction in some non-English

primary schools, and the results of the experiment

are encouraging. This is a new departure on which

we place our hope for the future. Our belief is

that fluency in the second language will improve

if it is used as a language of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



instruction for certain subjects in addition to

its being taught as a second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about Chinese as a second language? Mr

Speaker, Sir, the results so far have been

disappointing owing to historical reasons. It must

be remembered that Chinese as a second language

was introduced within comparatively recent times.

Moreover, the teaching of Chinese as a second

language is a subject in which we have no

specially trained teachers. There are experts who

very successfully teach Chinese as a foreign

language to people whose native tongue is not

Chinese. But there are no known experts who teach

Chinese to Chinese pupils whose first language is

English. This is not to say that we have done

nothing about it. An eminent teacher of Chinese as

a foreign language was invited to Singapore last

year to study the problem. Arising from his report

we hope to invite other experts to make a fuller

study and to tackle the problem in a systematic

and scientific way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our observations it would seem that the

older generation of bilingual people have

invariably started their education in their mother

tongue and then switched over to English at a

later stage. For example, all the Malay officers

in my Ministry who are bilingual went to Malay

primary schools and then switched over to English

secondary schools after a conversion year of

intensive English. This was because in those days

there was no secondary education in the Malay

medium. But now that we have established secondary

education in the Malay medium, we seem to be less

successful in producing Malay school leavers who

are bilingual in Malay and English. Similarly, the

Chinese officers in my Ministry who are bilingual

went through a similar transition; in this case

not for lack of secondary education in the Chinese

medium but by free choice. On the other hand,

those pupils who begin their education in English

have found it much more difficult to learn their

mother tongue as a second language even though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



they are taught that language from Primary I

onwards. If there is any truth in this

observation, the way to bilingualism would seem to

lie in beginning formal education in the mother

tongue for a few years, then switching to English

as the medium of instruction whilst retaining the

mother tongue as a second language. To achieve

quality in education the first prerequisite is

better teachers. Better teachers require better

teacher training, and better teacher training

means, amongst other things, full-time teacher

training. Two years ago, we made the first

tentative reversion to full-time training and the

first batch of teachers so trained have just

passed out from the Teachers' Training College.

More and more of such teachers will be trained in

the years to come while the number of part-time

trainees will be reduced correspondingly. In two

or three years' time, we shall not be recruiting

part-time trainees at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, quality in education demands better

facilities. In the provision of school buildings,

playing fields, sports and other equipment, we in

Singapore are second to none in Asia.

Unfortunately, we have still to use our schools

for two shifts. A gradual reversion to single-session schools will be made, but because of the

scarcity of land, only a limited number of

secondary schools will in the end enjoy this

privilege. Here we propose to begin at the top

with the pre-university classes. The first junior

college at Linden Drive catering exclusively for

pre-university students will open in January next

year. It will be a single-session college with

many more facilities than are available at present

to pre-university students in schools. Although

the existing pre-university students attend school

only in the morning, they have to vacate their

classrooms at 1.00 p.m, for other students in the

lower forms of the afternoon session, and they do

not have exclusive use of the playing field and

other facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opening of the first junior college,

pre-university education in Singapore will enter a new

phase and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



students will enjoy a corporate life much more

akin to that of a university. Research of the

right kind will also help us achieve quality

mainly by eliminating waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has suggested that we

should set up an independent research unit. I

would have thought that the University of

Singapore would have been the ideal place for

education research. But apparently nothing much

has been done there apart from dissertations by

students for their Master's degree in Education.

In the absence of leadership in educational

research from the obvious quarter, my Ministry has

had to set up its own modest research and

statistics department. This department has been in

existence for barely a year and some of its

established posts have yet to be filled.

Nevertheless, it has already completed three small

projects: a survey of educational wastage in

Singapore in the past two years, a study of the

correlation of the performance of 200 pupils in

the 1960 Primary School Leaving Examination and

their performance in the 1964 School Certificate

Examination, a survey of the teaching of

Mathematics using English as the medium of

instruction in Government Chinese Primary I and

Primary II classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Teachers' Training College too, there has

been a revival of research activity. During the

past year, two modest projects were completed. One

is a study of the motives for choosing teaching as

a career published under the title of Why Teach,

and the other is a study of the trainee teacher's

attitude towards supervision of classroom teaching

which will be published soon. A number of other

research projects are either in progress or at the

planning stage in both the Teachers' Training

College and the Ministry's department of research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the fourth and last objective

- that of extending integration to the aided

schools. Here, we have formulated no hard and fast

rule. The initiative for integration should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



come from the aided schools themselves. But

clearly there is need for something to be done

soon. As of last year, there were 87 integrated

schools, all of them Government schools with a

total enrolment of over 130,000. To date, there is

not a single integrated aided school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me next turn to some of the

suggestions made by Members of this House. One

Member suggested that the Primary School Leaving

Examination be abolished and a new examination be

instituted at Secondary II level. Another Member

suggested that channelling of students into the

technical, vocational and academic streams should

be done at the Secondary II level rather than

after Primary 6. These two suggestions which are

inter-related are professionally sound. As a

matter of fact, the very same proposals were

incorporated in a paper on educational policy

submitted by my Ministry to the Government some

years ago. The difficulty in accepting such a

proposition is that it would mean automatic

promotion to the secondary school for all. And

taking into account two chances of repeat between

Primary I and Secondary II and two more years of

secondary schooling after Secondary II in one form

or another, we would have to provide in excess of

10 years of education for a great number of

pupils. This was something we could not afford

even in the days when there was no need to build

up a defence capability. However, I am firmly of

the view, which is backed by professional officers

of my Ministry, that every child should have eight

years of general education before he is channelled

into technical, vocational or academic education.

We are of this view, firstly, because 14 years is

considered the minimum age at which a child is

mature enough to begin specialisation. And,

secondly, because eight years is considered the

minimum period necessary for acquiring the basic

language and mathematical skills with which to

learn other specialised skills. With eight years

of general education, a child of average

intelligence will, in fact, have reached the

Secondary II level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others with less than average intelligence,

they may have reached only Primary 6 or Secondary

I level. There is, therefore, a fundamental

difference between channelling at Secondary II and

channelling after eight years of general

education. That eight years of general education

before specialisation is desirable is

indisputable. But the question is whether we can

afford even this more modest proposal as a result

of the build-up in defence. The decision does not

rest with my Ministry or the Ministry of Finance.

It rests with the Government and it can only be

made after very careful weighing of our

priorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say a few words for the

benefit of those who are impatient for change.

There is no advantage in change for change's sake.

In education above all else, we must move with

prudence and w it h caution, especially in a small

multi-racial and multi-lingual nation whose

economy and whose survival depends on stability.

Let us not forget the trials and tribulations that

we have undergone as a result of educational

reform in the not too distant past. Let us look

beyond our shores to nations with much older

educational systems and see for ourselves the

troubles that they are undergoing right now. Let

us remember that with over a quarter of our entire

population in school, any change that we make will

affect every man, woman and child in our Republic

directly or indirectly. Let us remember too that

any experiment we perform in education has to use

children for guinea pigs and any mistake we make

now will show up only in the next generation.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, let me join hon. Members in thanking the

President for delivering his speech in which he

has outlined the three objectives that the

Government will seek to achieve in the crucial

years ahead. The workers of Singapore recognise

the need for the attainment of these objectives,

namely, (1) effective defence capability; (2)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



greater economic growth; and (3) enhancement of

national consciousness. As outlined by the

President, the crucial problems are unusual in

magnitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organised workers of Singapore, as led by the

National Trades Union Congress, are not only

conscious of but also concerned with the problems

that our Republic has to face in the difficult

years ahead. Recognising this crisis that we have

to face and realising that everyone in Singapore

will have to make sacrifices to achieve economic

success for Singapore, the National Trades Union

Congress Delegates' Conference on 7th April, 1968.

passed a special resolution giving the Government

its co-operation and support in the initiation and

formulation of emergency measures that may be

deemed necessary. The President too has indicated

that sacrifice and greater effort is needed as we

face an emergency situation. I wholeheartedly

agree that emergency measures are necessary when

we are faced with grave problems of economic

adjustment of a temporary nature. We are confident

that the crisis we face is of a temporary nature

and that this Government is capable of solving the

problems by 1971. Unfortunately, we have the

bitter experience in this part of the world that

sometimes emergency legislation passed somehow or

other becomes permanent even after the end of the

emergency. I sincerely hope that the emergency

labour legislation that is to be moved in

Parliament will not become permanent even after

the crisis is over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the special resolution passed by

the delegates of the National Trades Union

Congress, the workers of Singapore are willing to

make sacrifices, but are not willing to commit

suicide. The trust and the faith the people of

Singapore have placed on the People's Action Party

Government in electing all the 58 Members of

Parliament shows that the people of Singapore

expect us to solve the problems that we face by

1971. For the survival of Singapore, solve them we

must. The workers of Singapore are willing to

tighten up their belts by two inches or, if

necessary, even three inches in order to overcome

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



temporary setbacks. But if we expect them to

remove their belts from their waists and hang

themselves, they will never do it. They recognise

that the Government is pro-labour in its outlook

and it is our duty to see that this recognition is

maintained. Co-operation between labour and the

Government has not been lacking so far, although

in a number of issues disagreements have been

recorded. The workers of Singapore have fully co-operated with the Government in the national and

wider interests of the country. Similarly, we

expect the Government's co-operation and

consultation with the labour movement in Singapore

when contemplating labour legislation. During this

period of consultation, I hope the

representations, proposals or amendments as

proposed by the National Trades Union Congress to

the Bill will be accepted by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not disillusion the workers.

Disillusionment will lead to frustration and we do

not want a labour situation like the one that

existed in Singapore in the late 1950s and early

1960s. Let us not forget that the Communist-led

trade unions are still around the corner waiting

to exploit any feeling of frustration amongst the

workers. Let us also remember that trained

Communist cadres are watching from the sidelines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall comment further on various aspects of the

Bill, when it is introduced in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out in the President's Speech, the Bill

will seek to provide a standard working week of 44

hours for all employees. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

said, that this will standardise and regulate the

terms and conditions of employment for workmen,

clerks and shop assistants. We now have about

137,000 workmen and industrial clerks who work 44

hours a week. We also have about 28,500 shop

assistants who also work 44 hours a week. In other

words, we have about 165,500 registered workers

who work 44 hours a week and only about 33,500

clerks who work 39 hours a week. Therefore, what

the legislation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



will bring about is that these 33,500 clerks will

be required to do an additional 5 hours per week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out in the Addendum to the President's

Speech, this new legislation also seeks to

regulate overtime and to enable a wider spread of

employment. Sir, this legislation will certainly

curtail the overtime of clerks, but will it spread

employment? As a result of the increased hours of

work, will it result in retrenchment? Will there

be safeguards for employees so that they will not

lose their jobs as a result of increased working

hours? These are questions that will have to be

carefully considered and the drafting of the Bill

can best be done with close consultation with the

trade union movement in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions in Singapore look forward to the day

of full employment. They realise that there is

large-scale unemployment in Singapore, and unless

and until everybody is employed, labour will be

exploited. Will this legislation that is to be

introduced be used by employers to exploit their

employees? Will the increase in hours of work for

clerks remove the social differences that the blue-collar workers feel exist between them and the

white-collar workers? By increasing the working

hours of clerks from 39 hours to 44 hours a week,

we are not showing that the blue-collar workers

are as good as, if not better than, the white-collar workers. We are just showing that the

clerks are just as bad as the blue-collar workers.

Let us remember that not all employers in

Singapore are angels. There will be many who will

utilise this legislation to exploit workers for

their own benefit. On Friday, we heard the Member

for River Valley pay a glowing tribute to the

workers of Singapore. Speaking as an employer, he

praised the workers of Singapore and assured that

the employers will not exploit this piece of

legislation. But Sir, not all employers are as

enlightened as the Member for River Valley.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also aware that there are employers

in Singapore who prefer to give overtime

employment rather than employ new employees. How

are we going to curb them? The Minister for Labour

will have to consider all these questions very

carefully before the Bill is introduced in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also point out now that the N.T.U.C, is

fully committed to increasing productivity and has

done and is doing all it can to increase

productivity. The National Productivity Centre at

Jurong was set up by the Economic Development

Board principally through the motivating power of

the N.T.U.C. The N.T.U.C, propagates and advances

the view amongst its members and the Government

that increased productivity is something to strive

for. It also seeks ways to inculcate in workers

that mass productivity means progressive

improvement in the conditions of labour. Increased

hours of work alone will not result in increased

productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the move by the

Government to include employees of Government,

statutory boards and self-employed persons as

contributors to the Central Provident Fund, in

addition to pensions or other provident fund

benefits. This will go a long way towards

compulsory savings and increasing the funds for

industrial financing by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home ownership scheme to be introduced will

encourage and induce more construction not only of

Housing Board flats but also private building

construction. However, it is noted in the Addendum

to the President's Speech that the scheme being

worked out between the Ministry of Labour and the

Housing and Development Board will only enable

balances in the present Central Provident Fund to

be set off against the first instalment of Housing

Board fiats. However, the Central Provident Fund

contributions can be used to pay off monthly

instalments for both Housing Board flats and

privately built homes. The Government should also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



consider whether the present Central Provident

Fund contributors can use their present balance as

a first instalment for privately built homes as

well, instead of confining them to Housing Board

flats. I welcome another excellent feature that is

contemplated, that is, the lowering of the

assessment in the home-ownership scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the head Ministry of Education, I

wholeheartedly agree with the comments made by the

Members for Katong, Serangoon Gardens, Paya Lebar

and Bukit Panjang, notwithstanding the answer

given by the Minister for Education. I am pleased

to note that a few well established secondary

schools will be converted to single-session

schools. Now that the quantitative target has been

achieved, we should also think in terms of not

only converting more schools to single-session

schools but also reducing the number of classrooms

in each school. It is to be noted that schools in

the last few years have become immense factories

where, in some instances, the staff is so very

large that the principal, who has to be a

professional guide to the teachers, is not even

able to know all the teachers by their names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1950s, we had schools with not more than

13 classes in each session. They were managed by

two principals, one in the morning and one in the

afternoon. Today, we have schools with 30 to 40

classrooms in each session. They are managed by

one principal who is expected to supervise the

teachers and students of both sessions, which is

humanly impossible. Now that we have reached the

stage of qualitative education, although we may

not be able to have one session in every school,

we should make a start by at least appointing one

principal for one session, which will improve the

situation somewhat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Phua Bah Lee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to support the motion of  the  Prime

Minister thanking the President for his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his speech has warned us of the

serious  problems that will have to be faced.  All

sensible  people will take this warning seriously.

With  the British withdrawal, we will not only  be

losing  a  major source of income, but  will  also

have  to  meet heavy expenditure to  build  up  an

adequate  defence  force within  a  short  period.

These are no small problems and it will be foolish

to  pretend  that they are. Some of the  steps  to

overcome these difficulties are explained in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



the  Addendum to the President's Speech and in the

Ministerial  statements. These will  minimise  the

effects of the British withdrawal, but it will  be

too  much to hope that the normal standard of life

to  which  we  are accustomed will be  unaffected.

With the loss of a major source of income and  the

expenditure of a large portion of our resources on

defence,   there  will  be  less   available   for

consumption. We must therefore be prepared  for  a

more  Spartan life during the transitional  period

of  the  next five or ten years until our  economy

has stabilised under new conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting ourselves to new conditions may not be

easy. Giving up luxuries which we used to take for

granted  may not be pleasant, but they  are  small

sacrifices for a better and more secure future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown us that whether a nation will

prosper or perish depends on its ability to change

and  adapt. Even great nations had floundered  and

gone  into oblivion for clinging to old ways  that

no longer suited changed conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill which seeks to regulate terms

of  employment to meet the challenges of today is,

therefore, to be welcomed. No doubt it will not be

well  received by those who make it their  purpose

of  life to expend the least effort and to grab as

much  as possible by abusing every privilege  that

is  available. Such people are not only unfair  to

their employers, but also to society at large and,

finally to themselves as well. Under conditions of

a  colonial  administration where  the  Government

tried  to exploit the country and employers  tried

to  exploit workers to the full, attempts  to  get

their  own back on their employers were excusable.

Such  behaviour,  however, is unpardonable  in  an

independent  country striving for  survival.  Here

every  one must pull his weight. There can  be  no

place for passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the proposal to extend the range

of  contributors to the Central provident Fund  to

mobilise savings. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



need for increased funds to meet the heavy cost of

measures  to counter the economic effects  of  the

British  withdrawal  has  been  explained  in  the

statement by the Minister for Finance.. Mobilising

savings  by  increasing the number of contributors

is one of the most painless ways of doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it is not the intention, the extension of

contributors  to include Government  servants  has

also  the  effect  of remedying the  situation  of

Government  servants having inadequate savings  on

their  retirement. As an ex-civil servant, I  know

how  modest is the sum known as gratuity  which  a

Government servant gets on retirement. An  officer

who  had  reached  the  very  top  found,  on  his

retirement,  that  his gratuity  was  insufficient

even  to  buy  a modest house. The Provident  Fund

contributions  will be a very useful  addition  to

what an officer will get under the Pension Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while on this subject, I wish

to  correct  a  wrong impression  which  the  hon.

Member for Punggo1 might have created when he said

that   by   including   Government   servants   as

contributors  to  the Central  Provident  Fund,  a

Government  servant will then benefit  three  ways

for  his  services: namely, pension, gratuity  and

Central  Provident  Fund  contributions.  What  is

commonly   known   as  gratuity   payable   to   a

pensionable officer on his retirement is  actually

no  more  than  an  advance of pension,  which  is

recovered from the retired officer by paying him a

reduced  pension. Therefore, it is part of pension

and cannot be deemed a separate benefit.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to support the Prime

Minister's  motion of thanks to the President  for

his speech at the opening session of Parliament on

Monday  last.  The  President in  his  speech  has

outlined  three  important  objectives  which  the

Government  will strive to achieve over  the  next

five   years.  The  three  objectives   constitute

fundamental issues which must be achieved  by  the

people  of  Singapore  if we  truly  want  to  see

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



succeed and the country capable of standing on her

own feet and capable of defending her independence

and  sovereignty until the end of  time.  What  we

have   to  do  now  is  to  utilise  every  second

available   to  us  to  strengthen  our  country's

defences. At the moment, we have already a  strong

army.  We need also a powerful navy and air force.

Together with Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and

Britain,  we  hope  our  country  will   have   an

effective  defence capability which can  not  only

ensure the security of our nation but also be able

to  contribute to the security of this part of the

world.  In  fact, Singapore's security  cannot  be

divorced  from  the  security  of  the  whole   of

Southeast  Asia. The Second World War  has  proved

that when Singapore capitulated to the enemy,  the

whole  of  Southeast Asia fell to the enemy.  With

modern  equipment  now available,  we  can  easily

imagine that if Singapore falls into enemy  hands,

not  only will Southeast Asia fall but the  entire

region   of   Australasia  will  face   the   same

catastrophe.  This demonstrates the importance  of

our   having   defence   co-operation   with   all

Commonwealth countries in this part of the  world.

We  must  have  an adequate defence capability  to

ensure political stability in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next five years, we will be confronted

with a multitude of problems which will affect our

lives. For us every problem has its solution.  Let

us say to history, "We will decide on your destiny

and  not  vice  versa."  Any  nation  that  allows

history  to  determine  its  destiny  will  become

bankrupt and decadent. Let us determine the course

of  history. Let us influence history.  We  should

not allow history to influence our destiny. If  we

can move ahead of history we will forever be safe.

We  will forever prosper and forge ahead. If we do

not wish history to decide on our destiny, we must

have   a  disciplined  society,  a  society   with

collective  leadership such as we have  today.  We

need to have a society which can be likened to  an

army. If we succeed, it will be a victory for  all

the people of Singapore. If we fail, it will be  a

defeat for them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, events have shown that we are

well  on  the road to success. I believe that  the

three  objectives enunciated by the  President  in

his  speech will be brought to fruition. The  next

five  years shall witness the establishment  of  a

disciplined  and rugged society, but efforts  must

also   be  made  to  ensure  the  creation  of   a

productive society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we must now start to

consider  the possibility of having as our  future

slogan  the establishment of a productive society.

We must be productive in economy and productive in

politics.  We  must also be socially and  mentally

productive.  But for God's sake, let  us  be  less

productive in human procreation.



<br><br>5.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the President's Speech and

the  Addendum  to  the speech in  general.  But  I

should  also ask to be allowed to say a few  words

on the objectives of the Government as outlined in

the  President's  Speech.  That  economic  growth,

especially   in   the  direction   of   increasing

productivity,  be  the Government's  objective  is

praiseworthy. That high morale, internationally or

internally,   be   another   objective   is   also

praiseworthy.  The fact is that  high  morale  and

economic growth go hand in hand. In order that the

people  can  be  spurred  on  to  greater  efforts

towards the economic growth and prosperity of  the

nation,  the people's morale must be kept high.  I

am  referring  to the high morale consequent  upon

the confidence which



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Cheong, can you speak a little

slower?  I think the interpreters are having  some

difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Yes, Sir,I am

referring to the high morale consequent  upon  the

confidence  which the people will  have  in  being

able  to  seek  a  better and higher  standard  of

living.  For it must be remembered that while  the

Government may measure economic growth in terms of

the  gross national product, the ordinary citizens

measure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



economic  growth  in terms of per  capita  income.

Further, income is here seen not just in terms  of

dollars and cents and what that money can buy, but

also in terms of what may be broadly called fringe

benefits.  Sad  to  say, it  is  in  the  proposed

Employment  Bill that Government policy  is  cock-eyed. Take the extension of the 39-hour week to  a

44-hour  week.  We  are  all  aware  that  a  high

percentage  of the economically-active  population

are  unemployed. Even way back in 1965  we  had  a

labour  force  of  573,000 of  whom  502,400  were

employed.  On  the  basis  of  the  recent  Sample

Household  Survey  and population  projections,  a

total  of  827,775 is estimated to be  the  labour

force in 1977. This works out to be a labour force

growth rate of 3.5 per cent per annum between 1966

and  1977. This, it may interest the House, is 1.3

per cent higher than the decade from 1957 to 1966,

the  decade  which represents the full  impact  of

Singapore's  population  explosion.  Incidentally,

who   says  that  Singapore's  population  is  not

productive? In short, if our labour force in  1977

is  to  be  completely  employed,  something  like

308,000 additional jobs will have to be created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic premise of the proposed Employment

Bill  is "to enable a wider spread of employment".

This,  if  I may be allowed to say, is a  laudable

objective,  bearing in mind that we  have  a  high

rate  of  the population dependent on the earnings

of   only  a  comparatively  small  income-earning

group.  This goal of the Government, if  achieved,

will  go  towards  promoting economic  growth  and

raising morale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, it may be asked, does it bring about high

morale?  It  is evident by way of an  illustration

that  a  man with five mouths to feed will  surely

feel greatly relieved when his son gets a job, let

alone the prospect of a bigger family income.  The

fact  that  there is one dependent  less  to  feed

means  that  there is more to go round  the  rest.

Therefore, the Government's objectives of economic

growth and high morale cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



but  gain high commendation. But does the proposed

legislation  of  a 44-hour week help  in  any  way

towards  achieving these two objectives?  Further,

does it in any way help towards a wider spread  of

employment?  Sir, I respectfully  submit  that  it

does  not.  I  am,  of course,  not  unaware  that

certain   categories  of  workers  are   presently

engaged  on  a  44-hour  week.  Extension  of  the

present  39-hour week involves the working  of  an

additional   five  hours  per  week  per   worker.

Assuming  that 50 per cent of our employed  labour

force  of 502,000 put in the additional five hours

per  week,  this would total 1,255,000  hours  per

week.  If  these  workers had continued  with  the

existing  39-hour  week, about  32,000  additional

jobs  could  be  created.  Sir,  I  repeat  32,000

additional jobs. This is surely a figure to reckon

with in terms of economic growth and high morale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of regulation of over-time, I

should like the House to see this in the light  of

the  proposed 44-hour week as against the  39-hour

week.  The  additional five hours  per  week  that

would  be  so affected represents a loss  of  five

hours  per  week  of  overtime earnings.  This  is

certainly  not  a  situation  conducive  to   high

morale.  I  do  not suggest for  one  moment  that

excessive  over-time should be encouraged  in  the

face  of massive unemployment. But the basis  upon

which  excessive over-time must be  curbed  is  so

that  people  can be employed and national  income

may be increased. The basis is not for the purpose

of  exploitation of labour. Yet this  is  what  it

will  amount to if overtime work is curbed on  the

one  hand  and hours of work are extended  on  the

other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear, that this so-called comprehensive

Employment Bill that is to come is nothing  but  a

cock-eyed and retrogressive policy. It  is  to  be

noted that among the measures to be implemented in

order  to achieve the objective of economic growth

is  one  which  seeks  to  "limit  certain  fringe

benefits    to   lessen   abuses   and    increase

productivity". I propose to deal with  the  aspect

of productivity first.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the ultimate goal of increased

productivity is to raise the standard  of  living,

not  the  cost of living. In other words,  such  a

drive  is  calculated to achieve greater  economic

growth  and high morale. This is certainly another

laudable move. The success of a productivity drive

may best be evidenced in the lowering of prices of

goods  and services. It has been mentioned earlier

that   the  sum  total  of  a  man's  high  morale

constitutes, amongst other things, not merely  his

income, but rather what his money can buy. Is  any

drive to increase productivity likely to result in

lower  price levels? I humbly submit, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that the chances are not too bright. At least

not   unless   some  form  of  price  control   is

established.  I submit the following  reasons  for

maintaining  price  controls which  are  necessary

before lower domestic prices can result:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Protection of infant industries,

necessitating the imposition of import quotas  and

restrictions. This results in an immediate rise in

prices of commodities, i.e., a price mark-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When these same commodities are produced in

Singapore, the prices are the same, if not  higher

than the marked-up prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Even when productivity is increased by virtue

of   the  smallness  of  the  local  market,   the

producers  are  not  likely to  demonstrate  their

concern for lower prices of their commodities.  In

short,  coupled with the continued  protection  of

industries,  a  take-it-or-leave-it attitude  will

prevail.   Who   then  benefits   from   increased

productivity? Not the workers who have sweated for

it  and  not the consumers in the domestic market.

For  these  reasons, there arises the urgent  need

for  a  system  of  controls which  will  make  it

imperative for producers to lower their prices. If

such  a  system of controls is not established  to

give  an  assurance  of just rewards,  it  is  not

unreasonable   to  say  that  our   workers   will

participate  in  this  productivity   drive   with

suspicion.  For  it would be a fair  question  for

them to ask, "Why should I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



sweat  it  out so that my employer can  make  more

exorbitant profits at my expense?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, it should be borne in mind that

many of these ventures are either foreign-owned or

joint  ventures with high participation by foreign

capital.  The outflow of profits would, therefore,

affect our balance of payments position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of limiting certain fringe

benefits to lessen abuses, I should like to hazard

a few guesses as to what this would mean. It would

mean that paid annual leave will be reduced. As to

how much is another question. It would mean that a

number  of  paid public holidays will be  out.  It

would  mean that the worker's entitlement of  sick

leave  will be reduced whether drastically or  not

is  to  be  seen.  Sir, I am  wondering  what  the

Government  seeks  to drive at  by  limiting  such

fringe  benefits. Does the Government hope,  along

with the proposed 44-hour week, to provide a wider

spread  of  employment? If the answer  is  in  the

affirmative,  then I beg to submit that  something

has  gone wrong with my little head and the  heads

of many people who share my view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of limiting fringe benefits are not

inconsequential  in terms of  morale  as  well  as

money.  When examined closely, this is  tantamount

to a subtle wage cut. Mr Speaker, Sir, I repeat -

a  subtle wage cut. I am not an economist, but the

House  will  recall  that  not  so  long  ago  the

necessity    for   expenditure   was   emphasised,

expenditure  to counter recession.  The  necessity

for  expenditure  was argued on  the  ground  that

"expenditure   generates   income   and    creates

employment".  My  argument is this.  In  order  to

spend, we need income. If income is cut, how  much

can we spend? Further, as presented earlier, there

is  the  argument for non-extension of the 39-hour

week  on the ground that additional jobs will then

be  created.  With the availability  of  jobs  and

income,  expenditure  is  forthcoming.  All   this

results   again   in  the  creation   of   further

employment,  greater  economic  growth  and   high

morale.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not unaware of the proposed second Central

Provident Fund contribution which, for the purpose

of  collective bargaining, would count as part  of

the  wage  bill.  But I have doubts  whether  this

compulsory contribution will be able to offset the

losses  that  arise  with the proposed  Employment

Bill.  The  spate of retrenchment has grown  quite

alarmingly.  I  fear that the proposed  Employment

Bill  will aggravate the situation, not mentioning

the  temptation  of  management  to  misuse  their

authority. In this connection, I would support the

hon. Member who spoke before me and would urge the

Government to consider seriously the setting up of

a  retrenchment  and!  or  unemployment  insurance

scheme.  The  ranks of the unemployed are  already

massive  without  the retrenched workers  swelling

their  ranks. The price we have to pay for such  a

restive, displaced and literate population is  too

heavy.   In  many  developing  countries,  Marxist

theory  has won great appeal. Our task is  to  see

that  this threat does not become real. If radical

changes must come, be it in the Employment Bill or

elsewhere,  I plead that this threat be  borne  in

mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the proposed additional Central

Provident    Fund   contributions    are    indeed

commendable.  I  should like to consider  this  in

relation to the civil service employees when  they

resign.  The  present Government  regulations  are

such  that when an employee resigns, he  does  not

get   a   cent  by  way  of  gratuity  or  accrued

retirement benefits. This is the case irrespective

of  whether  the employee has served  five  or  15

years. We are all agreed that such regulations are

trappings  of a colonial era intended  to  exploit

the  workers  in  a colony. We are further  agreed

that  the  Government, being the largest employer,

must be a model employer in terms of fairness  and

justice to its employees. I maintain that  if  the

Government is a government of the people, it  must

rid  itself of the vestiges of colonial  trappings

and  give  its employees a fair deal. I  therefore

urge   the   Government   to   consider   granting

gratuities and such other relevant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



benefits when their employees resign.. Forfeitures

may possibly be made where an employee resigns  in

order  to  avoid dismissal. Such entitlement  then

may  be  put  into  the  proposed  second  Central

Provident Fund contribution scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have stated at the outset

that I have only a few words to say, but perhaps I

ought  to  amend that by saying that  I  have  had

quite  a  few words to say. I should like  to  end

here  as  I began, by saying that except  for  the

views  expressed by me, I support the  President's

Speech.



<br><br>5.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, every head of state of a country has

to  make  a  policy  statement.  Perhaps  in  some

countries, the delivering of the policy  statement

will be merely an official ceremony. Singapore  is

now  an  independent Republic after 150  years  of

existence, and the President delivered the  policy

statement  at  a time when new faces  appeared  in

this  House  to  instil  a  new  spirit  into  the

leadership of our country. This is a milestone  in

our  social  development and it also reflects  the

direction  of the social development  and  changes

that  will come about. We do not have to wait  for

five  years to judge the results and the worth  of

the  policy  statement delivered by the  President

because  it is well planned. At the same time,  we

have   a   strong  and  dynamic  leadership   and,

therefore,  we  can  foresee the  results  of  the

policy statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's Speech has made

us   understand  that  not  only  is  our  society

changing  but  the whole of South  and  South-east

Asia  is  also changing. We must be awake to  this

situation. We must recognise our attitude and  the

work   we  are  doing,  which  are  factors   that

contribute  to  the  changes. Although  we  cannot

foresee  future events in detail, we can make  use

of   existing   factors   to   create   favourable

conditions  and  guide the trend of  events  in  a

direction that is more favourable to us. In order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



to   achieve   this,  we  must  first  consolidate

ourselves.  The more stable our society,  and  the

more consolidated we are, the greater will be  our

influence  over these changes. I call  this  trend

stabilising  strength.  Generally,  when  we  talk

about  stabilising strength, we do not  mean  just

economic  and  defence strength.  The  comparative

strength  in party politics should also  be  taken

into  account. The present phenomenon of one party

in  this House is also a valid reflection  on  the

comparative  political party  strength.  But  this

comparative strength comes within a constitutional

scope.  The  existence of one party in this  House

and  the  near  unanimous opinion of  its  Members

should not be interpreted as the proportion of the

comparative political strength among the people to

be  100  to  one  without any latent  or  apparent

opposition force. But it cannot be denied that the

existence   of  one  party  in  this   House   can

adequately   reflect   the  comparative   strength

between   the  majority  party  and  the  minority

extremists.  In fact, the victory of democracy  is

normally   defined   by  majority   support.   Our

democratic  victory is true and reliable,  because

the  existence of only one party in this House  is

the result of the general consent of the people of

Singapore through democratic elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason lies in the fact that in the

history of Singapore since 1946 - two decades  ago

-  political  victories could only be won  through

constitutional channels. Constitutional  victories

have  been won by the democratic socialists.  Such

examples are not lacking. On the other hand, we do

not   see  many  such  victories  going   to   the

Communists.  It  is  very seldom  that  they  have

achieved  victory  through  constitutional  means.

Today,  we  know that our democratic  victory  has

been  achieved in a series of waves which are  not

isolated  from one another. Our victory  has  been

won on a constitutional basis. But the changes  in

turbulent  South and Southeast Asia  and  even  in

larger international confines are not entirely  in

keeping   with  constitutional  development.   For

instance,   the   war  in   Vietnam   is   not   a

constitutional war. Not one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



bomb  dropped  in Vietnam is done constitutionally

by  a  prior statement to that effect. Many of  my

colleagues  and I appeared on the political  scene

when  politics reached a decisive stage at a  time

when   there   was   a   struggle   against    the

Constitution.   Some  of  us  went   through   the

constitutional  upheaval when  Singapore  withdrew

from  Malaysia.  We  should, in  our  minds,  make

certain  preparations to meet the changes, whether

our  feeling is one of hardship after  the  trials

and  tribulations  or one of  great  daring  after

overcoming  these difficulties.  The  greater  our

achievements, the greater is our need  for  making

these preparations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak more

about  these  preparations. The first  concept  in

making  these preparations is to have the  fullest

control over the time and human factors so that we

can progress as fast as possible. In this respect,

we cannot remain static in our approach or adopt a

wait-and-see attitude. We should try  to  progress

as fast as possible. We should try to run a 3,000-metre

race at a speed as if we are running a  100-metre  race.

It is only in this way that  we  can

ensure  our survival. This principle is  known  by

many of our neighbouring countries. We are not the

only   people   who  know  about  this.   We   are

endeavouring  to  develop  aviation  whereas   our

neighbouring   country,   Malaysia,   is   already

negotiating   a  civil  aviation  agreement   with

Indonesia and relaxing some of the restrictions on

aviation.  Furthermore, Indonesia is  prepared  to

train Malaysian pilots. Mr Speaker, Sir, when  we

are  doing this, we cannot help thinking  that  we

are  a  small  country. In terms of  manpower,  we

should  equate  one man to 100 men.  In  terms  of

expenditure, we should equate $1 to $100. In other

words, we should try to achieve maximum results at

a  minimum cost. In terms of time, one year to  us

should  be longer than 100 years to other  people.

Of  course, this does not mean that we live  in  a

fairy  land where seven days are equated to  1,000

years.  Rather  we should try to  strive  for  the

highest value in every respect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I go on now to the second

concept  in making these preparations. Put simply,

it   is  this.  Our  basic  standpoint  should  be

inflexible, but in strategy we should be flexible.

If we make these preparations, even though we have

won  our constitutional struggle, we will  not  be

like  the  Romans in history who, while they  were

still  dreaming beautiful dreams, were invaded  by

the barbarians and as a result, their civilisation

was   destroyed.  Although  they   preserved   the

Justinian Roman law or legal code, it was  no  use

to them. One of our objectives should be to try to

have    the    constitutional    supersede     the

unconstitutional. When we talk about  flexibility,

I think we should take note that in our Parliament

we  have  only  one party. This, however,  is  not

contrary to the spirit of democracy. It is  merely

an expression of democratic strength which has led

to  the  creation of a somewhat unusual situation.

The  main reason is that the democratic system has

a   certain  tradition  which  is  based  on   the

Westminster  model. Therefore, by comparison,  our

democratic  system  is  rather  new.   We   should

therefore  adapt  ourselves,  in  concept  and  in

theory,  to  the democratic system. In  any  case,

although  we  have only one party  in  Parliament,

this  does  not  mean  that we  have  a  one-party

autocracy. Our constitution still provides for  an

Opposition  party and it can enter  Parliament  by

taking  part  in  democratic elections.  What  the

Communists want is a one-party autocracy.  If  our

party  were  a one-party autocracy, we would  have

gained  the  praise and support of  the  Communist

Party.  However,  the  slanderous  and  derogatory

remarks made by the Communists on Parliament  show

that we do not have a one-party autocracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that in transplanting the

democratic system from Western soil to Asia, there

are difficulties involved. These can be likened to

the  difficulties  that beset a heart  transplant.

For  example, in the case of Burma - the  Chairman

of  the Revolutionary Council of Burma, General Ne

Win, came to Singapore recently -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



social  democracy was practised at one  time.  But

later they had to abolish the traditional election

system.  In fact, in some developing countries  in

Africa,  there has emerged one school  of  thought

which holds that the one-party system rather  than

a  multi-party  system  is  necessary  during  the

transitional   period  between  independence   and

stability.  For  example,  in  Kenya,  there   was

practice  of  a  one-party system  for  some  time

before  the multi-party system was revived in  the

face  of great stability. In Tanzania, we can  see

the  present  practice  of a democratic  one-party

system.  What  is  the feature  of  the  one-party

system?  It  is  the  intoleration  of  Opposition

parties.  This is quite different from the  system

that  we  have in Singapore. Here, apart from  the

party in power in Parliament, there are Opposition

parties  outside  Parliament.  This  is  a   clear

indication that we are not practising a  one-party

dictatorship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in a democratic system, we should be

more  concerned with the multiplicity of political

parties.  There  should  always  be  one  or   two

political parties strong enough to take  over  the

reins of government. However, the multiplicity  of

political  parties would mean the emergence  of  a

feeble   coalition  government  followed  by   the

tragedy of a coup d'etat and the abolition of  the

democratic system itself. For example, in trouble-stricken  Congo there were at one time  about  200

political   parties   in  existence.   But   their

existence  did not bring any happiness or  benefit

to  the  people. Instead the existence of so  many

parties  brought crises and troubles. In Singapore

there  are about 20 political parties, both active

and dormant. In so far as the democratic system is

concerned, this is not necessarily a bad sign.  We

are still in good health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whether a new Opposition party will

emerge  in  Parliament in the l970s is a  question

for  the future. At the present juncture, we  need

not  over-emphasise the advantages of a  one-party

Parliament. If we do have to emphasise it, we  can

very well say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



in  a  small  nation like Singapore surrounded  by

other  countries,  we  do  require  a  strong  and

invincible party in power in Parliament. If we  do

have  to explain why there is the emergence  of  a

one-party  Parliament in Singapore,  we  can  very

well  say  that  it is because of the  enlightened

leadership  in  our party. It is  because  of  the

obvious achievements which we have made, and which

are  well known to everybody, that it is no wonder

that  we have been able to sweep the board of  all

the  58  seats.  These are not  matters  which  we

should argue about. We should, however, adopt this

attitude; we must accept a one-party Parliament as

a   fait   accompli.  Then  under  the  democratic

arrangements we must try to do better than a multi-party Parliament. In any case, we should try to do

no  less better than a multi-party Parliament.  At

the  present moment, there is no Opposition in our

Parliament,  but the reform and the reorganisation

that  the  present Government is seeking to  carry

out  is  beyond the imagination of any  Opposition

party,  even  if one were to turn up. Furthermore,

we  have  new blood in our Parliament and we  have

made our Members of Parliament more representative

by  choosing them from all walks of life.  In  the

President's policy speech we can see that there is

determination to seek improvement and changes.  We

have  no desire to rest on our laurels. All  these

are  indications that even without an  Opposition,

we  are capable of marching forward. This has been

the  point  raised  and agreed to  by  Members  of

Parliament when they support the motion of thanks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I now wish to deal with some points

raised  by  several  Members of  this  House.  The

Member for Punggol and the Member for Jurong  have

mentioned the difficulties of some fishermen  who,

when  they  went  out for deep-sea  fishing,  were

themselves whisked away by pirates. I remember  on

the  24th January last when Parliament sat,  these

same  Members raised the same question  that  they

are  raising today. I would like them to read  the

report  in  Hansard concerning  this  matter.  The

answer given by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



Minister of State concerned is still valid.  There

has  been no change. What I would like to  explain

to  this House is that the Ministry of Defence has

now  strengthened the marine patrol  system  which

will  improve  the situation. There will  be  more

patrol boats to handle this kind of situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has mentioned the two-year military training under the national service

scheme for university and college students, and he

requested  that the period of training  should  be

reduced to one year. He said two years would be  a

waste of their knowledge. But I would say that  we

are   still  growing  and  the  youths  are  still

growing.  So  this  is the best  time  for  us  to

contribute  our  strength. What  we  need  at  the

moment  is not a very large army but a small  army

of  regulars  supported  by  a  large  reserve  of

national servicemen. We are adopting the principle

of  quality and not quantity. If we want  quality,

two  years' military training may not be too  long

for  university or college graduates  to  man  our

future army. If we look at the Hitler type of hair-do  of the Member for Ulu Pandan, we can know that

he  is frustrated by the considerations he has  in

mind.  But we must, first of all, consolidate  our

defence,  so that everybody will have a  sense  of

security,  before we can put all  our  talents  to

better  use. If we are faced with the  problem  of

national   security,  even  if  we   have   enough

graduates with a wealth of talent, we cannot  make

full  use of that. When a country does not  exist,

where  can  its  people use  their  talent?  Their

capability  and knowledge cannot be used  at  all.

The  best  one can do is to compile statistics  to

show how -
