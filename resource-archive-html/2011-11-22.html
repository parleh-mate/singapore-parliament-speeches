                  </span>: Sir, the Community Care Endowment
Fund (ComCare) provides assistance for low-income and needy Singaporeans.
ComCare funding and programmes are delivered through our Community
Development Councils (CDCs). ComCare beneficiaries are a diverse
mix of needy Singaporeans who need different forms of assistance
and for varying periods of time. Examples include elderly persons who
are unable to work and need long-term assistance, families who require
short-term help because the breadwinners have been retrenched from
their jobs, families with members recovering from chronic illnesses
and parents who require financial support so that their children
can attend preschool. ComCare complements other support which the
beneficiary may receive from his family as well as the help provided
by various other help agencies in the community.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e5c130a0-b585-43a2-b39d-9854438c2f82">
                  <a name="id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-e5c130a0-b585-43a2-b39d-9854438c2f82"><!--a--></a>Mrs Lina Chiam asked about
the amount of help each beneficiary receives each month. CDC officers
will look at each individual's or family's circumstances, including factors
such as household size and composition. Depending on the specific circumstances,
the CDCs put together a package of assistance to address their needs. The
help can be in form of cash assistance, free or subsidised medical
care, vouchers for food, rental, utilities, service and conservancy
charges, and preschool and student care subsidies. Because of this,
it is not meaningful to provide an average figure on how much each
beneficiary receives per month. However, we can give some typical examples.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8e5cecff-1d15-4e44-9d0d-a2e7f877fdef">
                  <a name="id-3f0bd322-d7c3-41d7-9be4-f60758b5f580__id-8e5cecff-1d15-4e44-9d0d-a2e7f877fdef"><!--a--></a>For a family of four, where
the male breadwinner with a homemaker wife and two preschool age
children has recently lost his job, his family may be provided with
$600 a month in cash allowances as well as vouchers for utilities
and service and conservancy charges for three months. In addition,
his children can receive up to $340 a month each in preschool subsidies,
while the parents look for work. This is on top of the universal childcare
subsidies which his children are already entitled to. For a couple
where the husband has to stop working temporarily due to ill health
and the wife has to be his primary caregiver, but has savings and
some support from their children, he may receive $300 in cash a
month while he recovers at home. They may also receive assistance
for utilities and service and conservancy charges as well as rental
assistance if they reside in a rental flat. For a single needy elderly
without family support, he or she may receive $400 in cash allowances
a month. In addition, there are other support such as free medical
treatment at polyclinics and restructured hospitals, rental and
utilities vouchers and community help. This additional support can
amount to about $1,000 a month.</p>

help services provided by the CDCs and other helping hands can be
better coordinated and communicated to minimise their falling through the
cracks. We agree on the importance of the CDCs to work with the
various help services within their respective districts. Currently,
this is done through the ComCare Local Networks. Today, nine ComCare
Local Networks bring together various agencies comprising voluntary
welfare organisations, citizens consultative committees, other social
service agencies and even schools, hospitals and self-help groups.
Through these networks, agencies come together to collectively identify
and sort out systemic issues as well as work out processes to facilitate
the referral of cases among the ComCare Local Network (CLN) partners
and closing of referral loops. Working together, they are better placed
to decide on the best approach to reach out to and assist the needy
within their communities. Nonetheless, there is room for improvement.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive
reply. I would like to ask the Minister of State if her Ministry
would agree to conduct a survey of the different help agencies and
find out what is happening now on the ground and how they are coordinated,
so as to identify areas of best practices and improvement. I would
also like to seek the Minister of State's response as to when the
review would be done in order that an action plan can be developed
as soon as possible to plug the gaps, so that those who fall through
the cracks will be salvaged.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
want to thank Ms Denise Phua for those questions. On the question
of having a survey, I would like to inform Ms Phua that we do surveys
on and off, although it may not be on a large scale. We constantly
ensure that we test the waters and assess the environment in order
to make sure that those who need help are getting the help that
is available for them. Of course, we can always look into the possibility
of conducting a much more comprehensive survey in order to see whether help
is reaching the beneficiaries. In fact, we did a survey of 2,000
low-income households, those in the bottom 20%, and we received
some feedback from them. They are the primary targets of our ComCare
assistance schemes. We found that one out of 10 of these beneficiaries
do feel that they need help but they have some difficulties getting
it. What is also surprising to us is that about 60% of them, although
they belong to the bottom 20%, indicated that they prefer to be
self-sufficient and that they do not need assistance. And so, we
do have some surveys on and off to assess the situation on the ground.</p>

as to when we will complete the review, this is an ongoing process.
We share with the Member her sentiments that we should try to do
it as quickly as possible, and that is obviously something that
we are looking into. Just to reinforce the point that our primary
consideration is that those who need help will get the help. They
must get the help. This is where we are also strengthening our CLN,
by working with the CDCs, our primary agencies, our family service
centres and other VWOs. In the longer term, we are looking at other
possible structures as well like, developing the service hubs. We
have in mind two models. One is more programme-centric and the other
is more client-centric, depending on what are the most feasible options
available.</p>

Sir, I would like to thank Mdm Halimah Yacob for the answers. I
would like to ask two supplementary questions. First, would the
Ministry set up a one-stop assistance centre where officers can
work with community and social workers to provide details on all
schemes, including those run by charitable and non-governmental
organisations so as to achieve on a coordinated and targeted basis,
the best way to address the needs of the poor and needy in getting
the right help at the right time, like assistance in terms of housing,
children's education, medical needs and financial counselling in
regard to retrenchment in jobs and advice on dealing with creditors?</p>

the needy who are poorly-educated and unaware of such schemes do
not fall through cracks in our social safety system, will the Ministry
set up a committee
to brainstorm ideas for more publicity through the mass media on
the financial help offered by the ComCare schemes?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
want to thank Mrs Lina Chiam for those questions. I think the crux
of the issue underlining both questions is how we ensure that the
needy and those who need help are able to access the help that are
available to them. That is the basis of her question for having
a one-stop centre and also in having a committee in order to look
at these issues. On the question of a one-stop centre, the problem
with having just a one-stop centre is that it can become a bottleneck.
And especially when we want to make sure that the touch points that
we have are spread all over the island and not just within a one-stop
centre. Instead of having a one-stop centre, what we have now is
a situation where we work very closely with our partners. So, we
have nine ComCare Local Networks under the CDCs and through those
ComCare Local Networks, we bring together all the touch points needed
throughout the island. So, there are the CDCs, the family service
centres, and the VWOs dealing with different areas of needs of our beneficiaries
and our needy persons. All of them are brought together under the ComCare
Local Networks. The ComCare Local Networks act as a focal point
where it also provides a platform for all the various agencies providing
help to the needy to come together to discuss and share experiences
and notes on how to extend assistance and help to the needy. Instead
of a one-stop centre, what we have in mind, as I mentioned earlier,
is to develop service hubs. Service hubs are structures where we
either have it as programme-centric or client-centric located in
one location, and where we bring all the service providers together.
For instance, if we need to take care of the elderly, we need to
bring all the providers together, whether it is the family service
centre or the VWOs taking care of the elderly needs. They will then
be co-located. As Members are aware, a structure like this takes
a bit of time to develop but this is one of it.</p>

is whether we can have a committee. We all know very extensively
and comprehensively the issues, challenges and problems that we
face. It is not necessary for us to set up another committee to
look into this issue. What we need to do is to identify what are
some of the gaps, which we are doing right now, and also to address
those concerns and issues. I must say that looking at the structures
that we have, it is for the moment able to reach out to the needy
and the beneficiaries. There are areas where we need to do more
outreach, particularly for those who are at the bottom 20%. One
out of 10 in our survey says they do face some difficulties. This
is where we will then work very closely with our grassroots organisations
and VWOs to work out an outreach strategy for them.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for her reply. We are grateful for
the service hubs and the CLNs, but I think what is probably lacking
is an integrated information or database of those who are in need
of help. Sometimes, we may or may not know who had been helped.
I would like to ask the Ministry if there are any plans for a more
client-centric approach in integrating information from the various agencies
and make the information more accessible to the CDCs and the grassroots,
so that those who come to us for help can be helped quickly and
holistically.</p>

This database is accessible. Sometimes, the gaps are dependent on
what information each individual advisor
puts into the database. But the database is there. We are currently
also looking at how to further enhance and improve the database.</p>

Sir, the Minister of State mentioned that there are needy residents

Minister of State for an assessment of how big this group is from
the group of needy residents that have been reached out to? Also,
what is the MCYS' approach towards groups of residents who are publicly
going out to seek help such as by selling tissue papers or appearing

welfare?</p>

just want to repeat the call that we have made repeatedly. If there
are any such cases of needy residents or Singaporeans that any Member
of Parliament comes across, do please refer them to us, and we will
follow up or refer them to our five CDCs, so that they can also
follow up with the relevant assistance and support. With regard
to some Singaporeans whom we feel may need help, but they feel they
can manage on their own, I think the real issue is this:That we should
also respect people's desires and wishes. </p>

to the bottom 10% of the population. Very often, when I was in school,
my teachers would tell me, "Why do you not go and ask your mother
to go and get social welfare or social assistance?" But my mother
would be terribly horrified with any suggestion that she should
go and get social welfare or social assistance. Because when my
father died when I was eight years old, my mother said that so long
as she has two hands and two legs, we will all survive.</p>

desires of people, even though they may be at the bottom 20%, when
they say that they want to have ownership of their lives. They want
to decide whether they want to seek help or not to seek help. We
cannot say that just because you are at the bottom 20%, we must
therefore extend our help to you regardless of whether you want
it or not. I think that should not be the philosophy that we should
adopt, but rather, we should adopt a philosophy where we provide
them with the dignity, the support and the level and kind of assistance
that they need. </p>

I thank Mr Liang for his question. Traffic congestion at any time
leads to a sub-optimal use of our road network. It undermines our
quality of life, the environment, and the overall efficiency of
the economy. Congestion therefore needs to be kept in check. Where
possible, traffic engineering methods, such as road widening, have
been implemented to relieve congestion. However, where such solutions
are not available or have been exhausted, Electronic Road Pricing
(ERP) has been introduced. </p>

ensuring an optimal travel speed either on individual roads, such
as expressways and major arterial roads, or to the city area using a
cordon concept. The cordon concept, where all routes entering the
same area are priced uniformly, is necessary because the roads leading
into the city area are fairly good substitutes for one another.
The lack of a cordon would only lead to traffic diverting into roads
that are not priced or priced lower, resulting in greater localised congestion.</p>

ERP on Saturdays for the Orchard and Bugis-Marina Centre cordons
in 2005 and 2008 respectively still stand today. Since its implementation, ERP
has improved traffic speeds within these cordons and maintained
them within the acceptable range. ERP rate reviews are carried out
quarterly, as well as for the June and December school holidays,
to ensure that ERP rates remain relevant to the traffic situation.</p>

of ERP remain essential, we will continue to be flexible at the
margins where there is room to fine-tune the system. For instance,
we recently shortened the evening ERP operating hours for gantries
along the northbound Central Expressway (CTE) before the Pan Island
Expressway (PIE) and the southbound Singapore River Line, taking
into consideration public feedback, traffic conditions and travel
patterns. In response to feedback on weekend ERP and cordon charging,
and also to take into account the changes in the road network in
the vicinity of Marina Centre area, we will be moving the Nicoll
Highway gantry in 2012 and adjust the Bugis-Marina Centre cordon,
to enable motorists to access the East Coast Parkway (ECP) via the
Nicoll Highway without having to pass through and pay ERP at the
cordon. In doing so, motorists will have a greater choice in choosing
their travel routes and times. Motorists who want a smoother drive
can still do so by paying the ERP charges. We will continue to monitor
the traffic situation and fine-tune the ERP scheme where necessary.</p>

Sir, we are talking about Saturday's ERP. It is a non-working day,
a day where the office CBD crowds are not rushing to get into their
offices. Perhaps the impact to economy would be less severe. I would
like to ask the Minister of State whether LTA can go a little easier
on Saturdays in their road management and perhaps even do a trial
and see if we were to switch off the ERP on Saturdays, what will
be the difference in the behaviour of road users. Perhaps we may learn
something new from there in how we can manage traffic. I hope the
Minister of State would look into this – whether there is a necessity
to have ERP on Saturdays, given it is a non-working day.</p>

                  </span>: I thank
Mr Liang for his supplementary question. Let me reassure the Member
that the decision to implement Saturday ERP for these areas was not
taken lightly. Average speeds had deteriorated to below 20 km/h
before ERP was introduced. This has since improved and speeds are
now kept within the optimal range between 20 km/h and 30 km/h. Even
on Saturdays, there are economic activities like the retail trade
in the Bugis-Marina Centre and Orchard areas. So, taking these factors
into consideration, the ERP will continue to be implemented in these
areas. Having said that, ERP implementation is not static and we
will continue to fine-tune it from time to time.</p>

The Minister of State has just said that LTA has shortened the evening
ERP to 8.00 pm and that there has been positive response. If the
approach of LTA is to allow some degree of traffic congestion during
non-critical hours, surely, we can consider allowing some degree
of traffic congestion on non-working days like Saturdays. So, why
do we not review it earlier and cut the ERP on Saturdays as well? </p>

to be adjusted and fine-tuned from time to time. I understand the Members'
concern on behalf of their residents, and people that they have
encountered and received feedback from, to remove ERP completely
on weekends and evenings. I would just like to remind the Members
that in the Orchard area, before ERP was implemented, traffic speeds
were lower, causing some people who used Orchard Road for shopping
purposes to feel that the traffic congestion there was not within
acceptable levels to them. So, we have to strike a balance and today,
having introduced ERP, not at very high rates, the speeds along
the Orchard Road areas on weekends have been maintained at an acceptable
level.</p>

Sir, I support the call by Mr Liang about considering the removal
of ERP on weekends. The Minister of State mentioned earlier that
from retailers' viewpoint, they may consider congestion on weekends
as a factor that would adversely affect their business. I believe
otherwise. I would actually like to suggest that LTA conducts a
survey among retailers in that belt and ask them whether freeing
up ERP on weekends would be a move that they support. If they do,
then it will be a win-win for every sector – win for the businesses,
and certainly more car owners would support this. It may be something
that the entire community is advocating and they are prepared to
live with the congestion that comes with it.</p>

Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for his question.
The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the operator SBS Transit
(SBST) monitor the passenger loading situation on the Sengkang-Punggol
LRT (SPLRT) system closely. In recent years, ridership on the SPLRT
system has increased, with year-on-year growth of about 10% from
2008 to 2011. Passenger loading levels have consequently also risen,
with crowding observed during the morning peak travel at the last
station on the Sengkang East loop in the direction of Sengkang Town Centre,
where most commuters alight to transfer to the North-East Line. </p>

a comprehensive review of the long-term capacity needed for the
SPLRT system. One key aspect of this study was to determine the technical
feasibility of converting the current one-car system to a two-car
system, to increase the system's capacity in the medium to longer
term. LTA is currently in the process of finalising the study and

from four minutes to three minutes during the peak periods. SBS
Transit has also deployed Customer Service Officers (CSOs) at the

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a number of supplementary questions for
the Minister of State after her very comprehensive reply. Could
we have, perhaps, some indication of the time frame for the report
of the comprehensive review? The second question I have is – given
that there are number of new developments that are five to 10 years
behind Sengkang in terms of infrastructure development and maturity
as a town – Punggol being as an example – are there lessons learnt
from the experience with the LRT system in Sengkang that are going
to change the way LTA and the Ministry deal with public transport
infrastructure in relation to population growth and development
in new towns such as Punggol? Specifically, with respect to the
last-mile concept for public transport which often is a friction
for people to change their behaviour when a family moves in to a
new location and buys a new BTO flat. This is an opportunity for
them to reconsider and change their lifestyle with respect to public
transport, perhaps. And very often, it is that last mile which is
the determining factor. So, have there been lessons learnt from
the experience in Sengkang which we will use to change either our
operational approach or policy approach? And last question, would
the Ministry consider either a structure or incentive system for
the private transport operators to make them more likely to service
this last mile in a way that our residents are likely to use even
if in the short term it loses money?</p>

connectivity, I am glad that the Member brought it up because it
is a very important criterion in ensuring that as many residents
as possible are able to gain access to public transport and find
it convenient to use our public transport system. Anecdotally, and
also from studies that were done in the past, one of the things
that has been identified is that when a station is accessible within
400 metres of walking distance, this has been found to be the most
effective in encouraging the use of public transport. Indeed, the
LTA is in the process of doing a detailed study on how we can improve
last-mile connectivity to make sure that as many residents as possible who
may now find that last-mile connectivity is not as good as they
would like it to be, can experience enhanced connectivity when they
try to access the public transport network through the nearest station
to them. This is also a study that is ongoing. What I can assure
the Member is that the results will be known quite soon, and we
shall be able to share with the public what plans there are to achieve
this.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for the answer. To Dr Janil's point
on the experience of Sengkang LRT and how it can be applied to other areas,
I am sure Members would agree that there has been positive feedback
from the introduction of the Circle Line. Currently, the Circle
Line, to my understanding, operates on a three-car system, compared
to six cars for the North South and East West Lines as well as the
North East Line. Does the Government intend to make a study on the provision
of additional cars and carriages should the demand for the Circle
Line increase in the future?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, in
response to the Member's question, the design of any particular
line takes into consideration many factors, for example, the areas
they would serve, the population density of those areas as well
as how likely it is to be used by the residents for travel to different
parts of the network. When the decision was taken for the Circle
Line to be implemented as a three-car system, these factors would
already have been taken into consideration, not just for the short
term or the median term but also based on the long-term trends and
patterns of where people would live. In response to this question,
there are no plans to review whether the Circle Line will change
from its existing three-car configuration at this point in time.</p>

Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir,
our hawker centres actually originated from the programme in the
1970s and 1980s when we cleared street hawkers. These street hawkers
who were, in a sense, resettled from the streets, therefore, enjoyed
subsidised rentals. Currently, to date, the National Environment
Agency (NEA) manages about 15,000 cooked food and market stalls.
Of these 15,000 stalls, about 42% of them are paying subsidised
rentals. So, these would be, in a sense, a legacy from the original clearance
programme. For the remaining stalls,
the rentals are pegged at the market rate. But having said that,
these rentals are still lower than those paid in cooked food centres
in private food courts.</p>

the trade pay market rates, as assessed by professional valuers
appointed by the NEA. These assessed market rentals are generally
in the range of $100 to $1,500 for a market stall, and from $400
to $3,000 for a cooked food stall. The variation would take into
account the characteristics of the centre and the popularity of the
location.</p>

market rates can fluctuate according to demand and supply and prevailing
business conditions. My Ministry recently announced plans to build
more hawker centres and this will inject a greater supply of both
cooked food and market stalls into the overall equation. And I expect
that this will have a downward pressure on market rentals. We are
committed to ensuring that hawker centres continue to provide cheap,
affordable and accessible food to all Singaporeans. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>
                  </span>: On
the first supplementary question on social policy, as I explained
earlier in my reply, our hawker centres came about because we were
trying to clear the streets of mobile hawkers. The reason for that
clearance was to first ensure public safety and hygiene, because
clearly street hawkers would not have access to clean running water
and would not be able to maintain the cleanliness of their used utensils,
plates, forks and spoons. So the plan was to relocate all of them
into a proper hawker centre. It will improve hygiene, it will also
centralise the infrastructure, facilities and supplies that they
need, and it will also be more convenient for the public because they
will know where to go for their regular fix of hawker food.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-093e9ccd-489e-449b-aa15-419ae9526949">
                  <a name="id-932a1ad5-7330-4ed8-9726-d759e5a94437__id-093e9ccd-489e-449b-aa15-419ae9526949"><!--a--></a>I explained all this so
that Members understand that it did not originate from a social policy.
It originated from a public hygiene, safety and convenience point
of view. But having said that, hawker stalls then took a life of
its own and, today, they have become almost an icon of Singapore
life in that you cannot imagine a Singapore without hawker centres,
without access to freshly cooked food at a very affordable rate,
in which people from
all walks of life can get together, whether you are wearing a jacket
or a tie, or in shorts, tee-shirts and slippers. That is where the
social dimension came in. It did not necessarily start, nor is it
even today, as an option for providing jobs for people who have
no other occupations available. That almost, in a sense, is an incidental
effect. In the earlier years – I think you have to go back to before
the 1990s – there was a programme for people who had difficulty
in making ends meet and could not find any other job, they would
be allocated a stall. I think that policy was discontinued more
than 20 years ago.</p>

if you look at the mix, half of them are enjoying subsidised rentals.
As I said, these were legacy issues, people who previously enjoyed
subsidised rentals were also allowed to transfer their entitlement
to subsidised rentals to their family members. In a sense, they
were the second generation hawkers. But for all the others, the
Ministry at that point in time decided that it would be best and
fair to allocate the stalls according to market demand. These stalls,
you would have realised, do have a market value because they generate
income for the operator. The fairest way of doing it was to let
the market price discovery mechanism occur. And that explains the
way it has worked since then. But even with that in place, because
of the way our hawker centres are structured, you will find that
the market rentals paid in a hawker centre are still significantly
lower than that in a private food court or certainly in any restaurant.
So, there is a clear difference.</p>

question was about the impact of market rentals on the final prices
that hawkers charge their customers. I think we should acknowledge that
the rental that a hawker pays in a hawker centre is one component
but it is not the only factor that determines the final price that
a hawker charges. This is a free market and we do not control the
prices that hawkers set. Therefore, it is a combination of what the
market can bear − the competition, the traffic, the number and the
fame of that individual hawker – which allows him to set a price,
and then determine the viability of his business. I am not convinced
that we should change that free market model. But having said that,
there is a supply and demand equation, and I believe that by increasing the
supply, we will put downward pressure on the market rentals. But,
ultimately, whether hawkers lower their prices in response to that
is a market test which time will prove one way or the other. So,
it is not a simple equation where I can offer a subsidised rental,
control the price that he charges and ensure a social policy of
ensuring that there will always be cheap food freely available to
everyone. That is not the business model for the hawker centres.
It has never been that, and I do not believe that will be a viable model
for the future.</p>

NEA would obviously work with the hawker to find out why he is having
difficulty coping with the rental. For instance, if he fell ill
or, for some reason, his business went down because of local factors,
then, of course, NEA will exercise forbearance. But, in the long
run, this is a business and the revenues must be sufficient to cover
the cost of doing a business, including rentals, paying for ingredients, manpower,
utilities, water, etc. So, we have to be clear that this particular
hawker is viable in the long term and if he is, of course, we will
do our best to help him. If he is not, then, perhaps, that is not
necessarily the wisest business enterprise for him and we will have
to look for ways for him to exit and to look for alternative jobs
or avenues, or even an alternative venue to go to where the rentals
may be lower, and maybe for someone else with perhaps better business
model or more tasty food or a more loyal clientele to replace him
in that particular centre.</p>

                  </span>: I just want to ask the Minister
a supplementary question. I do not intend to haunt him like the
way I haunted him in MCYS. Just building on the Member, Mr Lim Biow
Chuan's concern about the cost of food in food centres, beyond market
rate for the rental of food stalls in food centres, I believe that
there is this practice of allowing a COV, sometimes of up to as
high as $300,000. That is the transaction happening on the ground,
when stalls are transferred. I believe this practice further pushes
up the cost of food in food centres. This has probably taken on
a life of its own. It is very unlike the HDB rental flat policy
which stipulates that when there is a transfer of ownership, the
HDB actually takes back the rental flat when the tenant quits. I
am sure he does not approve of the additional transfer cost that
is happening on the ground and I wonder what the Minister would
do about this.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
it is a peculiar, almost unique, feature of doing business in Singapore,
in hawker centres and sometimes in coffee shops. Whenever you have
this phenomenom of "coffee money" or you hear this exorbitant sum
of $300,000, in fact, it should make you pause and understand that
what is really happening from an economic point of view is arbitrage
because of regulatory mismatch. The fact that someone else is willing
to pay $300,000 in order to receive the assignment for the stall for
which NEA is probably collecting a few hundred dollars or maybe
$1,000 a month, illustrates precisely why we should not blindly
go into artificially pegging prices in the name of subsidies. The
point I am trying to make is that, in fact, subsidies distort the market
and do not necessarily lead to optimal outcomes. </p>

As the human traffickers work across state boundaries and legal
jurisdictions, enforcement also requires cross-border cooperation
for countries to work closely together, and the taskforce will continue

ensure victims are identified and human traffickers are pursued
even across borders and legal jurisdictions. Beyond operational

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I thank the Member for his questions and the opportunity to
clarify. Firstly, on inter-agency cooperation: indeed, that is the
way the work has been done. To repeat the point: It is not that
the taskforce will convene in mid-2012. The plan of action will
be completed by mid-2012. That is the estimate. In terms of inter-agency
cooperation, therefore, it is reflected in fact in the way even
the taskforce is composed. We have the Ministries of Home Affairs,
Manpower, MCYS, as well as the Police, immigration and various other
agencies which have a vested interest and a role to play in this whole-of-Government
effort. Indeed, that is the way we will continue to proceed. In
some of the raids that have been conducted and enforcement actions
taken, that has also been the case, and the Home Team agencies typically
work together on many of these efforts. </p>

collaboration and whether we can leverage on Interpol, indeed, the
Interpol facility that is going to be established here will be an
important asset for us. But it is not just what we have in Singapore,
but indeed, that is an approach that have been taken by the Police
and the other agencies involved, that we need to find partners across
borders because we often want to interdict at the source rather
than wait for it to come to our jurisdiction. And that has been
one of the key measures that has underpinned the way they have conducted
their enforcement activities.</p>

Sir, SCORE tries very hard to ensure that our releasees have the
best chance at rehabilitation and reintegration. This is not only
looking at the job needs. We have to look at their needs for shelter,
home support, social support and so forth. In addition to doing
that, we also ensure that they are, as much as possible, well prepared
to go back to the workforce. As I mentioned just now, of those who
sought help from SCORE, 91% of them actually got a job and stayed
on the job at least for a while before they moved on to another
job. For those who have not sought help, we do not really know why
they have not done so. But as far as we have found out from the inmates,
many of them have other sources of information and also old skills
that they can rely on to get jobs.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have met some residents

and they were incarcerated for a while. When they came out of prison,
they wanted to go back to their former work as Security Officers,
but their Security Officer's licences were revoked and they could
not get them renewed. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain
what were some factors that led to these licences being revoked.

Sir, those in the security industry, they are to protect the property
and the premises for which they are entrusted. Therefore, it is
important for us to have people whom we can trust, not only to be
the lookout for the employers, but also in addition to that, they
are part of the overall security setup that we have in our homeland.
Therefore, when they have committed some offences for which we think makes
it not suitable for them to return to the security industry, we
would not allow them to continue with the work. But given a time
lapse, during which we will monitor them, we will approve their
licence renewals if they do not fall back into the crimes for which they
were incarcerated.</p>

Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer.
The inputs from students with hearing impairment or deafness in
these institutions confirm that current efforts to support them
are based on individual kindness, not systemic. The examples that
the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has quoted come from just some
of the institutions who are willing to be kind. What I am asking
for is something systemic, and to ask the Ministry to provide a
very clear instruction to the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)
to support students with hearing impairment and deafness, just like
what the Minister did for character education. If MOE says it would
do it, then the whole machinery gets turned on – </p>

The students would also know that they can develop their own support

have very structured ways to help students with disabilities, including
hearing impairment. </p>

students with disabilities. For example, NUS, NTU and SMU undertake
pre-enrolment medical examinations to assess the disability of the
students. They also require the students to declare if they have
any disability, so that they can assign staff members to look out
for these students. They train their staff members to be able to
help such students with disabilities. That teaching and learning
support is the second assistance that is given. Part of the learning
support is to get students who can help their classmates in taking notes and
in sharing information about the lessons taught in the class. I
think these are powerful ways to help students with disabilities manage
their instructions in class. Apart from that, our institutions also
help provide clear written instructions to those with disabilities
including hearing impairment. </p>

what I understand, the Allied Educators, especially those who are
doing learning and behaviour support, are trained to deal with students

that the number of students with disabilities is very small. Less
than 1% of those in our IHLs. Nevertheless, each of the institution
takes great care in ensuring that the students with disabilities
are, firstly, identified properly; secondly, they get the right
assistance, not just someone who is able to provide sign language
services but, more importantly, for someone to sit with the students
with hearing impairment and other disabilities so that they can
get the direct assistance needed. </p>

into the Sports Education Programme (SEP) Funds to offer learn-to-play
programmes for additional breadth of sports participation. The Sports Education
Programme (SEP) is an initiative introduced by MOE and Singapore
Sports Council (SSC) which aims to promote sports participation
in schools. The programme provides a spectrum of options that range
from traditional mainstream sports to more unconventional sports
such as wakeboarding, sport climbing and in-line skating. In addition,
the SEP also offers a "sports leagues" category where schools can
organise intra-school competitions for students to hone their sporting
skills. </p>

some schools have also woven specific sports modules within the
total curriculum. Jurong West Secondary School, for instance, has introduced
various sports programmes such as basketball, volleyball, netball,

CCA. This augments the overall developmental opportunities for students

17% as the second choice and 6% as the third choice. What it means
is that students have a lot of opportunities to take up sports CCAs
that they like. But, of course, we
cannot expect all students to like sports. We want to encourage

that schools make use of the SEP Fund to encourage students who

who are not involved in sports CCAs get to learn one or a few of
these games – basketball, volleyball, netball, hockey and frisbee.
It can be just throwing of the disc but it can be very fun, and
they get involved in sporting activities.</p>

Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his
answers. I scanned through the most recent book published by MOE
introducing secondary school education to the public. I noticed
that most schools offer, perhaps, four or five sports CCAs. I would
like to ask: Does the Senior Parliamentary Secretary feel that four
to five sports CCAs is enough? I also noted that a number of popular
sports like football and basketball are not being offered by many
of the schools as sports CCA. The second question I have is that
in speaking to a number of schools, one of the problems told to
me is that they do not have the budget to hire the coaches and to
handle the logistics for more than the four or five sports CCAs.
So would the MOE consider increasing the budget to support sports
CCAs?</p>

it is not sufficient because in a typical school, there are 1,500
students and you have only four or five sports CCAs with, say, an
average of about maybe 20 members, sometimes, in the smaller sports
there are 10 members participating. I do not think that is enough
to go round. I personally experienced this myself or I hear this
from my friends – difficulties getting our own children into the sports
CCAs that they wish to simply because it is not being offered by
the school.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, I think
the Member is talking about students who represent the schools.
Yes, we do need students to represent the school in sports or games
that schools have chosen. Nevertheless, students have the opportunities
to learn to play the games and take part in competitive games through
other opportunities – through the CCA, inter-class games, carnivals,
and so on. Many schools use the SEP Fund which is an initiative
of SSC and MOE. So I would like the Member to consider that taking
part in sports should not necessarily be just based on sports CCAs.
It should be done through PE lessons which are now more structured.
We have introduced more PE lessons in primary schools now and the
students have the opportunities to learn to be able to like the
games and to play on their own. So playing games should not be confined
to taking part in CCAs in school. We can provide more opportunities
by working together with the community organisations.</p>

who informed the Member that they were not allowed or they were
not recruited into certain CCA since they are unable to represent
the school, if he has any specific example, he can let us know.

iterate that learning to play and to be able to enjoy playing certain
games can be done outside CCAs. It is already introduced in structured
PE lessons, it is introduced through inter-class games, inter-house
games, inter-school games. I think there are opportunities but not
every student can represent the school and resources are limited.
I would admit a school has only one field, there is only one hall.
If you want to introduce 20 games, then there will be great competition
for the use of the school field. So schools will have to choose
the games that can be introduced which students can learn to play,
students can compete and students can enjoy playing even after they
have left school. There is a choice to be made. </p>

of which 250,000 were from subsidised Class B2/C wards; and if we
include B1 wards, which also received some subsidy, this accounted
for close to 85% of the total inpatient workload. Government subvention
to the public hospitals for their subsidised patient services alone
amounted to $2.2 billion. Generally, services that are not subsidised,
such as Class A ward admissions or private day surgery, are charged
on a cost-recovery basis. The public hospitals generated an aggregated
surplus of about $11 million, or around 1% of the revenue, from
such services in 2010. </p>

the capacity in the public hospitals. Most of our public hospitals
are running at about 85% capacity on average. At this level the
capacity is tight and
we are taking steps to address this. For example, in terms of manpower,
we increased the number of specialists last year by about 8%, from
1,850 to about 2,000. We are also expanding our healthcare infrastructure.
Public sector acute hospital beds increased by over 600 beds, or
about 10%, over the period 2000 to 2010, with the completion of
Khoo Teck Puat Hospital last year.</p>

one measure of healthcare capacity. As our hospitals develop evidence-based
care pathways to better manage patients, they are also able to reduce
the average length of stay whilst at the same time improving the
quality of care. These measures effectively expand the capacity
of hospital beds, allowing us to admit more patients with the same
number of beds. </p>

streamlined their processes and as a result, they were able to maintain
the median waiting time for admission from the Emergency Department
of about 1.4 hours in 2009 and 2010, despite a 4.5% increase in
admissions. They have also maintained the median waiting time for
new Specialist Outpatient Clinic appointments for subsidised patients
at around 28 days in 2009 and 2010, even though attendances rose
by 3.5% from 2009 to 2010. For subsidised patients requiring urgent
appointments, such as suspected cancer, the current median waiting
time is within two weeks. But I think we can improve further.</p>

Ng Teng Fong General Hospital will add 700 beds in 2014. Planning
for the Sengkang General Hospital has begun. Other than acute hospitals,
we are also ramping up other facilities such as community hospitals
and nursing homes; and we will strengthen our primary care capabilities,
including the setting up of medical centres in the community to
address the demand for specialist services. This is an area that
Mr Seah raised in the next question. I hope I will have time to
speak on this in greater detail then. I would like to reassure Mr

so, how many were affected? On remuneration, I would like to ask

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I do not have the specific occupancy rates for Class C wards
but I would assume that in most of our hospitals' Class C wards,
the occupancy rate is very high. For some patients, when they are
admitted, the Class C wards may not be available and we would ask
the patients whether they would want to opt for higher class wards
like B2 or B1 wards. But if the patients are unable to afford the higher
wards and if medical conditions required it, we will ward them in
a higher ward and on a case-to-case basis, we will allow what we
called an upgrade, an "up-warding" to allow them to be admitted so that patients
will not be denied admission just because the lower class wards
are full while higher class wards are available. We do what we can to
accommodate them on medical grounds.</p>

for doctors: I think doctors have to be governed and guided by medical
conditions rather than monetary incentives, whether we skew them towards
Class C patients or private patients. I think it is better for doctors
to assess the needs of the patients and they generally look at all
patients in a team-based approach so that patients are given the
appropriate treatment. At the same time, we are also looking at
reviewing the remuneration system for our doctors to ensure that
we encourage them to deliver appropriate care for our patients.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, today,
our primary care landscape comprises both the private General Practitioner
(GP) clinics and public polyclinics. The polyclinics play an important
role in delivering primary care, especially to the lower income.
Through the years, the Ministry of Health has ensured that our polyclinics
provide the best care possible for their patients. This includes
upgrading our polyclinics and equipping them with the appropriate
manpower and equipment to care for their patients. Last year, we completed
the upgrading of Choa Chu Kang and Toa Payoh Polyclinics. We will
continue to upgrade other polyclinics, such as the Geylang and Tampines
Polyclinics, in the coming years.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c7c9b794-0508-47ca-ae2f-92d8b3a9121d">

our polyclinics, we are aware that the long-term primary healthcare
burden cannot be borne by the polyclinics alone. The more logical and
sustainable primary care model is to enhance the partnership between
our polyclinics and GPs to provide quality healthcare that is more
accessible and affordable for patients. We have more than 2,000
GPs in the community who are located near to their patients and
capable of managing patients with both acute and chronic illnesses. Many
of them have also taken up postgraduate courses to further enhance
their skills and knowledge in Family Medicine. We have now more
than 800 doctors with the Masters of Medicine in Family Medicine
and the Graduate Diploma in Family Medicine. This is an invaluable
resource for the country as we seek to meet the growing healthcare demands
of a larger and ageing population.</p>

process of jointly developing the Primary Care Masterplan with our
GP partners to enable GPs to play a bigger role in chronic disease
management. To ensure affordability of care when patients see their
GPs, we recently announced the enhancement of the Primary Care Partnership
Scheme (PCPS) which will take effect from early next year. PCPS
is a portable subsidy scheme that allows Singaporeans to receive subsidised
care at private GPs and dental clinics. The age eligibility criteria
will be lowered from 65 years to 40 years while the income cut-off
will be raised from $800 to $1,500 per capita monthly household
income to enable more Singaporeans to benefit from the scheme. </p>

we are proposing new primary care entities to support better management
of chronic diseases in the community. For example, GPs can come
together to set up Family Medicine Clinics with larger spaces and
onsite ancillary support services. Or they may refer their patients
for ancillary support services such as nurse educators or diabetic
retinal photography at neighbouring Community Health Centres. In
addition, we intend to set up medical centres in the community to provide
ambulatory procedures, specialists would work with GPs to co-manage
patients and enable right-siting of patients from the specialist
centres of our acute hospitals. We hope that our efforts in this
area will result in much stronger primary care delivery and service
for Singaporeans. By leveraging on both our polyclinics and GPs,
we can deliver the most appropriate care to patients in the most
cost-effective way. </p>

Bill 2011 comprises two categories of legislative changes. The first
category puts into legal effect the income tax changes announced
in the 2011 Budget Statement. The second category covers other amendments

tax system. The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill was released for public
consultation from 11 July to 1 August this year. MOF has revised
the Bill to incorporate the suggestions accepted for implementation. </p>

in this Bill have already been debated upon in this House following
their announcement in the 2011 Budget Statement. Let me summarise
some of these key changes. </p>

and Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme has been enhanced to encourage
innovation and productivity efforts. Changes include increasing
the PIC deduction from 250% to 400%, increasing the cap on qualifying
expenditure from $300,000 to $400,000 per activity, and raising
the cash payout in lieu of deduction to $30,000. Clauses 17, 19,
23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31 and 33 of the Bill provide for the changes.</p>
                  <p class="column">Page: 686</p>

rebate of 20% up to $10,000, or an SME cash grant of up to $5,000
has been granted to help companies cope with the rising cost. This is
provided for in clause 61.</p>

able to pool their tax credits for foreign tax suffered on their foreign
incomes with the new Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) Pooling system. This
should simplify compliance and reduce the tax payable on the remitted
foreign income. This is provided for in clause 54.</p>

tax incentives will be streamlined under a new umbrella incentive
- the Maritime Sector Incentive. Apart from streamlining, the umbrella
scheme improves on existing shipping-related incentives by covering
more shipping-related support services and new entrants into the
industry. The enhancements will strengthen Singapore as an International
Maritime Centre. Clauses 7, 10, 12, 43, 45, 46, 48, 49, 69(a) and
71 provide for these changes. </p>

has been introduced to allow a company to claim for the cost incurred
on acquisition of its parent company's shares, through a Special
Purpose Vehicle, for its Employee Equity-Based Remuneration Scheme.
This is provided for in clauses 22 and 27(b) and (c).</p>

able to claim tax deduction for expenses incurred prior to its earning
any revenues. The expenses should be incurred in the accounting
year before that in which it earns the first dollar of revenues.
This enhancement will further relieve businesses of start-up costs.
The change is provided for in clause 26.</p>

of 250% for donations made to Institutions of a Public Character,
Government, approved persons and prescribed educational or research institutions
will be extended for another five years to 31 December 2015. This
is provided for in clause 32(a).</p>

tax rate structure will be amended effective from the next year
of assessment in 2012. The new personal income tax schedule is more progressive.
A one-off personal income tax rebate of 20% up to $2,000 has also
been granted for Year of Assessment 2011. These changes are covered
by clauses 68 and 70 respectively.</p>

in the employer's CPF contribution rate from 1 September 2011, the
corresponding tax deduction allowable to the employer is increased
to the new CPF contribution rate of 16%. The contribution that is
exempt from tax or the contribution in excess of which is deemed
taxable, as the case may be, is accordingly raised to $5,000 per
month. Clauses 4(b) and (c) and 16(a) provide for the change. </p>

the other tax changes covered in this Bill that arise from the on-going
review of our Income Tax Act. Let me highlight four of these changes.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0865dca7-612d-401b-b7f9-57f774172761">

for the avoidance of doubt that Government-Paid Childcare Leave
payments received by self-employed individuals are taxable income
since their introduction on 31 October 2008. This ensures consistency
with the tax treatment of Government-Paid Maternity Leave payments
received by self-employed women. </p>
                  <p class="column">Page: 687</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4498e436-4547-4b4c-b02d-8938f965e161">

tax appeal procedures for greater clarity and certainty in the timely
resolution of tax disputes, and savings in tax compliance and administration
costs. Changes include enabling taxpayers to take their case to
the Income Tax Board of Review even if their case is non-taxable
for that year, and extending the time to file appeals from 14 days
to 30 days. Clauses 56 to 60 provide for this.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ac1e03d9-6fe8-4d3e-a66a-81c6b2d28c6a">

the Unique Identity Number (UIN) or Unique Entity Number (UEN) will
be made compulsory and extended to donors who make cash donations
to IPCs through grant maker, cash donations to Government, donations
of computers to prescribed institutions, and donations of art works
to approved persons. This requirement was already introduced for
qualifying donations made to IPCs directly. With the amendment,
donors will not need to declare their donations in their tax returns
in order to enjoy tax deductions on their donations. Clause 32(b)
provides for this. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9827d7a8-30a0-4d47-be91-5f8561970e49">

towards the international Exchange of Information (EOI) standard,
the Income Tax Act is amended to allow Singapore to exchange information
via separate EOI arrangements, where necessary. Presently, EOI can
only be done through Avoidance of Double Taxation Arrangements.
Clauses 62 to 67 provide for this change.</p>

changes arising from our periodic review of the income tax system
are either technical in nature or relate to improvements in tax
administration. With the above changes, the Income Tax Act will
be enhanced and updated to better achieve our economic and social
objectives. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p>

query the Minister for extending tax relief for research and development
expenditure to R&amp;D incurred overseas. Would this not lead to
an exodus of R&amp;D activities and investments from Singapore?
I also wonder how the Minister hopes to ensure that R&amp;D activities
valuable to Singapore is being carried out once it is moved overseas
and that this relief is not merely used as a mechanism to evade
tax. </p>

Yuen Ping, Wong Poh Kam and Toh Mun Heng of NUS in 2009, found that
the impact of R&amp;D on growth in Singapore is not as strong as
it is in other developed countries. In fact, to catch up with other
developed countries, the study recommended that Singapore needs
"some effective exploitation of domestic R&amp;D activity". Instead
the Government must think of ways to make it really attractive for
these companies to consider putting their R&amp;D investments in
Singapore. Put simply, create more incentives locally and create
disincentives for doing it overseas.</p>

since this is part of the Economic Expansion Incentive Act being
amended here, there are many ways in which the Government can be
creative in addressing several problems at one go. For instance,
would the Government consider giving tax relief to companies that
hire disabled people, or tax relief for the purchase of gym or exercise
equipment in order to promote a healthy lifestyle for Singaporeans,
or for occupational health support, especially when prescribed by
a doctor? </p>

tax rate for Singapore Government Securities and ask how this benefits
common Singaporeans since most retail investors do not trade in
these securities. On the many clauses where the Minister has discretion
on a case-by-case basis, may I ask whether the Minister compiles
an annual report to Parliament on all cases – whether discretion
has been exercised and the reasons for rejecting or approving an

is rising around the developed world, and Singapore is not spared.
The rich are getting richer and the middle-income earners and the
poor are getting poorer. We should rethink our income tax policy

                     </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of this Bill. Broadly speaking,
I think this Bill, which provides for substantial tax breaks in
various areas, is to be welcomed at a time when we are facing a
potential global slowdown. At a time when many other governments
are struggling with trying to find answers or find ways to raise
taxes and cut spending to deal with serious fiscal deficits, we
are in the happy position of being able to offer tax breaks. </p>

and thoughtful. The corporate income tax rebate or cash grant for
SMEs will hopefully help them to deal with rising costs, while the
one-off personal income tax rebate would reduce the burden across
the board, but the cap means that the full reduction would be enjoyed
most by the middle-income and low-income groups, in so far as they
are subject to tax. </p>

specific taxes, which are undoubtedly ways to assist the promotion
of those sectors in Singapore. Two proposals I found particularly
interesting were the enhanced deduction for research and development
expenditure set out in clause
19 of the Bill and the concessionary tax rate for shipping related
support services in clause 49. I will discuss both of these in turn. </p>

for research and development, I think one of the main benefits of
such incentives would be to improve Singapore's reputation as a
hub for research and development. In the face of the current climate
of economic uncertainty, this is one way of attracting investment
to Singapore. </p>

has been levelled against our plans to attract research is the allegation
that many of the new jobs created go to foreigners and, therefore,
while GDP may grow as a result of the added investment, this may
not necessarily translate into high quality jobs going to our citizens.</p>

that may skew the incentives a little further in favour of hiring
of Singaporeans in this sector would be to tighten the definition
of "staff costs". For example, at the moment, one of the qualifying
expenditures that may enjoy tax incentives is the deduction of "staff
costs". Staff costs are defined as the salary, wages, and other
benefits paid or granted in respect of employment and include expenses incurred
for training or certifying the employee. If the definition of employee
were confined to Singaporean employees, this would essentially mean
that the hiring and training of Singaporeans in this sector is incentivised,
but the hiring of non-Singaporeans does not enjoy any similar incentives.</p>

mean that some companies with a large foreign workforce may in fact
get fewer incentives, even after the amendments. But I think this
may not necessarily be a bad thing because the training of Singaporeans
would also be incentivised. And also picking up on <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mrs Lina Chiam's point,
I think one of her concerns was that foreign research and development
may also be deducted but ironically if this foreign research and
development is engaging Singaporeans, then ultimately I think that would
also be to the benefit of Singaporeans. So, perhaps where the research
takes place is less important but if the benefits come back to Singapore
and Singaporean companies, that may ultimately still be in the best
interest of our country. </span>

for the marine sector. The maritime sector is one that, I think,
has been important to Singapore from historic times. And coming
from Sembawang, I think Sembawang Shipyard remains both an important
employer and contractor for small business operators.</p>

subject to intense competition, and our shipyards are facing competition
from lower cost regional shipyards. The concessionary tax covers
a very wide range of maritime-related sectors, and, I think, one
which will still be an uphill battle for many of these operators
to compete. I think this tax will go some way to helping them deal
with the pressures of global competition. Over the past couple of months,
I have met a couple of residents who were working in the maritime
sector, and these residents were retrenched over the past couple
of months. Usually they are able to find new jobs but they have
difficulty finding similar jobs in the maritime sector. The result of this is they
have to take pay cuts because their previous work experience was not
directly relevant.</p>

make sure that the new jobs are created by these incentives would
be to find a way to link the tax breaks to the employment of Singaporeans.
One way to do this would be that in order to get the tax incentives
under this, approval needs to be given by the Minister or his appointed
representative. One of the considerations that might be taken into
account in giving approval to companies applying for this tax break
would be the composition of their workforce. </p>

of discretion is still necessary; so putting hard and fast rules
may not be entirely helpful. But one factor that the Minister might
take into account, depending on the individual company, would be
the proportion of the workforce that is Singaporean. Additionally,
it might also be helpful to require these companies to interview
people referred to them by the CDC, especially people who get retrenched
from the maritime sector who are looking for more jobs in that area.
Perhaps guidelines could be incorporated to this effect as well
internally. This is not something for legislative change but something
which we can use with the current proposed legislation. </p>

to reiterate my support for this Bill. I think the tax incentives are
going to be very helpful to the sectors concerned and, hopefully,
helpful to Singaporeans who are looking for jobs in those sectors.
I hope that the suggestions I have made can be taken into account
when they are being implemented.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
let me first thank <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mrs
Lina Chiam</span> and M<span class="ph hcInline hcMember">r
Vikram Nair</span> for their comments. Let me respond first
to the suggestion on how we could deal with the enhanced deductions
for R&amp;D under the Productivity and Innovation Incentive (PIC).</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0996a418-afd5-4593-83ec-ebea5b701f6f">
                  <a name="id-a4c871d7-f831-4c88-9387-2876dd07aa90__id-0996a418-afd5-4593-83ec-ebea5b701f6f"><!--a--></a>First, let me highlight
that the aims of the R&amp;D enhanced deductions are the same as the
rest of the PIC. It was not about nurturing the R&amp;D industry <em class="ph i">per
se</em> for which we already have strong incentives. It is really
part of a comprehensive PIC incentive to encourage pervasive innovation
and to promote improved productivity. The benefits were specifically
tailored to favour the SMEs so that they can gain from this to the
largest extent possible. And so, as a result, we included as many
types of investments that could contribute to productivity. Six
categories to be exact, including R&amp;D. For expenditure on training,
which is another category under the PIC, we do not discriminate
between local and foreign employees. Again, the aim is mainly to
get businesses to value skills training and upgrading as a way to
improve their productivity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e8c76312-77e8-4227-85bd-c761dcf25693">
                  <a name="id-a4c871d7-f831-4c88-9387-2876dd07aa90__id-e8c76312-77e8-4227-85bd-c761dcf25693"><!--a--></a>To the question of why we
allow R&amp;D done outside of Singapore to qualify for the PIC scheme:
We want a strong incentive for the companies to undertake R&amp;D
in the first instance; in other words, please get started on R&amp;D,
never mind where it is done. Therefore, as an exception, we have
been prepared to be generous to allow the expenses incurred on R&amp;D,
whether done in Singapore or abroad, to enjoy the PIC deductions,
up to the expenditure cap of $400,000. R&amp;D spending beyond $400,000
will enjoy 100% tax deduction if done outside of Singapore and 150%
if done within Singapore.
So, there is a differentiation in the benefit depending on the location
where the R&amp;D is conducted, but this happens after the first
$400,000 of deduction. </p>

we restricted costs supportable under the PIC to local employees'
costs and to R&amp;D conducted within Singapore only, it will make
it difficult for SMEs to benefit fully from the PIC and we are less
likely to achieve our objective. What is more critical is that we
succeed in raising productivity and reducing manpower needs and,
by doing so, wages are more likely to go up over time, and this
is how the PIC aims to benefit Singaporeans.</p>

look at the workforce composition when approving incentives for
shipping related support services: Generally, tax incentives are
tools to encourage companies to locate high value activities in
Singapore, create jobs and bring about economic benefits. They are
subject to conditions such as fixed asset investments, total business
spending in Singapore, and the number and types of jobs created.
Such incentive recipients, like other companies in Singapore, are
also subject to foreign worker quotas and levies which are the existing
policy levers to manage our dependence on foreign workers.</p>

comments on the personal income tax regime. First, I would like
to point out that our personal income tax rates are generally already
low and progressive. Only 43% of our resident workforce pays income
tax at all. So, the lower income earners do not pay income tax.
Further, I should point out that with this round of enhancements,
all tax payers will pay less personal income tax, but the middle-income
earners will enjoy the largest percentage reduction in their taxes.
In fact, these changes were made in line with the objective to improve
our progressivity of the personal income tax. It is estimated that
these changes would result in a revenue loss of $519 million. Quite
significant. A sum which, in fact, could alternatively have been
used to provide very targeted assistance to the needy. So, the changes
have been introduced to benefit the middle-income earners, and taking
into consideration that our low-income earners already do not pay
personal income taxes, this is a fair approach. Sir, I hope that I
have addressed the Members' suggestions and concerns; and so, on
that note, I beg to move.</p>

comprises eight amendments. Two amendments give legislative effect
to Budget 2011 initiatives, while the remaining six amendments arise
from the periodic review of our stamp duty system. </p>

on the provisions in the Bill that give legislative effect to the
two measures announced in Budget 2011. First, stamp duty relief
will be made available for a company converting into a Limited Liability
Partnership (LLP), subject to conditions. This relief provides more
flexibility for companies restructuring to LLPs. Clause 4(a) of the
Bill provides for this change. Secondly, we will remove most fixed
and nominal stamp duties of $2 and $10 on documents executed on
or after 19 February 2011. This streamlines our stamp duty regime
and reduces taxpayers' compliance cost. Clauses 2, 3, 6, 7(a), 8,
12 and 13 provide for this change.</p>

the other tax changes covered in this Bill that arise from the periodic
review of our stamp duty policies and administration. Let me highlight
two of these changes. In Budget 2010, the Minister for Finance had
announced the stamp duty relief for qualifying mergers and acquisitions
(M&amp;As). Clauses 5 and 14 propose changes to align conditions
for stamp duty relief, such as the qualifying period, more closely
to the conditions in the income tax allowance for qualifying M&amp;As.
This will provide for greater consistency and ease compliance.</p>

effect to the new GST scheme for approved marine customers to buy
or rent goods at zero-rate GST automatically, so long as the goods
are for use or installation on a commercial ship that is wholly
for international travel. Previously, suppliers of such goods needed
to maintain documentary proof of the export of the goods for GST
zero-rating. With the new scheme, suppliers can zero-rate the supply
of goods to these pre-approved customers without the need to maintain
export documentation. This simplifies GST compliance for businesses
supporting the marine industry. </p>

storage facilities in Singapore, and purchase-related services,
such as auction, insurance and valuation in respect of the stored
goods. The GST zero-rating also covers the renting of storage units
used to store such high value goods. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill
provide for this initiative. </p>

the GST compliance burden of local agents who frequently import
goods for overseas persons. Currently, local agents are not able
to claim input GST on the goods imported for the overseas persons
if the goods have undergone a treatment or process that changes
the nature or form of the goods, before being supplied in Singapore.
Given that any further value-add to the imported goods would have
been priced into the subsequent supply and accounted for eventually,
the Act will be amended to enable local agents to recover GST on
such goods. In addition, local agents who are approved under GST
suspension or deferment scheme would be able to use the scheme to
also suspend or defer payment of import GST on goods imported for overseas persons for
subsequent re-export. Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill provide for
the changes.</p>

clarification of the GST rules for determining when a supply is
made and thus when GST needs to be accounted for. We have simplified
the rules for accounting of GST to be at the earlier of the tax
invoice date or payment date in Budget 2010. This amendment clarifies
that the alternative rules, that existed before the simplification
in Budget 2010, will continue to apply for certain specialised transactions,
such as the assignment of rights over land. This is provided under
clause 2 of the Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </p>

                     </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b424f6e8-8390-4361-a219-2ff0459c82be">

Bill comprises three main categories of changes. The first category
seeks to enhance Customs enforcement. The second category allows Singapore
Customs to share information collected under the Customs Act with
domestic public agencies for the investigation and prosecution of
certain offences, or when it is in the public interest to do so.
The third category improves the administration of the Customs Act.
Let me now highlight the key changes.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-431a34e2-8217-4e79-9b07-7e95a7ca34fb">

the penalties for tobacco-related offences. Sir, from 2005 to 2010,
the number of tobacco-related customs offences increased by about
24%, while the number of repeat offenders in the same period increased
by more than six times. We will introduce mandatory imprisonment
for repeat offenders caught with more than 2 kg of tobacco products,
and increase the minimum court fine to $4,000 for all repeat offenders,
comprising $2,000 for the unpaid duty, and $2,000 for the unpaid
GST.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a8eb5e2a-9328-4a66-a604-a5fa9714113b">
                     <a name="id-4ea846b3-cc27-4c7d-b754-8d3e53a4cf5d__id-a8eb5e2a-9328-4a66-a604-a5fa9714113b"><!--a--></a>We will also increase the
court fines for first-time offenders caught with contraband cigarettes.
Currently, the minimum court fine as provided under the Act is 10
times the duty and tax payable, which could at times be lower than
the composition sum for minor offence cases. The minimum court fine
will therefore be raised to $2,000 for first-time offenders, comprising
$1,000 each for the unpaid duty and the unpaid GST. Clause 17 of the
Bill provides for these changes.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cbb1b6ff-4d98-4ad5-b61f-13e8272a6ad5">
                     <a name="id-4ea846b3-cc27-4c7d-b754-8d3e53a4cf5d__id-cbb1b6ff-4d98-4ad5-b61f-13e8272a6ad5"><!--a--></a>We will also amend the Act
to extend liability to any person who furnishes incorrect information
to another for making declarations. Currently, traders may appoint
third-party agents to declare their consignments. However, under
the Act, only declaring agents who make false declarations may be
prosecuted, but not the traders who provide the information. Clause 15 of the Bill
allows Singapore Customs to prosecute traders who have provided
incorrect information as well.</p>

amendment that facilitates the disclosure of information to domestic
public agencies, subject to safeguards.</p>

by traders is strictly confidential. It can only be disclosed with
their consent, or if the information is necessary for the purposes
of an investigation, enforcement or prosecution under the Customs
Act or the Goods and Services Tax Act. This is to protect sensitive
commercial data and uphold our integrity as a trading hub. However,
we recognise that there may be over-riding reasons for Singapore
Customs to disclose information to other domestic public agencies.
These could be for the purpose of investigation and prosecution
of offences under other domestic laws, or when there are national
security, public health and safety concerns.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-600f4cea-28b2-4a5a-9e90-160464184da0">

be amended to allow Singapore Customs to disclose information to
domestic public agencies, where public interests are of concern.
To reassure traders that confidentiality of their trade data will
be respected, comprehensive procedural safeguards will be established.
Agencies requesting for customs information will be required to
seek approval from the Minister for Finance. Each request will be considered
carefully, and will be granted only when there is a strong justification
to do so. In addition, any information disclosed to the domestic
public agencies will be governed by the Official Secrets Act. Clause
11 of the Bill provides for this change.</p>

some of the amendments that will improve the administration of the
Act.</p>

system for minor customs offences. This helps to streamline the
enforcement process by automatically requiring any offender who
fails to pay the composition sum to be brought to court. The offences
for which the ticketing system is applicable will be prescribed.
Clause 14 of the Bill provides for this change.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6fa4089e-c1d3-4f96-9981-fded1d86ef44">

Customs to appoint persons such as a taxpayer's bank or employer
as an agent for recovering unpaid duties. This is similar to the
provision for the Income Tax Act and GST Act. Clause 13 of the Bill
provides for these changes.</p>

to the use of image systems for the retention of trade documents.
Traders must retain trade documents, regardless of whether these
are in hardcopy or electronic form, for no less than five years.
Clauses 10 to 12 of the Bill allow traders to keep an electronic
image of the records instead of the original documents, at any time
after the goods in question have been removed from customs control.</p>

provision to facilitate the implementation of the Compressed Natural
Gas (CNG) duty. In Budget 2009, we announced that CNG will be dutiable
from 1 January 2012. The Customs Act will therefore be amended to
define CNG as a dutiable fuel, and to extend the three-quarter tank
rule to include CNG tanks. Clauses 2, 4, 18 and 20 of the Bill provide
for this change.</p>

clauses to allow subsidiary legislation to be made.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, this Bill is an important one. It impacts trade flow and the
movement of people. With the amendments, it is hoped it will enhance
our border management and improve the ability to collaborate more
with the other agencies, especially when dealing with issues related
to national security, public health and safety. I do, Sir, have
a few points to raise.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-73b0a860-4fb3-4f37-8db6-c8fdac5ae90e">

Singapore Customs investing in new technology and how are they adapting
to the higher and more sophisticated technology of today in terms
of training, skills enhancement and information technology?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5ae20243-3f7e-40d5-8527-868254fc162d">

it is stated that the Minister may prescribe the operator of authorised
pier or place to comply with the Director-General's instructions.
Now, will they be given ample notice and sufficient preparatory
time as this may have an effect on their day-to-day operations which
may require diversions? It will also be good to clarify this more
precisely, for example, the circumstances under which the Director-General may
prescribe the requirements and restrictions.</p>

82 and 143, Sir, pertaining to the refund clauses moving to subsidiary
legislation, it would have been good to have drafted the subsidiary
legislation for the refund clauses for licence fees before the draft
amendments to the Customs Act are legislated. This way we can also
gather inputs and comments from the traders as well as the public.</p>

has a new section 125A inserted on the issuance of a prescribed
notice from Customs officer instead of having to go through courts,
it can certainly expedite the process of issuing summonses. But
does it carry the same weight? Does it mean it is easier to appeal
against as it is not issued by the courts and will these prescribed
notices be allowed to be compounded? In that same section, Sir,
it would be clearer if provisions for minor offences and its applicability
can be illustrated as examples. Also, if these minor offences would
affect the trade first grading band of companies, it should at least
be transparent. How?</p>

the Minister to make certain regulations, one of these relates to
the World Customs Organisation (SAFE) or SAFE framework of standards
to facilitate and secure global trade. Can the Minister explain
the rationale for this? Are there any formal agreements with our
active trade partners? </p>

how does Customs officer handle someone with an infectious disease

hold these people?</p>

the fine-tuning of clause 17 which amends section 128L(2) and (4)
pertaining to relevant tobacco products. In fact, I would like to
express my vote of thanks to the Customs officers who have been
very proactive especially in my constituency pertaining to this
matter. I hope they will continue their proactive work as it is
much needed. With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>

let me thank Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef for her comments and queries.
Sir, to the first question on the use of information technology, indeed,
to keep up with the times and to tackle new challenges, Singapore
Customs has had to intensively leverage on IT to enhance operational
effectiveness and to better serve the trading community. In fact,
this year, Customs launched Document Exchange or Doc X to enable
authorised business partners to share documents securely and easily. On
1 January 2012, very soon, Customs will be launching version 4.1
of TradeNet, the latest version of Singapore's electronic data interchange
system, for the clearance of trade documentation. Users who are
familiar with TradeNet will know that it is not only well accepted,
it is regarded in the international community as one system that
has contributed greatly to the efficiency of our trade clearing
procedures. These are just some examples of the continuous efforts
made by Customs to stay abreast.</p>

                  <a name="id-4ea846b3-cc27-4c7d-b754-8d3e53a4cf5d__id-7d1decf8-e118-4ebf-af5d-192e36c13010"><!--a--></a>As to the Member's important
question on how Singapore Customs keeps up with international alerts,
yes, it actively monitors the relevant UN decisions and sanction
list. When a trade-related sanction is imposed by the UN Security
Council, Singapore Customs enforces it through compliance and audit
checks on companies trading in strategic goods to ensure that Singapore
fulfils our obligations. Customs officers also conduct frequent
outreach to keep the trading community informed of new developments
and key issues so that they, in partnership with Customs, can help
to ensure that our trade flows remain secure. Singapore Customs
performs dual roles in trade facilitation and supply chain security.
It also works closely with other Government agencies, including
the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the border checkpoints
to maintain the integrity of our trading system and to facilitate
legitimate trade.</p>

number of queries that really relate to the ICA's purview, for example,
questions on bio-security and infectious diseases control at the checkpoints.
These are perhaps better addressed by the ICA. So may I suggest
to the Member that a PQ be filed so that a more comprehensive response
can be given? This is also the case for some of the detailed clauses
that at the implementation stage will benefit from fine-tuning. We would be very
happy to engage the Member on those matters.</p>

                  </span>: There are seven industrial REITs in
Singapore, which together own about 17% or 6.6 million square metres
(sqm) of the total industrial space in Singapore. The industrial
REITs play a useful role in Singapore's industrial property market.
For example, they develop customised facilities on behalf of some
industrialists, and then lease the facilities to them. This allows
the industrialists to operate in customised facilities without having
to pay development costs upfront. Industrial REITs may also buy
completed facilities from industrialists, and then lease the facilities
back to them. These two models help industrialists lighten their
balance sheet, and channel the freed-up resources into their business
operations or expansion plans.</p>

JTC required buyers of the industrial properties to ensure business
continuity for existing tenants. As a result, rental escalation

properties divested to Mapletree in 2008, rental rates for existing
tenants were capped at 5% growth per annum over JTC's July 2007
posted rentals for three years. For properties divested to Mapletree
in 2011, rental rates for existing tenants were capped at 5% growth

were also discounts for tenants who had more than 10 years of continuous
tenancy.</p>

                  </span>: I
understand the concern that Dr Lee is expressing. Indeed, even though
we have put a set of casino social safeguards, let me assure the House
that the Government continues to monitor and to review the situation.
Nothing is cast in stone, and we are prepared to strengthen our
social safeguards as need be. </p>

that gambling is an expense and not a means to make a living, and
to discourage casual and impulse gambling. Some believe that a higher
levy will be a more effective deterrence. Others worry that increasing
the levy will only cause Singaporean visitors to intensify their
gambling so as to "max out" the upfront cost of the entry levy.
The jury is still out as to which is the likely behaviour of Singaporeans
if we raise the levy. </p>

abolishing the annual levy. Some believe that we should abolish
the annual levy because it encourages Singaporeans to visit the
casinos too frequently. My Ministry shares the concern about frequent
gamblers at the casinos. We are studying this issue, which is different
from that of impulse gambling. We are also looking at the experience
of other countries. In Holland for example, they look out for frequent
gamblers and interview them. Depending on their assessment, they
may subsequently limit the patron's visits to the casinos or even
exclude them. Depending on our assessment of the problem, we may
consider different measures to deter frequent gamblers. What we
put in place eventually, if any, will have to suit our local context
and meet our needs and situation.</p>

and should be stringent, they should not and cannot replace individual
responsibility. Individuals must make the correct decision to gamble responsibly.
In our Asian context, we also encourage families to play their part

families to apply for casino exclusion orders, which is the right
instrument if their family members are gambling addicts.</p>

workers. Many foreign workers are financially vulnerable and at
risk. At this point in time, to help foreign workers avoid the perils
of problem gambling, we are focusing on a targeted approach of combining
education and casino exclusions. Such an approach also emphasises
individual responsibility. For an individual, Self-Exclusion can
be a much more effective upstream safeguard against problem gambling
than even a downstream monetary quantum.</p>

face language barriers in applying for exclusions, the National
Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has put in place arrangements
to enable employers to facilitate foreign workers' application and
to encourage their foreign workers to be prudent. The results have
been encouraging. As at 31 October 2011, we have more than 26,000
Self-Exclusions by foreigners in force. We expect the numbers to continue
to rise. NCPG will continue to work with MOM and employers to advise
foreign workers to apply for Self-Exclusion.</p>

prepared to strengthen social safeguards as and when necessary.
One upcoming change is the tightening of advertising and promotions by
the casinos. We will soon amend the Casino Control (Advertising)
Regulations to make it crystal clear to both casinos that they cannot
target the domestic market. The Regulations will also be widened
to cover not only advertisements but any promotion of the casinos,
which should prevent incidents like the heartland shuttle buses.
We will make further announcements in due course.</p>

                  </a> conducted at the National University Hospital
in 2003 showed that the prevalence of major depressive disorders
was 4.3% in both prenatal and postnatal women. Initiatives targeted
at early intervention of women who may be at risk of prenatal and
postnatal depression were incorporated in the National Mental Health
Blueprint. Launched in 2007, the Blueprint aims to promote mental
health, prevent the development of mental health problems, as well
as reduce the impact of mental disorders. The mental health initiatives
for pregnant women consist of mental health teams integrating into
routine prenatal and postnatal care of women seen at KKH and NUH
to conduct screening and intervention for mental health conditions.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">MG [NS] Chan Chun Sing</strong>
                  </span>: Singapore
does not have a national poverty line. Different countries adopt
different approaches to help those in need, depending on their own
unique situations. Some establish a poverty line to identify those
who need help. For example, in the United States, the 2010 threshold
for a family of four works out to be about US$1,860 (S$2,390) per
month. Based on this threshold, the US' poverty rate is about 15.1%.
On the other hand, other countries like Canada and New Zealand do
not have an official poverty line. Canada, for instance, adopts
an income threshold, determined using family expenditure data, in
guiding its assessment of the populace's needs. </p>

rule on how to determine needs. In Singapore, we take an approach
of tailoring our social safety net to different groups, depending
on their needs and circumstances. This approach is more flexible
and no less effective than countries that choose to adopt a poverty
line. Our help schemes typically cover the bottom 20th percentile
of households, with the flexibility to go beyond if the family's
circumstances merit special consideration. This approach allows
us to provide more targeted and customised forms of assistance with
real outcomes for families and individuals.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 708</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4bbcd50b-f751-4cac-94f8-2a162408c6d9">

example. For a family of four where the male breadwinner has lost
his job, assistance from ComCare will help the family manage financially
and put food on the table. The vouchers for utilities, service and
conservancy charges given to the family ensure that they continue
to have electricity, water and gas for their daily needs. The two young
children can go to childcare with the help of subsidies from ComCare.
This not only allows for the children to continue to attend preschool
and socialise with other children, but also enables both parents
to look for work. The working parents, if eligible, may receive
a Workfare Income Supplement as an addition to their wages and CPF
savings, as well as an encouragement for them to stay employed. Different
help schemes, in this case ComCare and Workfare, complement each
other to help our clients in their journey. This is what I mean
by our approach to provide targeted assistance with real outcomes
for families and individuals.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4911f274-a74b-40a5-93fd-639a9cb27b03">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4911f274-a74b-40a5-93fd-639a9cb27b03"><!--a--></a>	Dr Lily Neo has also asked
whether more assistance could be rendered to needy households. The
Government has regularly reviewed its assistance programmes and subsidies
in anticipation of evolving needs. Over the years, we have raised
the level of help given to needy households. For instance, our population
is rapidly ageing and more elderly would need eldercare services.
To increase the accessibility of community-based eldercare services,
MCYS has extended subsidies to such services up to the 50th income percentile
in October this year. We have also increased funding to senior activities centres
that serve low income elderly. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7fb92211-1fb2-43d5-9966-4cc3901567ae">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-7fb92211-1fb2-43d5-9966-4cc3901567ae"><!--a--></a>We also recognise the importance
of developing children. For this reason, ComCare assistance schemes
for young children were enhanced in April this year to go beyond the
20th percentile of households. Therefore, a family with two young
children for instance, and earning a gross household income up to
$3,500 – which previously exceeded the old $1,800 household income
threshold – can now benefit from such pre-school subsidies. Families
can consequently focus their resources on other needs within the
family. </p>

Neo that we will continue to review our social assistance schemes
to ensure that they remain relevant to the evolving needs of the
low income and vulnerable. If Dr Neo or any member of the public
comes across Singaporeans who may need help, please direct them
to our Community Development Council, a Family Service Centre, or

Job seekers or workers who require employment assistance can approach
WDA's career centres at the five CDCs or the Employment and Employability
Institute (e2i). Since 2009, there have been about 37,000 cases
of Singaporeans aged 50 and above who sought employment assistance.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 709</p>

seekers were placed in jobs. Those who are not placed continue to
receive assistance from the career centres and e2i, such as further
coaching and referrals to additional training to improve their chances
of landing a job. </p>

should be noted that the unemployment rate amongst Singaporean workers
above 50 remains low. It was only 2.7% in 2010, in fact a little
lower than the overall unemployment rate of 3.4% then. Nevertheless,
older workers who are out of a job tend to face greater difficulties
in getting back into the workplace. The common difficulties faced
include insufficient literacy and numeric skills, a lack of relevant
skills and mismatches in expectations.</p>

we have been working closely with our tripartite partners to expand
their employment opportunities and improve their employability.
This involves introducing new legislation, training and re-training,
job re-design, workplace improvements as well as changing the mindsets
of both employers and employees.</p>

we have taken steps to ensure that our workers have the opportunity
to work for as long as they can and want to. The Retirement and
Re-employment Act will take effect in January next year, enabling
more people to continue working beyond the current statutory retirement
age of 62. Although the law will only come into effect next year,
our recent survey shows that more employers are willing to re-employ
eligible workers. The proportion of private establishments that
allowed their local employees to work past 62 increased significantly
from 64% in 2009 to 77% in 2010. The Public Service is also playing
its part. Over the last two years (2009 – 2010), 1,400 officers
(eight in 10 retiring officers) were offered re-employment and 83%
accepted. </p>

have put in place several schemes to encourage companies to employ
older workers. This includes the ADVANTAGE! Scheme<a href="#fntarg_2" name="fnsrc_2">
                     <sup>2</sup>
                  </a> introduced in 2005, which provides
a grant to help companies recruit and retain older workers. This
year, the Government introduced a one-off Special Employment Credit
(SEC) scheme to raise the employability of older, low-wage Singaporeans.
These efforts have helped to expand the employment opportunities
for older workers.</p>

programmes, we are also working with our tripartite partners to
shape positive perceptions among employers and the public towards
the employment of older workers. We have seen positive results.
The employment rate of older workers aged 55-64 reached a high of
59% in 2010. MOM will continue to work with our tripartite partners

                  </span>: The Land
Transport Authority's proposed road across Bukit Brown is needed
to ease traffic congestion in that area during peak hours. Today,
the tailback on the slip road from PIE onto Lornie Road is often
more than 500 metres during the evening peak hours. With new developments
in the centre and north of Singapore, the Land Transport Authority
expects this traffic demand to further grow by as much as 30% by
2020. </p>

of Lornie Road. This however adversely impacted the existing nature
reserve and also required the acquisition of private homes. The
idea of a viaduct above Lornie Road or Bukit Brown was also looked
at. This was found unsuitable because the building process itself
would have the same if not greater impact than a road on Bukit Brown
Cemetery. Likewise for the option of a tunnel, conventional excavation
would have to be employed due to the required width of the tunnel
and this would have an adverse impact greater than a road option.
On the balance of these considerations, the road option was chosen
as it posed the least adverse impact on the existing nature reserve,
on Bukit Brown Cemetery, and also does not require the acquisition
of residences. </p>

needed to make difficult decisions over competing interests, about
how we use our land. This is necessary because land is scarce in
an island like Singapore with its plural ethnic character and corresponding
diversity of interests. Whether such choices and decisions had entailed
the acquisition of private land, or communal spaces including cemeteries

CPF members turning 55 from 2013 onwards and who have $40,000 or

who are aged 55 and older have been able to opt into CPF LIFE since
Sep 2009. Many such members are already receiving payouts under
the Minimum Sum Scheme or have already finalised their financial
arrangements in retirement. Nonetheless, more than 70,000 chose
to sign up for CPF LIFE. </p>

would have withdrawn any remaining balances in their Ordinary Accounts,
and looking at OA balances at this age is not meaningful. The level
of balances in the Retirement Account (RA) is more pertinent, since

enterprises are businesses with a social mission. They play a useful

organisations. </p>

social enterprises through the ComCare Enterprise Fund, especially
"Work-Integration" Social Enterprises. These are enterprises that provide
training and employment opportunities for individuals from needy
or disadvantaged groups, such as persons with disability, ex-offenders,
youths-at-risk, persons recovering from psychiatric illnesses, etc.
Since 2003, about $10 million has been disbursed to about 80 social enterprises.
These have brought about benefit to needy or disadvantaged groups.
For example, more than 1,600 beneficiaries have found employment
opportunities in these social enterprises.</p>

educational programmes, the Association has also set up a Social
Enterprise Development Centre in 2010 to provide business advice

on how it can better support social enterprises. We hope to do more
in the following areas.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4169fbb2-0d5a-40c9-8904-dff6fa4b9b66">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4169fbb2-0d5a-40c9-8904-dff6fa4b9b66"><!--a--></a>	First, we would like to
raise awareness and knowledge of local social enterprises. We hope
to work with partners like the Social Enterprise Association to
educate consumers and help social enterprises better profile their
products and services. This may entail creating more platforms and
opportunities for them to showcase themselves to consumers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37c166c7-6f42-4d45-9461-92cad2068509">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-37c166c7-6f42-4d45-9461-92cad2068509"><!--a--></a>Second, MCYS hopes to nurture
greater interest and involvement in social entrepreneurship amongst
youths, many of whom have an interest to further a social cause
through small businesses. We will explore with schools and Institutions
of Higher Learning to support student-initiated social enterprise
projects, and programmes to equip youths with the competencies needed
to be successful social entrepreneurs. </p>

in the areas of talent attraction and capability building. It is
challenging for social enterprises to manage both its social mission
and business viability. To better support social enterprises in
managing its double bottom-lines, MCYS will look at developing new
programmes, increasing accessibility to training, and bringing in
expertise from the private sector to assist social enterprises. </p>
