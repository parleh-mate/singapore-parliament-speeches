<div align="center"><b>MOTION OF CONFIDENCE</b></div>



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to  move  this  motion   of

confidence in the Government,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its confidence in the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the past week have been so rapid

and  dramatic  that  it would take  some  time  for

everybody  to  grasp  their full  significance.  On

Monday, the 10th of July-ten days ago - at a forum at

the  University of Malaya especially organised  for

the  occasion  to discuss the basis of  merger,  an

open  collision took place between Mr Devan  Nair,

who  represented the P.A.P., and Mr Woodhull,  who

represented Mr Lim Ching Siong and four others  in

the  T.U.C. Mr Woodhull, Mr Devan Nair,  Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan, the Deputy  Prime

Minister, myself and several other members  of  the

Central  Executive Committee of my Party  were  old

comrades in the P.A.P. Now an open break has  taken

place  when Mr Woodhull, a Political Secretary  in

the  present  Government, in the last week  of  the

Anson  by-election, openly attacked Mr Devan Nair,

a   former  member  of  the  P.A.P. and  a  P.A.P.

stalwart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, the 14th of July - six days ago-eight

Assemblymen  of the P.A.P. came out supporting  the

Trade  Union  Six;  and, in open  breach  of  Party

discipline and the rules of decency, created public

confusion  by  demanding the P.A.P.'s disavowal  of

Mr Devan Nair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was this all about? Their object in doing

this was to make us lose the Anson by-election  and

the  more  heavily our candidate was defeated,  the

more  it suited their plot. They have succeeded  in

making  our candidate lose. 1,500 people  abstained

from  voting in Anson, disillusioned by this  Party

dissension  brought out into the open  deliberately

on  the  eve  of Polling Day, and we  lost  to  the

present Member for Anson by 546 votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it all about? The time has come to begin

to  explain frankly what is happening and why it is

happening.  After Hong Lim, when we  were  defeated

badly, I felt that if the people desired



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



it, there should be a reference back to the people.

However,  it was decided by a majority  opinion  of

the Party that we should first fight Anson and then

reconsider  the  position. At that  time,  Mr  Lim

Ching   Siong  and  all  his  trade  union  friends

strenuously  opposed any talk of  our  resignation.

Now,  however,  after  losing  Anson  by  a  narrow

majority, and because of this attempt by the  Trade

Union  Six and eight Assemblymen - one of whom  is  a

member  of  the  Trade  Union  Six - to  capture  the

Government  and the Party, we are resolved  not  to

abdicate  our position in order that the Party  and

the  Government  does not pass into  the  hands  of

people who intend to use it for purposes for  which

the  people did not vote the P.A.P. in. The present

leadership of the Party was responsible for winning

the  last elections and getting the mandate of  the

people,  and  it is our duty not to  give  Mr  Lim

Ching Siong and his friends any opportunity to take

over  this  Government in order  to  run  it  as  a

Communist front Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it all about? Their first plan now, since

they  are unable to capture the Government,  is  to

get  me  to resign in order that someone whom  they

believe they can manipulate could be elected  Prime

Minister.  They  hope  in  this  way  to  force   a

compromise in the policy of the Government so  that

they  can  extend Communist influence in  Singapore

and   prevent  us  from  fulfilling  our   declared

objective of independence through merger  with  the

Federation  with or without the Borneo  territories

in  1963. This move has now been frustrated by  the

unanimous   decision  of  the   Central   Executive

Committee  to  stand collectively together  against

any  change. And this stand has been endorsed by  a

majority of P.A.P. Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is one of confidence and the motion

will  have  to  be  carried as  it  stands  without

amendment,  or  the  Government  must  resign   and

general   elections  follow.   On   a   motion   of

confidence, any amendment is tantamount to  a  vote

of no confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the hon. Members on the other side of the

House, may I say, on behalf of my colleagues and I,

that  if they want general elections then they  can

vote against the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary session has become necessary

because  of the sudden turn of events of  the  last

few  weeks.  Eight Assemblymen on the  P.A.P. side

have  openly  defied the Party leadership.  Demands

for my resignation as Prime Minister have been made

and  it  is  now  necessary that the  House  should

clearly give us a mandate to carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when we

last  met  on  14th  June,  1961,  the  House   was

adjourned  sine  die,  the  reason  being  that  we

expected  to  prorogue the session  and  re-convene

again at the end of October after you have returned

from  a  C.P.A. conference in London. I  understand

you  will  be  leaving Singapore in  September  and

returning  in mid-October. Therefore,  before  this

House  goes into recess, we must make it  clear  to

the people that we have the mandate of the Assembly

to carry on as the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this stand we know that we shall face a fresh

offensive which will be mounted maybe on labour and

industrial  sections  and  on  many  other  fronts.

Therefore,  it was necessary that I should  have  a

clear  mandate from the Central Executive Committee

and  the  P.A.P. Assemblymen who have  to  go  into

battle  with us. This mandate I have been given  by

the  Party,  and  I  now formally  ask  it  of  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my duty to tell the House of the trials and

tribulations  which  lie  ahead  and  of  the  many

unpleasant  things which may have  to  be  done  in

order  to  maintain the economy of this island  and

the people's welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come also for the unvarnished truth

to  be  told. For two years, the British Government

has  tried to manipulate the P.A.P. into a position

where  we  will become the successor  to  what  was

called  the  Lim  Yew  Hock Government,  where  the

Communist  Party will be attacked  not  by  British

imperialism,   which  is  the  supreme   power   in

Singapore,   but   by  us,  the   locally   elected

Government  with  limited powers. To  achieve  this

end,  every blandishment and argument has been  put

forward,  and every device and seductive  manoeuvre

practised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years, the British have decided that the

P.A.P. is impervious probably to such blandishment

and  perhaps they have decided that we may  be  men

who  are  not influenced by personal considerations

of wishing to stay in power. We have stated that we

are prepared to lay down our office at any time  at

the behest of the people and we are not going to be

manipulated by any power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big scheme we have only been able to piece

together  after  the Anson by-election.  The  plot,

counter-plot and sub-plots that have been going  on

would make an Oppenheim thriller read like a simple

comic  strip  cartoon.  The  diplomacy,  skill  and

cunning  of  some  300 years of  the  building  and

running   of  the  British  Empire,  and   in   the

manipulation of men and their motivations  have  in

great  part  led  to this curious  position,  daily

going curiouser and curiouser.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British, as I see it, had two objectives. The

first objective was to engineer a collision between

the  non-Communist  Left  in  the  P.A.P. and  the

Communist  Left  leadership in  the  unions.  Their

second  objective  is  to ensure  that  the  Borneo

territories are put into a position where they will

come  together  immediately in a  federation  under

British  tutelage, but in a state of  readiness  if

the  international situation turns delicate  to  be

transferred to a nationalist government of "Greater

Malaysia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the planners of this scheme for

having succeeded thus far. Day by day, on the basis

of  British  blandishments, manoeuvres,  hints  and

gestures,  all parties - the Communists, the  P.A.P.,

the  Federation  and  the  leaders  of  the  Borneo

territories - have all been putting in stakes on  the

poker  table, and they are mounting.  To  the

pro-Communists  in  Singapore, the  British  say,  have

said,  and  are saying, that they are  liberal  and

democratic, and that if they have released men from

prison  to  be  Prime Ministers, and only  recently

have  done  so again in Nyasaland, then why  should

they want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



keep detainees in gaol? It is darkly hinted that it

is  the wicked Singapore Government that wanted  to

keep them in gaol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These insinuations started slowly. After the Hong

Lim by-election, they were intensified. The British

were  unhappy  that in Hong Lim the Communist  Left

rallied to the P.A.P. united front. I emphasise the

P.A.P. united front, and not the Communist  united

front.  So  some plan had to be devised  to  ensure

that the P.A.P. would come into collision with  the

Communist  Left.  Dinner  parties,  cocktails   and

luncheons  led  to friendly fraternisation  between

the  British  Lion  and Messrs.  Lim  Ching  Siong,

Woodhull  and Company. The pro-Communists were  led

to    believe   that   the   P.A.P. were   wicked

obstructionists,  and that the  British,  wise  and

statesmanlike people were prepared even to envisage

a  new "Left" government emerging in Singapore even

more  Left than the P.A.P., provided their military

bases  were not touched. What has happened is  that

the   British   have  become  their   own

agents-provocateur.  And  how  well they  have  succeeded!

Quietly  and  insidiously they have instigated  the

pro-Communists to attempt the capture of  both  the

P.A.P.   Government  and  the  Party.   Young   and

inexperienced  revolutionaries  were  so  taken  in

that,  in  a crisis, Lim Ching Siong, Woodhull  and

Fong Swee Suan looked up the U.K. Commissioner  for

consultations last Tuesday, the 18th, at Eden Hall,

the    home    of    the   British    imperialists'

representative. Sir, we felt that something curious

was going on and we therefore kept the residence of

the  U.K.  Commissioner under observation.  Lo  and

behold!    The    great    anti-colonialists    and

revolutionaries turned up for secret  consultations

with  the  British Lion. I am now  convinced,  Sir,

that  some  funny things are happening  when  in  a

serious crisis this revolutionary trio, instead  of

getting   in  touch  with  the  P.A.P.,  got   into

consultation  with  the U.K. Commissioner  at  Eden

Hall. I therefore suggest that, having led the

pro-Communists  into  believing  that  a  non-Communist

Government was no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>



longer   necessary   and   that   a   pro-Communist

Government was possible, obviously these  men  were

going  to  try  and  capture  the  P.A.P. and  the

Government.  And  the British may also  have  hoped

that under attack and threat of capture, the P.A.P.

would   fight   back  and  finally   suppress   the

Communists,  something they have so far  failed  in

persuading the P.A.P. to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, to the P.A.P., the British had

suggested  that we should take firm action  against

the  mounting subversion. In fact, a  plan  was  to

have  been drawn up which would have culminated  in

an   act   leading  to  open  collision  with   the

Communists  in which the P.A.P. either remained  in

office,  and so became committed forever to  defend

British colonialism, or resigned, in which  case  a

non-Communist  Government not amenable  to  British

pressure would have been got rid off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Federation began to believe that

they  could  get  the Borneo territories,  together

with  Singapore,  merged into a larger  federation.

The  Tunku  came down to Singapore on 27th  May,  a

week  before National Day, and announced to a group

of  foreign correspondents that he recognised  that

there  must  be closer political and economic  ties

between the Federation of Malaya, Singapore and the

three Borneo territories. I responded on the 3rd of

June,  National Day, that on principle we  welcomed

the  Tunku's  plan  for  a  larger  federation,  if

thereby merger between Singapore and the Federation

was made easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, on the other hand, immediately

propounded  that there was no need for independence

through merger, and that the next step should be to

abolish the Internal Security Council in order that

there  would  be expansion at all levels  of  human

activity on behalf of the Communist cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six trade unionists came out with statements

openly supporting the Communist line on the 2nd  of

June. 42 trade unions also supported this C.P. line

and  literally  put  their  rubber  stamps  on  the

statement  to  this  effect without  convening  any

meetings  or consulting the rank and file.  On  the

9th of June, the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



Chairman,  the Leader of the House, announced  that

the  Government would demand complete  independence

through merger with the Federation, or merger  with

a   larger  federation  when  Constitutional  talks

reopen  in 1963. The P.A.P. which was not  amenable

to  manipulation by the British, is not going to be

manipulated by the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took our stand and the battle then began. Three

days  after  the 9th of June, the Trade  Union  Six

demanded   immediate  release  of  the   detainees,

implementation  of  the  reunification   of   trade

unions, granting of citizenship rights to all those

loyal to the anti-colonial struggle, Communists  or

non-Communists, and more freedom of speech,  Press,

assembly  and  organisation for the advancement  of

the anti-colonial struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, two Governors and one High Commissioner

flew  in from Borneo to add impetus and mystery  to

the   fast   developing  plot.  All  these   events

incidentally  lent  credence to the  false  rumours

that  the  P.A.P. had  sold out  Singapore  to  an

imperialist  plot. The U.K. Commissioner  left  for

London; the Tunku and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  of

the Federation went to Brunei. Everyone started his

own  analysis and adopted his own counter measures.

The  Member  for Anson said this was  all  for  the

purpose of the Anson by-election. But the Communist

Left believed differently and decided that this was

an evil conspiracy to which the P.A.P. was a party.

They  mounted  the offensive and intensified  their

campaign.  The Trade Union Six openly attacked  the

P.A.P.;  three Political Secretaries in receipt  of

Government remuneration flagrantly flouted all  the

rules  of decency and attacked the Government  they

had  promised  to serve. 43 trade unions  came  out

against  merger supporting the Trade Union  Six  to

make  the  P.A.P. lose in Anson. Finally,  when  in

spite of everything the P.A.P. looked like winning,

they  engineered the betrayal of the Party by eight

Assemblymen issuing a statement of discord  on  the

eve  of  polls.  These people had been  duped  into

believing  that the P.A.P. had sold out the  rights

of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will take some time for me to tell you the

story  right from the beginning, and the story  may

have  to be continued to be told, over a period  of

time. But I feel the people must know the truth  in

order  that  when the mandate is returned  to  them

they can make their choice in full knowledge of the

facts.  And  the choice will be - do  you  want  your

future to be a Singapore merged with the Federation

of  Malaya, or do you want to follow people who ask

first  for  the abolition of the Internal  Security

Council,   as   a  first  step  to  an  independent

Communist Singapore? We saw these problems  looming

over  the  horizon  even whilst the  Hong  Lim

by-election was on, and I stressed over and over again

why  the  P.A.P. does not stand for an  independent

Singapore  and  why our future must  lie  with  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong and his friends took fright and alarm when rapid developments began regarding

merger.  They  were alarmed because  merger  is  no

longer  a  mirage over the horizon  but  a  reality

which  will  take place in 1963. Two Governors  and

one  High  Commissioner  arrived  from  Borneo   to

discuss  matters  with Lord Selkirk.  Lord  Selkirk

returned  to  London to discuss  matters  with  his

Government in London. The Tunku and the Agong  went

to  Brunei,  and the Tunku went on to Sarawak.  The

Tunku   made  a  broadcast  on  the  4th  of   July

announcing that he would take Brunei in as a  State

of  the Federation, together with North Borneo  and

Sarawak.  On  the 11th of July at a Rotary  dinner,

the  Tunku  said he would hold talks with Singapore

as to how Singapore should come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they oppose this merger? Why do they want

to  capture the Government and the Party to prevent

this  when for years they have always endorsed  and

supported  the P.A.P. plan of independence  through

merger? Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr Woodhull, Mr Fong

came  out  from  prison  because  we  had  won  the

elections  and  had  demanded their  release  as  a

condition  precedent  before  we  assumed   office.

Although  we  knew  that politically  our  opinions

differed on important points of

ideology from some of them, we were openly comrades

in  a united front and we did not betray them.  But

they,  on  the other hand, in the middle of  a

by-election  which was crucial to the Government,  and

for  the purpose of giving the P.A.P. a mandate for

merger,  for their own reasons, betrayed us  openly

at  Anson, caused dissension in the Party ranks and

confusion in the minds of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the battle lines have already been

drawn  and forces drawn up on each side. A  strange

twist  of  events has taken place  in  Borneo.  The

people  of Sarawak, it appears, do not want  merger

as  a  State  with  the  Federation  as  the  Tunku

suggested.  Neither, it appears, do the  people  of

North Borneo in which no single political party yet

exists. The British Governors talked of support for

"Greater  Malaysia" but only as a  long-term  plan.

The  Tunku was angered at this turn of events,  and

now  openly attacked British colonialism which  has

put  a stumbling block in the plan for merger of  a

larger  federation. And ten Malayan  officers  were

being  intimidated and chased out of Brunei because

it   is  believed  and  said  that  British  police

officers  were dilatory in protecting the  physical

safety of the Malayan officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, because "Greater Malaysia" had been

presented  to  the  people of Brunei,  Sarawak  and

North Borneo as a Federation colonising effort, the

three  territories  have  for  the  first  time  in

history  come together voluntarily on  the  British

plan of a Borneo federation. I congratulate the men

who  charted this course of events if, in fact, all

these  were  intended. The British are now  getting

the three Borneo territories together for the first

time  into a federation, after they have failed  so

far in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the British supported the Tunku's plan

for  "Greater Malaysia" on principle, but they  had

always said that the Borneo territories must form a

federation first before they merge with Malaya.  As

far   as  the  Borneo  territories  are  concerned,

therefore, the British have got everyone  well  and

happy,  except  probably the  ten  anxious  Malayan

officers in Brunei.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile in Singapore they have succeeded in

beguiling the pro-C.P. elements into believing that

the  P.A.P. had sold them out and encouraging  them

to  openly attack and betray the P.A.P. in Anson by

suggesting  that  there could be a government  even

more  Left than the P.A.P. The British were  happy,

for  they  thought  that after this  collision  the

P.A.P. would have to take strong measures to ensure

its survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, day by day the chips on the poker table are

mounting. The game as has been played has  gone  so

far  now  that no side can afford to back out,  and

some  time  in  the near future all cards  will  be

called  and  seen.  Whoever is bluffing  will  lose

bitterly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now say on behalf of my colleagues and my Party

that we are not going to fit in with the scheme  to

beat  up  the  C.P. for  the  benefit  of  British

colonialism.  If  we  get no  independence  through

merger,   we  will  leave  the  British  with   the

predicament  of having to deal with the  Communists

themselves, even in an elected government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, on the other hand, have mounted

their  offensive  in  order to capture  the  P.A.P.

Party  and the P.A.P. Government. Needless to  say,

we  shall  resist them to prevent  this  from  ever

happening. We advise them not to try it and not  to

provoke us into unnecessary collision. If they want

to  win and take over power in Singapore, they  may

try to do so in the next general elections. We,  on

the  other  hand,  must let  the  people  know  the

truth - plain, simple, unvarnished - so that  all  will

realise the hazardous course they will travel  with

these men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our battle with the Communists must be won by

argument and in the hearts and minds of the people.

We  will prove that the democratic socialist forces

in  Singapore are honest and sincere to the people,

and  have not sold out and will not sell out  their

rights  to anybody. It will also be shown that  the

Communists have not only been duped by the  British

but  duped  to the extent that they betrayed  their

P.A.P. comrades  in  the nationalist  Left  united

front.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say the battle for men's minds cannot be won by

simple  smearing  of  a  man  being  either

anti-Communist,   reactionary,   wavering   bourgeoisie,

Social Democrat or Communist. As I said, the battle

for  men's minds cannot be won by simple labelling.

Not   all   those  who  oppose  the   British   are

nationalists.     Some    anti-colonialists     are

nationalists and some are Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see this distinction that not all who

oppose   the  P.A.P. are  Communists;   some   are

Communists,  some reactionaries, some  opportunists

and some merely confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this battle for ideas, it is

necessary  that we should call a spade a spade  and

put  across  truthfully the respective position  of

everyone. Our purpose is to build a movement for  a

united,   independent,  democratic,   non-Communist

Malaya.  Our business is to strengthen  the  forces

that help to create this united Malaya. In the past

the  Communists  may  have for  their  own  reasons

assisted us in this task. If so, they did it in the

full  knowledge that we are non-Communist, and  not

Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are firmly convinced that the survival of the

P.A.P. depends on a strong adherence to this  line

of  non-Communism  to  prevent  perversion  of  our

Party,  either  by the British getting  the  P.A.P.

into  openly repressing the Communists, or  by  the

Communists  in  making the P.A.P. the  vehicle  of

their Communist line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the game has been played so far, beyond any

doubt  the really able and skilful player has  been

the  British.  Even we, Mr Speaker, Sir,  were  at

first  puzzled  by  this  strange  development   of

events. On the one hand, we were asked to be  tough

and  to  take firm action. On the other  hand,  the

British  lion was asking the revolutionary  Messrs.

Lim  and Woodhull & Co, to dinner and telling  them

that   all  the  detainees  can  be  let  out,   or

suggesting to them that that could be so. And  then

their  fellow-travelling friends come and  tell  us

that  they, the revolutionaries, have a first-class

pipe-line   with  the  U.K.  Commission   and   are

convinced that all that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



British  wanted in Singapore were their  bases  and

quiet,  peace  and  tranquillity,  and  even  if  a

Communist government can be popularly elected,  all

would be well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all sides the events of the last two months

have  been irrevocable ones. Such conflicts as have

appeared  between  the pro-C.P. elements  and  the

P.A.P. cannot  just be laughed off and  forgotten.

The British are still hoping that we will come into

open  collision  and  that we  will  use  draconian

methods  of suppression to establish our  position.

But  as  I  have explained, Sir, we are  completely

unmoved  by  considerations of staying  in  office,

pomp   or   power,   for   these   were   not   the

considerations that made us seek office in 1959. We

can,    therefore,   afford   to    ignore    these

blandishments  and  present  to  the  British   the

dragon's teeth that they have been sowing.  But  we

shall fight to prevent the Government and the Party

from capture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways the events of the last two months

bear  resemblance to the crisis in  the  P.A.P. in

1957.  There again the pro-Communist Left, whom  we

had  called  Left-Wing  adventurers,  miscalculated

their position and tried to capture the P.A.P. and

force  us  to follow their line. Very prudently  we

calculated  differently and abstained from  office,

thereby  saving  the P.A.P. and ourselves  a  great

deal  of unnecessary trouble. As a result, we  were

able to survive, grow to greater strength and later

succeed in the last General Elections and were able

thereby  to  rescue Mr Lim, Mr Woodhull  and  six

others from prison, before we assumed power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now again in 1961, as in 1957, it is believed that

the  P.A.P. can be captured by Communists and  used

for  Communist policies with impunity. Some of  the

lesser souls in our Party have decided to take  the

easy way out - this shortcut to peace in our time and

popularity in our time. Little do they realise that

this  short-cut can only lead to peace only  for  a

time and popularity only for a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to stay and not abdicate to

prevent  this criminal folly from being perpetrated

on the P.A.P. for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



the  second  time. I only hope these gamblers  will

not  have  to pay too high and bitter a price  when

the cards are opened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask these gentlemen of the Communist Left to

stop and ponder on the adventure they are about  to

embark on. We the P.A.P. have never betrayed  them.

Although  we  never  agreed with their  ideological

position,  yet because we were in one anti-colonial

front  and  they landed in gaol, the non-Communists

in the P.A.P. carried on, won the General Elections

in 1959, and secured their release. We were able to

do  this  only because we were wise enough  not  to

fall  into  a  trap  in  1957 when  some  Left-wing

adventurers  tried  to capture the  Party.  On  the

other  hand, the pro-Communists have been duped  by

the  British. Having wined and dined with the lion,

they are convinced that the lion will not eat them.

It   is   our  intention  that  as  long   as   the

constitutional position remains as it  is,  and  no

riots  and  no  violence take place  requiring  the

intervention   of   British  troops   and   British

generals,   the   P.A.P. will  allow   them   full

opportunities for free and open debate, leading  if

necessary  to  a  victory  for  them  in  the  next

election. It is for them to decide what course they

are to embark upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the detainees arrested by the

previous  Government  and still  in  detention,  my

colleague, the Leader of the House, will be  making

a statement. We intend to get this irrelevant issue

out  of  the  political scene by  implementing  the

memorandum  which  we  submitted  to  the  Internal

Security  Council in August 1959, for the continued

releases  in batches of all the detainees, arrested

in  two purges in 1956 and 1957 in which the P.A.P.

was involved. As a result of the turn of events, we

are  convinced  that it is in the interest  of  the

country  to get this issue out of the way, so  that

the real issue, merger, is not clouded over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On merger, let me repeat what the Party Chairman

has   said - that  we  stand  for  merger  in   1963,

independence through merger either direct with  the

Federation alone or together with the three  Borneo

States  on  the  terms that there should  be  local

autonomy  on education and labour. There have  been

no details agreed upon; there have been no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



secret  deals.  I  hope  at a  convenient  time  to

discuss  these matters with the Tunku on the  basis

for  merger.  When  the terms  and  conditions  are

formulated,  it is our intention not  only  to  get

this  House  to  support it, but to get  the  whole

country to endorse it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of reckoning is fast approaching,

partly  by British design, partly by miscalculation

and  the gullibility of people who are supposed  to

be  politically  intelligent  revolutionaries.  The

cards have been dealt out and gone out to them, and

the  game  must  come  to its  conclusion.  Let  me

explain how we are going to play this game  on  our

side.  First, we intend to win the game not  merely

for  the  immediate present but for  the  long-term

future.   We  are  concerned  not  so   much   with

immediately  remaining in office, but in  preparing

the conditions for merger and presenting the issues

to  the people so that ultimately they can make the

right choice on their future in full possession  of

all  the  facts. I stated in October 1959, in  this

House  that as long as British power is supreme  in

Singapore,  in  any  conflict  between  the   armed

Communists and the armed colonialists we  must  opt

out.  We  have only limited arms - a Police Force,  a

small  S.I.R. unit and a couple  of  riot  squads.

Violence and unrest which the Communists can  mount

on  a  scale that will require the intervention  of

British troops and the taking over of command by  a

British  general  must mean that  we  abdicate,  or

otherwise be labelled stooges of a colonial regime.

It  is therefore a matter for the Communist-Left to

decide  whether they want to get us out by bringing

about  this  situation. But since their  adversary,

the British Lion, has led them to believe that they

will be left secure and that they will be given the

freedom  of  the island, obviously some irrevocable

decisions  must already have been made by  them  on

the strength of this belief. Obviously also, nearly

three  years  of  meditation  in  prison  have  not

brought   about   that  maturity  of  revolutionary

judgment  which is, I think, required of those  who

embark on perilous schemes for the acquisition even

of limited power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange that both the British colonialists

and the Communists should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



have  come to a common conclusion, that the  P.A.P.

no  longer serves any political purpose. What  they

mean  is that the P.A.P. is no longer of any  value

from  their respective points of view for  purposes

of  manipulation, either by the British or  by  the

Communists.  Hence  the British talked  of  liberal

rights to Messrs. Lim Ching Siong, Woodhull &  Co.;

of  the British being in favour of releasing people

and encouraging the Communist Left to make more and

more demands on the P.A.P. leading to a bid to take

over the Government and the Party, knowing that  in

that  event  the  P.A.P. would have  to  fight  the

Communists for its survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat once more clearly that the

only  way to independence is through merger. We  do

not  intend to take repressive actions against  the

Communists   just   for   the   benefit   of    the

colonialists.  It  is our business  to  try,  under

conditions of absolute safety for the life and limb

of  every  political contestant to win the argument

for the political future of Singapore in the hearts

and minds of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the P.A.P. we are concerned with two

things - the interest of the people of Singapore  and

of  the Federation whom we consider to be one,  and

next  the  interest of the P.A.P. as  a  means  of

bringing about a democratic socialist society.  The

British,  having  been  unable  to  manipulate  the

P.A.P.,  naturally are prepared to see it destroyed

and  have decided with diabolical cynicism  to  use

the  Communist Party as their tool. Their objective

now  is to put the P.A.P. in a spot where it either

has  to  suppress  the C.P.,  or  be  devoured  and

captured by it peacefully by the technique of smear

and  silent  intimidation. However, I  believe  the

Party  and its stalwarts are sufficiently stout  at

heart and mind, and fortunately have foreseen  such

eventualities.  We  have  our  own  safeguards  and

defences.  The  question  of  suppression  of   all

Communists we leave to the wisdom of the Communists

as  a  matter  between them and the British.  Since

they  apparently have become good  friends  I  wish

them  well in their new fraternisation. However,  I

fear  that in due course of time both parties  will

end up in mutual humiliation and betrayal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very moment the Communists decided that

super-merger was a plot of the British  imperialist

in   conjunction   with  what   they   called   the

"feudalists" in the Federation aided and abetted by

what  they called the "wavering bourgeois"  in  the

P.A.P. in  Singapore,  they  decided  to  destroy

support for it. Their fear is that this was a  trap

to  keep  them permanently in a state  of  constant

suppression. And they have been led to believe, not

least  I  suggest by the British, that  a  colonial

Singapore  without the I.S.C. is preferable  to  an

independent  greater  Malaya or  Greater  Malaysia.

With  British blandishments they believe that under

colonialism and without the I.S.C. they  will  have

more  freedom  of action than under an  independent

united Malayan government. Sir, it is not for me to

fathom  the tortuous depths of their minds.  But  I

say  that those who believe in the proposition that

more  freedom  is available for the advancement  of

the  Communist  cause by having  a  colonial

self-governing  Singapore  than by having  Singapore  as

part  of Greater Malaysia or of the Federation  are

men  whose  political maturity is very much  to  be

doubted, and whose claim to be revolutionary heroes

will  be disproved and discarded by the harsh  test

of  time. Good revolutionaries are not men who fall

into  traps  set by their enemies and  get  excited

when   they  see  British  Governors  arriving   in

Singapore  to discuss super-merger, and the  United

Kingdom  Commissioner leaving Singapore for  London

to discuss matters with the Imperial Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the democratic socialists with less dogma

and  theoretical blinkers were better able  to  see

through  this maze of events and were less agitated

and jumpy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young socialists in the University of Malaya

thought  super-merger a trap. I think in  the  next

few months it is likely to be proved that they,  in

fact, had fallen into a trap, a British trap to get

them  to oppose both super-merger and merger.  From

this  trap  they  will  find  great  difficulty  in

extricating themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is so much to tell on so many things that I

think  it  is  better that we take things  step  by

step. The drama of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



the  last few weeks which has led to this new phase

in  the political life of Singapore will move  with

increasing  rapidity to a crescendo. As it  unfolds

itself,  the  people  of  Singapore  and   of   the

Federation  will see the under-current  forces  for

themselves and they will have to decide  what  they

wish  to  make  of their country, their  homes  and

their lives. Our duty is to preserve the P.A.P. in

the  midst  of zig-zagging policies and opportunist

manoeuvring  by  the  Right as  well  as  from  the

Communist Left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the beacon which lights up the road to an

independent  democratic  non-Communist  Malaya   in

which the races will live in peace and harmony with

each  other  and build out of our multi-racial  and

multi-linguistic  peoples one Malayan  people,  one

common  destiny  for us all in  this  part  of  the

world.  Perhaps  at  some future  date  the  Borneo

territories may find themselves drawn towards us by

the  very  logistics of the political situation  in

South-East Asia. These events may take place faster

than have been envisaged a year ago. It is our duty

as a political party to hasten tendencies which are

to the benefit of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion

standing in my name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker, the Prime Minister has very aptly outlined

to  the  House the course of political developments

in  Singapore. I have little more to add to what he

has  said  excepting to bring out and to  reiterate

the   stand  of  the  P.A.P.  Government  over  the

detention  of  those  who  were  arrested  by   the

previous Government in two purges, in October  1956

and  August  1957.  I  would like  to  restate  our

position  so that it will be clear in the minds  of

the  people,  in  the minds of even the  detainees,

that  the  P.A.P. was sincere in working for  their

release in the Internal Security Council.



On 22nd May, 1959, during the election campaign,  I

stated that the P.A.P. would not take office unless

former  members  of the Party who  were  intimately

connected with the Central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



Executive  Committee and who are now  in  gaol  are

released.  This  pledge  we have  fulfilled.  Eight

P.A.P. members, all those intimately connected with

the  leadership of the Party, were released at  our

insistence on 4th June before we assumed office  on

5th  June. These eight persons were released before

the   Internal  Security  Council   was   set   up.

Subsequently, orders for the release of  the  other

detainees  were  made  in batches,  but  after  two

batches   were  released,  the  Internal   Security

Council  challenged  the policy  of  indiscriminate

release. As a result, a memorandum recommending the

release  of  these detainees was submitted  by  the

Singapore  Government  to  the  Internal   Security

Council  dated 12th August, 1959, two months  after

the P.A.P. had assumed power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote the relevant extract from this paper

defining  the  Singapore Government's  policy  with

regard to the present detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As early as October 1956, the P.A.P. saw clearly

that it would be necessary, if and when it won  the

elections,  to  release those  detainees  who  were

closely  associated  with  the  Party.  This  is  a

question highly charged with emotion. Whether these

men  were Communists or not is irrelevant  when  it

comes  to  justifying the position  of  the  P.A.P.

Government in the eyes of the people, and the smear

to  which the P.A.P. Government would be opened, if

these men remained in jail and the P.A.P. in power,

is one which cannot be lightly dismissed.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Am I right in assuming that

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  is  quoting  from   a

document?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If he is quoting from a document,

then  it is right that that document itself  should

be  laid on the Table. If the Deputy Prime Minister

undertakes to do that, it can be done later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is my intention

to  lay this document on the Table at the end of my

speech,  and  I  am  quoting  extracts  from   this

document. If you so wish, I could lay the  document

on  the Table now, but I would rather do it at  the

end of my speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For the charge would be, not that these men were

Communists,  but that these men were  known  P.A.P.

supporters who have been betrayed and abandoned  by

the Party...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the P.A.P. Government point of view, it

stands  more  to  gain  than lose  by  the  gradual

release  of the 40 odd detainees a few  at  a  time

over  the  course of the next two to three  months,

and the five leaders who are on its side would have

discharged   their  moral  obligations   to   their

colleagues and comrades under detention...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there should be exceptional cases where

no  release  will  be made in  view  of  the  grave

security  risk  of the individual concerned.  Other

than  such cases, in the eyes of the neutral public

the  P.A.P. Government would have discharged itself

honourably from all moral obligations by  releasing

those  detained in the two purges in October.  1956

and  August,  1957. These were the  two  purges  in

which  the P.A.P. was involved. In the other  cases

where suspects were picked up and unconnected  with

the   P.A.P.,   the  present  Government   has   no

obligation  to  them  whatsoever,  and  the  public

(other than Communist sympathisers) does not expect

the Government to do anything about them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were altogether 61 persons detained on 2nd

June, 1959. From the day the P.A.P. assumed office

on  3rd  June, 1959, to date, 35 persons have  been

released.  Of  those  who  were  detained  by   the

previous  Government in the two purges of 1956  and

1957,  there  are now only 18 persons  still  under

detention. It is vital that the continued detention

of  these  18  detainees should not be  allowed  to

obscure  the main issue in the minds of the people,

and    that    is   the   political    future    of

Singapore - whether  we  are to  attain  independence

through  merger with the Federation in 1963  either

with or without the Borneo territories, or whether,

as  has  been  suggested by Mr Lim  Ching  Siong's

group,  the next step should not be merger  but  an

internally  self-governing  Singapore  without  the

Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to lay on the Table the Singapore

Government's Paper to the Internal Security Council

dated 12th August, 1959, for the information of the

House.  I  would  like to make it  known  that  the

Singapore  Government  has  written  to  the   U.K.

Commissioner  about our intention to  release  this

memorandum  by  the  Singapore  Government  to  the

Internal  Security Council and has asked  the  U.K.

Commissioner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



to  inform  the Federation Government. I understand

that the U.K. Commissioner has registered a protest

against publication of this paper. However, in  the

light  of  recent  developments  which  have   been

outlined  by  the Prime Minister to the  House,  to

remove  all  doubts  and any vestige  of  suspicion

about  the  sincerity of the P.A.P.  Government  in

wanting  to  release these detainees,  we  have  no

alternative hut feel compelled that the whole truth

should be made known to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the question of merger so

outweighs  all  other considerations  that  we  are

anxious that this side issue of continued detention

of the detainees should be immediately resolved and

not  be  allowed to be used as an argument  against

merger.  Notwithstanding the stand of  the  British

Government  in the Internal Security  Council,  the

Singapore  Government  will issue  orders  for  the

release  of the detainees in batches from  time  to

time  in  accordance with the original proposal  of

the  Singapore Government to the Internal  Security

Council. In doing so, I would like to clarify  that

it is not the desire of the Singapore Government to

precipitate  any  conflict  or  crisis   with   the

Federation Government with whom it has always  been

our  policy  to  maintain  amicable  and  brotherly

relationship in the interest of the people of  both

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of memorandum dated 12th August, 1959,

recommending  release of detainees  submitted  by

Singapore Government to Internal Security Council

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Deputy Prime

Minister  has  no objection to these  copies  being

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I notice that the Paper itself is

marked  "Secret. This Paper is the property of  the

Internal  Security Council". I  take  it  that  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister has  satisfied  himself  on

legal advice that the release of this Paper is  not

unconstitutional?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the original of the

document  was  a Paper submitted by  the  Singapore

Government  itself. It is not a document  submitted

by  another party to the Internal Security Council,

which  it  would  be  improper  for  the  Singapore

Government  to release. This is a document  stating

the  Singapore Government's position and we  could,

if we had so wished, make it public at that time.



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  with a deep sense of regret and a great deal of

sadness that I rise to speak on the motion standing

in  the name of the Prime Minister - regret that  the

Prime  Minister should have chosen to move a motion

of  confidence  in  the Government  at  such  short

notice  and  without  prior consultation  with  the

Government Assemblymen and the Party rank and file;

and  sad  that the political movement  led  by  the

People's  Action Party is in such a critical  state

that  the  collective leadership deems it necessary

to force the issue in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in a parliamentary democracy in

which  the  Government has a majority of  39  seats

against  12 in the Opposition, a vote of confidence

in  the Government by the Prime Minister must  mean

only  one  of two things. Either the Government  is

seeking  unanimous support from both sides  of  the

House  on an issue of national importance and above

party  politics, or there is dissension within  the

ranks of the Government majority. As we have as yet

no  occasion to debate any issue that is considered

of  national importance and above party politics in

this  Assembly,  the  second  possibility  must  be

viewed with seriousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore crave your

indulgence  to hear me speak on matters  which  you

might  consider highly politic. With 39 Assemblymen

on  the Government Benches in a House of 51 seats - I

beg  your  pardon,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  52  seats - I

consider   it  inappropriate  that  a   motion   of

confidence  should  have  been  brought  into  this

House. If it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



merely  to  find  out how Government  Members  will

vote,  surely  the Whip will be the person  in  the

best position to advise the Prime Minister, and the

motion therefore becomes meaningless. I cannot  and

will not believe that the Prime Minister is seeking

support  from  the  Opposition  Benches.   In   the

circumstances, the intention and the implication of

the  motion becomes quite clear, particularly  with

the  publication of the exchange of letters between

the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on

the  subject  of  the  Prime  Ministership  of  the

Government  in  yesterday's newspapers.  The  Prime

Minister concluded his letter by saying - I quote the

Straits Times of yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am quite prepared to assume leadership of the

government  on behalf of the party provided  it  is

the  clear wish of the party executive and  of  the

Assemblymen  who  will  have  to  follow  us   into

battle.'



<br><br>The Deputy Prime Minister's reply was endorsed only

by   the   remaining  13  members  of  the  Central

Executive   Committee.   This   motion   makes   it

inescapable  for Government Members to endorse  the

Deputy Prime Minister's reply in the open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some of us on this side of the

House  take exception to such methods and  also  to

certain  statements and implications  contained  in

the  Prime  Minister's letter. Many of us  on  this

side   of  the  House  are  here  not  for  selfish

objectives or for ulterior motives. We  are  not  a

loose  and  feudalistic  conglomeration  of  people

seeking selfish and opportunistic ends. We are here

because  we  believe  in a political  system  which

seeks  to eliminate the exploitation of man by  man

and the building of a more egalitarian society.  We

all came into this House bearing our sacrifices and

with  only one single motive - to serve and  to  help

our fellowmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of us feel that it is impossible for us

to unconditionally associate ourselves with some of

the  sentiments  expressed in the Prime  Minister's

letter to the Deputy Prime Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



the  17th of July. We feel, therefore, that  it  is

equally impossible for us to give our unconditional

support to the Prime Minister if he is to pursue  a

policy with which we cannot fully agree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no hesitation in stating my belief

that  the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues

are the most able persons in this Assembly - nay,  in

the  whole  of  Singapore - to lead  us  towards  our

political  objectives. I would  have  been  equally

unhesitating in giving them my full confidence  had

political  events not taken a sudden  turn  in  the

last few months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before the House itself is distasteful

to  me  and  to  many  of my comrades,  because  we

consider  it  to be nothing but party politics  and

should not concern the Legislative Assembly.  Party

politics  and differences of opinion between  Party

Assemblymen and Party members should be and must be

thrashed  out  at  party  level.  Where  there   is

dissension  within the Party, surely the  cause  of

such discord should be democratically debated to  a

mutually  satisfactory conclusion within the  Party

which  accepts democracy and socialism as its  main

pillars  and  its main political basic beliefs.  To

bring party politics into the Assembly means not  a

loss  of  confidence of the Party  Assemblymen  and

Party  members  in the collective  leadership  but,

Sir,  on  the  contrary,  it  means  the  loss   of

confidence of the collective leadership in some  of

the Assemblymen who represent the majority view  in

the  Party. Can we, the second rung leaders of  the

People's  Action  Party, vote for this  motion  and

associate  ourselves with the collective leadership

to  indicate the loss of confidence in our comrades

in the rank and file who have worked tirelessly and

with  complete  disregard for  their  own  personal

safety  and interests to put us into this Assembly?

In   the   Enright  affair,  the  Party  collective

leadership enunciated the policy, and rightly  too,

but   with   uncalled  for  arrogance,  that   only

Singapore  citizens  may participate  in  Singapore

politics. May I, Mr Speaker, Sir, also plead  with

humility and with sincerity that only Party members

be allowed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



participate  in  party  politics?  To  invite   the

Opposition  to  participate in party  politics,  as

this   motion   has   obviously   called   for   by

implication,  would be tantamount  to  surrendering

the  rights  and  privileges of  Party  members  to

Members  of the Opposition without apportioning  to

them  the duties, the responsibilities and the hard

work  that  is  expected  of  every  single  P.A.P.

member.  It breaks my heart, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  to

say  such blunt things to the collective leadership

and  in  particular to the Prime Minister  and  the

Deputy Prime Minister who have both been my mentors

and  political tutors and whom I regard  with  deep

respect  and affection. Political convictions  must

come  before  personalities and before  sentiments,

and  I  am left with no alternative but to  let  my

head rule my heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as this motion before the House

is  intimately  associated  with  the  exchange  of

letters  between the Prime Minister and the  Deputy

Prime Minister published in yesterday's newspapers,

I  feel  obliged to make two comments on the  Prime

Minister's letter. I am deeply disturbed, Sir, that

the  Prime Minister should deem it fit to  put  the

cap  of  the  Communist Left on the  heads  of  all

socialists  who  disagree with  him.  I  also  feel

gravely  concerned, Sir, that he should imply  that

all  those  who have expressed doubts or  harboured

suspicion  about the Tunku's grand design  are  the

Communist  Left  or  are  Communist  stooges.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I state here categorically  in  this

House   that  I  stand  for  the  merger  and   the

unification  of  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  It  is  by a cruel and deliberate  act  of

colonialism  that  we  stand  isolated   from   our

hinterland,  very  much  as  a  new-born  babe   is

snatched away from its mother overflowing with  the

milk  of human kindness. We all believe that merger

as   a   historical   event   is   inevitable   and

inescapable. And in all our Party statements before

the  elections  we  stated in the most  categorical

terms that merger is the long-term objective of the

Party. We explained in a great deal of detail that

the Alliance Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



anti-merger because of the one million  Chinese  in

Singapore  and  because of the  Leftist  danger  or

menace in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two years of government the P.A.P. has not

changed any of these two facts. Suddenly the  Tunku

with  colonial connivance calls for a super merger.

Surely,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot be reprimanded

for  harbouring doubts and suspicion.  Being  loyal

members  of  the People's Action Party and  members

with  full confidence in the collective leadership,

we   ask   for   clarification  and  we   ask   for

information. Instead of discussing the  issue  with

us  at  a  Party meeting under expert guidance  and

under wise leadership, we have been dubbed as

anti-merger,  and  a sudden demand for an open  vote  of

confidence in the Government is made on us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand and we appreciate that merger

is  not  palatable  to the Tunku and  his  Alliance

Government and that we are in no position  to  make

uncompromising  demands on the Federation.  But  we

feel strongly that in a negotiation of such import,

the   collective  leadership  must  have  the  full

mandate of the Party and the people before  it  can

proceed.  As socialists and Party members loyal  to

Party  objectives, we must know the  minimum  terms

and  conditions  and  the compromisable  terms  and

conditions before we can give our mandate.  Had  we

not accepted the Party analysis as laid down in the

Fourth  Anniversary Celebration Souvenir as to  why

the  Alliance in the Federation is anti-merger,  we

would  not  need  to  know  the  minimum  and   the

compromisable conditions before we gave our mandate

to  the collective leadership. The sudden change of

heart  by  the  Tunku in offering us  super  merger

knocked  the  ground off our feet. We are  grateful

for  his  graciousness, for his  charity,  for  his

magnanimity, but we have a right to know  from  our

own  leaders under what terms this merger or  super

merger  is to be brought about. Even if our minimum

terms  and  conditions could not be  fulfilled,  we

would have the satisfaction of knowing that we have

been   associated  in  fighting  for  our  glorious

political goal. But nothing about the super  merger

is told to us. Instead we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



asked to give blanket approval - which under ordinary

circumstances  I  have  no  hesitation  at  all  to

give - and a vote of confidence to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, Sir, I plead

with the Prime Minister to withdraw this motion.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

you have heard the sad and the rather pathetic call

of  the  Prime Minister, "That this House expresses

its confidence in the Government." Sad and pathetic

because  it comes from a Government that still  has

39  seats  in  the  Assembly and  is  faced  by  an

Opposition of only 12, as has been ably put by  the

Member  for Nee Soon. Thirty-nine against  12,  and

the  Government has asked the House  to  express  a

vote of confidence in the Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I heard the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Health referred to as

the  Member for Nee Soon. I take it he is still the

Parliamentary Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, I

meant  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister asks for a clear mandate from

the Assembly. I say to him: the Prime Minister does

not require such a clear mandate from the Assembly.

He  requires  it from the Party and  not  from  the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> From the country!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why is it so? What has

happened in the short period of two years that  has

led  a  strong, stable Government to adopt  such  a

move?  It  seems  like  yesterday  that  we  saw  a

popularly   elected   Government   that   had   the

overwhelming  support of the people  marching  into

the  Assembly with the acclaim and good  wishes  of

all  Singapore. We were known as the best organised

and  best  disciplined Party in Singapore politics.

It  has  also  been  said  that  we  are  the  most

promising  political party in the whole  of

South-East Asia. The leadership had taken great pride  in

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 43 Members on the Government side at that time

presented so formidable and so invincible  a  front

that it looked as if nothing in the political arena

in  Singapore could ever dent it. The voice of  the

Opposition could hardly be heard in the thunder  of

the  Government  benchers. Even  today,  would  the

Opposition  have  dared to  move  a  motion  of  no

confidence  when  they  do  not  even  have  enough

Members to occupy their front benches, and when the

Government  side has hardly sufficient elbow  room?

Yet  the irony of the situation is this. It is  not

the  Opposition  that  is moving  a  motion  of  no

confidence.  The  Government  still  has  a   clear

majority  of 39 seats against 12 - more  than  three

times  the  number on the Opposition  Benches.  And

they  have  come to the House today  grovelling  on

bended  knees,  as it were, to ask for  a  vote  of

confidence  in the Government. It is  fantastic!  A

unique situation! Nowhere in any part of the  world

that  practises parliamentary democracy do we  find

such a comic spectacle - a Government commanding  an

absolute and overwhelming majority of 3� times  the

number of seats in the Opposition asking for a vote

of confidence. A vote of confidence!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For what? So that it may carry

out  its  inglorious design for the destruction  of

(1)  intra-party opposition to the leadership,  and

(2) other Left-wing forces feared by the leadership

that regards such forces as a serious challenge  to

their  present  hold on the party  leadership.  The

general public has now focused its attention on the

intra-party struggle. Well, what is wrong with  the

Party?  One  thing: it is the lack  of  intra-party

democracy. Yes, it is the very lack of democracy we

hear so much about in this House. This very lack of

intra-party democracy that has brought about such a

ludicrously  chaotic situation  in  the  Government

today. It sounds almost like a dream. Democracy - one

of  the  chief tenets of the P.A.P. Democracy  that

has   been  twisted  out  of  shape  and   out   of

recognition by the leadership of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. Democracy, the meaning of which has been

twisted  by the P.A.P. leadership to mean something

entirely  different,  to mean non-discussion,

non-consultation;  to  mean, "When I order  you,  obey.

What  I  say,  you follow. What I say is  true  and

right. What you say is false and wrong."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this

stage,  I  crave  your indulgence if  I  appear  to

digress  a little. I propose to give the House  the

background  that  has led to this  motion.  In  the

P.A.P. democracy is the special  property  of  the

very  few, the heavenly-born, specially endowed,  a

coterie  of  very special and privileged people - the

P.A.P. leadership. The majority in the P.A.P.,  the

rank  and  file,  the true workers in  the  P.A.P.,

those  who do all the ground work, who move,  work,

live  and  eat among the masses; feeling the  pulse

and temper of the masses - they have never known the

true meaning of intra-party democracy. Do they take

part  in  intra-party  discussion  and  intra-party

consultation  when major policies are  decided  on?

When   decisions   are  taken  which   affect   the

livelihood  and destiny of the people of Singapore?

Are  they  ever consulted? No, Sir, they are  never

consulted. And the Party set-up is such that  there

is  nothing  they can do about it - hardly  anything.

The  Party leadership does not regard the rank  and

file as men and women with brains and intelligence.

Such  brains and intelligence the P.A.P. leadership

believes  to  be  the  special prerogative  of  the

leadership and is only found in the leadership. Any

criticism  is  smacked down as  unconstructive.  Is

criticism   unconstructive  when   one   asks   the

leadership  not  to  be  arrogant  to  the  people?

Indeed,  the  rank and file, all the  rest  of  the

party  are merely tools fit to be pushed around  by

the  leadership  for the glory of  the  leadership.

Their's  not to reason why. Their's but to  do  and

die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret I have to bore the

House  with all these unsavory facts. But some  may

ask,  "What of the cadres in the Party? Don't  they

help to formulate Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



policy?"  Theoretically  they  do.  But  in  actual

practice - no.  The  cadres elect  the  C.E.C. in  a

cadres   conference.  The  C.E.C. in  turn  select

provisional  cadres  and  later  confirm  them   as

cadres.  A  case of you scratching my  back  and  I

scratching yours, Mr Speaker. It is also,  Sir,  a

case  of  the leadership appointing the cadres  and

the  cadres  appointing  the  leadership.  And  who

select the cadres? How-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

all  these details have any relevance to the motion

before   us.  I  do  not  think  the  Assembly   is

interested  in how the leadership is  appointed  by

the Party itself. We want to know whether the House

has confidence in the Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg your indulgence, Mr

Speaker.  All  these  form the  background  of  the

motion  that  has been put before the House  today.

Unless  you have a clear picture of the background,

Mr  Speaker, you may not fully understand what has

happened  and  why  this motion  has  been  brought

forward  today. I ask, "Who select the cadres?  And

how  do the members qualify to become cadres?"  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, your guess is as good as  mine.  The

people will be shocked and surprised to learn  that

all  this  selection of cadres is  done  by  a  few

persons,  and  if  your  views  are  known  to   be

different from the views of the leaders, well,  you

can whistle for your cadreship.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must stop the hon.

Member. He is going into too many details which  do

not  really interest this Assembly as an  Assembly.

It might be interesting in some other forum. But in

this  Assembly,  I do not think he should  go  into

these details. I think the hon. Member has made his

point. He has alleged that there has been no, as he

calls  it,  intra-party democracy. I think  he  has

made  that  point  and  further  details  will   be

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, I just crave your

indulgence, and I hope you will allow me to present

the  facts  in an orderly manner so that everybody,

not only everybody in this Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



but  all  the  people  in Singapore  who  are  most

interested in this debate, will know the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31st May, 1959, - this is just a little bit

more. Mr Speaker - there were 500 cadres. After what

is  known  as  the  Ong Eng Guan incident  all  the

original cadres were eliminated and new cadres were

formed.  Until  a few months ago in  a  Party  that

boasts  of a membership of five figures there  were

only 70 cadres-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I will have to stop

the hon. Member if he does not bow to the ruling of

the  Chair.  Perhaps he can go on  to  a  different

aspect of his speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bow to your decision, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  Anyway, you can see how  every  new

situation inside the Party has given birth to a new

set  of  cadres.  Nobody really knows  outside  the

P.A.P. leadership  who the cadres  are.  It  is  a

closely guarded secret, because disclosure of  this

cadres  list  will bring in a lot  of  embarrassing

questions  which cannot be answered satisfactorily.

As far as I know, Mr Speaker, a good number of old

party  faithfuls have not been confirmed as  cadres

because they are known to hold views different from

those  of the leadership. And these are the  people

who  have sacrificed so much to help the P.A.P. to

power.  Their  only sin seems to be that  they  are

people  of  conviction, not so easily malleable  to

the   whims  and  fancies  of  the  leadership  and

unwilling to be sycophants. I ask you, Mr Speaker,

is  this democracy? Is this democracy? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  from what I have just said, it is clear  that

there  is  no  such thing as democracy  inside  the

P.A.P.  It  is  this lack of intra-party  democracy

that has brought the P.A.P. to its present state of

instability and caused a so-called crisis in  spite

of  the  Government majority in the  Assembly.  The

leadership has made a complete mockery of democracy

inside the Party. There is complete dissatisfaction

and  frustration amongst the rank and  file.  Party

members have lost confidence in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



the  present  Party leadership.  The  leaders  have

their  noses in the clouds and their feet  off  the

ground,  and  already stand utterly discredited  in

the eyes of the majority in the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such then, Sir, is the reason why we have the

motion  of confidence tabled by the Hon. the  Prime

Minister before the House today. It is not the lack

in  numbers amongst the Government benches that  is

causing this anxiety, uncertainty, instability  and

lack of confidence. It is the Party leadership that

is  denied  this confidence. That, Mr Speaker,  is

the  secret of the motion. That is why we have this

absurd  comic opera of a Government with  39  seats

out of 51 asking for a vote of confidence. Sir, you

saw the strength of the P.A.P. giant two years ago.

Today,  you see the weakness in this strength.  The

weak link, the chink in the armour, is this lack of

intra-party democracy. It is really ridiculous that

an intra-party struggle between two factions should

have  been brought into: this Assembly.  It  is  an

intra-party struggle between the leadership and the

rank  and  file. From a purely intra-party struggle

the P.A.P. leadership has, by various twists, turns

and  somersaults, magnified it into a  much  bigger

issue. It has become a special crisis that has been

brought  before the House. Of course, this is  done

with  a very special object in view. They now stage

this  comic opera, this super comic opera, I think,

in  order  that  they  may  bring  the  intra-party

struggle  into  the Assembly so as to  confuse  the

people.  It is really tragic and pathetic that  our

leadership have so lost their grip on the Party and

on  the  affairs of the State that  they  have  now

become  totally bankrupt of political  ideas.  When

politicians  have  to  resort  to  smearing   their

opponents in the hope of salvaging their own

fast-sinking  prestige,  then surely  it  is  time  they

stepped  down from the political stage and  took  a

long,  long holiday. Such smears are not  something

new. The Lim Yew Hock Government-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Thank you!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - used these same tactics

against the P.A.P. There were the same bogeymen  of

the extremist and the Communist. Now we have it all

over  again. We have anticipated such smear tactics

as  was  said in our letter to the Chairman of  the

P.A.P.  It  has become fashionable for the  present

P.A.P. leadership to smear all who  disagree  with

them as stooges, or as being under the influence of

this  person  or  that person. More  recently,  the

smear  has  taken the extremely dangerous  turn  of

labelling   all  who  disagree  with   the   P.A.P.

leadership  as non-Malayan, communal or  even

pro-Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace the smear campaign through the

history  of  the  P.A.P. When the Party  was  first

formed in 1954 all those in the P.A.P. were staunch

anti-colonialists. In 1957, the P.A.P. was  divided

into  two  groups - the non-Communists and  the

pro-Communists.   In  1959,  there  were   the   social

democrats   against   the  Left-wing   adventurers,

fireside  revolutionaries and extremists.  Now,  in

1961,  only  a  few weeks back, it is the  national

Left  against the non-national Left and parish-pump

patriots.  Today,  it  is  the  non-Communist  Left

against  the Communist Left; and right now,  today,

in  this Assembly hall, it is the P.A.P. leadership

against  the duped, the confused and the  gullible.

It  is highly interesting and revealing to a lot of

people  in  Singapore. But finally let us  ask  the

P.A.P. leadership: what is Left and who is Left? Is

it  the P.A.P. leadership which is Left, or  is  it

Lee Kuan Yew who is Left? There is a lot of talk of

merger and anti-merger. Who is anti-merger? We  are

all  for  merger. But the confederation  is  surely

something new and different. Is it wrong to ask for

details  before we give our support? Why  must  our

leadership give full and unqualified support to the

confederation  scheme before  even  consulting  the

Party?  Is this not clear evidence of the  lack  of

consultation  and  lack  of intra-party  democracy?

Cannot  the leadership see that it is this lack  of

intra-party    democracy    that     has     caused

disillusionment, frustration and non-confidence  in

the leadership, and hence this motion today? It  is

really farcical, Sir, that some politicians have so

degenerated that they have to concoct stories to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



frighten the people. In so doing, they hope to  win

their support. Politicians with the experience, the

calibre   and  undoubted  ability  of  the   P.A.P.

leadership  should be the last to  resort  to  such

means  of  finding support for their fast tottering

empire.  With  all  the years of experience  behind

them, surely they know that the only firm support a

politician gets is the solid support of the people.

You  do not get the solid support of the people  by

frightening them with ghosts, spectres and  bogeys.

You  get their solid support only by genuinely  and

constantly  looking after their  interests  and  by

giving  expression to their needs and  aspirations.

Inside  the Party you can achieve unity only  by  a

genuine   and   constant  practice  of  intra-party

democracy. In our case today, that can be  done  by

the  calling of a 51 Branch Executives and  Central

Executives  meeting to discuss Party  policies  and

decisions.  Let the P.A.P. leadership  prove  their

genuine  love  of democracy which they  pretend  to

defend  by  calling  this  51-branch  meeting   and

accepting  the decision of this 51-branch  meeting.

Instead  of  trying to find support and  confidence

inside  the Party, the leadership have now come  to

the  Assembly  to beg for this same support.  Whose

support do they expect to get? The support  of  the

pro-colonialists? The support of  the  Members  for

Tanglin, Cairnhill, Mountbatten, Farrer Park?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me emphasise once again that this

confidence vote should be sought not in this  House

but  inside the Party. The Government is not  short

of  Assemblymen to form a majority in the Assembly.

The P.A.P. leadership do not need the confidence of

the Assembly, but they need, and need it very badly

too, the confidence of the Party which alas they do

not command. A confidence vote in the Assembly will

not  make  the P.A.P. any the stronger. The  P.A.P.

can  only  be  strong  if the leadership  have  the

confidence of the rank and file and if they  pursue

a  correct  policy. The motion therefore should  be

withdrawn. The confidence vote should be sought  in

the  51-branch meeting inside the Party. The P.A.P.

leadership have hoped to bamboozle and confuse  the

people  with  red  herrings. The  motion  today  is

merely a subterfuge to diddle support for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. leadership from outside forces. I ask  these

men  of  ability, intelligence and guts not to  run

away  from their own Party, but to go back and face

their  own  comrades.  This  attempt  to  use   the

Government to solve an intra-party crisis will  not

help  matters. The few leaders who do not have  the

support  of  the majority in the Party are  holding

on, monopolising and almost appropriating the Party

apparatus as their own private possession.  If  the

P.A.P. leadership want a confidence vote, let  them

seek  it at the 51 branch meeting inside the Party.

The motion has no place in this Assembly. It should

be withdrawn.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, we have been reminded by the Hon. the

Prime Minister that this session was adjourned sine

die on the 14th of June, a procedure which normally

immediately precedes the prorogation of a  session.

But  for  some  curious  reason  now  manifest,  no

prorogation was ordered. Did they have in  mind  by

any  chance, Mr Speaker, the possibility  of  this

emergency  session? We do not know,  however,  that

under  the  provisions  of Standing  Order  5,  the

Leader  of  the  House has sought  to  convene  and

obtain  your  consent  for the  convening  of  this

emergency sitting in the public interest. Sir,  the

provisions  of  Standing Order 5 are  intended  for

moments of national emergency-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Member for

Anson   wishes  to  question  a  decision  of   the

Speaker - and  this was a decision of the Speaker - his

remedy  lies in Standing Order 53 which  says  that

the  decision on any point of order - and this  is  a

point  of  order - "shall not be open to  appeal  and

shall not be reviewed by the Assembly except upon a

substantive motion moved for that purpose." And the

hon. Member can give two clear days' notice of that

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am sorry that so early I was misunderstood.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  no  intention   to

criticize  or  question in any shape or  form  your

convening of this Assembly. I am seeking to clarify

that this is deemed to be an emergency period for a

special question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



public interest. Now, what, Sir, is this emergency?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Hon. the Prime Minister and we

have  listened with incredulity, no  doubt  on  the

part  of  some  of his colleagues, to  a  colourful

children's   fairy  tale  of  British   lions   and

Communist  bears. But it does transpire, Sir,  that

the  essence of this emergency is that the Hon. the

Prime  Minister  desires to continue  to  hold  the

office of Prime Minister, and his colleagues desire

to continue sitting in their padded scarlet leather

arm-chairs. If I might borrow an adjective  of  the

hon.  Member who spoke last, I would indeed  agree,

Sir,  that  this  is a pathetic  motion.  Does  the

Government really seek from this Assembly a vote of

confidence? Is that its purpose? The Hon. the Prime

Minister has informed you, Sir, that he seeks  from

this  House a mandate to govern. He has sought this

from  the people of Singapore in Hong Lim  and  in

Anson,  and he has been rejected. How does he  seek

from  this  Assembly  at this stage  a  mandate  to

govern?  I hope to show you, Mr Speaker, that,  in

fact,  that  is not the purpose of this motion.  In

fact,  they  have put a vote of confidence  to  the

people  of  Singapore and that vote  of  confidence

they  have lost; and nothing they can do here, with

a  majority obtained two years ago when the  people

had  faith in the P.A.P. leadership, can obliterate

the  mass  of  evidence of disillusionment  of  the

people  of  Singapore with the  leadership  of  the

ruling  Party, which is the Government  today.  You

must be aware, Mr Speaker, it is your duty to take

cognizance of the fact, that three months ago there

was  a  by-election in Hong Lim and that the ruling

Party,  should you read the newspapers, Sir, fought

that  by-election  with  all  the  forces  at   its

command.  In fact, two days before the end  of  the

gruelling  seven  weeks,  the  Prime  Minister   is

reported  to have informed the voters of  Hong  Lim

that  the P.A.P. would treat the by-election  as  a

vote of confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read, Sir, an excerpt of a report of a speech

alleged to have been made by the Prime Minister and

printed in the Straits Times of the 28th of  April,

the day before Polling Day. Despite-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Anson is

not  quite  a  new "boy" in this Assembly.  I  have

ruled  that  if  extracts are to  be  read  from  a

newspaper,   that   newspaper  itself   should   be

produced. I have no doubt the hon. Member  will  be

able  to produce the newspaper in time. Not only  a

cutting, but the whole paper should be produced.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not aware of

that  ruling and I certainly apologise for bringing

cuttings  only.  But  I undertake,  Sir,  within  a

reasonable time to make available to this House the

complete paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I might be permitted, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Despite what the pundits and experts had said

about  the  Hong  Lim by-election, the  P.A.P. had

deliberately chosen to underline the importance  of

Hong Lim.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of the speech of the Hon. the Prime

Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. could well have chosen not to, having

40  seats in the Assembly and therefore was  in  an

impregnable position constitutionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as he and his colleagues saw the problem, the

P.A.P. was in power at the collective behest of the

people [not the Assembly]'-



<br><br>"Collective behest of the people" - quite right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... who voted for it on the basis of a clear-cut

programme setting out its intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party would continue to govern only if it was

in the interest of the people and was even prepared

to govern against its own interest if it was in the

interest of the people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are aware, Sir, of the massive defeat which

the  P.A.P. suffered in Hong  Lim.  That  vote  of

confidence  was unquestionably lost. I  know,  Sir,

you  have  this afternoon heard the  story  of  the

British  lion  and the Communist bear,  this  fairy

tale  for  the  consumption of little  children  to

prove  to  them that the defeats in  Hong  Lim  and

Anson  did not indicate the disenchantment  of  the

people of Singapore with the P.A.P. leadership. Oh,

no, it came about by the Machiavellian machinations

of  the British lion who sought - the richest of  all

fairy  tales - to encourage the Communists to form  a

government. It has not been said, Sir, but  I  will

be  interested to know from later speakers, whether

the  Member for Hong Lim and myself are deemed  now

to be the standard-bearers of the Communist Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are conscious, Sir, that immediately after the

massive  defeat in Hong Lim - and you  have  been  so

informed  quite frankly by the Prime Minister  that

it  was  considered a grave defeat - serious  thought

was  given to the resignation of the Party.  I  may

well be misinformed, but my information is that the

Party  considered the defeat was the defeat of  the

Prime  Minister alone, not of the Party,  and  they

decided  to continue. The Prime Minister  issued  a

statement  that  the  Party  would  reconsider  the

position after the Anson by-election. Sir,  let  me

make  this clear. In the Anson by-election, Merdeka

was the issue, not the slogan, Sir, but the concept

of  independence for the people of  Singapore.  The

continuance of the Prime Minister as Prime Minister

was  an  issue,  but  I never sought  to  make  the

continuance of the Government an issue.  The  Prime

Minister  would  not  have it  so,  and  he  sought

consistently   and  repeatedly - and   so   did   the

P.A.P. - to  make it known to the people of Singapore

that  they would treat the vote in Anson as a  vote

of confidence. May I, Sir, with your permission, in

respect  of  this challenge of the  P.A.P. to  the

people  of  Singapore, read only some  very  recent

statements  made by them? You were  referred  to  a

forum organised by the University Socialist Club. I

was  one of those who were invited to speak. I must

confess, Sir, that I was not conscious that it  was

Lord  Selkirk  who  had  persuaded  the  University

Socialist  Club to hold that meeting  in  order  to

bring  about  the  downfall of  the  P.A.P. and  a

government  of the Communists. I am very interested

to  learn  that.  But what is interesting  to  this

House,  I trust, Sir, is that this stalwart of  the

P.A.P. to  whom  the  Prime Minister  has  already

referred,  a  man by the name of C. V. Devan  Nair,

stated  at  this  forum, "P.A.P. will  not  stay  a

punching bag".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to get these

things  in  proper order. Perhaps  the  Member  for

Anson will tell us the name of the paper from which

the cutting is made.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am reading, Sir, from the Straits

Times  which you will remember two years ago almost

to a day was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



referred  to by the Hon. the Prime Minster  as  the

diabolic  English Press that falsifies and distorts

the  news  in order to divorce the English-speaking

from the rest of the people of Singapore. Sir, this

diabolic  English Press, the Straits  Times,  under

date  12th  July,  1961, which  I  intend  to  make

available  to  the House, reports with considerable

prominence  the  speaker for  the  P.A.P. at  this

function - the  representative  of  the  P.A.P.,  the

editor  of Petir, its official organ. And  this  is

what it reports him as having said - and being there,

Sir, I can confirm it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [that is, Mr Devan Nair] found it incredible

that some people who claimed close association with

the  party should attack it and say that everything

the party did was wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the party said they wanted to give the

mandate  back  to the people, they were  told  they

must not resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words," Mr Nair said, "we should remain

as  a useful punching bag for other people. We  are

not going to remain a punching bag for anyone."'



<br><br>Sir, in other words, Mr Nair is telling the people

of  Singapore, "We don't like criticism.  We  won't

accept  criticism. If in the Anson by-election  the

electorate  votes  against  the  P.A.P.,  we   will

consider that a criticism which is unacceptable and

we  will  resign  because  we  will  not  remain  a

punching  bag."  The  first  public  expression  of

dictatorial   arrogance   on   which    the    hon.

Backbenchers  have  thrown such considerable  light

today.  It was thought, Sir, by this Party  in  its

smug  complacency  of  its  majority  that  it  was

indispensable and that it threw down the challenge,

the  threat of a drunken gambler, to the people  of

Singapore,  "You  vote  against  us,  and  we  will

resign."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, on 13th July we have the organ of the

P.A.P. coming out in an editorial again making  the

issue of the Anson by-election a vote of confidence

in  the Government. I can place this one, Sir - it is

unmutilated. It is known as Petir, the organ of the

People's  Action Party, Thursday, 13th July,  1961,

two  days before this so-called crucial by-election

in which the P.A.P. leadership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



consciously  and  intentionally - whether   with   or

without  the support of their rank and file,  I  do

not  know - made the issue one of confidence  in  the

Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Democracy on Trial - what some people find

inexplicable   [says  this  paper]   is   why   the

Government,  with 39 seats in the assembly,  should

devote  so  much  time  and trouble  in  trying  to

recover one seat in Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...the P.A.P.'s approach to democracy is based on

the   belief  that  an  effective  government  must

clearly have moral authority to rule.'



<br><br>I say bravo!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fact that at any particular moment a

Government  has a majority in the Assembly  is  not

conclusive  proof  that it enjoys moral  authority.

All  that  it  proves is that at the  time  it  was

elected, it had the backing of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of its life, a Government

may,  for  a  variety of reasons,  forfeit  popular

support. The Government may have got in under false

pretences. It may have become effete, tyrannical or

corrupt.'



<br><br>Let   me   say  this,  Sir,  I  am  not  suggesting

corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Or it may be that the people may have changed

their minds about the very policies they endorsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons, a democratic Government,

whether  good  or  bad, which has  lost  its  moral

authority  to  rule,  cannot in  the  long  run  be

effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Anson by-election, what is being put to the

test  is  whether, as the Opposition groups  claim,

the Government has lost this moral authority.'



<br><br>That was, if I may say so, Sir, an honest piece  of

journalism  and  an honest stand. It  said  to  the

people, "We were elected two years ago but much has

happened since then. You may not want us today.  We

may  have  become  tyrannical. We may  have  become

effete. We will treat this Anson by-election  as  a

vote of confidence." A very honest stand indeed. It

is  clear,  therefore, that the  P.A.P. recognised

that  the mandate it received in 1959 was no longer

valid,  and it sought in Anson to ascertain whether

it  had,  in  its  own  words,  "forfeited  popular

support", whether the people believed it  had  come

in    under   false   pretences - I   repeat   "false

pretences" - and whether in the view of the people it

was  no longer a Party that they trusted. Now  this

editorial   clearly  indicates  that   the   P.A.P.

recognised that the majority it had in the Assembly

as  a  result of the votes of the people two  years

ago does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



not  necessarily reflect the feelings of the people

of Singapore, that it was no use coming here for  a

mandate,  that  a  mandate  was  needed  from   the

people - and not, as the last speaker said, a mandate

from  the  Party. The Party is not the  people.  It

sought - and quite rightly - a mandate from the people

because it recognised that in the interim period it

might have lost that confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us recognise, Sir, that this vote of

confidence was sought in a P.A.P. stronghold. Anson

in  1959  was  won  by a P.A.P. candidate  with  a

smashing  majority  over,  I  believe,  four  other

candidates.  And what is particularly  interesting,

Mr Speaker, Sir, is the way Anson was built up  by

the P.A.P. as being the quintessence, the sample of

all  Singapore. They were prepared to take the vote

in Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only two more paragraphs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Anson is in many respects a good testing ground.

It   is   a   Singapore  in  miniature  as  regards

distribution of population in terms of  communities

and  social classes. Unlike Hong Lim, where special

and   purely  local  factors  may  have  influenced

decisions, in Anson, it is a straight-forward fight

between   the  P.A.P. on  the  one  hand   and   a

heterogeneous collection of political  parties  who

between them are espousing all the causes that  the

P.A.P. has refused to take up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a test of whether a constituency which is

typical  of  Singapore as a whole  is  prepared  to

endorse  the  policies and actions  of  the  P.A.P.

Government during its two years in office.'



<br><br>Sir,  in  case  you say that that could  have  been

hardly   noticed  by  anybody  as  being  a   Party

newspaper,  let  me  assure you that  the  diabolic

English  Press - and  I  have  no  doubt  the  honest

Chinese,  Malay and Tamil Press too - gave  it  full

publicity - "ANSON: A TEST FOR P.A.P.". I read  from

the Straits Times of Friday, the day before the

by-election - "By-election will decide if it  still  has

`moral  right  to stay in power'" and  considerable

excerpts from this paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see, Mr Speaker, Sir, that they

intentionally   sought  in  these   two   areas - and

particularly in Anson - a vote of confidence  of  the

people. They lost this vote. The Hon. the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



Minister refers to gamblers. There are gamblers who

refuse  to  pay  up on their debt  of  honour.  The

P.A.P. leadership refuses to meet the promises that

it  has  so clearly made to the people of Singapore

in  the by-elections of Hong Lim and of Anson.  You

are  told,  Sir  - I  am not surprised;  it  is  now

traditional - that the victory of the  Workers  Party

in   Anson   is  suggested  to  be   due   to   the

Machiavellian machinations of Lord Selkirk. That of

all  things is perhaps the most amusing. But  there

are  other allegations. We did not win it, Sir, not

at all. They did not lose it, Sir, not a bit of it.

They  did not lose it and consequently they do  not

have  to pay up their debts. They remind me of  the

gambler  who goes to a firm of solicitors and  asks

them to protect him from his gambling debts through

legal technicalities. Sir, they refuse to pay up on

their  promises and their threat to the  people  of

Singapore. And they come to this Assembly with this

fairy  tale  of the lion and the bear in  order  to

continue in office for another two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they were quite convinced of victory, because

there  are  no  millionaires  in  Anson.  It  is  a

particularly  poor Division. I doubt  if  there  is

another  Division in Singapore which is poorer.  It

is a particular stronghold of the P.A.P. Also there

were 1,500 new voters about whom some nasty rumours

are  spreading around. Whatever the truth  may  be,

Sir,  the facts are that the P.A.P. had almost half

the support it had before, in spite of the enlarged

electorate by more than 1,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the P.A.P. leadership whether, in coming to

this  Assembly and counting the noses of  those  of

its  Back-benchers who were elected two years  ago,

it  thinks it gives itself the moral right to  stay

in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the day of the election this

diabolic   English   Press,  which   distorts   and

falsifies  facts in order to delude the  people  in

the  interests  of imperialism and capitalism,  and

which  has  for  some mysterious reason  taken  the

P.A.P. leadership to its clammy arms, came out with

a screaming poster, "ANSON - ALL AT STAKE-".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member may

find  the Speaker of this Assembly is perhaps

old-fashioned.   I   have  always  been   against   any

demonstrations of that nature. All I think the hon.

and to read the contents of that poster, and not to

make a demonstration.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was seeking to

Sir,  the editorial of this diabolic English Press.

I  read  now, Sir, from July 15th (the day  of  the

election)  Straits  Times, Saturday.  The  heading,

across  the  front page, "ALL AT STAKE  NOW".  "Lee

the  editorial  itself,  we  have  details  of  the

horrors  of  what  would happen if  the  Anson

by-election were lost by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, I have sufficiently proved to you

and sufficiently reminded the Members opposite that

the  P.A.P. leadership consciously,  intentionally

and repeatedly made the Anson by-election a vote of

confidence  in  the Government, and as  clearly  as

possible  threatened the people of  Singapore  with

resignation  if  it lost. It has lost.  The  P.A.P.

lost the Anson by-election, its own stronghold, and

this  Party, which calls itself a consistent Party,

refused to accept the very vote that it has sought.

It  refuses to accept because that would  mean  the

resignation  of the Government. It is  not  a  test

which the Opposition laid down, Mr Speaker. It  is

not  a test which I sought to lay down. I made  the

issue of the continuance of the Prime Minister  one

of  the  planks of my platform. It is a test  which

the Prime Minister, not wishing to go alone, sought

to  drag  the entire P.A.P., the entire Government.

And  he has lost. Does he resign? He is, I say with

respect,   in   honour  bound  to  resign,   though

naturally nothing in the law can prevent  him  from

not resigning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to your knowledge, we had the example not

very  long ago of another government which  refused

to  resign.  It came to be known as the Jaga  Kreta

Government.  Some  Members  may  remember  it.   It

started  off somewhere in June 1956 with a  promise

by the Prime Minister that his was only a caretaker

government  and that he would resign within  a  few

months, in a short while. Well, there was-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we ought to

confuse the issue. It was the Chief Minister  then;

not the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I thank you for the correction, Mr

Speaker, Sir, It was indeed the Chief Minister, not

the   Prime   Minister.  And  the  Chief   Minister

continued  in office, and continued in office,  and

continued  in office, right up to the bitter  legal

end.  He had the legal power. So, Mr Speaker, Sir,

have  these  gentlemen  opposite  the  legal  power

constitutionally despite the will  of  the  people,

despite their promises, to continue in office.  And

in   order  to  make  it  palatable  to  their  own

consciences - I do not know if it is possible for one

so  to  delude  oneself - they bring out  this  story

about the Communist Left and the non-Communist Left

and  the  British  lion dining with  the  Communist

bear,  and  the plots. The Hon. the Prime  Minister

has  always  had a predilection for the  cloak  and

dagger  approach, and I am not a bit surprised,  in

fact,  I  am  delighted  at  this  example  of  his

ingenuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did make the issue in Anson the question of

the  resignation of the Prime Minister. I trust you

will believe me when I say, Sir, that I did it  out

of  no  personal malice but because, having watched

his  machinations over the past  two  years,  I  am

satisfied  that  his continued occupation  of  this

office  constitutes a grave danger to  our  people.

Sir,  I  am  not one bit abashed to say to  you  in

front of him that I have a very genuine regard  for

his  political ability. I am equally aghast at  his

lack of respect for human beings, his lack - if I may

be   permitted  to  say  so,  Sir,  - of   humanity,

humility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never believed, Sir, in the myth of

collective leadership of the P.A.P., and it is with

interest  that  I read of a letter  issued  by  the

eight  hon.  Members  opposite  declaring,  in  the

clearest  possible terms, that  there  is  no  such

collective  leadership. For myself,  if  I  may  be

permitted  without  suggesting any  criticism.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if I may be permitted to say  so,  I

regret  you did not hear in full the last  speaker.

Because it seems to me that the examples he gave of

the  lack  of democracy within the People's  Action

Party  are  evidence against the vote of confidence

which  these gentlemen opposite seek.  How  can  we

have confidence in the democratic leadership of the

P.A.P. when  they  have such  dictatorship  within

their own Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would you permit me to read to you one

passage  from  this letter of the  "eight"  to  the

Chairman, the Leader of this House, printed in  the

Straits Times of the 14th of July, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There has never been much practice of intra-party

democracy  in the PAP, though democracy is  one  of

our   chief  tenets.  Decisions  have  always  been

imposed upon the rank and file by a few individuals

at the top.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democratic discussion, with fullest possible

consultation, is a thing almost foreign to even the

party  executives on whom implementation  of  party

policies depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often the secretary-general or some Ministers

make a speech in the Assembly or elsewhere and  the

rest  of  the party is informed that what has  been

said has become the policy of the party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to persuade fellow Asians to a

democratic  way  of life, we ourselves  must  first

practise democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this lack of intra-party

democracy that we urgently request you to influence

the  CEC to hold meetings so that policy discussion

and  consultation  may take place  and  intra-party

democracy observed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it must be clear, Sir, that in the

dictionary  of the P.A.P., "collective  leadership"

means the leadership of the Prime Minister and  his

colleagues  collect. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not

intend  to go into details because Members all  are

intelligent persons, but it cannot be doubted  that

the loss of Hong Lim and of Anson indicates in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



clearest  possible  fashion the disillusionment  of

the people of Singapore with the Prime Minister and

their  strong  resentment of him.  His  refusal  to

resign  is  a  slap in the face of  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read, Sir, as you have read, the farce of

the  exchange of letters between the Hon. the Prime

Minister  and the Deputy Prime Minister,  in  which

the   Prime  Minister  informed  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister of his willingness to resign and his equal

willingness to continue in office. The question  is

this, Sir: it is not the Deputy Prime Minister, nor

is  it  this House that can give the Hon. the Prime

Minister  the vote of confidence which he has  lost

in  Hong Lim and in Anson of his own choice. I  say

to  you,  Sir, that anyone with elementary  respect

for the people will accept the verdict. But no,  we

have  this  curious summoning of this  Assembly  in

order to cover up the Prime Minister's refusal,  to

honour  his  moral obligation, and to  give  him  a

specious excuse for his continued occupation of his

post.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the Member for

Anson will take some time?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I propose to suspend

for half an hour. I shall take this Chair again  at 5.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we adjourned,

I was drawing the analogy between what became known

as  the  Jaga  Kreta  Government  and  the  anxiety

displayed  in this motion by the present Government

to  remain in office despite the test which it  set

itself  of confidence in the country and  which  it

lost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Party having lost the vote of confidence

of the country, we now have this super spectacle of

an emergency sitting called in order to bring up  a

super  smokescreen to cover up the retreat  of  the

Party  from its moral obligations and to  build  up

some excuses for its continued existence. Sir, with

respect, I find that the bogey or the fairy tale or

the  ghost  story of the Earl of Selkirk persuading

the  Communists  of  Singapore to  take  office  is

something  that is unworthy of further  comment.  I

myself have had the pleasure of being the guest  of

the  Earl of Selkirk and I can solemnly assure you,

Sir, that at no time did he seek to persuade me  to

join the Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bogey that we now have is that the

central  issue before the people is  merger  or  no

merger. Sir, the P.A.P. tell us that they genuinely

seek  merger with the Federation of Malaya. I would

ask  you  to recognise, Mr Speaker, that today  in

this  very  House the Hon. the Prime Minister  laid

down  impossible conditions for the achievement  of

that merger. He said the P.A.P. seeks the merger of

Singapore  with  the Federation  on  conditions  of

autonomy in education and labour policies. Sir, the

Prime  Minister himself is a lawyer and I do credit

him  with  an understanding of the Constitution  of

the Federation of Malaya. He must be conscious that

though  the  Federation of Malaya  permits  of  the

incorporation  of new States as constituent  States

within the Federation, they would all be subject to

the  same  laws,  and  it is impossible  under  the

present   Constitution  of   the   Federation   for

Singapore or any other State to have the privileged

position   of  autonomy  in  labour  and  education

legislation. If it is meant seriously, Mr Speaker,

Sir, as we must believe that it was meant, then  it

must  be  suggested that we will compel or seek  to

obtain  from  the  Federation an amendment  to  the

Constitution of the Federation, an amendment  which

would   require  a  two-thirds  majority   of   the

Federation Parliament, an amendment which would put

Singapore  as a State superior to any  other  State

that  is a constituent member of the Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are all too conscious that for many years now the Government of Singapore has

officially  offered to the Federation merger  as  a

constituent State unconditionally. I have disclosed

that  I  made  that offer in 1955. I  know  it  was

repeated again and again, Mr Speaker, up to  about

the  middle of or early 1956. I have no doubt,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that it has been repeated since then.

We  have each been rebuffed, sometimes courteously,

and  sometimes even sharply, on the offer to  merge

as  a State unconditionally. Yet it is suggested by

the  Prime  Minister that Singapore  can  and  will

achieve  merger with the Federation in  1963,  with

autonomy in education and labour legislation. I say

to  you,  Sir, that that is a day-dream which  they

know  to be a day-dream. I do not know whether they

expect  the people to take it seriously,  but  they

themselves cannot believe in it seriously. We  have

the  hard  reality that for six years now  we  have

been  refused  any  kind  of  opening  of  official

conversations for a merger. For the last two  years

they  have even refused a Common Market.  In  those

circumstances,  Sir, I say that it  is  the  P.A.P.

leadership  that  is  making impossible  conditions

leading to the impossibility of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is alleged that

the  issue  in Anson was merger or no merger,  that

the  T.U.C. Six came out openly against merger, and

that  I received their support. I think I ought  to

make  it  clear, Sir. The Workers Party at no  time

sought  the  support of the T.U.C. Six  or  anybody

else except the voters of Anson. We do not know who

voted  for us, quite naturally. But it is a curious

thing  to suggest that the T.U.C. Six and the three

Political  Secretaries  came  out  openly   against

merger and yet they would support me because,  Sir,

I  am  on  record prior to Election Day  as  having

stated quite categorically that I have at all times

been  and am in favour of merger. I do not  believe

in  seeking for Singapore an unhealthy superiority.

We  can and must go in only as a constituent  State

unconditionally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important, Mr Speaker, that we

should  take cognizance of the letter of  the  Hon.

the Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister and

which  was  published in the Press yesterday.  This

letter  deals with the phoney issue that  today  in

Singapore  the question is not whether  we  are  to

achieve  independence with or without  merger,  but

the  question is merger or no merger. I read,  Sir,

from this diabolic English Press dated the 19th  of

July, 1961, page 1, headed:



<br><br><div align="center">'TEST OF STRENGTH</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear comrade chairman [The Prime Minister to the

Deputy  Prime  Minister] - we are both aware  of  the

grave   difficulties  that  lie   ahead   for   the

government  and of the danger of industrial  unrest

for  political objectives now that three  political

secretaries  have  openly opposed the  government's

policy of independence through merger.'



<br><br>Where,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is this open declaration

of opposition of the three Political Secretaries to

independence through merger? This bogey of which we

are  being  warned  and  which  calamity  only  the

continuance  in  office  of  the  Hon. the   Prime

Minister  and  his  colleagues  can  prevent   from

occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, on the same page of the Straits

Times,  on  which  this  is  printed,  appears   in

headline  a  statement by one  of  these  Political

Secretaries, Mr Lim Ching Siong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`I am not against merger"



<br><br>And it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"I realise that the aspiration of our people is

to see a merger taking place between the Federation

and  Singapore. It has long been my dedication that

I  should do everything in my power to realise  the

aspiration of the people of Malaya, Mr  Lee  knows

this to be a fact."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was not, I am not and I shall not be against

the  unification of our country (Singapore plus the

Federation)."'



<br><br>That, Sir, is as categorical as any human being can

make  it. I have no brief for the gentleman. But  I

have  a brief, an important brief, to see that  the

people  are  not confused; to do what  I  can,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  to  prevent  this  confusion,  this

smokescreen, this attempt to throw dust in the eyes

of  the  people in order that the Government should

continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



in  office. Nowhere at any time, Mr Speaker, am  I

conscious of a single written word of opposition by

these three Political Secretaries to the concept of

merger  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya. They are not here to defend themselves.  As

I say, I am not interested in defending them, apart

from  seeking  to  disabuse  this  House  of  these

illusions  and to permit it to some extent  to  see

through this smokescreen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, is not

that  these three Political Secretaries are against

merger, or that the eight hon. Members opposite are

against  merger, but that they - and  this  is  their

crime - have  attacked  the  Government  on   certain

specific  issues.  The  Trade  Union  Six  and  the

Political  Secretaries  want  the  release  of  the

detainees.  It  has today been disclosed  that  the

Government  sought their release  in  August  1959.

What  have  they  done  apart  from  presenting   a

memorandum? Mr Speaker, Sir, let us face it. It is

perfectly  true  that  in  this  Internal  Security

Council  which  was brought back by  the  Hon. the

Prime  Minister, there are executive powers, powers

which  were  never  sought of me  in  the  Internal

Security  Council  which  was  envisaged  the  year

earlier. By some curious coincidence, the Hon. the

Prime  Minister, in partnership with the  gentleman

from  Cairnhill, brought back a Constitution  which

gave  considerable executive powers to the Internal

Security  Council. But these powers do not  prevent

the  Government  from  issuing  an  order  for  the

release of the detainees. They do give the Internal

Security Council the power to issue an order to His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara who will then

be  required  to put them back again. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, if that should happen, we would know where the

fault lies. It is not necessary that the Government

must then resign. The Government should resign when

it  loses  the moral support and the confidence  of

the  people. I can understand no reason  whatsoever

for the Government to resign when, in pursuance  of

the people's will, it takes steps which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



slapped  back  by  the superior  force  of  British

imperialism. But at no time are we aware,  nor  has

it ever been suggested, that this Government sought

to  do  more  than  present a petty  paper  to  the

Internal Security Council, and it has left it there

for  two  whole years, Sir, I find it difficult  to

believe  that the British Government would  seek  a

constitutional crisis in respect of  the  continued

detention  of  these people who have  already  been

five  years  or  four  years  in  detention.  Their

utility,  Sir,  to any subversive organisation  has

been completely nullified. Now that the matter  has

come out into the open, no doubt we may hope to see

some  action.  But can the Government really  blame

the  trade union leaders for demanding the  release

of  these  detainees? These persons  who,  together

with    Lim   Ching   Siong   and   others,    were

providentially detained by an act of the  gentleman

from Cairnhill at a time when it was-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would rather the Member for

Anson  refer  to the "gentleman from Cairnhill"  as

the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am so sorry, Sir. The Member for

Cairnhill - it  is  a  word I  myself  consider  more

appropriate.  The honourable Member  for  Cairnhill

detained  Lim Ching Siong and his colleagues  at  a

time  which was providential for the Prime Minister

and  his group, as saving them from the competition

of  their Party rivals. A curious coincidence,  Mr

Speaker,  one which has not been lost on the  Party

and which has not been lost on the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else did the T.U.C. Six and the three

Political  Secretaries demand?  They  demanded  the

abolition of the Internal Security Council Is  that

something  to take umbrage at? Are we  to  have  it

openly  stated  that  it is the  Internal  Security

Council which shores up this Government? That it is

the  Internal  Security Council which protects  the

continued existence of this Government? Sir, at  no

time  and  nowhere  can I read that  any  of  these

people, who are not here to defend themselves, have

ever  suggested  that they did not want  merger  or

that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



wanted  the  abolition  of  the  Internal  Security

Council in place of merger. What they have said is,

"Let  us have this. It is in our power now." Merger

is  not in our power any more than marriage  is  in

the  power of one party. We have to get the consent

of  the  other party. We cannot drag the Federation

by its hair to the altar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as words have meaning, I say to you

that in so far as a human being can judge from  the

facts,  it  has  been proved that  it  is  a  grave

falsehood to charge any group of persons  named  in

this  Assembly  this  afternoon  with  being

anti-merger.   The  three  Political  Secretaries   were

charged  by  the  Prime Minister as  having  openly

opposed  the Government's policy of merger.  I  ask

the  Prime  Minister to prove that  statement.  Mr

Speaker,  there  are,  however,  matters  of   even

greater import in this letter of which I feel  this

House must take note.



The letter adds:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You and I are aware that this is but the opening

of a new test of strength between the non-Communist

Left and the Communist Left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that having lost Anson we now

face  trials and tribulations as those  who  reject

merger  mount their campaign against the government

in  order  to  prevent it from  ever  reaching  any

agreement   on   principle  with   the   Federation

Government.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bogey of those who do not want merger and

seek to prevent us from obtaining merger, which  we

cannot   get  anyway  from  the  Federation   which

consistently refuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... let me assure you that it is not my desire to

absolve myself from the many unpleasant and awkward

things  that  the government will  have  to  do  on

behalf  of  the  people in order  to  maintain  the

economy  of  the  island,  the  livelihood  of  the

people, and the peace and order of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most likely that mounting industrial action

will  be  taken  by  Mr Lim  Chin  Siong  and  his

confederates to coerce the party and the government

to abandon its plan for merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that an open break has come, it is most likely

that  there  will  be a mounting offensive  on  the

trade union front with political and not industrial

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first political objective, of course, is to

break up any talk of merger with the Federation  of

Malaya.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be obvious that the

allegation  of the threat of industrial  unrest  in

the  context of the smear campaign of the Communist

Left   necessarily  presages   the   use   of   the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance again  to

detain political opponents, whom providence is  not

committing other Parties to detain, for the benefit

of  the  leadership of the P.A.P. There is  no  one

here to pick their chestnuts out of the fire unless

they can persuade the British to do it through  the

Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I read with interest - I must confess with more than interest; with consternation and

with  surprise -  the statement in  this  memorandum

tabled  by  the Deputy Premier today  that  of  the

eight  men  released, the most important  from  the

security point of view is Mr Lim Ching Siong,  for

he was the person "built up as an open front leader

by  the M.C.P. in 1955 and 1956". And later on,  of

the  eight  people released, "the P.A.P. Government

has  reason to believe that five, not including Lim

Chin  Siong,  genuinely and sincerely subscribe  to

the  P.A.P. democratic  socialist  ideology".  Mr

Speaker,  whilst  incidentally  wondering  at   the

extraordinary inconsistency of the conduct  of  the

Government in making the so-called known front  man

of   the   Malayan  Communist  Party  a   Political

Secretary, I would ask you to notice that all these

symptoms augur the utilisation in massive form,  in

time  of  peace,  for political  purposes  and  the

maintenance  of  political power of  a  clique,  of

provisions intended to be used in time of emergency

for  the security of the people as a whole. Nor can

we,  Mr Speaker, ignore that remark about Mr  Lim

Ching   Siong   mounting  industrial   unrest   for

political purposes. We are none of us so young that

we  can  have forgotten the unhappy events  of  the

latter  part  of  1956  with the  grave  industrial

unrest  which  many people believed  to  have  been

inspired by the government of the day for political

purposes  in order to give them an excuse to  bring

repressive  police action and to  detain  political

opponents.  It is a horrible thought, Mr  Speaker,

but it is one to which I must give vent. I think we

must be conscious of it. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



aware  that  the  P.A.P. leadership has  constantly

sought  to  control  and enslave  the  trade  union

movement for political purposes. We are aware  that

even today, with the break in the T.U.C., there are

many  unions  loyal to the P.A.P. and  many  trade

unionists loyal to the P.A.P. We are aware that the

P.A.P. is  in  a  position to incite  or  organise

industrial unrest. We are aware that the P.A.P. has

a  reputation  for  ruthlessness  well-earned.  The

question,  Mr Speaker, is this: let  us  recognise

that  if  any  person or any Party so  abuse  their

position in this age as to bring about violence  in

the  industrial field for the purposes of achieving

or maintaining political power, such person or such

Party  will  forever be damned in the eyes  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, it is not inappropriate when we

consider whether this Government is worthy  of  our

confidence,  not only to note that they  allege  in

one breath that a man is a front man of the Malayan

Communist  Party and, at the same time, retain  him

and  make  him knowingly their Political Secretary,

but  also  in this very Assembly they  call  him  a

traitor,  saying that he has stabbed  them  in  the

back,  that  he  is  anti-merger  and  opposes  the

Government's declared policy, whilst continuing his

service  in the Government. I ask you to recognise,

Mr  Speaker, that the post of Political  Secretary

is one at the dispensation of the government of the

day. It is not a civil service post. The Government

can,  at  will,  employ or dismiss whomsoever  they

think fit and quite naturally the man employed  for

such  a  post as Political Secretary must have  the

confidence of the Government. Yet these people whom

they  call  Communists,  traitors,  instigators  of

riots  or  potential instigators of riots have  not

been dismissed. Wherein, Sir, is the consistency of

this  Government,  and  how  does  it  deserve  our

confidence  that  it can act in so contradictory  a

fashion?  Equally,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the   term

"traitor" has been used of eight honourable Members

opposite.  I  know they can well defend themselves.

But  in  assessing the Government as to whether  it

merits  a  vote of confidence, apart from its  past

conduct,  which  I  will not  bore  you  with  this

afternoon,  let  us recognise that  they  have  not

sought in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



their  own  Party  to  deal  with  these  so-called

traitors.  But  they  seek  through  a  motion   of

confidence  in  this  Assembly,  Mr  Speaker,   to

intimidate them and their colleagues and to  retain

them  in  order  to have some sort  of  a  majority

whilst  seeking to deter them from criticising  the

Government.  We  have  been  called  in   emergency

session,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I say with  respect  to

you,  not for any purpose of national emergency  as

it  now  transpires, but solely for the purpose  of

shoring  up  the Prime Minister in his  intra-party

struggle  to maintain power against his  own  Party

members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore have

suffered almost as much from their leaders - it is  a

big  "almost" - as from the British, and I say to you

that  the  farce  which is being played  out  today

about asking the Assembly for a vote of confidence,

which  they have lost in the country, is adding  to

the   disillusionment  of  the  people   with   the

democratic  process. And so must this  ghost  story

about   the  British  seeking  to  bring  about   a

Communist  government in Singapore and  this  bogey

about  the  issue in Singapore being merger  or  no

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, this last and most hoary of all

bogeys - the  Communist Left. We do have  Communists,

Mr  Speaker, Sir - I believe but I am not sure. But

I  am  conscious  now that they  neither  have  the

strength  nor the influence to affect us materially

at  this  stage.  I  am  also very  conscious,  Mr

Speaker, that the tag of "Communist" has been  used

shamelessly,  dishonestly and fraudulently  in  the

past. I myself have been called a Communist by  one

newspaper,  now  defunct, when  I  came  back  from

China.  I then realised, Mr Speaker, perhaps  more

than  at any other time, how easily the people  can

be  deceived and how fraudulently and falsely  this

tag of Communist can be applied. It is a hoary tag.

It  is  one  which the British have used with  very

considerable  success. I must say  it  comes  as  a

surprise  that  persons  whom  I  believe  to  have

political  acumen, on the opposite benches,  should

seek to resuscitate this hoary tag and apply it  to

their  opponents. As the last speaker  has  pointed

out, Sir, they have gone the full circle of all the

abuse that they could muster



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



-Right-Wing  opportunists, Left-Wing deviationists.

What  are  the other terms? I have forgotten  them.

Oh!  Left-Wing  lunatics. And  now  Communist-Left.

Anything that disagrees with the Prime Minister, of

course.  It  is  significant  that  this   cry   of

Communist-Left  is  raised in the  letter  speaking

about  industrial unrest which the  Prime  Minister

prophesises will be organised by his own  Political

Secretaries.  It  is  not  that  I  personally   am

concerned  for  the  welfare or  freedom  of  these

gentlemen, but I do remember, Sir, that  they  have

been  detained for many years - and so was Dr Chuang

Chu-lin also detained under the P.P.S.O., and he is

now the Vice-Chancellor of Nanyang University. They

were  detained on the allegation that they  incited

the riots and the unhappy events of the latter part

of  1956.  Sir, the trade unions of Singapore  have

learned since the Hock Lee riots that violence  and

unrest are always to their disadvantage. Riots  are

always  an excuse for repressive measures  directed

against  the  workers. I believe that in  Singapore

more  than  anywhere else in the world the  workers

intend   to  exercise  the  utmost  self-restraint,

whatever the provocation, because they know that at

the  very  first  sign of any riot,  they  will  be

blamed  and their struggle for social justice  will

meet with the grave setback it met with at the  end

of 1956. The Prime Minister is fully aware that his

Political   Secretaries,  of  whom  he  speaks   as

possibly  inciting industrial unrest for  political

objectives,  have  played  an  admirable  part   in

inculcating  into  the  workers  of  Singapore   an

understanding  of the dangers of violence  whatever

the  provocation, and that they would be  the  last

people  on earth to incite industrial violence  for

political objectives; for they know that industrial

violence  in this small area, whether with  British

troops  or Federation troops, would be crushed  and

the  aftermath would be complete elimination of the

working  class leaders without trial on the  excuse

of industrial peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I conclude with an appeal that I have

made  for many years and that I make yet once more.

I ask the sons and daughters of Singapore of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



whatever  Party  to reflect quietly  and  recognise

that  the  constitution  we  have  is  a  dishonest

constitution  incapable of meeting  our  needs  and

incompatible  with  the requirements  of  a  vital,

decent  people.  We  must recognise  that  to  seek

independence   through  merger  alone   leaves   us

helpless  at the feet of the Federation which  then

has  no incentive to co-operate towards merger, for

it  has power through the Internal Security Council

to control Singapore without any responsibility and

without any reciprocity, not even the necessity  of

a common market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in assessing this issue as to

whether we give this Government our confidence, let

us recognise that today it has rejected the call of

independence preferably with, if necessary without,

the  Federation. It is a call which the very people

who  spoke  today fully approved not so  very  long

ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if I might take up your time just for a little while. I would like to read to you from

page  47  of Cmd. Paper No. 31 of 1956. This  is  a

memorandum  submitted on behalf  of  the  Singapore

Government  with which the Hon, the Prime  Minister

and  Mr Lim Ching Siong, as representatives of the

P.A.P.,  fully  endorsed and associated  themselves

with. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is, however, impossible for the people of

Singapore  to  accept  any  suggestion   that   the

fulfilment of their constitutional aspirations must

await  incorporation  with the  Federation  in  the

indefinite future. Since we must, we ask  for  such

fulfilment   now,  whilst  declaring   our   utmost

goodwill  and  readiness now and at  all  times  to

unite with the Federation into a single nation.'



<br><br>Now,  Mr  Speaker,  at  page  22,  to  show   the

inconsistency   of   this   Government   and    its

inadequacy,  these  are the statements  which  were

then accepted by the present Prime Minister and his

colleague on behalf of the P.A.P.:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore is small in area, but it has a

population of 1� million. That population is larger

than that of New Zealand when it became a member of

the  League  of  Nations and  four  times  that  of

Newfoundland  when the Statute of Westminster  gave

it  complete  autonomy. There are at present  seven

states   Members   of  the  United   Nations   with

populations smaller than that of Singapore, namely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



Costa  Rica,  Iceland, Jordan,  Libya,  Luxembourg,

Nicaragua  and Panama. It is only slightly  smaller

than  the  population  of three  other  independent

States,  Honduras, the Lebanon and Paraguay.  Since

there  are ten small countries with populations  of

less  than  1�  million  each,  there  can  be   no

justification  for  saying  that  Singapore  alone,

among  these  ten,  is  incapable  of  becoming  an

independent country.'



<br><br>And at page 23:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These facts show that Singapore cannot be

regarded  as  too  small to become  an  independent

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effectively ... it will have a larger revenue than

many of the 54 States Members of the United Nations

whose revenues appear superficially to be larger.'



<br><br>Sir, that was the stand with which the P.A.P. fully

agreed  in  1956. Now we are told that  the  P.A.P.

totally   rejects  the  idea  of   an   independent

Singapore and has rejected it ever since the  Party

was formed. It considers an independent Singapore a

fantasy. Mr Speaker, Sir, whether fantasy or  not,

let   us   recognise  that  the  struggle  for   an

independent   Singapore  is  not   derogatory   but

complementary  to  the  struggle  for  merger.  The

nearer we come to independence, the greater is  the

urge  on  the part of the Federation to merge  with

the  people  of Singapore. That has  been  to  some

extent, Mr Speaker, proved in the recent Anson

by-election.  Merdeka  and merger were  dead  for  two

years. Everytime the issue was opened, you know the

result.  The Anson by-election came in the  offing,

and  it  was  known that the issue of  independence

would  be the crucial focal issue of Anson. It  was

then,  and  then only, Mr Speaker, that the  Prime

Minister of the Federation saw fit to make friendly

noises about possible closer political and economic

relations with Singapore. Let us recognise that  if

we  do  not  offer the people an alternative  to  a

merger, which we cannot compel, we are leaving them

hanging in mid-air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is well and good to say,

"1963,  merger with the Federation." I am  prepared

to  accept  that,  and  I  believe  the  people  of

Singapore  are  also prepared to accept  that.  But

what  if  you cannot achieve merger by  1963?  What

then?  The Hon. the Prime Minister says,  "We  will

throw up our hand and tell the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



British to take over." Mr Speaker, surely that  is

a sterile approach. We cannot offer our vital youth

who are growing up, who seek their self-respect,  a

possibility  which is not even a  probability,  and

then  the alternative - British rule. I say  that  we

can  and we should all of us honestly and sincerely

seek, concurrently with our efforts for merger,  an

independent  Singapore, a Singapore  that  is  more

viable, as I have just indicated to you, than  many

States  which are independent today. Singapore  can

and  will, if necessary. "go it alone". Is that not

preferable  to throwing up your hand as a  bankrupt

and putting it in the laps of the British?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. does not accept the concept of independence preferably with, if

necessary without, the Federation because it  fears

the  loss  of  power for itself. I  say:  recognise

that  the people around us seek freedom. They  seek

self-respect  as a plant seeks air  and  light.  We

cannot deny this to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime

Minister  three days ago in his letter in reply  to

the  Prime  Minister stated that the call  for  the

resignation  of  the  Prime Minister  was  made  to

confuse  the people over the vital issue of  merger

with the Federation. Mr Speaker, it was I who made

that  call. I think I have made my stand on  merger

clear  and there can be no confusion. The call  for

the  resignation of the Prime Minister  is  a  call

from  the  people of Singapore for the  end  of  an

overpowering  personality  who  does   not   permit

democratic  play,  nor  has  he  respect  for   the

democratic principles or the will of the people. It

is  not,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that I know the  Deputy

Prime  Minister, that I am a friend of  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister who is so terrified of me  that  he

does not recognise me when he sees me. The truth of

it  is that, were the Prime Minister to resign,  at

least  that  would  to  some  extent  assuage   the

resentment of the people to this Government and  at

least   give  an  opportunity  to  this  Party m any

members  of  whom  I have no doubt  are  dedicated,

sincere   and  honest  and  seek  the  welfare   of

Singapore - to reorientate itself, to reconsider  its

position without the presence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



of   a  man  who  feels  that  reorientation,   the

recognition of a mistake, is in itself  a  dreadful

thing, and that consistency even in foolishness  is

preferable to the wisdom learned from mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with regret in this my

very  first speech to this House that I should  ask

the Asembly to take cognizance of a motion that  is

unworthy. Mr Speaker, if it had come from the Jaga

Kreta Government, we would have grown accustomed to

that  kind  of  conduct. But in the  light  of  the

distinction in the stature of the people concerned,

the  people  of  Singapore were  entitled  and  are

entitled  to expect greater integrity and sincerity

and  acceptance  of  the public will.  This  motion

before  the House, more perhaps than any other  act

of  the Government, displays - if it is not deemed an

unparliamentary   phrase,  Mr   Speaker - a   shabby

approach  to government, unworthy of the people  of

Singapore. And if this motion is persisted in, then

I   hope   the   conscience  of  the  Backbenchers,

independent  human  beings themselves,  would  make

them  vote  against this motion even  if  it  means

fresh  elections. I do not want a  fresh  election,

having  come  through five weeks of it!  Nor  am  I

unconscious that the alternative to this Government

is  at  present  unformed.  But  I  say  it  is  an

unhealthy  thing  for  any government  to  consider

itself indispensable, for any government to act  in

such   a  fashion - consciously  to  seek  to   bring

confusion and throw dust in the eyes of the people,

create  bogies and non-existent bogies in order  to

frighten them so that they should be supported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Hon. the Minister for Finance is very

anxious to take the Floor. Mr Speaker, I thank you

for  your  indulgence. I will not keep him  on  the

leash any longer.



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> As I

sweated  through that marathon performance  of  the

Member for Anson, I was just wondering whether  his

long absence from this Chamber has so increased his

powers for lengthy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



oratory  that  at  the first opportunity  he  would

deliver  such  a long oration to the Assembly.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, as he went on and on repeating  many

of  his  points  several times, I  thought  perhaps

after our defeat in Anson, this was the punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has raised a number of points and I have

no  doubt my colleagues concerned will answer  them

at  the  appropriate  time.  But  I  listened  with

interest to his remarks on what he termed the bogey

of  Communism  which has been raised in  the  Prime

Minister's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson was at one time the

Chief  Minister of Singapore. When he  was  at  the

helm,  he was faced with difficult problems.  There

were riots and the expansion of unions by operators

on  behalf of the Malayan Communist Party. So  much

so,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that when he went to  London

in April 1956, he had occasion to address a meeting

of  Malayan students in London, after which  I  met

him. At that time, Mr Speaker, Sir, the then Chief

Minister  did  not  assume the mantle  of  a  great

Liberal, the opposer of all attempts to make use of

the  Communist  smear in order to  liquidate  one's

political  opponents. What he said at the students'

union  would be on record, and perhaps one of these

days  we may be able to publish the minutes of that

meeting. But after the meeting, he met me and spoke

to me in earnest, almost desperate, terms. He said,

"Though you are a close friend of Lee Kuan Yew,  do

you  know  that  he is giving legal  cover  to  the

Communists so that they can expand their  influence

in  Singapore,  in  the unions,  in  the  students'

associations,  cultural bodies? And that  Lee  Kuan

Yew is using his considerable skill as a lawyer  to

give  Communist operators the legal protection that

they  need  for the consolidation and expansion  of

their  Party?" And he begged of me to  persuade  my

friend to disavow his presence so that he, as Chief

Minister, could take action against them. Sir, that

is  a long cry from the present stand of the Member

for  Anson. Indeed, I might say that the circle has

made  a  complete turn. I will come  back  to  this

subject in due course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the comments from the two Government

Parliamentary  Secretaries on the absence  of  what

they  term "intra-party democracy", the  allegedly

dictatorial  methods of the Party  leadership,  and

the centralisation of power and decision-making  in

a  small body of the leadership. Sir, much of  what

they  say  is  already familiar to this  House.  In

fact, a stronger case had already been made by  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim who gave more  examples  and

spoke with even greater heat and passion because he

himself had been the object of disciplinary  action

taken  by  the  Party under its  Constitution.  The

Member  for Hong Lim roundly condemned the  absence

of  party  democracy in the P.A.P. So when  he  was

expelled,  he  formed  a new party,  whose  name  I

believe is the United People's Party. Sir,  he  has

applied  for  registration  and  we  are  therefore

provided  with  a  copy of his Party  Constitution.

Members   will   be  amazed  to   know   that   the

Constitution of that Party is practically identical

with that of the P.A.P., and that, in so far as the

clauses differ from the P.A.P., it is to strengthen

and  centralise  power in their  Central  Executive

Committee.  So, Mr Speaker. Sir,  let  us  not  be

deceived by all this humbug.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir, Is

it  proper  for a Minister to refer to confidential

communications sent in by a political Party in open

assembly?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order for me.

Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that document is not

confidential.  In  the  course  of   events,   that

document will be available to anyone who presumably

wants to apply for membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to carry on, Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not need

any  lectures on democratic procedures from persons

who  are unable to respect the elementary decencies

and loyalties which are expected of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



gentlemen. It is open to them, if they so violently

disagree  with the way in which party  affairs  are

conducted,  to leave the Party, form a new  one,  a

more  democratic Party, one hopes,  and  avoid  the

example  of  their predecessors. Far from  carrying

out  the  conclusions to which  his  criticisms  of

party organisation would lead, the Member for  Hong

Lim  has,  in  fact, followed in  almost  identical

terms  the structure and organisation of the  Party

which he has condemned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is it necessary for political Parties in

Singapore  to  have  constitutions  which  are   so

severely centralised? The Member for Hong Lim is no

chicken.  He  has been with us for many  years.  He

knows  what  the issues are. He has seen  Pandora's

Box opened and on one occasion he has been stung by

the  bees  that came out of that box. To understand

why  political Parties organised by people who have

gone  through  this phase of Singapore's  political

development  adopt  certain safeguards  within  the

constitution, I therefore say that it is to prevent

their  Party from being captured by forces who  owe

no loyalty to the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the central

theme   developed  in  the  speech  of  the   Prime

Minister.  It is now no longer possible for  us  in

the  P.A.P. to gloss over the differences  between

the Communists and ourselves. There was a time when

we  were  colleagues in the anti-colonial struggle,

and  the ordinary dictates of decency demand of  us

that  we  should give to those who are fighting  as

comrades-in-arms the maximum cover  and  protection

that  we could afford. But now the parting of  ways

has taken place. We owe them no obligation, for  it

is  they  who  took the initiative in forcing  this

break.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to develop the theme which the Prime

Minister has described in his speech, and  that  is

the  analysis  of  events in  the  last  few  weeks

whereby  the  British intervened on  the  political

stage  in Singapore to bring about certain  results

which  they thought would be advantageous to  them.

It  has  been our habit to heap all kinds of  abuse

upon the colonialists. They are represented as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



cruel, oppressive, unjust, inhuman, rapacious,  and

so  on and so forth. But there is one attribute  of

the   British  imperialists  to  which   inadequate

attention had been paid. And this is their  cunning

and  their skill and experience in manipulating men

to their own advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great scheme of theirs which the Prime

Minister had revealed emphasises that we must never

under-estimate  our  adversary,  particularly   his

capacity  for diabolical scheming. The  scheme  has

been  set  on foot only during the last few  months

and shows that it has not only been conceived by  a

master-mind  but  that it has  been  executed  with

consummate skill and precision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to give some details of this plot and

the  way  it  was carried out and its effect  on  a

narrow  sector of the political stage.  I  want  to

describe  in  some detail what has  happened,  when

events  took their course, among a group of  P.A.P.

leaders in the Assembly. More specifically, I  want

to refer to the revolt of the eight Assemblymen led

by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Is he still the Parliamentary

Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask the same question?

Is  the Member for Queenstown still a Parliamentary

Secretary? If he is, he must be referred to as  the

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To the best of my knowledge,

Mr Speaker, Sir, yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me first recapitulate the principal

tactical  lines of the operation which the  British

had  launched. As the Prime Minister said,  one  of

the  main objectives is to encourage the Communists

and  their supporters to break away from the P.A.P.

and attack it both from outside and from within. In

order  to achieve this objective, it is vital  that

the  British should convince the Communists of  two

points, otherwise no action ensues. First, that the

British would convince the Communists that it would

allow   a   pro-Communist  or  even   a   Communist

government to take charge of Singapore provided the

Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



agree  not to disturb their military bases. For  so

long  as  the Communists believe that they  are  in

peril  of  repressive action by the  British,  they

will  continue, as they had done in  the  past,  to

hide behind the P.A.P. They cannot be persuaded  to

destroy  the  P.A.P. unless their fear  of  British

repressive  action is dispelled. The British  must,

therefore, convince the Communists that so  far  as

the British are concerned, the Communists stand  in

no danger of suppression by force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must next convince the Communists that the

plan  for  a greater merger is ready for  immediate

implementation. For the Communists understand  that

with internal security in the hands of Tengku Abdul

Rahman's Government, they stand in great danger  of

suppression by the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Communists are convinced that merger or

super  merger is around the corner, they will  jump

like  prawns in hot water. For their own  survival,

they must take all action to wreck the scheme.  And

to  do so, they must mount an assault on the P.A.P.

to capture it if possible, to destroy it if not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first condition, that is, the British

assurance  that  they  are quite  safe,  therefore,

serves  to  remove any inhibitions  the  Communists

would  have  in  openly attacking  the  P.A.P.  The

second  condition,  that is, expectation  of  early

merger, provides them with the urgent, indeed dire,

necessity to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell the House how admirably the British

had succeeded in convincing the Communists on these

two  points  and how the Communists  in  turn  have

sought to manipulate some of the weaker brethren in

the P.A.P. to open fire on their colleagues even to

the extent of treachery and betrayal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been observing the conduct and opinions

expressed  by  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister for Home Affairs for a very long time.  It

was   clear  to  me  that  for  some  time  he  was

advocating  the policy of a united front  with  the

Communists on their own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



terms,   and  accordingly  I  held  a   number   of

discussions  to  find out what his real  intentions

were   and   whether   he  fully   understood   the

consequences of the policy he was advocating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known the Parliamentary Secretary as a

personal  friend for a great number  of  years.  In

fact,  our  friendship began over the chess  board,

and  he  is  a player of no mean ability.  You  can

judge a man's character by his style of play. Chess

players  are  of  many  kinds.  Some  persons   are

cautious  and calculating by nature, and they  play

the  game to obtain long-term strategic advantages.

Other players are bold and prefer complications and

combinations  on  the  chess  board  to  get  quick

results.  Some  again  are bold  to  the  point  of

recklessness  so that they readily embark  on  what

chess players call speculative moves. These involve

the   taking   of   great  risks   without   proper

calculations  in  the hope of achieving  early  and

spectacular  victory. If the moves  come  off,  the

adversary is soon overwhelmed. If they do not  come

off,  the game is lost with equal rapidity. I  have

never  known  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  lack

courage  in making speculative moves on  the  chess

board. And so it is that this man has initiated, on

the  political chess board, moves which I can  only

describe   as  speculative  in  the  extreme,   the

consequences of which to himself and to the country

he  has  not properly calculated. When you lose  at

chess,  you will replace the pieces and you play  a

new game. But in the affairs of the country, you do

not  replace pieces and play a new game  after  you

have  lost. You are playing not only with your  own

lives but with the lives of other men and women and

their families, and you take the consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now describe what took place in the

discussions between the Parliamentary Secretary and

myself during quite a number of sessions I had with

him. He was extremely depressed after our defeat at

Hong  Lim. He claimed that the Party had completely

lost the confidence of the people. He enumerated  a

long list of errors which we have made and demanded

that they be rectified.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



There  was  no  difficulty in getting agreement  on

these  points. Some of them I conceded to him,  and

with  regard to the others he accepted my point  of

view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on one point we could not agree, and that is

that the Parliamentary Secretary declared that  the

salvation of the P.A.P. lies in full and  open

co-operation  with  the  Communists.  Sir,  I  am  not

mincing my words here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In our discussions that we

had,  we  did not use vague terms such as  "extreme

Left"  or  "Leftist socialists".  We  were  talking

about  the  Communists and both he and I understood

what we meant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I posed to him the question whether he had

understood  the risk involved in such a  course  of

action. I said to him, "If you are a Communist  and

act  as one, you have no cause to regret should any

ill  consequences  befall you. You  understand  the

ideology; you are dedicated to the cause,  and  you

are prepared for the sacrifices. But if you are not

a  Communist  and try to toe their line,  then  you

have  only  yourself to blame if  events  overwhelm

you."  Now, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary is  no

Communist.  He  does not even understand  the  most

elementary  tenets of Marxism-Leninism.  Indeed,  a

great  deal  of  his behaviour and activity  rather

suggest  to me the conduct of a foolish virgin  who

has  entered into a brothel area and proclaimed the

brotherhood of men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he want to embark on this hazardous

course? He wants mass popularity for the Party  and

for himself which he thinks only the Communists can

provide. I repeatedly asked him whether or  not  he

had  calculated  the consequences. Everybody  knows

the  importance of Singapore as a British  military

base.  It  holds a pivotal position in the  defence

system  of the British in South-East Asia. I  asked

him  if  he imagined that the British would refrain

from  using  force to crush any Communist  or

pro-Communist  movement which threatens their security,

as must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



be  the  case. For Communism is a world force,  and

every  local  Communist movement is geared  to  the

world  Communist revolution. These are simple basic

axioms  from  which  any  political  analysis  must

proceed. The Parliamentary Secretary came out  with

a  light-hearted  reply  that,  in  his  view,  the

British  will  not  use  force  on  the  Communists

because he knew the Communists have decided not  to

use  force on the British. In fact, the Communists,

he  said, are not in a position in Singapore to use

armed revolution.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do not twist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> And accordingly they are

prepared  to accept the retention of British  bases

on  the island and there is therefore no reason for

the  British to suppress them. Sir, I have spent  a

long  time  with  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to

convince him of the error of his assumption. But  I

could  not move him from that position. It is clear

that   the   British  had  attained   their   first

objective.  They had convinced the Communists  that

it  is safe for them to proceed, and the Communists

in  turn have convinced the Parliamentary Secretary

that  no ill consequences would follow his throwing

in his lot with them. On the contrary, he would get

the advantage of mass popularity and the support of

their  mass organisations in Singapore. And in  the

end, Sir, a delectable prize to win - the Premiership

of  Singapore! Thus it was that the Communists have

secured   an  important  foothold  in  the   P.A.P.

leadership from which they could attack  the  Party

from  within.  This, it should be  noted,  Sir,  is

entirely  in  accordance  with  British  plans  and

expectations - the destruction of the P.A.P. by  the

Communists  in the first phase so as to leave  them

unencumbered  freedom of action to  deal  with  the

Communists in the final round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element of the British move to lure the

Communists into open conflict with the P.A.P. is to

convince them of the imminence of super merger. The

Prime Minister has described the various open moves

which  the  British had made to  bring  about  this

state of mind among the Communist open



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



leadership - visits   of   High   Commissioners   and

generals, trips to London by the noble Lord and  so

on.  I  now want to discuss the effects on some  of

the  P.A.P. members once the Communists themselves

have  been  brought into this state of  mind.  Many

members,  some  in  high  positions  in  the  Party

hierarchy,  continually call upon the Ministers  to

take  them  into  their confidence and  reveal  the

details  of this super merger. Indeed at this  very

meeting  of  the Assembly, Members have heard  from

another Parliamentary Secretary the appeal for  the

revelation  of  details of this  great  scheme.  So

convinced  were they that some evil plot  has  been

hatched to fix the Communists that they never fully

believed our reply that we do not know the details,

for  the simple reason that a super merger  was  no

more  than  a  general  proposition  put  forth  by

political  leaders  in various  countries  in  this

area. The stage has not even been reached where the

Governments  concerned have even begun  preliminary

discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the British in deceiving the

Communists has now been complete. But how did  they

pull  off  this spectacular psychological coup?  We

know  the  broad  outlines. We  know  some  of  the

details,   the  goings-on  between  the   Communist

supporters   and   sympathisers   and   the    U.K.

Commission.   The  lunches,  dinners  and   private

discussions  and cocktail parties which  they  had.

For  the  British to have pulled off  this

master-stroke,  which  can  only be  done  through  hints,

suggestions  and  innuendoes, certain  arrangements

are necessary for success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing events in the recent past, and piecing

together  the  information that we have  about  the

discussions  between the lion and the  bear,  I  am

irresistibly drawn to certain conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Ching Siong, in a Press statement yesterday, warned his followers against agents

provocateurs who, he alleged, had been  planted  by

the wicked P.A.P. Government to create disturbances

in  the  trade unions. This allegation is as stupid

as it is unfounded. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



that  is  not the point. The point I am  making  is

that  Mr  Lim Ching Siong should, at the beginning

of  this whole exercise, have taken heed of his own

warning   himself   and   guard   against    agents

provocateurs  whom the British had planted  in  his

midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole exercise of convincing the Communists of

these  two  fundamental  points - first,  that  they

could  operate  with safety even to the  extent  of

forming  their  own government,  and  second,  that

super merger is around the corner - has been achieved

in the course of a few brief months. To bring about

the  desired state of mind among the top  Communist

leaders,  it is essential to the British that  they

should  be able to use, for their purposes, men  in

whom  the  Communists have reposed  confidence  and

upon  whom  they  rely  to give  an  evaluation  of

British  intentions. The top decision-makers  among

the  Communists  are  all  Chinese  educated.  They

cannot be fully sure of their own interpretation of

what the British say or do, and they must therefore

seek  the  opinion  and advice of  those  who  know

British  minds better. Mr Lim Ching  Siong  should

now  review the interpretations which his

English-educated  comrades  have made  to  him  on  British

policy  as expounded in their discussions with  the

British.  He  will then find a pattern emerging  of

how  he  was  slowly  but  surely  brought  to  the

position  where  he  fell for  the  lure  that  was

offered and was finally played for the sucker. From

this pattern, he can draw his own conclusions. None

of us want traitors in our midst, and no traitor is

more  reprehensible  than one  who  works  for  the

imperialists. They have done the Communists a great

deal of harm. They have also inflicted injuries  on

the P.A.P. We, the P.A.P., and the Communists, have

a common interest in their eradication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me wind up with a few

remarks  about  the performers in the  great  drama

that  is  unfolding itself before our eyes.  First,

there  are the men who decide the course of events.

These  are  the men who understand the  reality  of

power  as  distinct  from  the  illusion  and   the

sensation  of  power.  They are  the  British,  the

Communists and ourselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



in  the  P.A.P. who  are  responsible  for  making

ultimate  decisions.  All  these  three  understand

that, as the famous dictum of Mao Tse-tung puts it,

"power comes out of the barrel of the gun".

Mao Tse-tung  went  on  further  to  say  that  every  good

Communist  must understand this basic  proposition.

Unfortunately for the Communists in Singapore, they

suffered  a  temporary  lapse  during  which   they

overlooked  Mao's advice and allowed themselves  to

be beguiled by those who held the gun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the principal actors. Then, among the

supporting cast, you find a variety of types.  This

is  a curious thing in Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir.

When  great and momentous events are taking  place,

for  no  rhyme  or  reason, clowns  appear  on  the

political  stage, to the merriment and exhilaration

of  all  around,  only to confuse the  picture  and

prevent  the  proper clarification of  events.  But

there  are  earnest  and  sincere  people  in  this

supporting cast who lack experience and breadth and

depth of knowledge. As a result, some of them  have

allowed  themselves to stray away from the path  of

rectitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again there are those who are less honest

and  sincere. They are driven by ambition and  lust

for  power  which  regrettably is  not  matched  by

sagacity of judgment. Whatever else happens in  the

future,  these are the persons that must meet  with

disaster because they are unable themselves to  see

the  pitfalls and traps that lie ahead and they are

unwilling  to accept the advice of wiser  and  more

experienced  men. Sir, the last act of  this  drama

has yet to be played. For our part, we can say that

our  minds  have  penetrated  beyond  external  and

superficial  manifestations into the roots  of  the

power  situation.  We  have  accordingly  made  our

preparations  for  each and every eventuality  that

may arise.



<br><br>6.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, I wonder very much why a Government  which

has  39  seats  can  ask the  Assembly  to  give  a

confidence  vote to it. The fact  that  it  has  39

seats  very clearly tells the Government  that  its

vote  of  confidence rests with these 39 seats.  It

also rests with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



51  branches of the P.A.P. Why does the  Government

not  want to seek confidence from the Party and the

Assemblymen   instead  of  seeking  it   from   the

Opposition? Does it mean that the Opposition's vote

can be more trusted? Whether there is confidence or

not,  it  is  a matter to be considered within  the

Party.  Treating  the Party's internal  affairs  as

political  issues in the Assembly  may  perhaps  be

permissible, but then the consequences will be very

miserable and deplorable. Intra-party disputes must

be  dealt with by Party members. In this particular

case,  the dispute arose because there was lack  of

democracy  in the Party and because the  leadership

had  deviated from the correct path. There  was  no

democracy.  Because of this, the eight  Assemblymen

on  the  Government  side and the  three  Political

Secretaries wanted to rectify the wrong path  taken

by  the  Party leadership. The intra-party struggle

is  a  very simple and common affair, but the Party

leadership have disregarded our request. They  have

divided  us and accused us of being Communists  and

that  they must necessarily be democratic Leftists.

I   regard  this  accusation  as  an  act  of   the

colonialists or their agents. It is not  surprising

that  they  have adopted this tactic of  slandering

us.  But the most surprising thing is that the

so-called  democratic people can resort to reactionary

activities.  They have always tried to treat  those

who disagree with them as questionable people. This

attitude  of  not  willing or  refusing  to  accept

criticism will not be good for the political future

of  the  people concerned. It will not realise  the

long-term  objectives of the Party. The  defeat  of

the  Party  in  the Hong Lim and Anson by-elections

was  blamed on the extreme Left-wing elements, but,

in  fact,  this  was  due to the  Party  leadership

having  deviated  from the correct political  path.

They want to confuse the vision of the people. They

want  to come to terms with the Right-wing and

pro-colonial elements. This action has to be contained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the correspondence exchanged between the Prime

Minister  and the Deputy Prime Minister,  there  is

mention  of  the Prime Minister wanting to  resign.

Three  points were mentioned in the correspondence.

One point was that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



Government will have to take some unpleasant action

in  the  interest of the people. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

there should be pleasant action for the majority of

the  people.  How can it not be so? The  unpleasant

action  is  to be carried out for the sake  of  the

colonialists.  The correspondence goes  on  to  say

that  the  three  Political Secretaries  and  eight

Assemblymen  are  guilty  of  open  rebellion   and

treachery. I do not exactly know what is  meant  by

"treachery".  Is it treachery to ask the  Party  to

rectify the wrong path taken? Can this be construed

as  treachery? In the Prime Minister's  letter,  he

says   that   he  always  believes  in   collective

leadership. We have taken part in affairs  relating

to   government  and  we  have  also  had  business

dealings with the Party. In the course of all this,

I  have never witnessed this collective leadership.

I have only heard of it.



<br><br>7.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday morning I received your

letter pointing out that it had been represented to

you  by  the  Leader of the House that  the  public

interest  required  that the  Assembly  should  sit

today. At the same time, I received short notice by

the  Prime  Minister about the motion,  "That  this

House  expresses its confidence in the Government."

The  Assembly  was adjourned only  one  day  before

Anson Polling Day. That sitting was supposed to  be

the  last sitting of the Session. Today the Chinese

Press  printed  news of this special  sitting.  The

convening  of  this  special  sitting  today   will

stimulate the minds of those who are concerned with

politics.  To  those who are more  sensitive,  this

will appear like an impending thunderstorm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much puzzled at this

motion.  I do not understand its purpose,  for  the

Party in power still has 39 seats. Our position  in

the  Assembly is very secure indeed and  cannot  be

shakened by the Opposition. Could it be because the

Four-Party   Alliance  candidate  has   asked   our

Ministers to resign? Or could it be due to the fact

that the Member for Anson has challenged us? If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



answer is yes to each of these two questions,  then

there is no necessity to introduce this motion here

or   to  ask  Opposition  Members  to  state  their

confidence in the Government. This is an impossible

situation.  It  is  clear that the  39  Assemblymen

sitting  on this side of the House can outvote  the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true picture is very clear. The introduction

of  this  motion  is really because of  intra-party

disputes.  Our conflicts should be resolved  within

the  Party  instead of raising this motion  in  the

Assembly,  which is inappropriate and a mistake.  I

earnestly  ask the Prime Minister to  withdraw  his

motion  and let the issue be decided by the highest

authorities of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in raising the motion, the Prime

Minister   gave   an  analysis  of  the   political

situation  in Singapore and asked the  Assembly  to

express  its confidence in the Government. But  now

let us think coolly and objectively about the whole

situation.   Its  causes  and  results.   This   is

necessary  and correct. If in our hurry  to  tackle

the problem we are not able to find the core of the

problem, then this will be a mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party was

founded  in  1954  on the basis of anti-colonialism

through  constitutional struggle  so  as  to  bring

about  a  united  and  socialist  Malaya.  Tens  of

thousands  of  members and  I  took  part  in  this

struggle.  After many crises, we won  43  seats  in

this  Assembly  with the support of the  people  of

Singapore,  and  we  were able to  form  the  first

internal  self-governing  State.  This  unsurpassed

victory was the product of a struggle lasting  five

years.  Unfortunately, dissensions and provocations

among comrades in the Party led to the expulsion of

the former Minister for National Development. As  a

result  of  the  Anson  by-election,  the  People's

Action  Party  has  now  only  39  seats  in   this

Assembly.  As a loyal member of the Party,  I  have

seen  the Party's prestige drop in the eyes of  the

people  and its political objectives becoming  more

and  more vague. Therefore, I think we should  have

the  right to air our views constructively.  It  is

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



duty  to  criticise  and engage in  self-criticism.

Being   a   socialist  political  Party  based   on

collective   leadership,  it  is   necessary   that

questions  in principle are submitted to  a  bigger

organisation  for  discussion and  decision.  Eight

Assemblymen  wrote  to the Party Central  Executive

Committee  asking  the  leadership  to  convene   a

meeting  of  the 51 P.A.P. Branches to discuss  the

problems  facing the socialist movement in  Malaya,

especially  the Greater Malaysia scheme  propounded

by  the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya,

Tunku  Abdul Rahman. This proposal for a merger  is

now  bigger  in  scope than the one sought  by  the

People's  Action Party. In principle,  this  scheme

merits    our   support   and   discussion.    But,

unfortunately, this scheme was made public  by  Mr

Devan  Nair  on  behalf  of the  Central  Executive

Committee.  This is heart-breaking and  unpleasant.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, two days before the  letter  was

published,  the  results of the  Anson  by-election

were  announced,  and  our  People's  Action  Party

candidate,  comrade Awang, lost to Mr Marshall  by

500-odd votes. That is the important reason why the

Government have introduced a motion seeking a  vote

of confidence in the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have read from the

newspapers yesterday of a letter from the

Secretary-General of the P.A.P. to the Party's Chairman,  and

his  reply. This highly exciting and dramatic  news

stunned the whole political arena in Singapore. The

last  paragraph  of the letter from the

Secretary-General reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am quite prepared to assume leadership of the

government  on behalf of the party provided  it  is

the  clear wish of the party executive and  of  the

Assemblymen  who  will  have  to  follow  us   into

battle.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Party's

Chairman  for his act of convening a special  Party

meeting  for Assemblymen, but the eight Assemblymen

were not invited to that meeting. After a report by

the  Chairman, the Assemblymen were asked  to  give

their opinions. At the same time, he requested  all

the  Assemblymen to sign a letter  to  the  Central

Executive Committee. The result of the dispute  was

that five Assemblymen, including myself, refused



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



to  sign  the letter. At that time we said that  we

would   submit  our  memorandum  to   the   Central

Executive  Committee to clarify our views.  Had  we

signed   that  letter,  it  would  not  have   been

necessary for us to meet here today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why we did not sign

that  letter  was  that we take  objection  to  the

analysis  contained in the letter of the

Secretary-General.  We  are not manipulated or influenced  by

anybody. What we are concerned with are the Party's

fundamental principles and its long-term objectives

and   their  gradual  implementation.  We  are  not

interested in personal fame, status and wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not wish to be

revolutionary  heroes, nor do we  wish  to  be  the

nation's enemies. We only wish to be loyal  members

of  the  People's  Action  Party.  We  want  to  be

ordinary persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the democratic system means

the  invention  of  all  sorts  of  adjectives   to

describe all those who do not agree, then this will

not  be  convincing to us. If the one man one  vote

system is used to bring intra-party matters to  the

Assembly, then the result is not conceivable. Here,

I  honestly  and sincerely hope the Prime  Minister

will withdraw his motion.



<br><br>7.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

I  said  during  the debate on the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech  in August 1960, when  blank  fall

out,  honest men will come into their own.  I  have

not  used  the word "rogues" because  I  know  that

honourable  men are not rogues. They are honourable

men  who  have  been  elected  by  the  people   of

Singapore to look after the destinies of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June 1959 when the P.A.P. scored,

according  to them, a very overwhelming victory  of

43 seats in an Assembly of 51, although they polled

only 54 per cent of the total votes cast, they came

to  the  Assembly dressed in pure white and claimed

that  they  who  came in pure white  were  a  good,

clean,  honest Government. Today they are no longer

in pure white. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



know. After two years of it there must have been  a

lot  of  stain that has stuck, so much so  that  we

find   even  Parliamentary  Secretaries   who   are

"Assistant Ministers" in the Cabinet coming out now

in  this Assembly telling the Prime Minister  where

he was wrong, calling him names which we called him

for  the  last two years - that the P.A.P. Government

was  nothing but a dictatorial Government, that the

P.A.P. leaders were nothing but arrogant  leaders.

These  charges were denied from that  side  of  the

House. But today, Sir, from the mouths of their own

Parliamentary  Secretaries,  they  say  that  their

leaders  are arrogant. They say that their  leaders

are  dictatorial.  This  is  indeed,  Sir,  a  very

pathetic day for the leadership of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they lost the Anson by-election, it was

left   to   the  defeated  P.A.P. candidate,   the

President of the T.U.C., to say, "That's all right.

It  was  not a bad defeat. We only lost by a  small

majority.  We  are not worried. We will  remain  in

office."  That  was  Sunday. On Monday,  the  Prime

Minister said, "We carry on." On Tuesday, the Prime

Minister's side of the T.U.C. said that  the  other

side  of  the T.U.C. which was not with  the  Prime

Minister  is  all wrong and is trying to  stab  the

P.A.P. leadership in the back. And on Wednesday  we

are  treated  to  the sight of the  Prime  Minister

exchanging letters with the Deputy Prime  Minister,

giving  full publicity to "Dear comrade"  here  and

"Dear comrade" there. So we thought that everything

was all right. It would appear that they wanted  to

carry on. All right, if they want to carry on,  let

them  carry on. We were waiting for the  time  when

the  Leader  of  the House would  inform  you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, of the next sitting of this Assembly.

Suddenly  we had to rely on that P.A.P.  Government

political  propaganda machine, Radio Singapore,  to

say  that  the  Prime  Minister  had  tendered  his

resignation   and   that  the   Central   Executive

Committee  of the P.A.P. had told him to  carry  on

- "Don't  worry. You've done a good job." And  later

on in the evening we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



were  told  that there was going to  be  a  special

sitting  of  this  House in the  interests  of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today, after having listened to the Prime

Minister when he moved the motion standing  in  his

name,  I  must say that we see nothing of  such  an

urgent  character  that  this  Assembly  should  be

summoned  at  such short notice, thereby  depriving

the   Opposition  of  the  time  needed  to  submit

questions and motions that we have in mind and plan

to  do as soon as this Assembly is called for a new

sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is typical of the Prime Minister to spend

about  one hour and twenty-two minutes, if  I  have

got  it right, telling us sweet nothing, concocting

a  story  that  there  is  a  British  lion  and  a

Communist bear, and saying. "Watch it, boys!  These

two  are  plotting against the P.A.P. and  if  the

P.A.P. were  to fall into the trap,  then  goodbye

Singapore!  The  P.A.P. is  the  only  saviour  of

Singapore."  Is it necessary for them  to  cook  up

such  a  story?  Sir, we have  been  alive  to  the

situation, and even Members on the other side  must

have  been  going round with their  eyes  and  ears

open;  and  wherever  we  went  and  if  it  was  a

Britisher  we  met, he would tell us, "Please,  Lee

Kuan  Yew  deserves  every help."  And  even  today

before  we  came, we were told that it would  be  a

good  thing if we could support the great Lee  Kuan

Yew.  And  then  we had the British  lion  and  the

Communist  bear.  Perhaps,  Sir,  the  great  Prime

Minister  has adopted the practice of his Communist

comrades whereby it is better for someone to  start

a smear campaign and say. "Now, even the Communists

are becoming colonial stooges and therefore we will

have  delivered the first blow. The Communists  are

now  becoming colonial stooges. We, the P.A.P., are

anti-colonialists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have learned quite a lot during the two

years they have been associating with what they now

term  the Communist Left. In August last year  when

the  Prime Minister moved a motion on the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's speech, he gave us, for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



first  time,  an  indication  of  the  buildup   of

Communist forces in Singapore. He said that for the

past  14  months - that was in August 1960 - Communist

forces  had  been  building up in the  trade  union

field.  He  tried  to frighten  the  Opposition  by

saying  that unless we behaved or unless we  worked

with   the  P.A.P.,  that  would  be  the  end   of

Singapore.  But it was significant,  Sir,  that  he

denied what I said to him at that time, that  there

were Communist sympathisers, activists or what have

you  in  the P.A.P. He stood up and denied  it.  He

said,  "There  is  no  such  thing.  There  are  no

Communist sympathisers and activists in the P.A.P."

And  today there is this secret document  which  he

has  found it necessary to release saying that  Lim

Ching  Siong  is a Communist-front man!  Sir,  they

always say what they mean, and they mean what  they

say. Perhaps in this particular instance, what they

meant  to say was not what they said to mean.  Sir,

they  put  it  to  us whether we wanted  a  general

election. We can say to them, we will meet them any

time, anywhere. The people of Singapore are fed  up

with their mishandling. For the past two years they

have  brought nothing but misery to the  people  of

Singapore.  Unemployment has increased to  such  an

extent that it is almost impossible of solution. On

the  one  hand,  they have a Minister  for  Finance

saying that we must have industrialisation. We must

have  a  development  plan  and  try  our  best  to

encourage the inflow of foreign capital. But on the

other hand, there is another Minister who says,  "I

will  use the P.P.S.O. on you if you do not behave.

I  will see to it that your entry visas will not be

extended if you do not behave." That is the kind of

government  we have been having for  the  past  two

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really do not know what they are asking us

to  vote on. If it is a vote of confidence on  what

they  have done about their policies for  the  past

two  years,  I  can say to them,  in  no  uncertain

terms,   that   we  have  no  confidence   in   the

Government.  If it is to tell us, "Boys,  there  is

this  Communist threat coming, but  you  know  that

unless we have your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



confidence  we  are  not going to  look  after  the

interest  of  Singapore,"  then  say  it  in  plain

language.  Do  not  use language  that  we  do  not

understand. Is the Government prepared to carry  on

to meet the threat if there is this threat, to look

after  the interest of Singapore, to do acts  which

may  be  unpalatable,  which may  be  described  as

undemocratic but doing them as a Government in  the

interest  of  the people of Singapore, above  party

politics,  above  everything,  guided  by  the  one

desire to serve as they have been elected to serve?

If  we  heard aright, the Prime Minister said,  "As

soon  as  there  is  this  trouble  coming  up,  we

abdicate."  Sir, what is the use of  our  giving  a

vote  of confidence to a Government which is  going

to abdicate immediately there is trouble, and which

is bringing all this trouble? I said in August 1960

that  if they were sincere in their desire to  look

after the interest of the people of Singapore, then

they should not try to play double politics. To the

Communists, they say one thing; to the British they

say  another. They denied that there had been  such

things.  But  now  it is openly admitted  that  Lim

Ching  Siong and his crowd belong to the  Communist

Left.  And  these Communist Left people  have  been

told  many a time by the leadership of the  P.A.P.,

"Boys,  if  you  behave, we  might  see  that  your

detainees, your comrades, are released. But if  you

do  not  behave, we cannot do it.  If  you  do  not

behave, Jamit Singh and company and even I think T.

T.  Rajah will not be given their citizenship.  But

if  you behave, we will do it." To the British they

say,  "Do  not worry. We are not going  to  release

these  people, you know. But allow us  to  use  the

Internal Security Council as a front." That is  the

kind of double talk they have been making. That  is

the  thing  that  accounted  for  Lim  Ching  Siong

standing  up  on  the  platform  and  accusing  the

Federation  Prime  Minister. The  Federation  Prime

Minister  - the  Government  of  the  Federation  of

Malaya - with  a decisive vote in internal  security,

for  the continued detention of the detainees. Sir,

they claimed they were a responsible Government. It

they  were  a  responsible  Government,  then  they

should  accept  full  responsibility  for  internal

security. Why is it when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



they are pressed today we are told that another  18

would  be released? Just in order to show  that  if

they  really wanted to do it, they could have  done

it.  Now  they know that when they cannot have  any

more  cover,  they say they will  do  it  within  a

period  of time. But before doing that, they cooked

up  a  story of the British lion and the  Communist

bear.  I do not know how they cooked up that story.

Perhaps  the Prime Minister, ever since the trouble

he  had  last year with his ex-colleague,  the

ex-Minister for National Development, the ex-Mayor  of

the  City Council, was a little upset. Every little

bit   that  he  did  after  that  trouble   was   a

miscalculation. They lost in Hong  Lim.  They  said

they  were going to resign. They would not  resign.

They  said  they were going to resign if they  lost

Anson. They were asking for our vote of confidence.

Sir, even before Nomination Day on June the 9th.  I

think  an hon. Back-bencher of the Government,  the

hon. Member for Telok Blangah, addressed the Kerala

Association  and  said, as a Back-bencher,  "If  we

lose in Anson, the Government will resign." A

Back-bencher speaking on behalf of the Government! There

was  no contradiction. The Government did not issue

any  statement  to contradict that. The  Government

allowed  it to go through. The Government  lost  in

Anson   and  it  is  now  asking  for  a  vote   of

confidence.  And it was a Back-bencher,  their  own

Parliamentary Secretary, who said today  that  this

vote  of  confidence is nothing but party politics.

And  we are asked to come here to help them out  of

their  difficulty inside the Party. Why should  we?

If  that is the intention, we can say this to  them

here, we are going to vote against the motion.  But

if it is the intention of the Government to ask for

a  vote of confidence to strengthen their stand  in

order  to  discharge their duty to  the  people  of

Singapore  in  so far as security and  welfare  are

concerned,  then  we will give them  that  vote  of

confidence. But they must assure us in no uncertain

terms  that that is the intention. If there is  any

other intention, then the vote is no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They now find that the three Political Secretaries

stabbed them in the back. But in August 1960 1 told

them - I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



like  to  quote  because it is rather  long - I  told

them: "I call upon them that if they really want to

meet  the  threat which the Prime Minister  himself

has stated in no uncertain terms, they must be firm

and  get rid of the Political Secretaries whom they

have  found  to  be disloyal." The  Prime  Minister

laughed  at  me.  He used language which  could  be

boiled  down  to  mean,  "You  are  teaching   your

grandmother  to suck eggs." And then  I  told  them

that  if  they  wanted to continue  and  meet  this

threat  and  get the support of each and  everyone,

not  only in the Assembly but in the country,  they

must  forget their arrogance. Learn to  be  humble,

because  there  is  greatness in  humility  and  no

greatness  in  greatness  itself.  He  laughed.  He

jeered.  Today  they come for a  vote,  asking  the

Opposition  to  vote with them.  Even  their

Back-benchers  say  it is laughable for the  Government,

with 39 seats, having to call on the assistance  of

the  Opposition to see that they remain  in  power.

They  say that these Political Secretaries  stabbed

them in the back. But they have not told us whether

these Political Secretaries have been sacked.  They

are  still being paid. Until they have been sacked,

they  are  still being paid $1,100 a month  out  of

public  funds.  And  yet they are  a  good,  clean,

honest  government, making use of public  funds  to

pay traitors, according to them. Is it right? Is it

good, clean, honest that they should keep on paying

$1,100  a  month  to  each of the  three  Political

Secretaries  whom  they  now  describe  as   having

stabbed  them in the back? Of course, there  are  a

lot  of  other things that have been going on.  Now

since  it  is  clear  from  the  speeches  of   the

Government  Back-benchers that this vote  that  the

Prime  Minister is moving is nothing but an attempt

by the Government to get the Opposition involved in

their  party  politics, I  do  not  think  we  need

prolong this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something to which I must reply. Sir.

The hon. Member for Anson who has been away for the

past  five  years has come back to us. I extend  to

him  a very warm welcome. But it would appear, Sir,

that he comes back to us still with a fixation that

we   let  Singapore  down.  Still  criticising  the

Constitution, saying how bad it was. It would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



have been better if he had got it. There had been a

very lengthy debate at that time, Sir, I would  not

like  to waste the time of this Assembly, but I  do

say   this,  and  I  repeat  it.  That   what   was

brought back from London was just accepting what he

had accepted, and succeeding where he had failed in

getting a Malayan-born representative of the Queen,

in  getting  a  representative  of  the  Federation

Government to participate in this Internal Security

Council. There was another thing he had in mind. He

was  prepared  to  accept a  Defence  and  Security

Council under the Constitution offered to him  with

the  British  as  Chairman, and  this  Defence  and

Security Council would have a right to regulate the

internal   security  of  Singapore  by

Orders-in-Council.  Let  me not fall into the  habit  of  the

Member for Anson who would, on every occasion, like

to  say everything he can about me. So let us leave

it   at   that.  Let  us  not  see  an   Opposition

quarrelling with the Opposition when the government

of  the day is just waiting for a decision from the

Opposition  whether  they should  continue  or  not

continue  in  office. We say this in  no  uncertain

terms. That if it is a vote for them to take action

against their own Party members, then it is nothing

but  party  politics, and we will vote against  it.

But  if it is for the security of the country,  the

Prime Minister will have to stand up and show us in

no  uncertain terms that that is what he intends to

do - that he intends to serve the people and  to  run

the  Government in the best interest of the  people

of  Singapore, irrespective of any action which  he

may  be forced to take against his comrades and

ex-comrades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point that was brought up in the

debate  just now, Sir, that Lim Ching Siong  was  a

great  man and that it was a very cruel act on  the

part  of  the previous Government to have  arrested

him.  Let me remind this House that Lim Ching Siong

was  arrested on the premises of the Singapore Shop

and  Factory Workers Union which was the centre  of

the  riot  disturbance. There  were  knives,  brass

bars,  iron  bars,  wooden bars, acid  bottles  and

Communist literature, the full plan of campaign  of

how to overthrow the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



there. If that kind of activity is going to qualify

a  person as a great hero, all I can say is I  feel

sorry for those people who have such ideas of  such

people.



<br><br>7.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  now  we can see  from  our  friends

opposite that they are playing a lot of tricks  and

games here. We can see what kind of games they  are

playing.  We  can  see they have  done  some  dirty

things to the people in the past-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

be very careful of the expression he is using. I do

not  know whether he is being translated correctly,

but  he  accuses, I think, the Member for Cairnhill

and  hon.  Members opposite of doing dirty  things.

That, in my view, is unparliamentary and should not

be said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  sorry. The Party of the Member opposite is said

to be a "rojak party". He claimed his Party to be a

Leftist  Party.  At that time the people  supported

him  to  become the first government.  He  used  to

pretend  to  be progressive and then  arrested  the

unionists. When he saw our motion here he was  very

glad  to  stand up and say that if this motion  was

for  the security of the people of Singapore,  then

he would vote for it. Mr Speaker, here I will take

part   in  discussing  this  matter.  It  is   very

regretful for me to say this - the Government has  39

Members and the Opposition has only 12 Members.  So

with  12 Members how can they vote against  the  39

Members?  How can they compete with us 39  Members?

It  is  unwise  for  them to do so.  Therefore,  by

moving  this  motion, our Prime  Minister  is  very

childish and puerile. It would be better for us  to

take  this  motion to the 51 Branches of the  Party

and  also  to  the Central Executive Committee  and

also  the  paid officials of the Party in order  to

discuss  it.  We can discuss the wrong attitude  of

the  leadership.  Our Party prestige  and  position

will then be restored. Then we can pursue our

anti-colonialist struggle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  eight  Assemblymen  have

jointly  written  a letter to the  Party  Executive

Committee  asking them to convene a  joint  session

between the Central Executive Committee and the  51

Branches. In their reply, they said this  could  be

done  later  on.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Party

leadership  sent one of their agents to the  forum.

From  this,  it  can be proved  that  there  is  no

democracy  in  the  Party. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

motion  introduced  by the Prime Minister  concerns

intra-party  affairs.  On  14th  July,  the   eight

Assemblymen published their letter to the  Chairman

in  the newspapers. We clearly pointed out the lack

of  democracy  and  the anti-people  trend  in  the

Party.  In  the  Hong  Lim  by-election  our  Party

suffered a great loss. This clearly shows that  the

policy  adopted  by the leadership is  against  the

interests of the people. The present leadership  in

the  Party  cannot  reflect the  interests  of  the

people.  Now,  all  the  people  of  Singapore  are

dissatisfied with the P.A.P. and Party members have

also   lost  confidence  in  the  leadership.   The

leadership has no courage to face the questions put

by  the  members  who hope that the  "rojak  party"

opposite-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope I did hear rightly, but

I  think  the  hon. Member has been  translated  as

saying that the Party opposite was a "rojak party".

Although I myself like rojak quite a lot, I do feel

it might be considered offensive to call a Party  a

"rojak party".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I used the words

"rojak  party"  figuratively.  It  means  a   party

composed of divergent views with so many elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we read recently from the

newspapers that the views put forward by our  Party

leadership  do not differ much from the  views  put

forward by the former pro-colonial Government.  Our

leaders always like to give a red cap to anyone who

does  not agree with the Party leadership, the

so-called  "pro-Communist Left-wing" and other  terms.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, why do some of the  Assemblymen

rebel against the leadership? A group of heroes  in

the past were detained by the colonial Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



because  of their struggle for freedom.  This

group of anti-colonialist fighters suffered a  lot.

It is because of their sacrifices that we were able

to  enter this Assembly as a governing Party. It is

because of their sacrifices and the blood they shed

that we were able to come into this Assembly. As an

anti-colonialist,  I  do  not  wish  to   use   the

gentlemen   opposite  to  discuss  our  intra-party

matters.  We hope our Prime Minister will  withdraw

his  motion and submit this dispute to a conference

of  the  Central  Executive Committee  and  the  51

Branches and go on with our struggle for freedom to

implement our long-term objectives.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether there

are  very  many more speakers. It is  nearly  eight

o'clock.  Can I have an indication as to  how  many

more are going to speak?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hon. Members indicated their intention to

speak.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I propose to suspend

for  one  hour. I will take this Chair again  at  9

p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>9.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise to speak on the  motion.  My

opinion  is  the  same as that  expressed  by  some

members in the Party. Though the opinion may be the

same,  I  think it is better to repeat  it  because

this  is  not an unimportant thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would

like to refer to what the Member for Cairnhill  has

said.  I  think  a  Member of  integrity  would  be

ashamed to hear it. In the old days if we had heard

these  things said by him, he would have been faced

with  a  counterattack. But  his  position  now  is

entirely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



different. The situation today is that the minority

leadership in the Party has introduced this motion.

I  have nothing much to say except that we are very

disheartened at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I really feel very uncomfortable

and  I  do not understand. The Government is  in  a

quandary,  surrounded  on  and  attacked  from  all

sides.  This situation should not have arisen.  The

introduction of the motion of the Prime Minister is

a  wrong move, judging it from any angle. It should

have been thrashed out in the Party itself. It  has

not received the support of the Party at all. If it

had  been agreed to by all the Party members,  then

only  would it have been right to introduce it into

the  Assembly. But, in fact, the Prime Minister did

not  seek any discussion on this motion. Therefore,

the   introduction  of  this  motion   is   clearly

something  which  has  been  manipulated   by   the

minority leadership. This is improper. The division

in the ranks of our Party shows that the leadership

was lacking in democracy for not having convened  a

meeting of the 51 P.A.P. Branches to discuss  party

problems  and matters. The leadership did not  dare

to  accede  to  the request of the members  of  the

Party,  but they saw fit to introduce party  issues

into the Assembly. This kind of political tactic is

adopted  in order to confuse the people.  Everybody

clearly  knows that our Party has 39 seats  in  the

Assembly  and there has never been an occasion  for

any  Member  on this side or on that  side  of  the

House   to  criticise  this  fact.  Why  does   the

leadership  try to introduce a motion of confidence

in  the  Government? This shows that they  have  no

trust in us. They are afraid to discuss this matter

in the Party itself, perhaps because they fear that

they  might not get the support of their  comrades.

But then without this support, they should not have

introduced this motion here. They want us to follow

them blindly. Therefore, they have resorted to  the

use  of  this  Assembly in order to  achieve  their

objective. I think that any recourse to the use  of

the Assembly as a means of carrying out any measure

detrimental  to  the  people will  be  against  the

conscience of the Government. I believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



that   the  people  of  Singapore,  who  are   very

politically  conscious, will not be  confused  over

this issue and that they will stand up to claim the

fruits which they have obtained after so many years

of struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dispute is an intra-party issue, whether the

P.A.P. is  going  to follow the people's  line  in

continuing  the anti-colonial struggle.  It  is  an

issue  concerning a basic political principle.  The

P.A.P. has to face this political reality in  order

to  win the trust and confidence of the whole Party

and  the people. It is not right and proper to take

a  strong line to suppress the democratic rights of

the people by resorting to the introduction of this

motion  here to get a confidence vote  on  it.  The

leadership should have got the issue settled in the

Party  itself. We joined the P.A.P. and our efforts

have helped to build it up. Without our support and

our  efforts, the Party could not have become  what

it  is  today.  But now the minority leadership  is

controlling  the Party in every way.  This  is  the

real crisis in the Party. Let history prove who are

treacherous to the Party.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must draw the

attention  of hon. Members - especially the  Members

on  the  Back-benches  on  the  Government  side-to

Standing Order No. 54 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention to the conduct of a Member, who  persists

in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his

own  arguments  or of the arguments used  by  other

Members  in  debate, may direct him to  discontinue

his speech.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there has been some repetition which is

becoming tedious. Perhaps Members on the Government

Back-benches  who  wish to  speak  will  bear  that

Standing Order in mind.



<br><br>9.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

am  an old man. Until now I thought the end of  the

world  would come sooner for me than or some of  my

young colleagues. I think the end of the world will

come sooner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



for  them  than  for me. By trying to  destroy  the

Party  which  has so far supported them,  they  are

trying   to  destroy  themselves.  They   have   no

following  of  their own. They think the  Party  is

going  down.  So  they allow themselves  to  become

prisoners  of anti-P.A.P. forces led by  Lim  Ching

Siong and his friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Member for Anson, who thinks he is free,

is  in  fact  a  prisoner of the  same  anti-P.A.P.

forces.  Today I heard him in this House  defending

Lim  Ching Siong, Fong Swee Suan and their friends.

These  were the same people whom he once  condemned

in the same House as dangerous subversives. I am an

old  man - I  say  this again - and  I  am  sorry  that

everything appears upside down. I am sure it is not

due  to  my  eyesight. It is due to the treacherous

activities of Lim Ching Siong and his friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the leadership of the P.A.P. and

the  Prime  Minister's motion. Let the  House  have

confidence in us. If not, let us all get  ready  to

go to our graves. I am an old man - I say once again - and I am ready for my grave.



<br><br>9.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Ton Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  we have heard just now our old  colleague

talk about the fact that we have today attacked our

Party. But here I would like to express my opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight Assemblymen have presented our views to

the Central Executive Committee, and they show that

our   stand  is  similar  to  the  P.A.P.'s  stand.

Therefore, we are fully convinced that we  are  not

against  our Party's policy. And so their criticism

that we are attacking the Party is groundless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister has moved this motion today for

discussion. The reason for it has been expressed by

our  colleagues.  The motive of the  motion  is  to

resolve the differences about the lack of democracy

in  our  Party. The introduction of the motion  was

due to the intra-party struggle because of lack  of

democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today we discuss the question whether we have confidence in the Government. Some Members

on  the  Opposition  who have already  spoken  have

attacked  the P.A.P. Government. People  may  wonder

whether  the representatives of the people  on  the

Government   side  are  right  in   attacking   the

Government.  We  have said, as the Opposition  have

also  said, that this is wrong and that  is  wrong.

But  we  differ from the reactionary Right in  that

we,  as  representatives of the  people,  are  also

members of the P.A.P. What we say today is said  as

members  of  the P.A.P. and not as Members  of  the

Government,  and  still  less  as  Members  of  the

Opposition. We hope that the people will not forget

this,  as  otherwise they will not  understand  the

meaning of our speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said by other Members, it is improper

to bring this motion to the House today, because it

concerns our Party's struggle. There is no need  to

call   on  the  Opposition  Members  to  interfere.

Although  the motion has been brought  from  within

the  Party  to the Assembly, we as Members  of  the

Assembly have to join issue with the Government and

the  party leadership. From our point of view, this

is in accordance with the interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, first, I want to ask what is meant by "confidence in the Government"? Does it mean that

it   is  sufficient  for  a  few  people  to   have

confidence in the Government? We deny this. We were

elected by the people, and we do not want to  cheat

others, nor do we want to cheat ourselves. Even  if

the  Members  give  the  Government  100  per  cent

confidence, that does not reflect confidence in the

Party and in the leadership. If we get 100 per cent

confidence, if we repeat past errors and go against

the accepted principles, then the people will still

be  dissatisfied  with us and we might  lose  their

confidence.  This is very clear even to  a  boy  of

three  years, and more so to the leadership of  the

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the big question is: why do they file this

motion before the House? We have lost the Hong  Lim

and  Anson by-elections, and with the loss  of  two

seats, the  P.A.P. has 39 seats, but still  has  a

majority.  I say that there is no real  problem  of

confidence or non-confidence in the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I should now explain the causes that have led to the differences in the Party. The

Opposition  said  that  this  was  caused  by   the

Communists  in  the Party. It is not surprising  at

all.  What  is surprising is, today, even  the

so-called  progressive leadership also admit  it.  All

the problems facing the Party are blamed on Mr Lim

Ching  Siong. Mr Lim Ching Siong is a great  trade

unionist and a leader of the workers, but he is not

a  demi-god. Alone, he cannot have the force or the

power  to  disrupt the Party. But  this  great  man

(Mr, Lee Kuan Yew) said that we are controlled  by

Mr  Lim Ching Siong. We are reasonable men and  we

can  reason  for ourselves and think for ourselves.

Let  all  the  people  be  careful  and  think  for

themselves:  why  is  the Government  attacked  all

round? Why is it that so many party cadres and  the

thousands  of P.A.P. members believe  that  as  the

leaders have come into power and have assumed  very

high  offices, they have changed? But  today,  they

have  resorted  to  mean  tactics,  equivalent   to

bribery,  in  order  to retain  leadership  in  the

Party.  But  we want to tell them that the

buying-over   of   people  with  money  is  not  permitted

according to political principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me say why the Party leadership has fallen into the pit. It is because they have

turned  Right. This is the main issue in our Party.

Their  stand now is different from that of  before.

We  have  been associating with them  for  so  many

years,  and  we  understand fully  their  political

motives.  Therefore, what we say is not groundless.

In  1959  because the people of Singapore wanted  a

progressive Left-wing Government, they elected  the

P.A.P. into  power. All those members  and  cadres

loyal to the Party had accepted the trust that  the

people  should  not  be disappointed  and  that  we

should bear our responsibility. Therefore, they had

fought    against   Right-wingers    and    against

colonialists,  and they had made great  sacrifices.

But  today  all classes of the people in  Singapore

are generally dissatisfied with the leadership,  as

are  also our Party cadres and members. That is why

we must openly give here our views, and I hope you.

Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  will allow us some more time  to  discuss

this  issue because the motion raised today is very

important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As loyal members we have to declare our stand. We

all know the attitude of our leadership towards the

problems  of  the different communities  and  their

stand. Anyone with brains will understand that  all

races  have to live in harmony. All the races  here

have  accepted it as a fact and they have lived  in

harmony  all  along,  and yet  the  action  of  the

leadership  is  not conducive to  that.  They  have

repeatedly cried out slogans about the unity of the

different  races, hut  they  have  in  fact   been

resorting only to slogans like "super-Malaya", and

so   on.   On  the  other  hand,  they  resort   to

suppressing the people who do not agree with  them.

and  now  they  have suddenly raised the  issue  of

merger.  This is not without any motive.  In  fact,

the  Federation  Government  and  the  Malays  have

increased their suspicion in regard to the  Chinese

community in Singapore. The leadership cannot evade

this responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general members in the Party have been excited

and  unduly stirred because some of them have  been

named  as  Leftist elements. They  think  that  the

Leftists  are fundamentally opposed to merger,  but

hope  that  merger can take place immediately.  But

they find that their interpretation has been proved

to  be  wrong.  We  know that the  purpose  of  the

leadership is to use the issue of merger to  defeat

all   Left-wingers  in  order  to  maintain   their

political  power.  But this  act  of  resorting  to

political  power  by suppressing the  Left-wing  is

something that we cannot accept. This will one  day

lead  to  some trouble. By then it is too late  to

regret.  As a progressive Left-wing Party, we  have

responsibilities.  There is great  significance  in

Left-wing  unity and unity in the  Party,  but  the

division in the Left-wing Party has been made clear

only  recently. When we Left-wing people enter into

a  new  era, we have to unite together to  progress

towards  the  right  path.  Some  people  who  feel

justified in our policies have gone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



out  campaigning for the Party in order  to  obtain

security  for  the Party. But when the  by-election

was  lost, they put the responsibility on the other

people.  Others  were  to  be  blamed.  They   were

innocent. This attitude of not wanting to unite all

the  Left-wing forces has been known to us. But  we

have  under-rated their hypocrisy.  Now  they  have

openly  split the trade union movement. At present,

the  leadership's  great  enemy  is  the  Left-wing

forces. Those Right-wingers are their friends. They

can  unite  with them. When they talk  of  the

so-called  non-Communist Left and the Communist  Left,

they are merely playing political tricks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in words and deeds our leadership in the Party are very similar to those of Lim Yew

Hock.  There  are a lot of facts to be  enumerated.

Now  I  will  quote only a few facts to  show  you.

First,  in  the  Anson  by-election,  the  Alliance

candidate  had  no difference of opinion  with  our

Minister  for Finance. It is a matter  of  being  a

different  Party only. This fact has been  revealed

at  the forum held at the University of Malaya when

our P.A.P. representative and the representative of

the  Alliance were very similar in the  content  of

their speeches. This is an unusual coincidence. Mr

Speaker, the people are not forgetful, and  we  can

remember  that  Lim  Yew Hock has  a  very  similar

speech. They knew only-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member knows

the Standing Order. It says he must not refer to  a

Member of this Assembly by name. He should refer to

him by his constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They ask,

without the base, what are we going to do? They say

in  Singapore  100  per cent of the  interests  are

dependent  on  the  British forces.  Therefore,  in

their  conclusion, they say we must not  chase  out

the  British. We must not be anti-colonialist. This

has  greatly  disappointed  us.  Mr  Speaker,   we

clearly  understand  that  the  attitude   of   the

leadership in the P.A.P. and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



that of the leadership of the Alliance towards  the

people  is  the  same.  And the  people  have  lost

confidence in their attitude. The leadership  think

that  the  people are easily led into believing  in

Communism. They intend not to take the people  into

their  confidence. For the past two years  we  have

seen  that the P.A.P. leadership actually like  the

attitude  of the Alliance. They consider that  half

of  the  people are foolish. After their defeat  in

the Hong Lim by-election, they blame the voters for

not returning them to power. Therefore, they cannot

have close association with the people. They cannot

mix   with  the  people.  Since  the  people   have

understood their aspirations, we have expressed our

different points of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to tell you that the P.A.P. does not belong to the leadership. The

P.A.P. belongs to all the comrades and members  and

executives.  It  has been created by  the  combined

efforts of the rank and file. In the year 1959, the

people  had great confidence in our Party.  Because

of  that,  we  won  43 seats. In the  eyes  of  the

people,  the  Party  has  enjoyed  great  prestige.

Unfortunately, in the short period of two years, we

have  today fallen into this position. It  is  very

sad  indeed.  The leadership have called  upon  the

people, through the Members of this House, to  have

confidence in them. This is not a joke. It is  verb

serious.  Politics is very important. It is  not  a

joke.  Because it greatly influences the  lives  of

the  people. Therefore, with great confidence  they

say  they  will not assume power unless the  people

have  confidence in them. They have threatened that

trouble may begin. At this time they still call  on

the people to have confidence in them. We hope that

this  is  not a joke. Mr Speaker, I hope you  will

pay attention to the fact that intra-party troubles

should  be resolved by ourselves. If the leadership

intend  to  carry out the policies and reflect  the

attitude of the Party, then let them quickly summon

all  the  51 branches for a Party meeting. We  hope

then  that  this  trouble will be resolved  in  our

Party and not in the House.

<br><br>9.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, today if is with a heavy and sad

heart  that  I  speak. Today when  I  entered  this

Assembly  I see a political waverer, one who  wants

to  hand  over  Singapore  to  the  United  Nations

Organisation.  It is with a sad heart  that  I  say

this.  Because  the  President of  the  T.U.C. was

defeated  by him. And this defeat is one which  has

been  brought  about by members of  our  Party  who

stabbed us in the back. That is why we suffered the

defeat. If we look at the history of the P.A.P. and

compare it with the history of this candidate, then

the  one  who should have entered this House  today

should  not  be the one who has been sworn  in.  He

should  be  one  who works for the benefit  of  the

workers,   who  struggles  for  the   workers   and

represents them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard our own

comrades  in the Party speak. They say there  is  a

lack of democracy in the Party. They criticise  and

attack  the Party leadership. I am a member of  the

Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P. And I say

the  people  of  Singapore  will  know  the  truth.

Frankly  speaking, the People's  Action  Party  may

have  made  some  errors in their  policy,  but  in

principle they have made no errors. If it  is  said

that  there  is  no democracy in the  Party,  then,

after  the defeat of the Hong Lim by-election,  why

did  we hold a joint meeting to review the work  of

the Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, every Member of the Assembly has

the  opportunity  to raise questions.  Among  these

Members, some were elected into the Committee.  Two

were  elected  as  members of the Committee.  Every

Branch of the Party has had the opportunity to give

their  views  as regards policy to the  leadership.

Mr Speaker, Sir, can you say there is no democracy

in  the Party? Today I see our own comrades holding

a sharp knife and stabbing their own comrades. This

makes me feel very sad indeed. One of us scolds the

Prime   Minister.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the   Prime

Minister  has  been  chosen by  us.  He  represents

Singapore.  The  Prime Minister is at  present  the

Secretary-General of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  They  have  insulted  him.  I  believe  our

Members  will  feel very sad to see  in  tomorrow's

papers  that  one of our comrades has  scolded  the

Secretary-General,  and  used  very  bad  words  to

describe him. But the principles of the Party  have

not  changed  at  all.  At  every  sitting  of  the

Assembly,  there has been no one to  criticise  the

policies  of the Party. But today, there  has  been

talk  that  the Party has changed. If that  is  so,

then everyone of them should be responsible for it.

Why  did they not bring this matter up in the past?

Why  did  they  not criticise the  Party  at  Party

meetings? Sometimes when I criticised some matters,

these people scorned me. I remember on one occasion

when the Party has just been in the government  for

sometime,  I  attacked one Government  servant - that

was  Thomson - but everyone of them scorned me  then.

Why?  The P.A.P. at that time was very stable. They

could  not argue over small mistakes. I cannot  pay

respect to that kind of hero. Party matters  should

be resolved within the Party. Why should they bring

up  this matter during the course of the Anson

by-election?  No  one can tolerate this stabbing  from

behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I heard an S.P.A.

Member of the Opposition, the Member for Cairnhill,

criticising  the  Government  and  saying  that  we

should admit to something before they could support

us.  This S.P.A. Member should not imagine that the

P.A.P., in the course of its struggle over a period

of  six  years, could be induced to go over to  the

other side. On this side, I must emphasise that the

P.A.P. will  not  be  like  the  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government.  The  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government   used

certain  tactics  to  deal  with  people.  We,  the

P.A.P., want to debate the question of the one  man

one  vote system and to get the confidence  of  the

people  by  this way. We will never resort  to  his

methods.  Some  comrades  have  said  that  we  are

adopting  means to deal with them. What  they  have

said  is  wrong. We know some tricks to  deal  with

them.  Coming  to a collusion with the  Right  will

never  happen.  This  talk is unnecessary  and  the

doubt is unfounded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present our main enemy is

still  around.  All we want to achieve  now  is  to

defeat  British  colonialism. We  should  be

anti-rightist. Therefore, they think that by firing  off

some   falsehoods,  in  the  words  of  the   Prime

Minister,  they  will succeed; but in  future,  the

truth will be out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, one of us did not understand

some  questions concerning the Party and had become

sceptical and had even accused the Party. So I want

to   explain  to  him  because  maybe  he  did  not

understand  the policy because he has been  in  the

Party  for  just a short time. I want to  tell  him

this  that the cadres of the Party are selected  by

the  various  Branches  of  the  Party.  He  should

remember  this.  The  Central  Executive  Committee

selects  the cadres. This selection is  decided  on

the performance and work of the member of the Party

concerned. So I would like to tell this member  who

does not understand, not to magnify a small matter,

to insult and smear our own Members or comrades. We

should  unite  together and should  not  shirk  our

responsibilities. We should carry out the  people's

mission and should not disappoint them.



<br><br>9.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, originally I

found  it  hard  to believe that tonight's  special

session would develop into what it is now.  I  feel

that  I  am  in  a  dream world. But  after  having

followed with great interest the speeches  made  by

Members  of  this House, I find it  imperative,  on

behalf of the Alliance, in particular U.M.N.O.,  to

express my views on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political developments in Singapore to date

have  only  reached the status of  self-government.

Our aim to liberate the island of Singapore in this

kind   of  atmosphere  will  be  even  farther   of

achievement. Who will laugh at us after seeing  the

events happening in this Assembly? Nobody else  but

the British colonialists. Mr Speaker, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



the  beginning,  we  have  not  deviated  from  our

attitude towards this Government which has  claimed

to have the overwhelming support of the people, the

loyalty  of  whose  membership  is  unquestionable:

whose policy is acceptable to the people, and whose

leadership  is approved by the people. But  as  has

been   demonstrated   to  them,   our   suspicions,

particularly  those  of  U.M.N.O.,  have  now  been

confirmed. All kinds of abuses were heaped  on  the

Opposition   side  (which  originally   had   eight

Members)  with  no  sense of decency,  although  we

represent certain sections of the people.  We  were

accused of being the tools of colonialism. But  now

it is our turn to accuse them of being the tools of

certain  forces which want to grab power for  their

own ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think there is no need for me to recapitulate matters to which we had drawn

Government's attention. It can be said that what we

have  said has fallen on deaf ears. It is as though

we  are  speaking  to a deaf person.  We  know  the

tactics of the Communists. In our opinion, we  will

not compromise if necessary with the Communists. If

they  want to use violence, we will meet them  with

violence.  That  is  the stand  of  U.M.N.O. which

represents  the Malay section of the  community  in

Singapore.   They   have   been   recognised    and

acknowledged  in the Preamble [of the Constitution]

as  the  indigenous people of Singapore. Our  stand

does  not centre around ideologies. To us, it is  a

small   matter   and  we  should  not   engage   in

unnecessary   arguments  over  it.   However,   the

Government  or the P.A.P. have boasted  that  their

ideology  brings  not disunity  but  unity  to  the

people of Singapore. I repeat what we have said  in

our  constructive criticisms in the past.  We  have

said  that the tiger which they bring up  will  one

day  devour them. There is no doubt about it.  They

realise  now  that  they are in pain.  The  problem

confronting us now, Mr Speaker, I agree,  concerns

all  the  people of Singapore, although  there  are

certain  quarters which maintain  that  it  has  no

connection with the people and that it is an

intra-party  struggle. If the Party in power is facing  a

crisis, will that mean that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



is to be no association between them and the people

who  voted  them  into  power?  These  double-faced

tactics of the Government - like a double-edged saw - I

say,  are  deluding the people.  There  can  be  no

compromise on this issue. The damage created by the

Government   should  be  solely   blamed   on   the

government in power.



<br><br>10.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I must declare my stand on this

motion,  otherwise I can hardly face the people  in

my   constituency.  The  purpose   of   the   Prime

Minister's  motion today is to force  us  to  break

away  from him. Let me point out the motive  behind

the  Prime  Minister's motion. In short, the  Party

leadership  wish  to  obtain  greater   power   for

themselves. Let me quote a passage from  the  Prime

Minister's letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In order to maintain peace and order in the

country  the  Government, on behalf of the  people,

has  to  resort  to  some  unpleasant  and  awkward

actions. I do not wish to assume responsibility  in

this respect.'



<br><br>From  this, it can be clearly seen what his motive

is.  I think everybody can still remember very well

the  former Chief Minister. Tun Lim Yew Hock,  when

he  challenged  the people by using words  in  like

vein.  But I would like to point out that  we  will

not  be  confused and coerced by these  adventurers

through  intimidation to follow the Prime  Minister

to  death. We will not be forced into it.  I  think

one  can  judge fairly by wisely reasoning out  the

Government leadership's attitude and the statements

issued  on behalf of the Party during the past  few

years.  The  Prime Minister has brought  an

intra-party  issue into this Assembly. It is not logical.

The  Prime  Minister wants to have a vote  on  this

motion, and this cannot be other than a trap. If it

is a trap, then I have to expose it, but I will not

fall into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody can remember that after the defeat of

the  Party in the Hong Lim by-election, some of the

leaders  in our Party did not want to take heed  of

the  experiences and lessons gained from the defeat

and admit their errors. They did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



not  intend to abandon their leadership. But  after

public opinion as reflected in newspaper editorials

was  expressed and, the stand taken  by  our  Party

members  was  discussed, they came to  admit  their

errors.   Therefore,  the  question   whether   the

Government should resign or not was postponed  till

after   the  Anson  by-election.  But  then   these

circumstances  brought about  a  dissident  feeling

amongst the general members. Now that the Anson

by-election  has  been held, it is high time  for  the

issue to be discussed at a joint conference of  the

Central  Executive  Committee  and  the  51  P.A.P.

Branches. But the Prime Minister dare not face  the

criticisms  of the members. He has not the  courage

to  rectify his own errors. That is why he dare not

convene  a  conference to discuss the  issue  in  a

democratic way. That being the case, he wants us to

express  our  confidence in him. We know  that  our

Prime  Minister  and the minority  leadership  have

control  over the Government, and they want  us  to

express our confidence in them. I think this course

is  not  proper, because the Party leadership  have

not  absorbed any new experience or learnt  lessons

from  collective  criticisms. They  have,  instead,

resorted  to bringing this issue into the Assembly.

The  purpose is to confuse the vision of the people

and  to ask us to follow them blindly. I would like

to  say that we have our basic stand, which  is  to

oppose  resolutely  colonialism  and  maintain  the

rights  and  improve  the living  standard  of  the

people.  So I think the Prime Minister's motion  is

absurd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you must be aware, from the

correspondence between the Prime Minister  and  the

Party  Chairman,  that there is a  passage  to  the

effect  that  the Prime Minister said that  it  was

another  test of strength between the pro-Communist

Left  and  the  non-Communist Left,  and  that  the

present   Government  is  faced  with  new   forces

launched  by  the  pro-Communist Left.  That  is  a

machination.  The Prime Minister thought  he  could

confuse the vision of the people so that they would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



not  see clearly what is ahead of them in the  path

taken by the minority leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the eight Assemblymen in the

Party are accused of being Communists. Let me  tell

you  that there are many members who hold different

opinions  from  those held by the  Prime  Minister.

This does not mean that you can accuse them all  of

being  Communists.  The  Prime  Minister  is   most

capable  in the use of new terminologies about  us,

and this makes me sad and disheartened. I am afraid

his  political  bankruptcy  has  led  him  to  this

impasse.  The eight Assemblymen who hold  different

views  from those of the Prime Minister are accused

of  being anti-national unity, anti-merger, and  so

on. These accusations are very serious and grave. I

must  solemnly  declare that I have  never  opposed

national unity with Malaya. I have taken a  similar

stand  in the past and I shall continue to take  it

in  the  future. The freedom and the rights of  the

people should be prerequisites to a merger. We must

not  sell out the interests of the people in  order

to  achieve  merger. We know that  in  the  present

situation obtaining in Singapore democratic  rights

have  been  won through the struggle and sacrifices

of many people in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe you have to eat bread

to  gain  strength. Merger can be  likened  to  the

eating  of  bread and therefore we must  achieve  a

merger.  But we must understand that there must  be

something in addition to bread, it could be butter,

jam or kaya. If you do not know what is spread on a

slice  of bread, then you will not dare to  eat  it

for fear that it might contain poison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the speech of the Prime

Minister  which lasted for more than  an  hour.  He

gave vent to his feelings in his speech and it  can

be  described  very shortly. His  long  speech  was

somewhat  in the nature of some of the speeches  of

the  former  Chief  Minister,  Tun  Lim  Yew  Hock,

because  at  that time Tun Lim did not  reveal  the

fact that he had sold out the rights of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the hon. Member

that  he must not use the name of a Member of  this

Assembly.  He  must  refer to  the  Member  by  his

constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank you for your direction. I want to point

out  that  in  the  past the Chief Minister,  whose

constituency  was  Havelock,  was  in  a   quandary

because  he was under pressure from all sides,  and

this  led  him  to take action detrimental  to  the

interest  of  the  people. He did  not  reveal  his

action and he did not want to know fully whether we

were genuine Leftists, or pro-Communists, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention here some of the

developments which have taken place after the Anson

by-election culminating in the introduction of  the

present motion. In this respect I want to refer  to

the  speech  of the Member for Cairnhill.  We  know

that  the  result  of the Anson by-election  is  an

indication  that the people are highly  politically

conscious.  Their  choice in  this  by-election  is

correct.   We  can  establish  this   fact   as   a

comparison. Now I want to mention the defeat of the

Lib-Socs and the Singapore Congress. Why were  they

defeated   so   pitifully?  In  the  1959   general

elections the P.A.P. got-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the hon. Member

can indicate how the detailed results of Anson have

any bearing on this particular motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it

is  because  today  this motion before  us  is  the

result  of the Anson by-election. If there were  no

Anson by-election, there would not have been such a

sudden  change in the political situation,  and  we

might not have to debate this motion today. That is

why  I  have to deal with the cause of this  motion

and  to  refer to a few points raised in the speech

of  the  Prime Minister, who is now accused by  the

people.  Therefore,  as  a comparison,  I  have  to

mention the number of votes polled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that the Party that was returned in

Anson  in  the 1959 elections polled a majority  of

3,292 votes, and the Lib-Socs only got 1,231 votes,

as against 104 in that by-election. Moreover, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



Opposition  have united and formed themselves  into

an  Alliance.  I want to mention this fact  because

this  will teach them a lesson as their past defeat

was  the  result of going against the will  of  the

people.  Therefore, after two years of  opposition,

in  other  words, after two years of government  by

the  P.A.P., they had not criticised the Government

in  regard to the welfare of the people.  They  did

not  do  so.  They  still  took  the  attitude   of

selfishness, and therefore, they suffered a defeat.

In  their  speeches they repeatedly  said  that  if

today's  motion is anti-Communist, then  they  will

vote for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we must understand the Communist Party

well.  We  have not seen the Communist  Party  here

because they work only for themselves. If they  are

against  the  people, then the people will  abandon

them.  In  other words, all sorts of illegal  terms

such  as  "pro-Communist" and "Communists" will  be

used  in  order that an opportunity is provided  to

say, "You are a Communist and you can be detained."

That  is  why  I  say that the people's  livelihood

depends  on their attaining liberty. For  instance,

if  my  wish is to hive in a house made of concrete

and so on, but I could only build an attap hut, how

can  society  progress?  Usually  statesmen  cannot

realise  their  wishes and since they  cannot  give

anything   to  the  people,  therefore   they   are

abandoned  by  the  people.  And  when   they   are

abandoned  by  the people, they have to  resort  to

tactics  to deal with such a situation. Under  this

democratic    system,   they   use   barbaric    or

undemocratic  methods to deal with  it.  Therefore,

there are some terms which are illegal in law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch on what one of my colleagues said

just now. She said that she was very sad to see the

situation  in this Assembly today, that  the  eight

Members in the P.A.P. deserted the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us find out why the leadership met with defeat

in  Anson.  It  could be attributed  to  their  not

knowing  how  to  lead,  perhaps  not  getting  the

opinions  of  all  strata  in  the  Party  who  are

conscious  of the needs of the people, and  thereby

not adopting a correct policy. It is because of the

undemocratic attitude which they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



have  adopted  that has caused  the  people  to  be

dissatisfied  with  them. If the  Party  leadership

could  listen to the opinions voiced by  our  eight

Members here, and if they disagreed and so declared

to  the people the contents of their speeches, then

they  would have retained their support  and  would

not have suffered such a crushing defeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We released the letter openly, the reason being

that  our  Party had neglected our  request  for  a

discussion. On the one hand, they said they  wanted

to discuss with us, but on the other hand, they let

Mr  Devan Nair make a statement on behalf  of  the

Party  at  a  forum  organised  by  the  University

Socialist  Club at the University of Malaya,  which

led  to  the result of the Anson by-election.  They

omitted  to  make  a statement  in  the  Anson

by-election.  This  caused general dissatisfaction  to

the  people of Anson. Therefore, the disclosure  of

this  letter  disproved what Mr Nair had  said  so

that  the  people in that constituency  would  know

that there is still some democracy in our Party and

our  Party can still have some hope of carrying out

the  job of serving the people. On the other  hand,

if our letter had caused the defeat of the Party in

the  Anson  by-election, then one point had  to  be

acknowledged - the onus should not be on  us  but  on

the  leadership. Because if we were wrong, then why

should the people still follow us? Just now I  said

that the Four-Party Alliance had a reduced poll  in

the  by-election. This shows that  the  people  are

always correct. They are always progressing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now deal with some points

raised by the hon. Member for the Southern Islands.

The  hon. Member said that he was speaking  on  the

same theme as the hon. Member for Cairnhill. He said

that our Party claimed to be anti-Communist and yet

alleged  that there are Communists in our Party.  I

must  say  that  this blame should be  put  on  the

leadership  of  our Party, as one of our  spokesmen

has  said  just  now, because the problem  was  not

properly  dealt with. Usually they resort to  using

very unpleasant terms about certain people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



Here  I must refer to certain points raised by  the

hon.  Member for the Southern Islands. He said that

the  leadership of the Party must not speak in such

a  tone  when  they cannot achieve their  aims  and

resort  to  all sorts of mean tactics in  order  to

achieve their purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, lastly, I must necessarily remind all here that those who cause misery will ultimately

cause  their own destruction. They will finally  be

judged  by the people. I will remind them  that  no

matter  what our members in the Party or Opposition

Members say, they have to bear this in mind.



<br><br>10.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Prime  Minister has at last thought fit to disclose

publicly that within his Party there are two  rival

groups  -the  Communist Left and the  non-Communist

Left.  Sir, this is a very serious disclosure  with

serious  implications. One implication is that  for

the sake of winning the last general elections, the

People's Action Party was prepared to welcome  into

its  arms the Communist Left. Was that a wise move?

The  second implication, Sir, is that while in  the

Federation   the   Communists   are   regarded   as

subversive  elements, the policy of  the  governing

Party  here  is such that those who  come  over  to

Singapore  and  join their Party  are  given  legal

protection.  Sir,  how is this  going  to  help  in

promoting good relations between Singapore and  the

Federation?  Another  very serious  implication  is

that  if,  in  the  struggle for power  within  the

People's  Action Party, the Communist Left  manages

to take over control, that means that the Communist

Party  has  captured Singapore. Sir,  I  will  just

mention those three implications and let the  group

in  control  of  the  People's Action  Party  think

seriously, and think of what steps they should take

to rectify the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have listened to two very dramatic stories

of  behind-the-scenes struggle; on the one hand, of

plots and counter plots, of moves made by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



British,   by  the  Communist  Left  and   by   the

Government,  and on the other hand, we  have  heard

from the dissident group accusations of the lack of

democracy in the party organisation and so  on.  We

believe  that very likely the truth is to be  found

in  both  versions.  Sir, to  me,  four  points  of

importance   have  emerged.  Firstly,   that   this

struggle for power within the Party must have  been

very  intense,  so intense that it has  had  to  he

brought  to the notice of the public. But it  shows

also  that  a  Party  in  power  which  depends  on

Communist  elements for its strength  cannot  be  a

stable  government. Therefore, how is the Party  in

power  going  to  attract  investors,  or  help  to

restore  a  climate of confidence to this  country,

thereby producing more factories, establishing more

industries, and, therefore, producing more jobs for

the unemployed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point is this. The Prime Minister

has  stated  that  his group is still  prepared  to

protect the Communist Party. Sir, this must be very

disturbing  to  many in Singapore, the  Federation,

Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen in history in recent years that we

cannot  under-rate,  we cannot  under-estimate  the

strength and the skill of the Communist leaders. If

the  Prime Minister and his friends think that they

can  outwit  the  Communist  leadership,  they  are

trying  to do what other leaders in other countries

have  failed. We are not saying that the Communists

are  not human beings. They are. Personally I  have

no hatred for my fellow human beings. But we do not

want   an   ideology  which  enslaves  the  people,

depriving  them of their freedom to think  and  act

for themselves. Sir, that is where we differ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The People's Action Party

considers  that  the  only way to  independence  is

through merger. Sir, we have agreed with them,  but

we  have also expressed our doubts whether  in  the

present context this merger with the Federation  is

now  possible. What with the disclosures that  have

been  made,  I am sure the chances of  merger  have

become more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



remote.  Therefore,  the only way  to  independence

while preserving good relations would be through  a

confederation  of independent States  where  we  in

Singapore do not endanger in any way the people  in

the  Federation or in other neighbouring countries.

Sir,  I  believe the ruling group in  the  People's

Action  Party are also in agreement with this.  The

Prime  Minister  has  said  that  his  duty  is  to

preserve the People's Action Party in the midst  of

zigzagging manoeuvres. I may have left  out  a  few

words,  Sir, I  have tried to copy them  verbatim.

Surely the primary aim of a political Party is  not

to  preserve its own self, but to serve the people

of  the  country, to promote their  welfare,  their

security, their freedom. And if it is necessary for

the  Party to sacrifice itself for the sake of  the

country, then if we are statesmen we will sacrifice

our   Party  for  our  country.  But  if   we   are

politicians, Sir, then the Party comes  first.  The

people  can  go  to hell. Sir, the  motion,  as  it

stands, goes against the feelings of the people. If

you  say  that  the people have confidence  in  the

Government,   then   we  are  going   against   the

expression  of  opinion  of  the  majority  of  the

people.  The people are dissatisfied with the  way,

the  Government  has treated the  employees-drastic

pay  cuts  without  proper  negotiations,  and  now

partial  restoration in a very dilatory  manner.  I

mean,  Sir, from the very start there was no ground

for  those  pay  cuts and, therefore,  morally  the

Government  should restore all the  pay  cuts,  and

thereafter  negotiate on the basis of  the  present

financial  state  of  the  country  for  a   proper

reduction in salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very likely the complaints of the rebel group

are  correct.  When people cannot be democratic  in

their own Party, how can they be democratic towards

the  citizens  of a country? In their treatment  of

the  teachers, we regret to say that the Government

are  applying  a principle which cannot  be  called

socialistic. More work for less pay. More work  per

day.  More days per week. It is therefore difficult

to  maintain the efficiency of the education system

of  this country under such conditions. How can you

blame the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



teachers  if they are dissatisfied and if  many  of

them seek better conditions of service elsewhere?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of unemployed is increasing, and

when the children leave school, what prospects have

they?  Again  and again I have met former  students

some of whom have been unemployed for the last  two

years.  What  prospects  of  employment  have  they

except  to  join the Work Brigade? Naturally,  Sir,

the  people are dissatisfied. They are unhappy. The

economic condition of the country is declining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to these disclosures. How can we say

that  the government of the country is going to  be

more  stable? Sir, we realise that the  leaders  of

the  People's Action Party perhaps were sincere  in

their  motive  and  have  made  mistakes  in  their

methods.  But if they want to regain the confidence

of  the people, they must be humble enough to admit

and  to rectify their mistakes. If they will  treat

the people of Singapore more like human beings than

as  robots,  as pieces of machinery,  perhaps  they

will  get  a  better response. The  leader  of  the

Alliance  has  said  that if the  purpose  of  this

motion  is  to enable the leaders of the P.A.P. to

prevent   Singapore  from  falling  into  Communist

hands,  we  will  not embarrass them.  But  if  the

motion is to obtain from us an affirmation that the

people   of  Singapore  are  satisfied   and   have

confidence in the Government, then I regret to say,

in  the face of what we know, that we are not  able

to do that.



<br><br>10.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I am indeed surprised  to  hear

just  now from the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Health that differences  within  the

Party  should be thrashed out in the Party,  and  I

invite the eight stalwarts of intra-party democracy

to  take heed of what their colleague has said.  It

was  these  very  eight traitorous Assemblymen  who

flouted the decision made by the P.A.P. Assemblymen

themselves by taking internal party issues  to  the

public,  and  that  at a time when  the  Party  was

fighting a crucial by-election in Anson. Was  there

any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



consultation  prior  to the  publication  of  their

statement in the Press? We were engaged in fighting

a  by-election  while these so-called  loyal  eight

Assemblymen and the Parliamentary Secretaries  were

bitterly  engaged in sinister plottings behind  our

backs.  This. I suppose, is what they  call

intra-party  democracy. I do not wish to delve  into  the

troubles of my Party in this House. But suffice  it

to  say that if the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister   for  Home  Affairs  finds  the   Party's

Constitution  so disgustingly undemocratic,  it  is

indeed  surprising that he should have  joined  the

Party  in  the first instance, stood as a candidate

on  its ticket and, together with the young man who

aspires   to   higher   office  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Health accepted  the

posts  of Parliamentary Secretaries of a government

which they accused of having no democracy. All this

talk of the undemocratic Constitution of the P.A.P.

reminds  one  of the voice of the Member  for  Hong

Lim.    For   their   information,   the    present

Constitution  of  the  P.A.P. was,  to  a  certain

extent,  the work of the Member for Hong  Lim  who,

not  so  long  ago,  also  accused  the  P.A.P. of

undemocratic and lack of intra-party democracy.  In

case  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for Home Affairs is not aware, the Constitution  of

the Party was precisely designed to prevent capture

by  insincere and disloyal party elements and those

who  willingly  allow  themselves  to  be  used  to

further  a  cause which will only bring  chaos  and

disaster to the country. Intra-party democracy does

not mean stabbing your comrades in the back.

Intra-party  democracy  does  not mean  discussing  party

differences  by  issuing  public  statements  at  a

crucial  by-election to injure the  Party  and  its

candidate.  Intra-party  democracy  does  not  mean

inviting outside forces to pressure the Party  into

deviating  from its basic objective of independence

through merger. These are acts of treachery of  the

worst kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well that the Assembly meets today to

discuss  a  motion calling for a vote of confidence

in  the Government at a time when the people  have

been presented with a very clear picture of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



the political situation in our island State. It  is

equally  fortunate that events in the  recent  past

have  helped  greatly to remove the rather  blurred

political lines, thus making it easier for  all  to

witness  the contest taking place in the  political

arena.  To  the extent that the people of Singapore

are  also profoundly aware of the issues at  stake,

the motion before Us should bring out, as I am sure

it  has brought out, the deeper significance  which

underlies it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might even add that even some of the more

simple-minded Members of the Opposition who were known  to

have  been concerned why the P.A.P. should  want  a

non-Communist,  socialist Malaya are  now  probably

convinced  about  the  wisdom of  this  categorical

stand of the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, today no

one  doubts  any longer what is meant by  the

non-Communist Left and the Communist Left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hong Lim by-election the call to "seek

concord while maintaining differences" was made  by

the  anti-national Left. This call  may  have  gone

down  with some political innocents because at Hong

Lim  the constitutional issue had not then come  up

to  the surface as it did at Anson. At Hong Lim the

call    to    "seek   concord   while   maintaining

differences"  could  have  referred  to   or   mean

anything the anti-national Left wanted it to  mean.

There was then no need for them to be specific.  It

was  then to their advantage not to be too specific

in  this  call  to "seek concord while  maintaining

differences". Under the circumstances, not only was

the  call to seek concord highlighted, but  it  was

highlighted  with such singing of praises  for  the

P.A.P.  The  P.A.P. they consistently repeated  was

within  the limitations of the situation: the  most

progressive  socialist  force  in  Singapore:   the

P.A.P. was  for  the people: the  P.A.P. was  the

banner to rally round to defeat Right-wing reaction

and  opportunism:  the P.A.P. was  correct  in  its

stand "at this stage of our political history", and

so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that it is absolutely rubbish to talk

about  seeking  concord when your  differences  are

fundamental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



and  when  you seek basically different .goals.  We

know that it is foolish to talk about a united

anti-colonial  front and Left-wing unity when our  stand

was  and is still an independent, democratic,

non-Communist, socialist Malaya. And that was  why,  as

Malayan nationalists and socialists, we refused  to

respond  to the insincere call for Left-wing  unity

upon which to seek concord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not sought concord because we are

democratic  socialists. Any  Left-wing  unity  will

have  to  be  on  the basis of a  democratic,

non-Communist  Malayan  socialism.  And  the  stand  of

Malayan  socialism  based  on  Malayan  nationalism

became as clear as daylight when at Anson the

anti-national   Left  showed  their  true  colours   and

abandoned  our stand to continue with our  declared

objective  of  working  for  independence   through

merger with the Federation.



<br><br>10.50 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair.]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete somersault by the six unionists who

represent  the anti-national Communist  Left  after

the  Chairman of the P.A.P. announced on  9th  June

our  objective of total eradication of  colonialism

in  Singapore  and  complete  independence  through

merger  with the Federation, or a larger Federation

when constitutional talks open in 1963, speaks  for

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not be sidetracked by the demand of the

anti-national Left group to release the  detainees,

etc. Let us be clear about our short-term and

long-term objectives. While our immediate objective  is,

as  the Chairman of the Party declared on 9th June,

i.e. - the   total  eradication  of  colonialism   in

Singapore and complete independence through  merger

with  the  Federation in 1963, that  of  the

anti-national   Left   group  is  full  internal

self-government  in  1963. The people of Singapore  will

not  be  deceived  about talk of  minimum  demands.

While  our  long-term  aim  is  a  democratic

non-Communist socialist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



Malaya, that of the anti-national Left group is  an

independent Singapore with merger suddenly becoming

a long-term objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines are no longer blurred. It is plain that

the   anti-national  Left  group  have   used   the

detainee,  citizenship and other issues  as  a  red

herring  to  distract public attention  from  their

fundamental  deviation  from  the  P.A.P.'s   basic

principles  and  policies. They have  not  answered

Government's  offer  to disclose  the  grounds  for

refusing  their  citizenship.  Neither  have   they

answered   our  question  whether  they   seriously

suggested that the Government should iii the  midst

of  the  Anson  by-election risk  a  constitutional

crisis on the question of the detainees. They  have

remained   silent  to  this  day  even  after   the

treachery  they committed against their  colleague,

the  President  of  the T.U.C., who  stood  as  the

P.A.P.'s candidate in Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I venture to suggest that they cannot answer the question even now, because it is

not  the  P.A.P. alone which is  waiting  for  the

explanation from them, but the people of Singapore,

and  the  people of the Federation of Malaya  as  a

whole   have  called  them  to  account  for  their

deviation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the motion before us will

of  necessity  be  put to an open  vote,  precisely

because   it  is  an  open  issue.  The   treachery

committed by the non-national Leftist minority is a

recurrence  of  the same blunder committed  by  the

M.C.P. 13 years ago.  In political terms,  it  is

not treachery against the P.A.P. as such, but it is

one    committed   against   Malayan    nationalism

comprising the Malays, Chinese and Indians and  all

others who belong to no other country but Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political innocents who have been so easily

duped    into   shouting   about   the   detainees,

citizenship, etc, must be aware that the  fight  is

still a three-cornered one until such time as  when

we achieve merdeka through merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is today an acknowledged fact that the P.A.P.

is  a nationalist force in the southernmost part of

Malaya.  Any  anti-national  move  whether  by  the

Communist  Left or the communalist  Right  will  he

looked  upon by the people of Malaya as detrimental

to the interests of Malayan nationalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I express complete support for the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> More trouble!



<br><br>10.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the problem

confronting us today is, if we say serious,  it  is

not  serious;  neither can we say that  it  is  not

serious,  it is not because I wish to support  what

has  been  uttered by some of the  supporters,  the

Back-benchers of the Government, but I am surprised

that  the Government has decided to introduce  into

this  House such a problem, i.e. calling the  House

to vote confidence in the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in my view, the problem is purely a quarrel. It is like a quarrel between

husband  and  wife. That is to say,  the  wife  has

fraternised  with another person and  the  husband,

not  knowing what to do, has therefore  gone  to  a

third  party to seek reconciliation. As for me,  if

my wife flirts with another man, I will give her  a

divorce  of the third degree! I hope the Government

will take such a step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has accused us of being a

rojak  Party.  That is a stupid accusation.  I  can

accuse  the P.A.P. of being a gadoh-gadoh Party.  I

am  sure  that you. Mr Deputy Speaker, has  tasted

gadoh-gadoh. It is very delicious indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government

has  constantly  accused us of being pro-capitalist,

pro-colonialist,  etc. If we are pro-capitalist  or

pro-colonialist, why do they seek support from  us?

Let them be bold and go forward and do not come  to

us for support.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



If  this Government is sincere and is dedicated  to

serve  the  people  of Singapore,  it  should  take

positive  and  definite steps in  the  interest  of

peace, as we did when we were in the Government. It

should  not  shirk its responsibility.  It  has  to

realise its responsibility. If it fails, to realise

that, then it should get out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have learnt today that Communist elements tried to disrupt the P.A.P. in

the  troubled days faced by the P.A.P. in 1957.  It

is only today that this is exposed despite the fact

that  we had explained in this Chamber when we were

in  the  Government that such events emanated  from

the  Malayan  Communist  Party.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister said that they were able to eliminate  the

M.C.P. elements during the troubled  days  of  the

P.A.P. in  1957  because of the  strength  of  the

Party. This is completely wrong, because it was the

Lim Yew Hock Government which helped the P.A.P. if

at  that  time the Lim Yew Hock Government did  not

arrest and put these elements into Changi Gaol, the

Prime  Minister,  the  Deputy Prime  Minister,  the

Minister  for Health and other Ministers could  not

have held office in the P.A.P in 1957. So we helped

them  out  of  their difficulties;  otherwise  they

would not be in existence today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another accusation was made by the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for Health  about  our

great  leader, Tunku Abdul Rahman, on the  question

of  confederation. He accused the Tunku  of  making

such  a  proposition with the help and co-operation

of  the British, which means that he was a tool  of

the  British. This is a very serious accusation and

I  challenge the hon. Member to repeat that outside

the  precincts of the Assembly. I believe  we  from

the Alliance-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand that Members of this

Assembly  have  special  privileges?  I  would  ask

whether it is in order for these challenges  to  be

made.  They  seem to me to be a limitation  on  the

liberty and freedom of speech in the Assembly,  and

make a very grievous inroad-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Kandasamy):</b>  Order. What is

the hon. Member's point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The point of order, Sir, is this: is

it proper to make a challenge to a person to repeat

outside what he thinks proper to say here?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have allowed that as it is

in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Thank you very much.

Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about challenges. I seem to remember that

in  1956 the Member for Anson, who was then sitting

at  the back there [indicating], issued a challenge

to  the present Prime Minister who was then sitting

in  the Opposition as the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

The  challenge  was  taken up  by  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar, but the present Member  for  Anson

did not take part in the Tanjong Pagar by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  Health to repeat what  he  has  said

outside,  because  I know for a  fact  that  it  is

nothing but a lie. If there are people in Singapore

or   in   Malaya  who  resolutely  oppose   British

colonialism,  Tunku Abdul Rahman is  one  of  them.

There is no braver person than the Tunku himself to

oppose British colonialism. It is our leader, Tunku

Abdul  Rahman,  who  challenged  the  British.   He

uttered  speeches which no other leaders  dared  to

do. Now there are people who say that they are

anti-colonialist.  At  that time, if  they  could  have

licked  the  feet of the British, they  would  have

done  so.  Similarly in the speeches of the  Member

for  Anson during the Anson by-election, be accused

indirectly  and insinuated that Tunku Abdul  Rahman

is  anti-Chinese. He dared to say this without  any

foundation. That is also a lie. It is not true  to

say  that  Tunku  Abdul Rahman is anti-Chinese.  We

will  most  definitely  not  co-operate  with   the

M.C.A.,  and  for  that matter with  any  political

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the forum held at the

University  of  Malaya,  representatives   of   the

various political Parties - the Alliance, the Workers

Party and a trade union group - discussed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



problem  of  Malaysia. I was  not  present  at  the

forum,   but  I  was  surprised,  on  reading   the

newspapers  the  following day, to learn  that  the

Member  for Anson referred to his meeting with  the

Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation,  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman,  in 1955 on the subject of a merger between

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>11.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read of it. I was really amazed because I

myself  was in the company of the Member for  Anson

at  the meeting that morning with the Tunku in  his

old  house - not  his new house. At  that  time,  the

Tunku  was not the Prime Minister. He was the Chief

Minister. I was present at that meeting. Why I  say

that  the  explanation of the Member for  Anson  is

false  is  because he stated that there was  a  big

function  that morning. I was present with  him  in

the Tunku's house. I remember we had kopi-o (coffee

without milk), one egg, some toast and butter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member for Geylang

Serai  satisfy  me  that this is relevant  to  this

motion?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

believe there is some relevance to the motion  that

we are debating now because the Prime Minister, the

Member  for Anson and other Members dwelt  at  some

length on the problem of Malaysia. So I would  like

to explain what took place in Kuala Lumpur in 1956,

otherwise  such statements might mislead  not  only

Members  in this House but also the people  outside

this House. It is not that I wish to sing anybody's

praises,  but this is based on fact. I  have  asked

the  Tunku  to  rebut the statements  made  at  the

forum, but he, being a gentleman, considered  it  a

small  matter  and that there was no necessity  for

him  to  make  a  denial. Therefore,  I  take  this

opportunity   to  raise  this  small   issue.   The

statements  hold no truth. The statements  made  by

the  Member  for Anson in regard to the Tunku  were

distorted  facts. I was present at that meeting.  I

sincerely say that three-quarters of what  appeared

in  the Press was not true - not lies, but not  true.

If  I  say  they  were "lies", I may  be  asked  to

withdraw that word.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, what we are now faced

with  is  not  the  problem  of  the  P.A.P. as  a

political  Party  or the internal struggle  in  the

P.A.P. The problem confronting us is, in my view, a

very  serious one. If we are not careful,  we  will

create a situation which we do not want to see. The

stand  of  the Alliance - particularly  U.M.N.O.-is

clear.  We oppose the Communists. On this Communist

problem,  I  would like to state that  we,  as  the

indigenous people of Malaya, are prepared  to  shed

our blood in the fight against the Communists. That

is  our uncompromising stand in any event, even  if

our  houses are set on fire. At the same time,  not

only  is  the  Communist  problem  a  danger,   but

communalism  also is a danger, just as  nationalism

is,  i.e. nationalism Left, or nationalism  Right.

But  in communalism, there is no Left or Right. One

kind of communalism is for a special race, and  the

other  is being used by political opportunists.  If

such a state of affairs exists I hope this will not

happen  in Singapore - the victims will not  only  be

the  P.A.P. alone, or the Alliance, or the  Member

for Anson, but all the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the motion before us and which is

moved  by  the  Government, we of the Alliance  say

that  although we oppose Communism, we do not  wish

to  be tools of anybody when it comes to voting  on

the motion.



<br><br>11.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I believe you  are  very  much

concerned  over  the political  situation  in  this

country. Therefore, I know you will be glad to hear

all  our views on the whole political situation and

its developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disputes that have taken place in our Party

can  be  traced  to  the lack of democracy  in  the

Party.  People in the minority make decisions,  and

people who are in the majority have to follow them.

In   order  to  enable  the  democratic  system  to

function  and  to  be accepted in this  country,  a

worker of a democratic political Party has the duty

to see that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



there   is   democracy  in  the  Party.  But   the

leadership in our Party, on the contrary, have been

shouting  very  loudly  the  word  "democracy"  and

pretending  to  be  democratic  when  there  is  no

democratic  spirit  at  all.  The  suppression   of

democracy for a long time in our Party has led to a

big breach in the Left-wing forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we grieve very much at the whole situation

and  its  developments, because all along  we  have

only  been able to work within a limited degree  of

democracy.  But today we can no longer  allow  this

state of affairs to go on forever. We have tried to

avoid  bringing  this dispute into  the  open,  but

unfortunately our leadership have neglected and are

indifferent to our views. They treat us as  members

who  ought to be loyal to only a few leaders.  Here

let  me tell the leadership this - we know that what

we  are  loyal to is the People's Action Party  and

its  programmes.  We  support the  People's  Action

Party and its programmes and its objectives and  we

will  not  waver. As long as colonialism exists  in

this  country,  the struggle to liberate  ourselves

will not cease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why have the differences between us and the

leadership  developed to such a stage  as  this?  I

believe  you  must  have read our  Party  platform,

constitution and regulations and its manifesto.  It

is  clear  that today everybody can  see  that  our

leadership  have not adhered to the  principles  of

the  Party  and its manifesto in dealing  with  the

question  of  principles  and  they  have  departed

further  and further from this objective. From  the

deeds and words of our Secretary-General, we do not

believe that he is what he was. Our leadership  are

not  prepared to implement the Party's  objectives.

Instead  they  accuse us of being traitors.  But  I

wish to ask: who are the traitors? I think this can

be  decided  by our members. But I want  to  stress

that the Prime Minister and his leadership call  us

the  Communist Left, and that he and his colleagues

are  the non-Communist Left. We feel ashamed and  we

regret  that  in  addition to all  this  the  Prime

Minister likes to coin all sorts of new and curious

phrases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the leadership employ this sort

of  tactics to spread terror far and wide among the

people  so as to dissuade them from supporting  our

objectives.  This sort of tactics will not  deceive

the people for long. We want to stress further that

ever  since  1954 up till now, our  stand  has  not

changed.  We  have  not changed  from  a  socialist

stand.  We are not like some people who put on  the

cloak of Left-wing socialists. As a matter of fact,

this group of people are really just like the

Right-wing  reactionaries. I believe  you,  Mr  Speaker,

understand this. History will record who really are

the traitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe you know that those

political detainees still under detention  are  our

comrades.  In  the  history  of  our  Party   these

comrades have contributed much to expand our  Party

and  they  have  made great sacrifices.  They  have

devoted much energy and have worked for the  Party,

but  colonialist  agents  like  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government  adopted high-handed tactics  to  arrest

them.  They  were  charged by the  colonialists  as

Communists.  These  comrades are  the  former  Paya

Lebar  Branch  Chairman, Mr  Tan  Mook  Teng,  the

former   Secretary,  Hong  Cheng  Han,  and   other

comrades.  They are still being detained.  And  our

leadership,  after  having been  in  power  for  25

months,   still  keep  our  comrades  in  gaol   as

Communists. As long as they are not released, it is

a  mockery to the Party and its members. Therefore,

I   feel   the  continued  detention  of  political

detainees is a shame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think you must have heard of the dispute in our Party about intra-party democracy.

There  has  been  talk  of  policies  having   been

approved as a result of consultation among  various

types  of  members. This may appear to be  true  to

outsiders,  but the true picture of the  collective

leadership  is this, Mr Speaker. I dare  say  that

many  policies have been approved as  a  result  of

consultation  among the various types  of  members,

but  without the knowledge of many of us, including

Parliamentary Secretaries and Party members in  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to make special mention

of  the  question of citizenship. It  is  indeed  a

shame for me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



to bring this matter up, because, as members of the

People's   Action  Party,  we  have  been  fighting

shoulder  to  shoulder  with  many  comrades  whose

applications  for  citizenship  are   still   being

disregarded.  This,  just  like  the  question   of

continued  detention  of  political  detainees,  is

again  another  insult  to us.  We  cannot  forever

remain  indifferent  in  this  matter  because   it

affects the future of the Party. We have seen  many

citizens  of Singapore who voted in 1957  and  1959

during the general elections. But now because  they

have  lost  their  birth  certificates,  they   are

required to apply for citizenship. Is this  not  an

irony?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about the

increase of school fees of school girls. We  had  a

discussion about this. This policy has been adopted

in  spite of the opposition of many of the members.

Mr  Speaker,  this  is typical  of  the  so-called

collective  leadership. The majority has  to  obey

the minority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to talk about the allocation of flats

and the fixing of rents by the Ministry of National

Development.  At present, the houses allocated  are

fewer  than  formerly and the rents are higher,  so

that those with a great burden to shoulder - the

wage-earners - are unable to stay there. This is  the

so-called  socialist objective of our leadership.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we have heard this leadership talking

about  socialism,  about the equality  of  men  and

women. To increase the fees of school girls to make

them  the  same  as  those of school  boys - that  is

equality!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of personal relief on income tax. In

the case of men, $2,000 is allowed; but in the case

of  women only $1,000 is allowed. Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is equality between men and women. This is the

criterion of socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today at this special sitting we

are  required to pass a vote of confidence  in  the

Government.  I  am puzzled why this  matter  should

have  been  brought  up  here  for  decision.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, why could this matter not be  decided

by the 51 Branches of the Party? We have 39 members

in  the Assembly and we are as stable as ever.  Why

should  there  be  such a show  of  democracy?  For

example, the Ong Eng Guan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



incident and the defeat in the Hong Lim by-election

were   discussed   in   the   Party   by   the   51

representatives from the various Branches.  Why  is

the  present incident not referred to in a  similar

manner?  Why  should it be more  serious  than  the

incident  I  have  just quoted?  According  to  the

principle  of collective leadership, there  is  all

the more reason for this decision to be made in the

Party. They have no guts, as in the past, to  bring

this matter for decision in the Party. It is purely

an internal party strife. It should be brought back

to the Party for decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard the

former Chief Minister, Tun Lim Yew Hock, saying  to

the  leadership  of the Party that  if  this  is  a

motion  to  eradicate Communism, then he will  vote

for  the motion. We here have listened to the Prime

Minister making his analysis. He treated his former

comrades,  with  whom  he had  fought  shoulder  to

shoulder,   as  the  Communist  Left.  The   Prime.

Minister  has  all  along been working  with  these

people, and why should he brand them as Communists?

Why should he protect them instead of accusing them

here  today?  I  think this is a  sort  of  "white"

terror.  We  have  seen the former  Chief  Minister

using  his tactics again before our leadership.  He

wants  our leadership to make use of the same dirty

tricks. We believe that our claim at present and in

the future is the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand the Secretary General's letter

to  the  Chairman of the Party. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

this  is the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 19th of  July.

There  is  here  a  criticism to this  effect.  The

Government  represents the people. The  Government,

on  behalf  of  the  people,  intends  to  do  many

unpleasant things. But we know that the people have

elected  us. Why did they elect us? Was it  because

they  wanted us to do something unpleasant to them?

Or  whether  they wanted us to sell them?  I  think

this  cannot  be  explained in  this  way,  because

everyone  wants to retain forever a good  name  and

not a bad name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now want to talk about a

female  Member  who  is  a member  of  the  Central

Executive Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



Just  now,  Mr Speaker, if you have  listened  to

her,  she  may have appeared to be reasonable.  But

this particular comrade of the feminine sex may not

have  understood the whole affair. How many  cadres

are  there in the Party nobody knows. We know  that

in the Hokkien Huay Kuan the cadres elected on 30th

May,   1959,  have  since  been  disqualified   and

withdrawn. We believe that all the Members in  this

Assembly are cadres. According to this, if  we  are

not   cadres,  surely  we  would  not   have   been

candidates  for the elections and the  Party  would

not  have trusted us. But the strange thing is that

among  the eight of us, two are not cadres  of  the

Party.  Therefore, this question has arisen out  of

internal  party strife, and I think  it  should  be

brought  back to the Parts for a decision  so  that

the  Party  will be more united and can stand  more

firmly  on  its  standpoint to  achieve  its

anti-colonialist aims.



<br><br>11.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, Singapore has been looked up to as one of  the

politically advanced countries compared  with  many

areas  around  it. It is a matter  of  regret  that

today, when Members of Parliament from overseas are

present in this House, the P.A.P. Government should

present such a pathetic spectacle and give  such  a

classic exhibition and example of how parliamentary

democracy  could be abused. Sir, what has  happened

today  is not something new. This is not the  first

time  that  Government  has used  Standing  Orders,

parliamentary    democracy   and   the    Singapore

constitution,  to  bring party quarrels  into  this

Chamber,  and to thrash out party differences.  You

will  remember, Sir, when the Member for  Hong  Lim

went against the Prime Minister, we have had to sit

here   session  after  session,  day   after   day,

listening  to the P.A.P. scolding and accusing

ex-P.A.P. and vice-versa. And all this, Sir, is  done

at public expense, mind you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, today when the P.A.P. Back-benchers are

defying  the party leadership, we are again brought

into this Chamber and asked to give a vote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



of confidence to the Government. We have constantly

been   pointing   out  to  the   Government   their

inefficiency,  their arrogance, their  undemocratic

behaviour,  and  the  damage  they  have  done   to

Singapore  and her economy. Sir, I am  sure  I  can

credit   the   P.A.P. leaders   with   sufficient

intelligence  to know that we will  not  give  them

this  vote of confidence on the part that they have

played, or on their past non-achievements.  I  also

congratulate   the  leadership,   Sir,   on   their

ingenuity  in  creating  a  situation  which   they

thought would corner the Opposition. They tried  to

make  it  so  that we either voted for them  or  we

would  be supporting what they called the Communist

Left-wing. The Prime Minister hoped, Sir, with  his

Mr  Lion  and Mr Bear fairy tale, to channel  the

issue to either we vote for the non-Communist  Left

or  the Communist Left. On second thoughts, Sir,  I

was  wondering whether this is meant only  for  the

Opposition.  Only it is also meant for the  general

public,  to make them feel that there is  no  other

Party or people except the Communist Left and

non-Communist Left-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker is seated in this

Chair and not in the gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. So that the

public  will  have to decide whether they  want  to

side with the Government or, if they do not want to

side  with the Government, then they will  have  to

side with the Communist Left. But, Sir, it must  be

admitted  that it is now obvious from the speeches,

especially  those of the Back-benchers (who,  if  I

remember rightly, without exception, called  for  a

51-Branch  meeting) and from that  call,  that  the

real  issue before the House is whether the  P.A.P.

leaders should convene a general meeting of the  51

Branches  or  not. What have we to do with  it?  We

came  here  thinking that the Government  wanted  a

vote  of  confidence from the House  to  strengthen

their hand in working for the security and peace of

the State of Singapore and its people. We came here

prepared  to support the Government in  this  fight

against Communist subversion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



But  today  the  Prime Minister in his  speech  has

stated  categorically that the Government does  not

intend  to do this. He has said that when there  is

trouble  from the Communists he will hand  over  to

the  British  and  it is up to them  to  fight  the

Communists.  Then  why does the Government  want  a

vote of confidence today?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before, Sir, and I say it now, that

whenever  the P.A.P. Government finds itself  in  a

difficult  spot they try to confuse  not  only  the

Opposition but also the public. They can no  longer

deny it now. The position is clearly this. Some  or

many  of the P.A.P. Back-benchers and Party members

wanted  a  meeting of the 51 Branches.  The  P.A.P.

leadership  refused to convene it. This  issue  has

been  clouded by the motion before the House today.

With due respect to you, Sir, actually we would  be

voting on the issue whether we think the Government

is  right in not convening this meeting or  whether

the   Back-benchers  are  right  in  demanding  the

meeting  and  the  Government should  convene  this

meeting.  That was what all the speeches are  about

today.  If  we  vote with the Government,  then  we

agree that the Government is right; and if we  vote

against the Government, then we agree that the

Back-benchers are right. Let us not be confused, Sir. We

shall  not be voting, as the Prime Minister's fairy

tale  tried to make it appear to be, on  the  issue

whether  we  have  confidence  in  a  non-Communist

Government   or  whether  we  would   rather   have

Singapore  handed over to the Communists.  That  is

not  the issue. We will not be voting on that.  The

Prime  Minister tried to make it a  "Heads  I  win,

tails  you  lose"  affair.  If  we  vote  for   the

Government, they win. If we vote against  them,  as

the  Prime Minister's fairy tale tried to make  it,

we are siding with the pro-Communist faction. So we

lose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Sir, it appears as, though it

might  be wise for us to abstain. But we feel  very

strongly  that the confidence the P.A.P. Government

won  in 1959 no longer holds, as has been shown  in

the results of the by-elections in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



Hong  Lim and Anson. The Alliance Opposition,  Sir,

is not at all surprised that the people of Hong Lim

and  Anson have rejected the P.A.P. Government.  In

fact,  we  have said it before that the  people  of

Singapore,  I repeat, Sir, Singapore, not  only  of

Hong  Lim  and Anson, have lost confidence  in  the

P.A.P.  Government. And why should  they  not?  How

have  they  benefited during the two years  of  the

P.A.P. government? You will recall, Sir, at the end

of  one year of P.A.P. Government, I tabled several

questions. One of them was how many houses they had

built.  The  answer  was 125 as compared  with  the

figures  I gave - I forgot the exact figures  - 3,000

odd built by the previous Government in their first

year;  6,000-odd built not only by the  Government,

but  by  the  whole State during that  first  year.

During  the  first  year of the P.A.P.  Government,

there  were  only 125 houses built. And  what  they

have  completed of S.I.T. flats, the rents are much

higher  than  what  the  previous  Government   was

charging. Unemployment has increased and  this  has

led to increased robberies and crimes. The standard

of  living has gone down. The standard of education

has  gone  down. The medical services have suffered

deplorably.  People  have  been  deprived  of   the

freedom  of speech. This has now been confirmed  by

the Back-benchers themselves - an accusation that  we

have made before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a hundred and one legitimate

reasons  to  prove  that the  electorate  has  lost

confidence in the Government. In view of  this,  we

have no alternative but to vote against the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was amused when the Member for Bras Basah said

that  because it is a one man one vote system,  the

P.A.P. cannot adopt what she called  the  previous

Government's "tactics". I suppose she was referring

to  the arrest of the subversives. But she said the

P.A.P. have what she called "tricks". I do not know

whether  the translation was right. She  called  it

"tricks"  to deal with these people. I do not  know

what "tricks"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



she  was  referring  to, is it the  appointment  of

Political Secretaries and paying them $1,100  each?

I  do not know. She knows best what tricks she  was

referring to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one amused me more. I just happened to

hear,  when I came in, that she was scolded by  all

the  others - presumably they were mostly men. May  I

be  so  bold as to venture In suggest that she  was

scolded by them, because she was a woman? Maybe!  I

say  this because I happen to know that the  P.A.P.

Government  does not believe in giving women  equal

privileges. On several occasions when I happened to

mention  equal privileges for women,  the  Minister

for  Finance  mocked  me and  said  that  while  he

believed  that all men are equal, he believed  also

that  some men are more equal than others.  As  for

the  Member  for  Pasir Panjang, he  gave  a  clear

picture  of what the P.A.P.'s idea of equality  for

women  means.  Equal work, equal  trouble  but  not

equal benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to make one

observation;  many people have been  wondering  why

the  P.A.P. have released the detainees,  and  why

they  have  employed them as Political Secretaries.

Could it be that the previous Government had made a

deplorable mistake in arresting innocent men? Could

it  be  that the present Government have found  out

that  they  had  been  wrongly  arrested  and  that

injustice  had been done to them; and so they  have

been  rewarded  with a good post of $1,100?  People

have  been  wondering, but today their doubts  have

been   cleared.  The  Prime  Minister  stated  very

clearly that they were Communists. He admitted they

were  Communists.  So they were  rightly  detained.

Anyway,  that  does not seem to solve the  problem,

Sir.  That  deepens the mystery. If they knew  they

were  Communists or Communist leaders or  Communist

friends, or whatever term they used, why then  were

they  employed? Why then are public funds  used  to

pay them? As this fact is public knowledge now, why

are  public funds still being used to pay them? The

mystery  seems  to deepen, Sir. The Prime  Minister

has given the answer! The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



public  are  still wondering why this is  continued

after the explanation has been given. I would  love

to  see the reaction on their faces when they  read

the  papers tomorrow, Sir, that the Prime  Minister

says the reason why they were released was that the

P.A.P. did not intend to take repressive  measures

against  the Communists. Their duty is to  preserve

the  P.A.P.  They  did mention that  they  did  not

intend  to  take  repressive  action  against   the

Communists for the sake of the British. Their  duty

is to preserve the P.A.P. Speaking on behalf of the

Alliance Opposition, Sir, may I say that the policy

of  the  Alliance  is to preserve  the  State  even

before the Party?



<br><br>11.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have been summoned to this sitting - I should say  it

is  through no fault of yours - at such short  notice

to  decide whether this Government should  stay  or

quit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent from the speeches of those on the

Government  benches that there have  been  troubles

and problems among themselves and that we have been

called here today so that this Assembly can be used

as  an  instrument by the present  leaders  of  the

Government to resolve their problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today's sitting should actually have been

held either in the People's Association's centre at

Kallang  Airport  or  in the cultural  centre  with

perhaps  a  different Chairman. But  we  have  been

asked  to  come  here  today and  we  feel  we  are

attending   more   as  observers   and   spectators

attending  a  conference of  P.A.P. members  at  a

P.A.P. conference. Sir, it is my view and that  of

my  colleagues that the best place to  resolve  the

problems  faced  by the P.A.P. leadership  and  the

leaders  of  the  Government is within  the  P.A.P.

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the issues brought out during the past

few  weeks between the P.A.P. Back-benchers and the

Front-benchers are not new to us. They were brought

up more than a year ago when the Hong Lim Branch of

the  P.A.P. submitted 16 resolutions to the  P.A.P.

leadership.  Most of the speeches made  today  have

nothing new in substance. I am sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



we  have heard them many times in this same Chamber

when  a  year ago the Government leaders sought  to

vindicate  themselves  in the  P.A.P. by  bringing

P.A.P. issues into this same Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a year ago we pointed out that the P.A.P.

leadership   had  departed  from  the  spirit   and

manifesto of the P.A.P., and from the firm  resolve

and  anti-colonial stand of the P.A.P.  It  was  in

June  last  year that the Hong Lim  Branch  of  the

P.A.P. first  raised the banner of revolt  against

the   present  P.A.P. leadership  when  it  sought

rectification of the mistakes and blunders  of  the

P.A.P. leaders  within the  inner  confines  of  a

P.A.P. conference. Sir, it has  been  a  long  and

tortuous  journey for many of us, but we  are  glad

that  we  have  vindicated the political  questions

raised in the Hong Lim resolutions during the  Hong

Lim  by-election.  We are also happy  to  say  here

today  that we are gaining wider and wider  support

on those vital questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting to note that it was after

the catastrophic defeat of the P.A.P. leadership in

the  crucial Hong Lim by-election that the  present

pattern   of  conflict  within  the  P.A.P. first

unfolded itself.



<br><br>00.01 a.m., 21st July, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not try to go too much into details

because we are not P.A.P. members any more. Perhaps

many  will join us later on this side of the House!

But  in the by-election in Hong Lim, we did not ask

for  a  mandate  from  the people  calling  on  the

Government to quit, for it was our belief  that  it

was  not  in  the interest of the country  to  have

general   elections  so  soon  after  the   general

elections  in  1959. What we did was  to  urge  the

Government to rectify its mistakes and we sought  a

mandate  that  we  shall be here  as  watchdogs  on

Government's policies, that we shall support  those

policies  which are in the interest of the  people,

and  that  we will oppose those policies which  are

detrimental to the interest of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is our view that this Assembly must not be

used   as  an  instrument  to  resolve  intra-party

conflicts or personal conflicts other than those of

a political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



nature.  Sir,  only political issues that  are  the

subject of public controversy and of public  import

should  be  brought to this Chamber. Now  that  the

battle  for Hong Lim and Anson is over, it is  high

time  that the P.A.P. Government settled  down  and

did  some strenuous work for the pay they have been

collecting  every month from the  public  purse  to

better  the  welfare  and  the  livelihood  of  the

overwhelming masses of the people. They should make

an   attempt   to  tackle  many  of  the   problems

confronting us. It is not in the national  interest

for  the  Government  to precipitate  crisis  after

crisis, for it would be the poverty stricken masses

and the people who would be made to suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing to prevent this Government

from  carrying on. As far as I know, no  Member  on

the  Opposition  has  questioned  the  Government's

authority to carry on. Perhaps the Member for Anson

has  asked  the Prime Minister to resign  from  the

Party.  He has not asked the Government to  resign.

But  at today's sitting, we have been asked to give

blanket  approval for all Government's actions  and

policies,  whether in the past or in  the  possible

future.  Sir,  we  are afraid we cannot  give  such

blanket  approval.  We  have  been  asked  to  give

Government a blank cheque, and today we  shall  not

give it.



<br><br>00.05 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, when the time came  for  holding

the  by-election in Anson, the P.A.P. nominated its

candidate, Inche Mahmud bin Awang, in his  capacity

as  the President of the T.U.C. to contest the

by-election.  Since the by-election campaign  started,

some  of the T.U.C. leaders, numbering six in  all.

led by Mr Lim Ching Siong, took the opportunity of

raising many issues in the newspapers with the sole

object of bringing about the defeat of Inche Mahmud

bin Awang in the by-election. This was obvious. Mr

Lim  Ching  Siong and his friends know  that  Inche

Mahmud  bin  Awang  is  a  leader  of  the  workers

movement and a friend to them in the T.U.C. But the

actions of Mr Lim Ching Siong and his friends were

acts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



of  treachery,  because, as the  Treasurer  in  the

Anson by-election, I could see and understand  very

well,  with  my clear thinking as the Secretary  of

the  T.U.C., the move taken by Mr Lim Ching  Siong

and  his colleagues. They did not stop there.  That

was  followed by eight Assemblymen who  put  out  a

joint  statement  in  the newspapers  opposing  the

P.A.P.  Possibly they were influenced  by  Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong  or  by  the  propaganda  and  tactics

adopted  by  him. As a result of this,  the  P.A.P.

held  a  meeting of Assemblymen at which a decision

was  taken  and agreed to by a majority  vote  that

Assemblymen  should not issue public statements  in

respect  of  political matters. It is a matter  for

regret  that  eight Assemblymen have flouted  party

discipline,  which  is  tantamount  to  an  act  of

treachery towards the Party. They issued  a  public

statement two days before Polling Day. What was the

motive  then  behind  the  release  of  the   joint

statement  of  the eight Assemblymen  and  Mr  Lim

Ching Siong and his colleagues?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I have been active in the labour

movement. I have been a colleague of Mr Lim  Ching

Siong  and  the  two  of  us  together  have  faced

hardships. I understand the tactics adopted by  Mr

Lim  Ching  Siong and his friends were  responsible

for  the  defeat  of  the P.A.P. candidate,  Inche

Mahmud  bin Awang. He was suddenly stabbed  in  the

back by his close friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

state  that I wholeheartedly support the motion  of

the Prime Minister.



<br><br>00.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate on the

motion  moved by the Prime Minister, many  Members,

both  of the Government and of the Opposition, have

expressed their views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a bit late for this afternoon's sitting and

when  I  came  in,  I found a seat  occupied  by  a

"military officer's. He stood arrogantly and  spoke

as a warrior or a hero fighting for the rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



of  man  in Singapore. At the same time, he thumped

his  chest over his victory in Anson, as though  it

was  of  great significance to him; but  he  forgot

that  behind his victory in Anson was an act  which

was  condemned by all the people in Singapore. Such

a  dirty  act resulted in his victory and  his

re-entry  into  this  Chamber, but it  should  not  be

forgotten  that  this champion of the  masses  once

challenged  a  Member to resign  and  when  it  was

accepted, he fled from the by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this motion the Member for

Anson  has  proclaimed  himself  a  hero  in   this

Chamber.  But in the Anson by-election, he  adopted

many  mean tactics to achieve victory. On the other

hand,  the  P.A.P. repeatedly stated  in  the

by-election in Anson that the winning or losing of the

by-election would not be an issue to the Party.  If

they were to lose it, they would go down honourably

and cleanly; and if they were to win it, they would

do so likewise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what amazes me is that the

Member  for  Anson is making himself out  to  be  a

genuine nationalist. He has brought up issues which

would  result in disunity amongst the various races

in  Singapore.  Mr Speaker, we should  not  forget

that   we   the  people  of  Singapore  are   today

struggling  for  the creation of a  united  Malayan

nation,  with a single national language, a  single

national culture, and a single fatherland. But  the

Member  for  Anson  has tried to play  up  communal

sentiments in order to gain a seat in Anson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the Parliamentary

Secretary is not now on a platform of the Anson

by-election!  I  think all his remarks are  completely

irrelevant  to  the motion. He may  later  on  have

another occasion to attack the Member for Anson for

what he did in winning the by-election. But let  us

get back to the motion before the House.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am not

speaking as though I am on an election platform. It

was merely to clarify, because the Member for Anson

just  now  thumped his chest over his  victory  and

said indirectly that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



he  alone  is  the fighter for mankind.  So  it  is

necessary  for me to expose whether  there  is  any

truth  in the statement made just now by the Member

for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, there is close connection

between his victory and the motion before us  moved

in  the name of the Prime Minister, because we  are

now  faced  with trials and challenges from  forces

which are against national unity in Singapore.  The

Member for Anson dwelt on communalism and said that

the  Chinese  should  not  forget  their  ancestral

culture, as also on their part the Indians and  the

Malays, it  is as clear as daylight that  communal

sentiments  are being worked up when we are  making

all-out efforts to create a national culture



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  must  take regard of comments  from  the

Chair.  I  do  not  remember the Member  for  Anson

mentioning anything about communalism in his speech

in this Chamber. Let us try to keep to the rails as

far as possible. Time is getting on.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, that

represents the tail-piece of the election  speeches

made  in  Anson.  I  am not saying  that  you,  Mr

Speaker, are not giving me freedom, but in order to

conserve time I will adhere to your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the issue now is that the people of Singapore, who are anti-colonialists, should

consolidate Left-wing unity. Mr Speaker,  what  is

meant  by  "unity"? "Unity" can be  interpreted  in

many  ways.  I will give a number of illustrations.

Mr  Speaker. For example, there are many kinds  of

animals living in the forest. When the forest is on

fire,  the animals take flight to save their skins.

At  that time the tiger forgets the deer; the snake

forgets the frog. Although they are enemies, common

interest  dictates that they should flee  from  the

fire. After the fire is over and everything is back

to  normal,  they will then get together.  What  is

unity  to  make a broom when the broom is  used  by

people who have no real use for it? Or is unity  to

mix cucumber with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



durians in one basket, which is impossible?  It  is

not possible for the durians and the cucumber to be

put in one basket without first removing the thorns

from  the  durians. It will not  be  safe  for  the

cucumber to be mixed with the durians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have given several definitions of unity. In attempting to seek unity, we should

realise  that  the  P.A.P. has clearly  stated  its

stand-  that  it  is fighting for  an  independent,

democratic,   socialist,   non-Communist    Malaya.

Although we have been challenged by certain groups,

we have repeatedly stated our unequivocal stand. If

we  take an anti-Communist stand, it means we  will

go into the Western bloc; if, on the other hand, we

adopt  a pro-Communist attitude, we will be  horses

for the Communists to ride on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has had occasion to say that in fighting for the interests of the people of

Singapore,  we,  as socialists and  non-Communists,

have  repeated that what is good for the Communists

may  not be good for us; what is good for them  may

also  be good for us; and what is not good  for  us

may also be not good for them. But what is good for

us, although it is bad for them, we will use in our

interests  even if we have to fight them.  This  is

clear from the speeches on the policy of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we ask ourselves, Mr Speaker, is it true that

we  are retreating? Suppose we are faced with  four

or  five enemies in front and there are friends  at

our  backs with a hammer. In trying to evade  blows

from  the enemies, if we turn round to our  friends

it  will mean that we are giving an opportunity  to

our  enemies in front to hit us. Such  an  act  is

even  more treacherous than stabbing from the back,

because stabbing from the back means that it is  an

act of so-called friends who are traitors. This act

gives  an  opportunity to our enemies to  kill  us.

This happened with the group of people who claim to

be  fighters of the labour movement - Lim Ching Siong

and  his  friends who have lulled the  masses  with

sweet music.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



Lim  Ching  Siong  and  his  friends  are  able  to

influence  certain members of the P.A.P. with  the

result that these members dance to their tune. They

have  forgotten themselves and have started to wash

dirty  linen in public, which they should do within

the  Party, to show that they are the real fighters

of  the  people.  This also is  a  treacherous  act

committed toward the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in facing this problem, we should understand the real meaning of unity, and this

motion has been moved by the Prime Minister not  on

our  bended  knees to the Opposition to seek  their

support.  If the people feel that we have  betrayed

their  trust, they will be able to judge  our  acts

and our deeds on this motion. Briefly, Mr Speaker,

in  the interests of national unity, it is vital to

create   a  single  united  nation  with  a  single

culture, and a single national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the motion moved by the Prime

Minister.



<br><br>00.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the motion

moved by the Hon. the Prime Minister, I would  like

to  state here that if I were to support it I would

be  considered mad. The reason why I say so is that

the  motion here states that the House is asked  to

express  its  full confidence in the Government,  a

government  which I see at that moment is  a  Bubor

Kachang Government. The reason why I say so is that

the  Government, whether on the Front bench  or  on

the Back-bench, are quarrelling in front of us. How

then  can we say that we will support them and give

them a vote of confidence when they themselves  are

quarrelling  among  themselves? Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

even  if you agree with the motion. I do not  agree

to give the Government a vote of confidence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Kampong

Kembangan   must  remember  that  the  Speaker   is

supposed  to be above all politics. I do not  think

it  is  fair to drag the Speaker into a  motion  of

this nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It was not my purpose

to   ask  you,  Mr  Speaker,  to  be  involved  in

politics.  But  this is my view  of  the  political

situation  which I must put before  the  House.  In

principle,  I regret I cannot give even  point  one

per cent of my support to the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw your

attention  to  the new champions.  I  do  not  know

whether  they are new ones, but from my reading  of

the  papers I notice they are making a lot of noise

in  the  Assembly  to  hit at the  Government.  But

tonight I can say that these people in the Assembly

today  are not true champions of the people. In  my

view, they have been wrongly chosen to sit in  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I give my sympathy to the Member for Anson who has just joined us in this Assembly. I do

not  like  to hit out at him. But I would  like  to

give  my  views  on various matters raised  in  his

speech  in  this Assembly. I feel the Member  could

not  have fathomed the true feelings of the  people

of  Singapore and the feelings of the  people  from

U.M.N.O. if my father in the Federation  is  being

opposed, the son would now like to take issue  with

the  Member for Anson on matters that he has raised

in  this  Assembly. Before he goes any  further,  I

hope  he  can  see ahead. Probably  he  cannot  see

whether  or not there is a wall behind him.  But  I

would  urge him to look ahead. If there is a leader

of  a  political party who says that he  wishes  to

bring  about  the independence of Singapore  within

the  jurisdiction of the United Nations, I am sorry

to  say.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that he has  forgotten

this.  He  should  always  remember  that  although

U.M.N.O. may  not  have  many  members   in   this

Assembly,  yet  U.M.N.O. has  a  very  clear  voice

outside the Assembly to speak to people who wish to

bring independence to Singapore. We Malays-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Members have been speaking a bit

loudly in this Chamber, but I think the Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan wins the first  prize!  Will  he

please modulate his voice?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg your indulgence,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is  clearly

stated  in the Constitution of Singapore  that  we,

the  indigenous people, have certain clear  rights.

We  are  not willing to be under the administration

of the United Nations, or under the tutelage of the

United   Nations;  nor  do  we   wish   to   become

independent without merger with the Federation.  So

this  is one of the views expressed by one  of  the

Sons  of Tunku Abdul Rahman on behalf of the people

of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come back to the P.A.P. I

am  amazed that after two years it is only now that

I  am  aware that there is no democracy within  the

P.A.P.  I do not blame the Ministers on the

Front-bench.  But I blame the people on the Back-benches.

If  indeed  they know that the Party has  not  been

practising  democracy, why is  it  that  they  have

tolerated  it  for  two years until  their  Members

rebel  against  the  Government,  whether  in  this

Assembly  or outside? I do not like to regard  them

as  robots.  I am sure it is not so in  the  Party,

because  they  always speak with great  pride  that

they  have been elected by the people. Five Members

are  going out and it seems the party is tottering.

So,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, after two years  there  now

comes a statement from the Federation for a plan to

bring  about a merger, and it is then that  we  see

the  true  state of affairs existing in the  Party.

When I stood up to speak about the Communists, they

would hit back at me right and left. But now it  is

up  to the people of Singapore to see whether there

are  any  Communists within the  Party.  If  indeed

there  are Communists in the People's Action Party,

why is it that the Minister for Home Affairs allows

these people to go free without detaining them? Why

do  they harbour Communists? Why do they give  them

salaries of $1,100 a month? Why should these people

be harboured if they know that they are Communists?

Why  should they not arrest them and send  them  to

Pulau  Senang, or wherever it may be? The stand  of

the Alliance is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



anti-Communist. We are indeed surprised that  these

matters exist within the P.A.P. I really feel  that

if this is so, then the aims of the P.A.P. to carry

out  its  policies  and its ideology  will  not  be

achieved.  Mr  Speaker, when the Tunku  wanted  to

create  a  Greater  Malaysia or a  Happy  Malaysia,

there arose not only from among the P.A.P. but also

from among the Opposition support that the Internal

Security Council should be abolished. I cannot give

a  guarantee, and I dare not give such a guarantee,

to  anyone that if the Internal Security Council is

abolished     from     the     Constitution      of

Singapore - perhaps you yourself, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

will  see - I do not know what will happen. If  there

is no internal Security Council, it would mean that

the  troops  of  the British and the Federation  of

Malaya cannot take a great deal of interest in  the

internal affairs of the State. If it is the  belief

of the people within the People's Action Party that

we  do  not require British forces, that we do  not

require  the  forces  of  the  Federation  to  help

safeguard  our  security, if the Internal  Security

Council  is abolished, then I believe, Mr Speaker.

A.R.T.I.S. in its biggest form and its worst  form

will  come into being and we cannot fight them.  If

there  is  no internal Security Council,  it  means

that the Communists will have things their own way.

Then  I  fear  there  will be  bloodshed.  This  is

totally undesirable in the State of Singapore.  So.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I  hope,  and  I  particularly

address  my  hope to them, that the Ministers  will

assume   the   responsibility  to  overcome   their

domestic  difficulties without calling upon  us  to

help  then,. By all means, wipe out all the  people

within  their  ranks  who are undesirable  so  that

Singapore will become prosperous and peaceful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has

clarified  his  intention  of  a  merger  with  the

Federation  with special emphasis on education  and

labour  policies. But I can say that such a  policy

will  not easily be agreed to. I would like to draw

the   attention   of  the  Hon. the  Parliamentary

Secretary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Minister for National Development that  if

the  mosquito net is ridden with bed-bugs, then let

the  Opposition Members not be asked to  help  them

clear these pests without their being besmirched by

the blood of the bed-bugs.



<br><br>00.45 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is with sadness that in two years this is the first

time  I have failed in my duty as a whip, but  that

is not within my power. It is easy to whip when you

have  only the Front-bench and the Back-bench.  But

it is very difficult to use your whip when there is

the  Front-bench, the Back-bench and also the

stab-in-the-back  Back-benchers. I have been  instructed

by  the  Leader of the House that tonight's  debate

will be a free-for-all. Each one votes according to

his conscience. So the whip is withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not my intention to say

anything tonight, had it not been for the fact that

some  of  our  friends were trying  to  accuse  the

leaders  of trying to bribe us, even to the  extent

of  saying  bribing  with money,  to  stay  in  the

government.  The  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister   for   Health  talked  of   parliamentary

democracy, but I would have thought that, according

to the rules of parliamentary democracy, anyone who

disagrees with Government policy or with Government

leadership  should  have  the  decency   to   speak

opposite  us.  They should have crossed  the  Floor

before they attacked the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs talked of party discipline. He said

that the P.A.P. was the best organised and the best

disciplined Party. That was no doubt a fact,  until

the statement issued by the eight Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my duty to draw your

attention  to  the fact that some months  ago,  the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang wrote an  article  in  a

magazine  without  consulting  the  Party   Central

Executive Committee saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



that  we  should fight for complete internal

self-government  in our next negotiations  with  London.

After  that, as a Whip, I told him that  he  should

have consulted the Party before deciding policy for

the  Party.  Later on, the Member for Thomson  also

issued  a  statement  with  other  trade  unionists

attacking the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an Assemblymen's meeting before Anson and

we  reached  a  decision by secret ballot  that  no

statement  should be issued by any  Assemblyman  to

the  Press  on matters of policy. So  if  there  is

anyone who is fit to talk of party discipline,  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs should be the last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs and the Member for Toa Payoh are

members  of  a  Committee of Review  on  party  and

government work. We have to admit that we  realised

that we had to rectify many of our mistakes both in

government and in party organisation after the Hong

Lim  by-election, and we formed this  Committee  of

Review  to look into the mistakes and to  make  the

necessary    rectifications.   The    Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs is Joint

Secretary with myself in this Committee of  Review.

He  knows full well that we have received memoranda

from  all  the  Branches with good  recommendations

about  intra-party democracy and  about  rectifying

our  mistakes in many affairs. In fact, an  interim

report  has been prepared for adoption  by  a  full

Assemblymen's  meeting. If that is not  intra-party

democracy,  then  I  do not know  what  intra-party

democracy means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why could they not wait for another 48 hours to

issue  the  statement? Why did they talk of

intra-party democracy when we were fighting the battle in

Anson? Why did they not raise the question of

intra-party democracy then? Why did they not support  the

Member for Hong Lim when he raised the question  of

intra-party  democracy  during  the  Hong  Lim

by-election?  If they know and if they were  convinced

that  there  was  no  intra-party  democracy,  they

should have crossed the Floor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



with  the Member for Hong Lim. Instead, they  spoke

solidly behind us during the by-election. They said

how good the Party was. For two years we have never

heard  a  word about intra-party democracy in  this

House.  The  statement about intra-party  democracy

came  only  after  our Chairman had  announced  our

acceptance  in principle of a merger. That  was  in

the Hokkien Huay Kuan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Member for Hong Lim also raised the

question  of political detainees in this  House.  I

cannot  remember  any  of our Back-benchers  having

spoken  on that motion. There is a Chinese  proverb

that when the tree falls, all the monkeys run away.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So they are monkeys!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I think it was a big mistake

on  the part of some of our leaders to say that  we

were  going to resign if we were defeated  in  Hong

Lim. That shook many of our chaps. They thought the

ship was sinking.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The rats started to run!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> They try to desert the ship,

but  still cling with one hand in case it does  not

sink. It is not sinking, and I assure you that,  as

a  loyal member of the Party, I will sink with  the

ship when it does sink.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If it is sinking, what can you

do?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang

said  that  we did not invite the eight Assemblymen

to attend a meeting to discuss the Prime Minister's

resignation. What I would like to know  is  whether

the  eight  Assemblymen had invited  us  to  attend

their midnight meeting of conspiracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I come to the Member for Toa

Payoh  who  has accused our leaders  of  trying  to

bribe with money to keep them in power and to  keep

us together with them so that they can be in power.

It  is a great insult to the integrity of all of us

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



still stick to the Party. I think they should  know

by  now that the P.A.P. does not believe in bribing

anyone.  Perhaps they had been persuaded to  desert

the ship with some good promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said that his Party was

ready for a general election any time, anywhere.  I

would  have thought that he had learnt a lesson  in

the Anson by-election.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Learn your lesson first!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Up till now, I have not heard

any of our friends answering the statement made  by

the  Prime Minister. I would have thought that many

of  our party affairs could have been discussed  in

our Party conference after this motion is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you have heard the speeches made

by  our so-called friends. These reveal that there

is, in fact, an attempt to capture the Party and to

overthrow the Government. If they are really honest

and  if  they  are  really  dissatisfied  with  the

Government,  I think they should vote against  this

motion.



<br><br>00.58 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

hurts  me  more than it angers me to see a complete

degeneration among our leaders. Sir, I  have  never

expected that these leaders of mine and my comrades

in  the  Party  would, within such a short  period,

degenerate  to this level to twist  and  turn  and

distort facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House is apparently a

very  simple one. It seeks the confidence  of  this

House  in the Government. But the intention  behind

the  motion and its implications are not clear,  It

is  our  duty  as  elected representatives  of  the

people  to remember now more than ever before  that

the  interests of the people are paramount and  not

those  of  individual political  leaders  who  have

pawned their principles in desperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is our responsibility to

discuss  dispassionately the  motion  and  put  the

underlying issues in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



the  proper  perspective so  that  the  people  may

correctly  judge them. We must expose any  plot  to

confuse and mislead the people. Sir, there are  two

basic questions we must answer honestly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. For whom is the confidence vote sought; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. For what purpose is it sought?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government referred to in the motion

technically  means the Cabinet  led  by  the  Prime

Minister,  who  is  the Secretary-General  and  the

leader  of  the  People's  Action  Party.  All  the

Ministers are in the Central Executive Committee of

the  Party and they constitute a dominant majority.

For  all practical purposes, therefore, the  P.A.P.

Cabinet means the leadership of the P.A.P. In other

words,  Sir,  today  in  this  House,  a  vote   of

confidence  is  asked  for the  leadership  of  the

P.A.P.  That  is the basic position that  we  must

make clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, Sir, in his speech has brought

out  three points which I consider to be major.  He

said,  one, the six trade unionists and  the  eight

Assemblymen  oppose  merger;  two,   there   is   a

Communist move to capture the Party and to  capture

the  Government;  and three, the  overriding  smear

that  these  people termed Communists are  actually

friends of the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is too silly and absurd a remark

to   make,   that  these  people  who  are   called

Communists are also colonial stooges, and therefore

it does not warrant any serious consideration. I do

not  see  how the Prime Minister seeks to  make  it

look  congruous by saying, on one side, these  are

Communist front men and on the other side they  are

friends of the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne)</b>: You have said it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But to understand the

behaviour of the P.A.P. leadership, it is necessary

to  be  aware of the situation in which  they  find

themselves. Today, Sir, the P.A.P. leadership  find

themselves,  one, internally, with a complete  loss

of  confidence  of the majority in the  Party,  and

two,  externally,  completely  alienated  from  the

working  class and the middle class and almost  all

strata of society. Sir, an awareness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



of  this  failure of the leadership to command  the

support of the people and the comrades in the Party

has  caused  a  great  sense  of  desperation,  and

desperate men are now preparing to act in desperate

ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House is a preparation

for  a purge. Once the sham confidence is obtained,

it is possible that some people will be arrested in

the  hope of provoking the workers, which, in turn,

they  hope,  will provide an excuse for a  complete

clean-up. Sir, it is clear that the Communist smear

and  the anti-merger smear are but parts of a  plot

to prepare anti-democratic and oppressive measures.

The  transparency  of this smear  is  obvious, its

objective  of  preparing the way  for  a  purge  is

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not unused to these smears. It is not

the  first  time that people like Lim Ching  Siong,

Fong  Swee  Suan, S. Woodhull and the rest  in  the

unions  have  been called Communists. I  think  the

people are aware how the previous Government, under

the  leadership of the Member for Cairnhill, called

even our present Prime Minister a Communist. Smears

are easy to be created. The calling of names can be

done  quite  easily, but this does not resolve  the

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the anti-merger smear. Sir, the

six trade unionists have issued up to date but four

statements.  There  is  not one  single  word,  one

single phrase, or one single sentence which says we

oppose merger. I shall be much obliged, Sir, if the

Prime   Minister  can  quote  any  part  of   their

statements  or  any  part  of  any  one  of   their

statements, or for that matter, any speech made  by

any one of us which contains a phrase or a sentence

opposing  merger. The big lie is that we have  made

minimum constitutional demands for 1963.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not quite certain whether

I  have  heard  the  word  "lie"  being  used  with

reference to a Member of the Assembly. If the  word

"lie" has been so used, it must be withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I used that word, but I do not think it

was used with reference to any of the Members here,

unless  any Member constitutes it to be a reference

to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said the big lie is that we have made minimum

constitutional demands for 1963 and have called for-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. My understanding of that

remark  was  that  it had reference  to  the  Prime

Minister's speech. If it did not have any reference

to the Prime Minister's speech, then, of course, it

is  in order. But will the Member assure me that it

had no reference to the Prime Minister's speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw the word lie", Sir, I

continue and further, that we have called for

anti-colonial  measures in order to block  merger.  Sir,

our position on this is clear and simple. 1963 is a

concrete obligation insofar as constitutional talks

go.  It  could be superseded by merger, but  surely

vague   talk  of  merger  cannot  be  regarded   as

superseding  the  obligations of  1963.  Therefore,

Sir,  we  have  taken up positions for  1963  while

keeping  an  open mind on merger and confederation.

On  the  question of merger, we state categorically

that  we do not oppose merger, merger in the  sense

it  is  a  full-fledged merger, in the  sense  that

Singapore  will become an additional State  in  the

Federation  of Malaya. Insofar as confederation  is

concerned, in principle, it is acceptable but it is

premature to talk about it now because nobody knows

the  details. The P.A.P. leadership on 9th June  in

the  Hokkien  Huay  Kuan made a  statement  to  the

effect  that  we  completely  support  the  Tunku's

Mighty Malaysia plan. It was the Prime Minister who

said,  "I  support a hundred per  cent  the  Mighty

Malaysia plan." Unfortunately, at the moment,  they

say,  "We  welcome  it in principle."  We  have  no

quarrel  with  anybody  who say  they  welcome  the

confederation plan in principle. There  is  no  use

talking  of  details now because nobody  knows  the

details.  Therefore, Sir, I repeat  here  that  any

talk  that  the  six  unionists  or  the  dissident

Members  of  the  Assembly are  people  who  oppose

merger is a basic distortion of facts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs said that the

four  anti-colonial measures demanded  by  the  six

trade   unionists  and  endorsed   by   the   eight

Assemblymen were inconsistent with the  objects  of

the  P.A.P.  Sir, I believe he  does  not  have  a

mandate to say this, because I am quite prepared to

take  him on - or for that matter, any other Minister

or  Party  official who says that  the  four

anti-colonial  measures recommended are  not  consistent

with the objects of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we subscribe without qualification to the

objects of the P.A.P. as contained in clause  2  of

the  Party  Constitution. Let  not  the  people  be

misled  by  further smears. The four demands:  one,

the  release  of detainees - I ask the leadership  of

the  P.A.P. whether  it  is  consistent  with  the

objects  of  the  P.A.P. to release the  detainees;

two, the unification of the trade union movement - is

it  or is it not consistent with the objects of the

P.A.P.;  three, the granting of citizenship  rights

to  genuine anti-colonialists - is it or  is  it  not

consistent  with  the objects of  the  P.A.P.;  and

four,  the  request to allow freedom of the  Press,

freedom   of  association  and  assembly - is   that

consistent with the objects of the P.A.P.? In  this

connection,  I  wish  to  elaborate  on  one  point

freedom  of  assembly. Sir, there  was  a  time  in

Singapore  - although that time  was  perhaps  worse

than it is now when - nevertheless trade unions could

hold  general meetings in places like the Badminton

Hall,  the Victoria Memorial Hall without a  police

permit so long as the organisation was a registered

one.  If  the meeting was called for the attendance

of its members, no permit was necessary. But today,

a  permit is necessary to hold a meeting. Why? Sir,

I  can  quote  examples  of this.  We  have  quoted

examples of this on numerous occasions. It  is  not

my  intention to take any more of your  time.  Sir,

but if and when further examples are necessary,  we

can list them down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows now that not all is well with

the  P.A.P. The Government Benches are divided. The

Party  is  faced with a serious crisis. Instead  of

sorting  out  the internal differences  first,  the

leadership has come here. This is a blatant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



attempt  by the leadership to bring internal  party

differences to let the Assembly decide. This is  an

attempt to make a decision of this House binding on

the  Party.  Sir, this is an attempt  to  seek  the

support  of  the Opposition the reactionary  Right,

and  the  communal  groups to carry  on  the  fight

against   those   loyal  Party  members   who   are

denouncing their leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, the Minister for Home

Affairs said that those of us who talked of

intra-party  democracy went to the extent of releasing  a

letter to the Press before the by-election. Sir,  I

do  not doubt the ability of the Minister for  Home

Affairs   to  read  the  letter  and  the  covering

statement  and to understand the reasons given  for

the release. A letter is sent by eight Assemblymen,

dated  one Sunday. On Monday morning, the  Chairman

of the Party received that letter. The letter says,

"Please  open  a 51-Branch meeting to  discuss  the

situation   arising  out  of  the  six   unionists'

statement, to discuss merger, and to discuss

intra-party  democracy." On Monday night, Mr C. V. Devan

Nair  went to the University of Malaya to attend  a

forum,  and  committed the Party on the  detainees'

issue and on other issues raised in the letter.  On

Tuesday,  we  received a letter from  the  Chairman

saying,  "We  will  call  a  meeting  at  a  future

suitable  date." I think it was on a Tuesday  night

at  an Anson by-election rally that Mr Devan  Nair

again  talked of the matters we had raised  in  the

letter. Sir, I believe any fool ought to know  that

we  had  to come out with a letter publicly stating

our position clearly to the people. We did not want

to   publish  this  letter.  If  it  had  been  our

intention  to publish this letter in the Press,  we

could  have  done it in the first place.  We  said.

"No, it is a confidential letter. Discuss." We  got

a  reply  saying,  "Yes. We will discuss."  In  the

meantime, the leadership committed the whole Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no extremely grave situation today

in  Singapore.  The leadership  of  the  P.A.P. is

facing  a  grave  situation inside the  Party.  But

surely  the  P.A.P. leadership does not  constitute

Singapore.  We  say  we have no confidence  in  the

leadership  of the Ministers, i.e., the  leadership

of the Party. The Party rank and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



file  have  no  confidence in the  leadership.  The

leadership  have  abandoned  their  principles  and

deviated  to  the  Right. This is a  question  that

should  be discussed inside the Party. On  the  one

hand,  Sir, the rank and file have been denied  the

right to discuss the conduct of the leadership, and

on  the  other, attempts are made to  force  us  to

express confidence in the leadership in this House.

By  any  standards,  Sir, this  is  base  political

trickery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now an open secret that the

sincerity of the Party leaders is questioned within

the Party. The Party Branches have no confidence in

the leadership, and the leadership does not reflect

the  views of the majority in the Party. These  are

facts.  Let  the  leadership  deny  this.  Let  the

leadership  have  the courage to call  a  51-Branch

meeting.  Sir,  the leadership  of  the  P.A.P. is

responsible  only  to  the  Party.  With  all   due

respect,  Sir,  to the integrity of this  House,  I

must say that the leadership of the Party cannot be

tried  here. Let all those non-P.A.P. members  here

not  imagine themselves to be the functionaries  of

the P.A.P. This House is not a branch office of the

P.A.P. Neither is it the P.A.P. headquarters and I am

sure, Sir, your respected and honourable self  will

be unwilling to play the role of a P.A.P. Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call made by the eight Assembly Members for a

conference  of the Central Executive Committee  and

the   51-Branch  Executives  has  still  not   been

answered  by  the leadership. This  call  is  being

repeated practically by all the Branches. The  rank

and  file  demand a conference. The cry for

intra-party  democracy is echoed by the majority  in  the

Party.  Yet the leadership has seen fit  to  ignore

what  is just and moral, but has come here  to  ask

the Opposition to give it a vote of confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Members opposite are

not  the  P.A.P. They are not card-carrying members

of  the P.A.P. They do not have the moral authority

to   express   confidence  or  otherwise   in   the

leadership of a political Party which is faced with

a  domestic  crisis. Sir, the fight is not  between

what  are  termed the non-Communist  Left  and  the

Communist Left. The fight is one of democracy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



the  Party  set-up. The struggle within the  Party,

Sir,  is  one between those loyal to the ideals  of

the    Party   and   the   leadership   which   has

fundamentally  deviated from this. It  is  a  fight

between those who resolutely stand on principles on

which the P.A.P. was overwhelmingly elected by  the

people in May 1959 and the leaders of the Party who

have sold out the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is an intra-party fight against the

leaders  who  have betrayed the confidence  of  the

people.  In  this connection, how  does  the  grave

situation arise? I say to the Ministers:  You  have

done  enough  harm  to the people.  Please  do  not

provoke  their  temper. The responsibility  of  the

leadership  is  to seek to resolve  internal  party

differences  within  the  Party  in  a   democratic

manner.  It  is  the business of the leadership  to

answer  charges, facing them inside the Party,  and

not  ignore those who constitute the P.A.P. and run

to  the  reactionary  forces in the  Opposition - the

S.P.A. and  the like for a mandate to deceive  the

people.  Why has the leadership no courage to  hold

democratic  discussions within the Party?  Why  has

the   leadership   not  sought   to   resolve   the

differences   inside  the  Party?   Why   has   the

leadership  not  convened  a  meeting  of  the   51

Branches?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately after the Hong Lim by-election,

the Party was faced with a major crisis created  by

the  leadership - the Government wanted  to  resign.

This question was discussed at a conference of  the 51  Branches.

The conference rejected the  proposal

to  resign.  Subsequently a decision was  taken  to

rectify  the mistakes of the leadership,  to  fight

the   Anson   by-election,  hold  another   similar

conference  after  Anson to review  the  Anson

by-election  results,  and to chart  the  future.  The

mistakes were not rectified. The leadership further

committed  the Party without a mandate.  The  Anson

electorate  rejected the Party. Yet  today  when  a

call  is made for the convening of this conference,

the leadership keeps silent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been insinuations in some of the

speeches  made  by  the  Front  Benchers.  All  the

criticisms  coming now are not new  to  them.  They

have  heard of them before. Sir, the cry for

intra-party democracy has been inside the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. ever  since  the Party  came  into  office.

Everyone  of  us here knows this is  so.  They  say

these  are  all  new.  The  call  to  release   the

detainees  is not new. The call to unify the  trade

union  movement is not new. Yet, if the  leadership

thinks  fit to smear, we are quite prepared to  sit

down and listen. But we shall not degenerate to the

level  of  calling them names. Sir, the  leadership

has  one  remarkable ability, and the one  man  who

specialises  in it is the Minister for Culture,  in

calling names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, and a few days before, the talk has been of

the  Communist Left and the non-Communist Left. Two

weeks  ago  it was the stand of the national  Left,

meaning, of course, the P.A.P. leadership. Sir, the

national  Left always reminds me of the nationalist

Left in Germany and Italy, Hitler's and Mussolini's

nationalist Left which had very significant Fascist

tendencies.  Sir,  this  name-calling  is  becoming

farcical. One day we are lunatic Left. Another  day

we  are professional political agitators. Then  one

day  we become fireside revolutionaries, then

beer-hall  revolutionaries, revolutionary  lambs;  what

others?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Never reactionary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Never reactionary. But colonialist

stooges, the British colonialist stooges.  Joke  of

all  jokes! Sir, my point principally is this. When

there is no confidence in the leadership within the

P.A.P.,  why come to this House to seek a  vote  of

confidence from the Opposition? Is it the intention

of  the leadership to make a decision of this House

binding  on the Party? The Whip, Sir, has just  now

said that there will be a meeting called of the  51

Branches after we have taken a decision here.  They

want  to  make this decision binding on the  Party.

Surely,  Sir, the first thing to do is  to  resolve

the   internal   differences   within   the   party

organisation, and then, if necessary, seek  a  vote

of confidence in the legislature. A decision of the

party  conference  is binding on the  parliamentary

group  of  the  Party.  But the  decision  of  this

Assembly  cannot be binding on the  Party.  Sir,  I

challenge the leadership here and now to  have  the

courage to convene a meeting of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branches  and put to them a vote of  confidence

motion  on  the  leadership. Sir,  the  leadership,

having  lost the confidence of the majority in  the

Party, and having betrayed the people, now seeks to

confuse  and  intimidate  the  people.  The   Prime

Minister  talks  in  terms of a  test  of  strength

between  the  non-Communist Left and the  Communist

Left.  The six unionists are smeared as being

anti-merger.  The people are intimidated with  talks  of

the   "many  unpleasant  and  awkward  things   the

Government  will  have to do in order  to  maintain

peace  and order". These are but cheap smears.  The

people  of  Singapore  have not  forgotten  similar

utterances of the former Chief Minister. The people

have  not  forgotten the ruthless actions taken  by

the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  in  the  name   of

maintaining peace and order. But it is a pity, Sir,

that  the  present  leadership of  the  P.A.P. has

forgotten the political fate of the S.P.A. and  the

Liberal Socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we who are dissatisfied and

disgusted with the leadership of the Government and

the  Party, are  forced by the manoeuvres  of  the

leaders to take this stand today.



<br><br>1.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is a bit late in the day to have a

lively debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rapidity with which events have moved

during  the  last  few weeks have been  as

breath-taking as they have been confusing. After two years

of  tranquillity  and stability  under  the  P.A.P.

Government,  we  are  once  more  plunged  into  an

atmosphere of political crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that this crisis should have

coincided  with the re-entry into this  Chamber  of

the  Member  for  Anson and his  re-emergence  into

politics after a permanent retirement is, I  think,

purely coincidental, and I think it only fair  that

he  should  be  absolved from  any  blame  in  this

respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the present crisis has been

brought about as a result of too many people trying

to be too clever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



The  Prime Minister earlier in the debate  outlined

the  forces and counter-forces responsible for  the

present crisis. It is a vast jig-saw puzzle. Though

we  have managed to fit many pieces together,  that

is,  enough  to make sense out of the  strange  and

extraordinary events of the last few  weeks,  there

are  possibly still many pieces missing,  and  with

luck  and assiduity we hope to be able to find  the

other pieces - if not us, then maybe those befuddled

and  over-clever plotters who are now  up  the  gum

tree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one thing is clear. Somebody is

up  the  gum tree, and it clearly is not the P.A.P.

It may be the British. It may be, as the Member for

Thomson  anticipated, the beer-hall revolutionaries

who had hoped to manipulate the British but who  in

fact  have been outwitted by the British. So,  Sir,

in  the not too distant future we shall know who is

up  the gum tree, when sooner or later - and I  think

it  will  be sooner - anxious cries of distress  come

from up the branches. The beer-hall revolutionaries

may   have  been  beguiled  by  the  British   into

attacking and betraying their Party and comrades in

the  P.A.P. in the Anson by-election in the  belief

that  once  the  P.A.P. has been got  rid  off,  or

captured, the revolutionary lambs can gambol  gaily

with the wily British lion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither I nor my colleagues know exactly what the

British  lion will do once the revolutionary  sheep

start  running all over the place. It may  be  that

the  lion  will, like an indulgent shepherd,  allow

itself  to  be bearded in its den for a while,  but

let  me  add that the old British lion's  beard  is

tougher than beards recently sprouted. It  may  be

that  the  wily lion may want to find out how  many

revolutionary  lambs there are in the  fold  before

its  thoughts  turn to more practical purposes - such

as  making mutton chops for lunch out of gambolling

lambs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their information, may I give two recent news

items  which may or may not be of interest to them?

There  was  a radio programme over the B.B.C. last

night  discussing the situation in Singapore. After

outlining the possible challenge to the P.A.P., and

the possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



ouster  of the P.A.P., the commentator gave  it  as

his opinion that the British would not intervene in

case  the P.A.P. withdrew from the political arena.

This  may  be a source of delight, I hope,  to  the

gambolling revolutionaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as against this, may I also draw attention to

another  report in the London Observer  which  says

that  the  constitution  might  be  suspended - which

means, as far as I can see, mutton chops for lunch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, we are not interested how the

sheep and the lion get on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are interested in is the future of the

P.A.P.  Government and the aims  and  policies  for

which   it   stands,   and  more   important,   the

establishment  of an independent, democratic,

non-Communist socialist Malaya. Our primary concern  is

with  the  lives  and destinies  of  the  1,500,000

people who trusted us, and whatever happens we  are

not  going  to sell them out either to the  British

plotters or the beer-hall revolutionaries who  have

been duped by the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our intention to put to the people the whole

truth so that with, their support and trust we  can

bring  to a successful conclusion the fight for  an

independent,  democratic,  non-Communist  socialist

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though we lost an election in

Anson we are happy because our hands are clean. Our

hands are not stained by the blood of colleagues we

have betrayed. One of our Political Secretaries-and

for  the  information of the Member for  Cairnhill,

who  is  very interested in salaries, as far  as  I

know, that Political Secretary is still being  paid

a  salary - at  a forum in the University  of  Malaya

sneered that a wounded P.A.P. Goliath limped out of

Hong Lim to meet the sling shots of David, who, for

your  information,  Sir, happens  to  be  also  the

Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, it is true that the P.A.P. Goliath

limped  out of Hong Lim. But it was not  the  sling

shots  of  David that it met, but those of  another

Goliath  that also limped out of Hong  Lim - the  Lim

Ching Siong Goliath. That is what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>



the Political Secretary forgot to tell those people

who attended the forum at the University of Malaya.

There were two Goliaths, both equally wounded,  but

with this difference. Though the P.A.P. Goliath was

badly   mauled  in  Hong  Lim,  it  went  to  fight

honourably in Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the Lim Ching Siong Goliath, who was

also   mauled  and  wounded?  The  fact  that  this

Goliath, which fought side by side with the P.A.P.,

was able to be at large in Hong Lim, was due to one

thing - that  we,  the  P.A.P.,  never  let  down  or

disavow our friends. If we make a promise, we  will

keep  it, whatever the merits or otherwise of  that

promise.  We kept that promise, but the  Lim  Ching

Siong Goliath limped out of Hong Lim ostensibly  to

fight side by side with the P.A.P. Goliath but,  in

fact,  to  join David to betray a comrade in  Anson

and  in  so doing reduced itself to the proportions

of  a dwarf. It secured a victory for David - and we

are  not blaming David for availing himself of  the

generous assistance given to him. At least  it  may

be  said  of  him that he came out  openly  as  our

political opponent. But not so the Lim Ching  Siong

Goliath.  He and his friends were ready  to  betray

the  Party and the Government with which they  were

openly associated. Mr Lim, Mr Fong Swee Suan  and

Mr  Woodhull  remained  as  Political  Secretaries

while openly indulging in activities calculated  to

bring about the defeat of the P.A.P. candidate  who

also happened to be the President of the T.U.C. and

the S.T.C. These then are the great leaders, men of

upright  character. Let me say, Sir, that a  friend

of  mine told me that even among gangsters there is

some  honour.  When two gangsters get  together  to

fight  another gangster, as long as they fight  the

other  gangster, they observe a minimum  of  honour

and  a certain code of ethics, one of which is that

you  do not stab your friend in the back until  you

have disposed of your common enemy. But never, even

among  gangsters,  do you reduce  yourself  to  the

level of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



sticking  a  dagger into your own comrade  when  he

calls  out  for  help  and thereby  assisting  your

enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any country, Sir, whether it is socialist,

Communist  or  capitalist, when a person  disagrees

with a government with which he is associated or by

whom he is employed to advise and assist, it is the

ordinary  decent practice for him  to  resign  from

office  before publicly opposing and  fighting  the

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously these Political Secretaries, these

gentlemen,  are out to establish new  standards  of

political morality. Betrayal of the Government  and

Party  colleagues  they  are  associated  with  are

presumably  things to be proud  of.  What  is  even

worse,  Sir,  is  that they deluded  eight  of  our

Assemblymen into joining in the betrayal.  Some  of

these  Assemblymen came out with us for four weeks,

I  think,  to  canvass for the P.A.P. candidate  in

Anson. They came with us telling the voters to vote

for  our candidate, the P.A.P. candidate. And  yet,

the  day before Polling Day, they came out  with  a

letter  under  the  pretence  that  they  had  been

provoked  into  publishing it.  If  they  had  been

provoked,  they  could have  still  waited  for  24

hours.  It  was quite clear that what was happening

was  that the present Member for Anson looked  like

losing,  and it therefore became necessary for  the

six trade unionists and for the dupes in the P.A.P.

ranks  to be mobilised to throw in their weight  in

open  intervention  in favour of  our  opponent  in

Anson.  We  know very well that at the last  minute

certain unionists were openly canvassing for  votes

for our opponent in Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these Assemblymen may be thinking

that    it   is   all   great   fun   playing    at

revolutionaries. But they should know what they are

in  for. If they are not Communists, they are going

to  be dupes. I suggest to them that they read what

is   in   store  for  those  who  allow  themselves

unknowingly to be used as dupes. There  is  a  book

called Revolutionary Catechism which was written by

a   young   Russian  revolutionary  called   Sergei

Nechayev.  His  work was greatly admired  by  Lenin

who, though repudiating many of the tenets of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>



catechism,  at least made some of it the  basis  of

his  strategy  and tactics on how to  carry  out  a

revolution. With your permission, Sir, I will  just

read a few extracts. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A good revolutionary is tyrannical towards

himself.   The  revolutionary  must  be  tyrannical

towards  others. All the emotions that  move  human

beings  (things like loyalty, friendship), all  the

soft  and  enervating  feelings  and  kinship - love,

friendship, gratitude and honour - must give way  to

a cold and single-minded passion for revolution.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on to describe what to do with

comrades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When a comrade is in danger [and it is just as

well for some of our colleagues who have been duped

by  other men into betraying our comrades for  them

to  remember this injunction by Nechayev] it may be

necessary  to  determine whether he is  expendable.

The decision must not be arrived at on the basis of

sentiment;  only  the  eventual  success   of   the

revolution has any importance at this juncture.'



<br><br>1.55 a.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair.]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he described the various groups of men that

he  could use as dupes. He named six, but two would

be of some interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The third group consists of people in high

positions,    remarkable    neither    for    their

intelligence nor their energy, but who have wealth,

connections,  influence and power as  a  result  of

their position. We must blackmail them, ferret  out

their  dirty secrets and make them slaves. In  this

way,  their power, their position, their  influence

and  their wealth become an inexhaustible  treasure

and a precious asset in our adventure.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fifth group who can also be used

as dupes, and they are also equally expendable. May

I    suggest    that   some   of   the    beer-hall

revolutionaries pay heed to this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fifth group comprises doctrinaires,

conspirators, revolutionaries, those who orate away

at  meetings  or on paper. They must be  constantly

driven into ambiguous positions, (that is, get them

to  betray  their  friends. That  is  an  ambiguous

position.) They must be compelled to come out  into

the  open and assume real and dangerous tasks (that

might be the next step, the next commitment.)  When

the  revolution is over, the majority of these will

disappear,  but of the rest we shall  make  genuine

revolutionaries.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>



So  to  those  who want to play at revolution  with

dedicated revolutionaries. I suggest they read  the

"Revolutionary Catechism" of Nechayev  because,  at

least,  they would know what is in store  for  them

when  the  real revolutionaries have  decided  that

these people have outlived their usefulness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, getting the tenderfoot revolutionaries to

betray  their  friends is part of the technique  of

commitment.   At   least,   under   the   Communist

technique, if somebody wants to join the  movement,

they  get  them to do something which would  commit

them  and thereafter there is no retreat. In  fact,

part  of the act of commitment is to get people  to

do  things  which  outrage their sense  of  honour,

decency and which go against their conscience;  and

once  the  unfortunate waverers have been  confused

and   persuaded  into  betrayal  of   friends   and

colleagues, then all self-respect is lost  and  all

lines of retreat are cut off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what was all this betrayal in aid of? It now

turns out that all this betrayal was unwittingly to

aid  the super designs of the British. Let me state

here,  Sir,  that I do not for one  moment  believe

that  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong and  his  friends  were

consciously aiding and abetting the designs of  the

British. Our opinion of Mr Lim Ching Siong and his

friends  is  that  they  are not  pro-colonialists,

Right-wingers or even opportunists. I have no doubt

they  believe sincerely in the things in which they

believe. We say that we in the P.A.P. stand for  an

independent,  democratic, non-Communist,  socialist

Malaya. But what has happened is that Mr Lim Ching

Siong  and his friends had hoped to manipulate  the

British.  But as things have turned out, they  have

been  manipulated by the British in the  hope  that

they  would come into open conflict with the P.A.P.

and,  if  necessary, destroy the P.A.P. We  in  the

P.A.P. might have fallen into this trap had we  not

been  able  to  free ourselves of  the  ideological

blinkers  which  obviously have  been  the  driving

purpose  behind  the thinking of Mr  Lim  and  his

friends.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our defeat in Hong Lim, when the bridge

between us and Mr Lim Ching Siong grew wider,  our

first belief was that all the manoeuvrings were  an

attempt  by  pro-Communist elements to  coerce  the

P.A.P. leadership  into  providing  a  favourable

climate for the growth of Communist forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we too have read the Communist theory and

practice  on  united fronts. We  have  read  how  a

united front should be tolerated by Communists only

insofar   as   the  non-Communist  leadership   was

manipulable.  For two years, the P.A.P.  Government

has  steadfastly refused to be manipulated  and  we

knew  that the pro-Communist elements were  getting

fed  up with us. Our initial analysis was that many

of  their manoeuvres after our defeat in Hong  Lim,

though rather irritating, were but usual manoeuvres

to force the P.A.P. to steer off course. After all,

these  manoeuvres have been going on in  the  Party

for many years and for us it has become a matter of

routine to deal with these little pressures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on 2nd June, the six trade Unionists came out

with a statement supporting the P.A.P. in Anson but

asking the P.A.P. to fight for full internal

self-government,  we  were a little angry  but  regarded

this as no more than an aggressive manoeuvre to get

the  P.A.P. to depart from its line of independence

through  merger. When the six trade  unionists  and

Political Secretaries issued this statement  asking

us  to fight for full internal self-government when

constitutional  talks  are  started,  we  were  not

consulted,  though what they asked was  a  complete

reversal of what they and the P.A.P. had stood  for

for years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we dismissed this as another manoeuvre to

make  the P.A.P. leadership uncomfortable. However,

we  were  reassured by the fact that the six  trade

unionists  and  their 43 unions had  endorsed  full

support  for  the P.A.P. in Anson and extolled  the

P.A.P. as the leading anti-colonial force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Party Chairman on 9th June came out

with a statement that the P.A.P. was going to fight

for  nothing less than independence through  merger

in   1963.  It  was  no  more  than  a  strong  and

categorical  reaffirmation of what has always  been

the P.A.P.'s stand. Also the thawing of opinion  in

the   Federation  about  taking  in  Singapore  had

convinced   us   that  merger  was  now   practical

politics.   We   expected  that  this   categorical

statement  of intentions would be well received  by

the  six trade unionists who had for some time been

calling into question our anti-colonial sentiments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a favourable reception, the six trade

unionists and their friends came out with a vicious

and  open attack against the P.A.P. leadership  and

its reaffirmation of the policy of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not then realise why they were so bitter

towards merger. We could not then understand  their

repeated  demand  that we publish  the  details  of

merger,  even though we for our own part  reassured

them  that we had no details about merger  or  even

super-merger. All that had happened  was  that  the

political  units concerned - that is, the Federation,

Singapore,  Borneo,  and so  on - had  more  or  less

indicated  that  they  were  ready  to  endorse  in

principle  the idea of a super-merger.  The  P.A.P.

Government  said  that it endorsed super-merger  in

principle  if  that would speed up  merger  between

Singapore and the Federation. We could not disclose

details,  because  there  were  no  details.   What

puzzled  us was this reversal on merger by Mr  Lim

Ching Siong and his friends. One would have thought

that  the Communists themselves would have welcomed

a  merger, if only to establish Communism on a

pan-Malayan basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more inexplicable was the publication by the

six  unionists, not long after Dr Toh's  statement

on   merger,   of  four  demands - the   release   of

detainees,  the granting of citizenship to  certain

individuals  closely connected with Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong,  the unification of trade unions and greater

freedom of speech, assembly, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our understanding of the situation was that

were the P.A.P. to act on these demands - that is, on

the demand, say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



of  the  release of detainees - then a constitutional

crisis  could  be created leading  to  a  situation

where  the Government might be confronted with  the

prospect   of  resignation,  depending   upon   the

reaction of both the Federation and the British. At

least that was our expectation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the six trade unionists repeatedly asked

us  and in fact mobilised support to ensure that we

did  not resign. Now this was the puzzle. Why  then

were  the  six trade unionists suddenly, after  the

announcement  of  merger, asking us  to  do  things

which,  in the normal course of events, could  lead

to  the resignation of the Government? That was the

puzzle. And again we thought, well, this is another

obscure  manoeuvre on the part of the pro-Communist

elements  to  embarrass the P.A.P. leadership.  In

fact,  in  an  editorial in  Petir,  we  asked  the

unionists   bluntly   whether   they   wanted   the

Government to resign as a result of acting on their

four  immediate demands. Strangely enough,  all  we

got  was  an  evasive reply saying that the  P.A.P.

leadership  had always been talking of  resignation

and that if it resigned the unionists could not  be

held responsible. Somehow they evaded the question.

Why? Because up to 9th June, the whole resources of

their propaganda and manipulations were to see that

the  P.A.P. stayed in power. But when on 9th  June,

the  Chairman of the Party announced that there was

going  to  be  a  merger, the same  unionists  were

forcing us to do things which sooner or later  must

lead   to  a  constitutional  crisis,  or  to   our

resignation.  All  this was  puzzling.  Somehow  we

could  not  explain  it. It was completely  out  of

character.  This was not what they had  been  doing

for  many years. Then just before Polling Day,  Mr

Lim  and his friends opened fire against the P.A.P.

and  openly supported Mr Marshall in the Anson

by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It became clear to us then that what the six

unionists and their friends were out to do  was  to

bring about the defeat of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their last-minute intervention in Anson, through

eight  P.A.P. Assemblymen, was the act that  helped

the  pieces  of the puzzle to fall into  a  pattern

which  suddenly  explained to us what  it  was  all

about.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It dawned on us that our analysis was all wrong,

that  the  actions of Mr Lim Ching Siong  and  his

friends could not be explained away as the kind  of

manoeuvres  they  had indulged in all  these  years

inside the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On the face of it, it suggested a

recklessness on the part of Mr Lim and his friends

which  could, so we thought, lead them to disaster.

And  if the P.A.P. resigned or the Constitution was

suspended, then the Communist elements would be the

first to suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the defects of Mr Lim Ching Siong and

his  friends, they are not reckless men.  They  are

not men who make calculations on pure intuition and

guesswork. So we had to look for the key  piece  in

the   puzzle.  It  had  to  be  an  analysis  which

explained all the facts, which gave rationality  to

what  appeared to be the reckless behaviour of Mr,

Lint Ching Siong and his friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key piece, it turned out, was the British.

Sir,  there  is  a short story by G. K.  Chesterton

where  the  detective almost failed  to  solve  the

murder mystery simply because he had overlooked one

suspect - the postman. The postman is taken  so  much

for  granted  that no suspicion is aroused  by  the

fact that he visited the murdered man's place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the British. We were so preoccupied

with thinking that this was a manoeuvre between the

non-Communist  P.A.P. and the  Communist  elements

that   we   forgot   that   the   British   too-the

postman-were somewhere around.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.14 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, the Prime Minister has sketched out

for  you  the role the British have played  in  all

this.  Now all the pieces fall into place. Mr  Lim

and  his friends were not being reckless in working

for  the downfall of the P.A.P. leadership,  simply

because  they had managed to persuade  the  British

that  they  could - and we know for a fact - with  the

assistance of certain "young turks" take  over  the

Government  and the Party. Mr Lim and his  friends

had,  I  presume, some assurance that if they  took

over or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



if  they created a new united front, nothing  would

happen. In fact, Sir, I may tell you this. When  it

looked  as if the split between the P.A.P. and  the

so-called  trade unionists was becoming more  acute

and growing wider, the editor of one of the English

Sunday papers came to see me as mediator. He asked,

"Why  should the Left drift apart? Can't  something

be  done?"  I  said,  "Well, it is  very  difficult

because   since  then  they  have  made  four   new

demands - internal self-government,  the  release  of

detainees,  and  so  on - which  are  all  completely

contrary to our policy." For example, over the case

of  the  release of the detainees, obviously  there

must be some crisis. This editor told me, with half

a  smile,  obviously knowingly, "Raja, I think  you

don't  know  much  because  these  boys  [i.e. the

unionists]  have  a  good pipeline  with  the  U.K.

Commission." At that time it meant nothing. I  took

it  as  just  one of those things.  But  after  our

defeat  in Anson, when Mr Lim Ching Siong and  his

friends,  for no rhyme or reason, went all  out  to

secure  defeat for the P.A.P. with which they  were

openly  associated  and  were  prepared  to   brand

themselves     publicly    as     betrayers     and

traitors - nobody can overlook that fact - then we felt

that  the  reason why they were moved to  commit  a

gross  act  of betrayal was that somehow  or  other

they had been deluded by the British into believing

that  betraying  the P.A.P. did  not  matter;  they

might  suffer  humiliation or lose the  respect  of

many  members of the Party, but a bigger stake  was

involved.  Therefore, Mr Lim and his friends  were

deluded   by  the  British  into  opposing   merger

because, somehow, they had been led to believe that

merger  was something which had been signed, sealed

and  delivered, which was a sell-out of  them,  and

that  the  P.A.P. was somehow in cahoots  with  the

Tengku to sell out Mr Lim and his friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that if the P.A.P. could not release the

detainees,  then  the  British  were  prepared   to

release   them   and   they  could   find   another

alternative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



type  of  government or Party which would  be  more

liberal  about these things. They felt  that  after

the  P.A.P. had lost Anson, that defeat could  then

provide  the  necessary fuel to  oust  the  present

leadership of the P.A.P. Government and the  Party.

The immediate plan was for the removal of the Prime

Minister,  and  the whole fury of  the  attack  was

concentrated  on  one individual.  Somehow  it  was

believed  that if one individual was  removed,  the

whole  organisation,  the whole  party,  the  whole

machinery  could be reformed. There was  a  purpose

behind  it.  First, for Prime Minister, they  could

put in somebody else. Many names were mentioned - Dr

Goh,  Dr  Toh. After three months they would  say,

"Well,  there was not enough intra-party democracy.

Out  with  Dr  Toh." Then Dr Goh. "Out  with  Dr

Goh."  One  by  one.  Then somehow  other  patterns

fitted  in. Why were they pressing for the granting

of citizenship to certain people? If the design was

this,  then  probably the Prime Minister  could  be

pushed out and challenged to an election in Tanjong

Pagar.  Then  somebody who had not got  citizenship

but  who had great aspirations and who had probably

managed to sell himself to Lord Selkirk as  just  a

liberal Communist or a Liberal-Socialist would then

contest if he could get citizenship. Then when  the

next  leader of the Party, Dr Toh, was pushed out,

a  big offensive would be mounted - "No, there is not

enough  democracy in the Party. You (Dr Toh)  must

go." Then somebody else if he got citizenship would

stand  for election. In that way the hope was  that

perhaps  in  the  course of time the  Front-benches

could  be  filled  with new  leaders  who,  at  the

moment,  cannot  get  into  the  Assembly,   either

because they have not got citizenship or because of

some  other reason. Anyway, it is quite clear,  and

we  know  for a fact, that there have been  in  our

Party  for the last two or three months young turks

plotting, manipulating, arguing who is to be  Prime

Minister, who is to be the Minister for Finance and

so  on. Some of these men, I think, have been duped

into  believing  that  they were  doing  the  right

thing. But there are five



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



persons  who are far more serious about  revolution

than  any of us are. Therefore, Sir, we have  today

reached  a  situation where a lot  of  things  have

become  clearer.  A  lot  of  the  antics  of   and

betrayals by Mr Lim and his associates are not  so

lunatic and reckless as they look because they have

been  led  to believe that nothing untowards  would

happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the drama is not yet finished. This exposure

now  presents  the  British  and  Mr  Lim  with  a

dilemma - who  will betray whom? Who is  up  the  gum

tree and how will be  come down without running into

disaster?  Anyway, Sir, we of the P.A.P. will  make

our  own  arrangements and manipulate and manoeuvre

as  we  think fit. But Mr Lim and his friends  can

thank  us for one thing - that if we had been  wrong,

if  we  had not seen - what this manoeuvre  was  all

about, then we might have been forced into a  clash

with  Mr Lim and his friends. Fortunately  we  did

not  fall  into the trap and we hope we will  never

fall  into  the  trap or be made dupes  of  by  the

British.



<br><br>2.24 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we    have   been   here   since   2.30   yesterday

afternoon - only 12 hours, Mr Speaker, but  by  your

grace we have been allowed outside this Chamber for

one  hour  in order that we might be more fortified

to  come and listen to the troubles and woes of the

P.A.P., the Party in power. We have been told about

dupes and people who are duped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite innocent in politics.

When  people say something, I believe them. I  take

everything that is said at its face value. I do not

analyse  it  in  the way the Minister  for  Culture

analyses it and reads into it things that  are  not

read into by normal persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I received the motion, "That this House

expresses its confidence in the Government", I  was

a little uncertain as to what exactly it meant. The

motion,  as  it stood, inevitably meant  that  this

Assembly was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



being  called because the public interest  demanded

it  and  that,  therefore, a situation  existed  in

Singapore which merited the calling of the Assembly

which   had  been  adjourned  sine  die   by

the Government. Now, the motion as it stands must  mean

that  the Government is asking the House as a whole

to  express its confidence in all the work  it  has

done  to date, and all the work its hopes to do  so

long  as  it  continues to hold the  reins  of  the

government.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  it   became

pertinent  to  find  out what exactly  this  motion

meant. The work of the last, two years. Now I  look

at  the  Minister for National Development, who  is

well,  and truly asleep at the moment, to  find out

exactly  what  his Ministry has  done.  So  far  as

housing  is  concerned,  very  little.  So  far  as

promises  are concerned, a great deal. I then  turn

to  his  neighbour, the Minister for  Education.  I

will  not say that his Ministry is a complete  flop

in the way the Ministry of National Development has

been a complete flop, but at least the Ministry  of

Education  has  created  a situation  in  Singapore

whereby  parents  are,  dissatisfied,  pupils   are

dissatisfied, teachers are dissatisfied.  So,  Mr,

Speaker,  one  cannot  say that  the  Minister  for

Education has made a great success of his Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the redoubtable Minister for

Labour  and  Law  who has just come  back  after  a

conference on labour problems in Geneva and London.

I  hope the atmosphere there was more congenial  to

him  than  it would have been had he been here.  So

far  as the Ministry of Labour is concerned,  if  I

may  deal  with  that  side of the  Honourable  the

Minister's  Ministry, it has  somehow  not  been  a

howling success. Neither do the people of Singapore

think  he  has  made  a  howling  success  of  that

Ministry.  The  way in which labour  problems  have

been  handled, from my point of view, is completely

unsatisfactory. A Minister for Labour,  seeking  to

bring about a settlement of a trade dispute, to  my

mind,  Mr  Speaker, must try and hold the  balance

equally between the employee and the employer. That

is my understanding of how the Minister should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



behave. I know it is very difficult sometimes, but

he must do his best to give that impression. Unless

he  is  able to give that impression to both sides,

that  he  is  trying  to be  fair  to  both  sides,

inevitably  he  fails in his duty as  Minister  for

Labour. Being Minister for Labour does not mean, to

my  mind, that he must advocate labour blindly  and

disregard whatever rights or equities the  employer

might  have in such a situation. The result now  is

that  in  so  far as the employer is concerned,  he

trembles  when  he goes to the Hon. the  Minister's

Office - not a very happy situation for Singapore. It

could well be that that situation enables labour to

get  everything it wants - a good thing perhaps. But

as  the  Government, it is the duty of the Minister

for  Labour  to  hold the balance  equally  between

these two contesting claimants. I know he says  his

is   a   labour  Government.  His  is   a   workers

Government, but he must also understand that in the

system  of society in which he is working,  capital

and  labour  must play a part, and unless  both  of

them  work  amicably, the economy of  this  country

must  suffer. And to that extent, the Minister  for

Labour  has  failed. So the Labour Ministry  cannot

get  the vote of confidence which this motion seeks

to obtain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about his Ministry of Law? Frankly he has

been so engaged on the labour front that he has not

had much time to devote to the law front. If he had

devoted  as much time to the law front  as  he  had

devoted to the labour front, I do not know what the

situation  with regard to the law front would  have

been. However, that is as it is, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the Hon. the Prime Minister. The

Hon. the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker, is the  most

dexterous  politician that has walked the political

halls  of  Singapore. How long he will continue  to

straddle  both worlds which he hopes to keep  under

his control only time will tell. May I tell this to

the  Hon. the Prime Minister? We on the Opposition

are   really  not  interested  in  these   domestic

squabbles  or on questions whether tie  is  fit  to

lead  them or whether he has their confidence.  But

we, Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  are  interested  in  the  Prime  Minister  of

Singapore. The Prime Minister of Singapore does not

belong to the P.A.P. He belongs to the country, and

unless  the  Prime  Minister understands  that,  we

shall   always  have  trouble  in  Singapore.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister's failing has been

that he has been a party mars first, jockeying  for

power in the Party first and letting the country go

to the dogs. That is what history will write of him

when history is written.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Deputy Prime Minister - the most peaceable

man in the P.A.P. arena, the man who can keep peace

betwixt  the two warring parties. Therefore,  I  do

not  want to say very much about him. He deals with

Ministries  which are not political. He deals  with

the  weather.  The trouble is that  we  cannot  get

enough rain at the moment. Our reservoirs are dried

up, but that is not his fault. That is the fault of

the  heavens  and the gods. They  are  not  in  the

P.A.P. That is not a matter which we can lay at the

doors of the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Minister for Health. Doctors have

resigned. There is a shortage of doctors, and there

are   very   few  specialists  in  the   hospitals.

Discontent  in the medical service. Recruitment  of

Japanese      doctors      from      abroad - further

dissatisfaction  in the service.  Allegations  that

the  Japanese  doctors do not know  what  they  are

doing  or  what  they are prescribing.  A  loss  of

confidence   in  the  hospitals,  and,   therefore,

inevitably,  people go to private practitioners - not

a  very good state of affairs in a society where we

have  a socialist government which is governing  us

and  which should, therefore, provide adequate  and

suitable  hospital  facilities for  the  people  of

Singapore. The hospital facilities today are at the

worst  possible level they have been  in  Singapore

for  a  long, long time. So what confidence can  we

have  in the Minister for Health? Although  I  like

him  very much personally - he is a gentleman and  it

is very difficult to find a gentleman in the P.A.P.

- unfortunately he is one of them, and anything that

is  connected with the P.A.P. seems not to be  able

to  get  on  in  its human relationships  with  the

people.  Now  might  I  tell  the  Hon. the  Prime

Minister this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



However   brilliant  his  Cabinet  might  be,   the

decisions  of  this  brilliant  Cabinet   must   be

implemented  by human beings who are  paid  by  the

Government, who work under the Government and below

those  servants. If the Government  cannot  command

the  respect  and  the  loyalty  of  those  people,

however  brilliant your policies may be, Mr  Prime

Minister,  they  must inevitably  fail.  They  have

failed because-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not as yet aspired to

the  position  of Prime Minister.  The  Member  for

Farrer  Park  must  remember he is  addressing  the

Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Might I remind the Prime Minister then through you,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that if he wishes to govern this

place   well,  there  must  be  humanity   in   his

Government  and  not  this inhumanity  and  driving

people  as  if  they  were  slaves  or  morons   or

machines?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister for Finance. The Minister for

Finance,  able  economist though he  may  be,  must

translate  his theoretical knowledge, his undoubted

theoretical  ability, bring it to  the  ground  and

make  it work in the form of rice and work for  the

people of Singapore. Then, and only then, will  the

people  of Singapore accept him as an able  Finance

Minister.  His  colleagues, I know, think  a  great

deal  of  him,  and so do I, Mr Speaker,  for  his

undoubted ability to analyse a situation  well  and

try  to  present  something on the results  of  his

analysis. Certainly he has great ability. But  what

use  has  that  undoubted ability of  his  been  to

Singapore  during the last two years of his  tenure

of  office? As the Minister himself has  said,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  the  most  pressing  problem   for

Singapore  is  the  question of the  common  market

which  is  to be established between the Federation

and ourselves. Naturally that is the only solution,

and  we  have been waiting anxiously for the  Hon.

the Finance Minister to make some sort of statement

on  this  common  market.  No  statement  has  been

forthcoming.  No statement will be forthcoming,  it

would appear, for a long time. We have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



patient  enough,  Mr Speaker,  Sir, I  think  the

people deserve a reply to this soon. Are you  going

to succeed, may I ask the Hon. the Finance Minister

through you, Mr Speaker, Sir? What has happened to

this  common market? It has been mentioned in  this

House  a long time ago. If we are to have a  common

market, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not going to  wait

for  it for another two or three years. We want  it

now.  The  people want it now. Then  the  Hon. the

Finance Minister puts out his Four-year Development

Programme.  He  tells the people of Singapore  that

this  is the solution to their economic ills.  What

are  the solutions in the Four-year Plan? What  are

his industrial development plans? His steel mill in

Jurong?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Coming up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Coming up! His steel mill in Jurong,

Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You want to take a bet on it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He is bogged down at Kallang. It will

take  him four years to fill it up, and he will  be

out of office by then. And nothing has happened  in

Jurong  yet. Steel mill? Now let us really  analyse

the  position  of the steel mill. He  has  not  got

enough  water to work that steel mill, Mr Speaker,

Sir. He has not got enough water to give the people

of  Singapore to drink, let alone run a steel mill.

Do  not  forget it. He needs 10 million gallons  of

water a day to run this steel mill. That is what he

has  not  told  the  people of Singapore;  and  the

reservoirs  at MacRitchie, Pierce and  Seletar  are

dried  up for the first time in 50 years,  and  the

Prime  Minister  has  the effrontery  to  tell  the

country that Singapore has not had it so good as it

has under his Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have just said that the

gods are responsible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. Now that the Prime Minister has

brought me back to it, I remember the Minister  for

Culture  in  one  of his speeches during  the  1959

elections  said,  "We  do  not  leave  anything  to

chance.  We do not leave anything to the  gods.  We

plan them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



ourselves and we see that we deliver the  goods  on

our plans." And the Prime Minister was bleating the

other  day when he was faced with a water shortage,

"What  can  I do? I have not had rain. The  sky  is

against  me. The gods are against me." Now is  this

the  sort  of  cry a socialist Prime Minister  lets

out, Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask you, when he faces the

country with a water shortage? More of that  later,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will come back to that  later.

So much for the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Hon. the Minister for Home Affairs, who

is  happily  married.  He is  one  of  the  quieter

Ministers   of  the  P.A.P.  Government,   a   very

difficult gentleman to fathom, as all Ministers for

the  Interior  should be. I believe he  knows  more

about  the Communist movement underground than  any

other  Minister  should, because it  is  under  his

portfolio,  as  the police are,  and  therefore  he

should  know exactly what goes on on a lower level.

Yet  we  get  to the situation, Mr Speaker,  where

Singapore  is  in  danger, where the  non-Communist

Left,  with  the  Hon. the Prime  Minister  as  the

leader,  and the Communist Left, of which  Mr  Lim

Ching Siong is the leader, are about to clash,  and

thereby  threatening the whole  of  the  democratic

fabric  with  ruin, and yet the  Minister  for  the

Interior,  the  Minister for Home  Affairs,  thinks

that  everything is all right. He is  quite  happy.

Nothing  has been done about the situation.  He  is

even  now  quite  content not to do anything  about

this  Communist  Left which he says is  threatening

the  very  existence of the Government, a situation

which I find very difficult to understand. If it is

true,  then  what confidence can  we  have  in  his

Ministry? Now for the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nothing very much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Nothing very much! I must say, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that  I  enjoy  listening  to   the

Minister  for  Culture's speeches.  They  are  very

illuminating. They are the speeches of a well-read,

cultured  gentleman. Although my  leader  does  not

think  the  Minister is cultured, I have  different

views about him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You have not been to the same

places!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We have not been to the same places,

no.  But  we might have. So far as the Ministry  of

Culture is concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, its  effort

to   create  a  Malayan  culture  has  been   quite

pathetic. No one, however sympathetic he may be  to

the   Minister  for  Culture,  will  say  that  his

Ministry has been a howling success. So, therefore,

on that basis this motion meant nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really and sincerely thought, Mr Speaker, that

to  summon  this Assembly, which had been adjourned

sine  die,  at  a  moment's notice meant  that  the

country  was in danger. That was the only basis  on

which this House could be summoned. The country was

in   danger.  Public  interest  demanded  that  the

Assembly do meet in order that the Assembly do give

guidance to the Hon. the Prime Minister to meet the

country's    perils,   to   solve   the   country's

difficulties.  So we came here expectantly,  hoping

to  help  the Prime Minister to solve his problems,

because his problems are our problems, if they  are

national  problems. But what do we hear  from  him?

Nothing  urgently national. All this  trouble  with

his Party; all the troubles about the non-Communist

Left  and the Communist Left. They are all  members

of  the  P.A.P. though-this non-Communist Left  and

the  Communist  Left. So it seems  a  purely  party

problem. Somebody has stabbed the Prime Minister in

the  back in the Anson by-election, and he has lost

the  Anson by-election. Therefore, it is a national

calamity. Therefore, we are brought into the House.

So   far  as  the  Opposition  are  concerned,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. can disappear tomorrow and

we  will  not consider it a national calamity.  The

P.A.P. are  entitled to think that it might  be  a

great  loss to the nation. That is their view.  But

to convene the House and say, "Somebody has stabbed

us  in  the  back.  Six of our  members  are  being

difficult. One of our Parliamentary Secretaries  is

not being the gentleman we thought he was, in spite

of  his  medical  training," that is  none  of  our

business.   But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  when   three

Political Secretaries are alleged to have stabbed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



the  Government in the back and are alleged to have

attacked  the  Government in  public,  and  when  a

Parliamentary  Secretary,  particularly   the   one

attached  to  the  Minister for Home  Affairs,  has

disagreed  with the Government openly and publicly,

then it becomes our business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these four issues have become

our  concern, and I ask our Prime Minister what  he

has  done about them. He is playing a sort of  game

with  these three Political Secretaries.  Each  one

saying,  "You resign." "No, I will not resign.  You

tell me to resign." It is as if a game is going on,

Sir, each one waiting for the other to make a move.

What  is  this, Sir? Are we playing a game  in  our

backyard? Does the Prime Minister not realise  that

these  are  national matters?  He  is  not  playing

parlour  games at the moment. These men  are  being

paid out of public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this document which the

Hon. the  Deputy Prime Minister has  laid  on  the

Table  is a very interesting document. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if  you have the document, would you be  good

enough  to take it and look at the date of it?  The

date  is the 12th of August, 1959, two months after

the  P.A.P. came into power, and well  before  the

Budget  debate.  This is what the  secret  document

says about Lim Ching Siong. Paragraph 5 on page  2, Mr Speaker, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of the eight men released, the most important

from  the  security point of view is Mr  Lim  Chin

Siong  for he was the person built up as  the  open

front leader by the M.C.P. in 1955-1956.'



<br><br>That  was  the report of the P.A.P. Government  to

the  Internal  Security  Council  on  the  12th  of

August,   1959.  The  question  of  the   Political

Secretaries, Mr Speaker, Sir, was debated here  at

length during the Budget Session in December  1959.

When  questions  were  raised about  the  Political

Secretaries, the need to appoint them and the  type

of  persons  that were to be appointed,  the  Prime

Minister, with his tongue in his cheek - now that  we

know  about this document - told the House, "Oh, they

are good chaps. They will put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



across our policies to the people." What sort of  a

game was the Prime Minister playing with the House,

Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He was taking you for a ride!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He did not take us for a ride, Mr

Speaker, Sir. He took the people of Singapore for a

ride.  And the people of Singapore will not forgive

him  for that. We might forgive him, but the people

of  Singapore will not. There are indications  that

they  are not forgiving him. And if he goes  on  at

this  rate,  there  are sure signs  they  will  not

forgive  him. We expect the Prime Minister to  play

the  game  by the country. When the Prime  Minister

puts  out  this  document to the Internal  Security

Council and then comes and tells the House  what  a

trustworthy  man Mr Lim Ching Siong is,  and  then

puts  him  in  the  Ministry of Finance,  with  the

Minister for Finance, what may I ask did the  Prime

Minister intend? Did he intend Mr Lim Ching  Siong

to  play chess with the Minister for Finance?  What

games did Mr Lim Ching Siong in fact play with the

Minister for Finance?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They do not talk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> They do not talk? I understand the

Minister  for  Finance has played  chess  with  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs and so understands his game well. I suggest

again  through  you,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  to   the

Minister for Finance this time that he might have a

game  or two of chess with Mr Lim Ching Siong.  If

he  had played a game or two of chess with him,  he

might  have  found out what sort of a man  Mr  Lim

Ching Siong is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister

made  his  announcement  that  there  was  a  water

shortage and asked the people to save water and not

to  waste  it, the leader of the Alliance  wrote  a

letter  to the Deputy Prime Minister, as Leader  of

the  House, suggesting to him that the shortage  of

water supply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



was  of such a nature and of such importance to the

public  interest that it merited the recall of  the

Assembly. But, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister

refused  the request. He said it was not  important

at  all. And yet the Prime Minister has brought  us

here, Mr Speaker, Sir, not because of any national

calamity that is about to befall us or to beset us,

but  because he wants us to solve his little  party

personal problems. I entirely agree with the Member

for  Thomson  that the question  of  the  trial  of

P.A.P. members and the leadership of the P.A.P  is

not  a  matter  for us. If they want  an  impartial

Chairman,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I venture  to  suggest

they  should go to somebody else, and not  to  you.

Since  they  cannot trust the chairmanship  to  Dr

Toh, I think they will have to go to somebody else.

But to bring the whole House here in order to force

a  vote  of  confidence on the Government,  because

there are defections in his own party group, is,  I

regret   to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  using   the

parliamentary machine to solve the Prime Minister's

personal  difficulties. It is a complete  abuse  of

the process of parliamentary government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what exactly did the Prime Minister tell us?

He  spoke to us for about 55 precious minutes,  and

he  said  precious  little. All he  said  were  two

things:  "We  do  not  intend  to  take  repressive

measures  against the Communists. Our  duty  is  to

preserve  the P.A.P." That was his song;  that  was

his  line; and that was what he repeated  over  and

over again in his inimitable English. Over and over

again,  "We  are not going to fight the Communists.

We  are going to let the British fight them, it  is

not  our business to fight the Communists. They are

about  to cut our throats, but we do not care about

that.  We  will let the British come and stop  them

from   cutting  our  throats."  That  was   how   I

understood  the Prime Minister. He says  his  first

job is to preserve his Party. Let the country go to

the dogs, it does not matter. He has already let it

go  to the dogs once before, you may remember,  Mr

Speaker, when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



the   ex-Minister  for  National  Development   was

misbehaving himself. He misbehaved himself for well

over  a year before the Prime Minister sacked  him.

He  nearly  brought  the country  to  a  standstill

before the Prime Minister acted. The Prime Minister

waited for a suitable opportunity to sack him.  The

suitable  opportunity was not in relevance  to  the

State, Mr Speaker, Sir, It was in relevance to his

own  position  in the Party. When the  proper  time

came,  he sacked him. And now he thinks it  is  the

proper  time again to use the parliamentary machine

to solve his own personal difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to say very much more. I think

I  have said enough. Time is getting on and  it  is

already  3 o'clock in the morning. By the time  the

Prime  Minister  finishes,  it  might  well  be   4

o'clock. But I want to say this, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

We  are not interested in the personal squabbles of

the  People's Action Party. But to the extent  that

their  personal  squabbles are  matters  of  public

interest  in so far as the Ministers are concerned,

and if as a result of the personal squabbles in the

Party  the  Ministers lose the faith and confidence

of their Back-benchers, then it becomes a matter of

interest  to  the Assembly as a whole  and  to  the

country at large. In parliamentary practice if  the

Ministers have not got the faith, the following and

the confidence of the Party, then there is only one

course  open to them, and who knows it better  than

the  Prime Minister himself, who is so well skilled

in  constitutional practice? But this I will ask of

the Prime Minister, that so long as he is the Prime

Minister  he  should act the Prime Minister  as  he

belongs  to the State of Singapore first.  He  must

not  put  his party interests before those  of  his

country.  I  am  entitled to  demand  this  of  him

because  I speak for the country on this matter.  I

do  not  speak  as  a Party man.  I  speak  as  one

interested in parliamentary democracy; and  in  the

parliamentary democratic system the Prime  Minister

belongs  to  the  country first and  to  his  Party

afterwards. Let him act the Prime Minister  and  we

will support him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister, in reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.57 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

surprised  to hear from the Members of  this  House

that  the motion has been brought into this Chamber

because of a domestic quarrel in the P.A.P. We have

spent, in a record session, 13 solid hours on  this

motion, which quite clearly has agitated everybody.

I  say, let us not confuse the people of Singapore.

A  collision of ideological forces has taken place.

Nobody  knows what the end result is going  to  be.

But  what we do know is that we are in for a  rough

time.  Whether this Government continues in  office

because  of  certain inroads made by the  Communist

Left into the will to resist of certain members  of

the  P.A.P. back-benchers  becomes  a  matter   of

survival  of the Government. That is why the  House

is in session. Very simply, as I have written to my

colleague,  the  Leader of the  House,  before  the

battle  is  joined, as I think it  inevitably  must

now,  you  have  to be sure that  the  people  will

follow you into battle. I have the assurance of  my

colleagues  that they are prepared to  do  this.  I

have come to this Assembly in order that the P.A.P.

Assemblymen can publicly declare where they  stand.

I  am not interested, Mr Speaker, Sir, as has been

suggested by some P.A.P. Assemblymen, in continuing

in  office on the strength of the Opposition.  They

know,  and I know, that that is the surest  way  to

political demise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was disappointed to listen to the evasive

rejoinders that have been made to the speech I made

in  moving my motion - disappointed because  all  the

speakers  were  reading  set  speeches  which  were

rendered out of date by the new situation which has

arisen  as a result of our disclosing the facts  to

the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park  is not very sensitive in guessing the

under-currents of the political forces now in tussle.  If

he were aware, as I think it is my duty to make him

and  the people of Singapore aware, that if we  are

not careful we shall run into a first-class crisis,

then  I think he would not have treated this debate

in the frivolous manner that he did.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a feeling that in these matters perhaps

some  Members  do  not  wish  to  face  up  to  the

situation.  The  Parliamentary Secretaries  to  the

Ministries  of  Health and Home  Affairs  and  some

P.A.P.  Assemblymen have taken the line that  there

is  no  necessity  for the vote of confidence,  and

have  requested  me  to  withdraw  the  motion.  Of

course,  they  do not wish to have to  say  openly,

yes,  they are going into battle. Well, that  is  a

matter  for  them to decide. I say the  moment  for

decision has now come. They did not wish to  resign

when after Hong Lim it was suggested that we should

return  the  mandate  to  the  electorate.  I   now

discover  that  what they want is  to  capture  the

power which we, the present leadership, won for the

Party  in 1959. It is our duty to see that  no  one

perverts  this  power for any other  purposes  than

those for what the people voted it. If they want to

assume  power and are prepared to face the  hazards

that  have  been  outlined  by  my  colleague   the

Minister  for  Finance,  then  let  them  call  for

general  elections so that they can seek  authority

from  the people, and not usurp the power from  us.

If  they  wish to take this course, let  them  vote

against  the motion. There is no question  of  this

motion  being withdrawn. We are going  into  recess

till  the end of October and we have to know  where

the country stands. When carried, today's vote will

give  the  Government the constitutional  right  to

carry on. But we ourselves have clearly stated that

it  is  the moral authority and the support of  the

people  that  is  so  vital for  good  and  orderly

government.  It  is therefore our business  at

an appropriate  time, after taking such steps  as  are

necessary in the long term interest of the  people,

to  return  the power back to the people  in  order

that  they can decide on who should guide them  and

whither they should go. Most important in the  next

few   months   is  our  business  to  present   the

conditions  for  merger to the  people.  I  do  not

believe  I can assist Members on the other side  of

the  House by explaining why, in my submission,  we

are  unlikely  to  establish these  conditions  for

merger if we act as the former Government did.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote, Mr Speaker, Sir, from a political

statement we made at the beginning of this year  in

which  I  hope, if Members opposite have the  time,

they might find some elucidation? On page 6 of  the 1960 Anniversary Souvenir number, we said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merger between the Federation and Singapore is

historically inevitable. The man made  boundary  at

the  Straits of Johore will disappear as  must  all

the  other  freak colonial frontiers bequeathed  to

newly  independent colonial territories by the  map

drawers and surveyors of the colonial era.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simply that the Federation cannot

afford to have a hostile Singapore. So far we  have

emphasised  the  importance of  the  Federation  to

Singapore.  Lest there is any danger of  forgetting

it,   let  us  remind  people  that  Singapore   is

important   to   the  Federation   militarily   and

politically.  Militarily and politically  Singapore

and  the  Federation are one unit. Colonialism  has

made  a  technically international frontier on  the

Straits  of Johore and created two states.  But  no

soldier  can  devise a front to make Singapore  and

the   Federation  two  instead  of   one   military

situation.   He   who  conquers   Malaya   conquers

Singapore.  The Japanese proved it. And  conversely

he  who  holds  Singapore absorbs Malaya.  Stamford

Raffles   proved  it.  Perhaps  it  is   worthwhile

remembering  that it is the same British  Army,  on

both   sides  of  the  causeway,  though   on   the

Federation  side  it  is  there  by  invitation  on

friendly  defence treaty with the Federation  Army.

And  no  politician  has yet devised  a  method  to

prevent  news and events from spreading across  the

causeway. Every political action in the Federation,

in  language,  education, taxation, and  all  other

fields  of government, affects and has repercussion

in  Singapore.  And the converse  is  equally  true

however  much  people  may  try  to  minimise   the

reactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... this delicate balance cannot last forever. The

present  balance of power and forces is an  interim

one.  For  finally  the  Federation  and  Singapore

positions  will  have  to  be  contained   by   one

authority, or the Federation will run the  risk  of

having Singapore fall into hostile hands and  later

have  to face more dangerous military and political

consequences.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain simply that if we are to win this

battle  in men's minds, it is not a simple question

as   the  Member  for  Thomson  has  suggested,  of

provoking  a  riot and then doing a purge,  because

the  end  result  of  having provoked  a  riot  and

executed  a purge is to have failed in the argument

in  the  minds of the people. I do not know who  is

the more courageous - the man who knows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



the  course  of events that are likely to  develop,

who  knows  that the malady is likely to get  worse

before  it  gets  better,  who  calmly  faces  that

prospect  and is prepared for the rigours  that  he

will go through; and the other who in alarm takes a

short-cut,  and  thus a purgative. Whoever  is  the

more  courageous - I have no doubt whatsoever,  which

of the two is the wiser course: getting home to the

people,  not  this froth that Communism   is  evil,

that  they  are all evil men talking villainy,  but

the  real  truth  that Communism  is  a  tremendous

challenge that has to be met, that it is a  battle

for  men's minds and loyalties. I have seen in this

very Chamber men's minds and loyalties switch under

the  heat  and pressure of persuasion, and  perhaps

silent  intimidation  by  the  Communist  that  the

future belongs to him, that the east wind is  going

stronger  than  the west wind,  and  that  when  he

prevails  one day, he will deal with all those  who

have opposed him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to my friend, the Member for Thomson, I

find  it  difficult to believe that two years  ago,

before  we  took office, I spent a whole week  with

him  up in the mountains and presented him with the

perils that we would encounter when we took office.

He  was  a non-Communist. He fought with me in  the

S.T.C.  Union  to prevent that union  from  failing

under Communist domination. He knew what the perils

were.  He  knows  what  is  Communism.  He  is   no

opportunist. And he made up his mind  that  he  was

coming  with us. One year ago, after constant  heat

and pressure from the Communists, he came to see me

in  hospital where I was convalescing from a  minor

operation, and, in the presence of two others, said

that  he thought it was a great mistake our  having

assumed power under these circumstances and that we

should  vacate. He was fighting the Communists  and

having  a  tough  time. Then one  day,  two  months

later,  after he came back from England, he decided

that he was on the wrong side and that he was going

over to the side that was going to win. He told  me

quite frankly that he thinks the Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



are bound to win, that he is not prepared to be  an

anti-Communist  or  to  have  a  fight  with  them.

Therefore,  he insisted that we must do this,  that

and the other. Then our ideological troubles began.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serious problem that we face because we

are   tapping  from  the  same  oilfield   as   the

Communists. The choice for democratic socialism  is

either  to battle for your political activists  who

have  convictions,  guts,  energy,  enthusiasm  and

drive,  and  who  are motivated not  altogether  by

personal   considerations;  or  to  rely   on   men

motivated for purely selfish motives, for position,

power  and profit. Therefore we tap from  the  same

oilfield. There is no person now on the P.A.P. side

who  can  say he did not know what he was  in  for.

Everyone,  before  he  came  in,  signed  a  solemn

document  that  he stood by the principles  of  the

Party  and,  in  particular, stood  by  the  Fourth

Anniversary Souvenir number wherein we made a clear

demarcation line between where we stood  and  where

the Communists stood. I never believed that I would

hear  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Home Affairs mouth words and phrases which  he

barely  understands, and give an analysis  which  I

think  deep down in his heart he knows is spurious.

But he has been convinced that that is the easy way

out,  and  so the rot sets in. The will  to  resist

disappears and they say, "In the name of democracy,

socialism,  intra-party democracy, let  us  go  and

float with them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the crisis - a crisis which even the

democratic States in Western Europe are  facing,  a

crisis   which   certainly  we  are   facing.   The

alternatives  are, either to have  a  Labour  Front

type government with Lib-Socs, consisting of people

who  are  relatively effete, who can be bought  and

sold  across the counter, and who will buy and sell

others,  or  to tap the same half per cent  of  the

population  which  is politically  alert.  We  have

tapped them, everyone of them. Today the eight  who

have  dissented from us are men who have moved into

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



world, the no-man's-land between the Communists and

us,  the  unions and the mass organisations,  where

words like "socialism" mean Communism or democratic

socialism, where things are hazy, where you do  not

want  them  to be clear, but where they  are  clear

enough  when you speak to each other in the  hidden

language  which those who are initiated understand.

That is the crisis we are faced with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle for the control of the P.A.P. as a

Party  is not a problem. That will be resolved.  We

are  veterans of many a battle since the Party  was

first  formed in 1954, and I have informed some  of

my  friends  behind me that we are unmoved  at  the

prospect  of another battle. It is not  the  P.A.P.

that is in danger, because we have built in all the

safeguards. We know, in tapping the oilfield,  that

explosions may occur from time to time and we  have

taken the necessary precautions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, men who joined the Party like the

Parliamentary  Secretaries  in  the  Ministries  of

Health and Home Affairs only recently in 1959, when

our  star  was  in the ascendent, are  rattled  and

shaken  to  the  point  of  contemplating  changing

stands  by the temporary setbacks in Hong  Lim  and

Anson.  They  do not understand that the  political

leadership,  if it is to survive, must be  resolute

and  must be prepared to face up to unpleasantness.

We  have  sufficient  confidence  in  the  ultimate

triumph  of our analysis and the fact that  because

the  analysis is correct we are more likely to have

the  appropriate political strategy. Let  everybody

take  his  stand in the knowledge that  it  is  not

possible to insure with both sides: the P.A.P.,  if

democratic  socialism continues, or the Communists,

if   Communism  triumphs.  We  in  the  leadership,

whatever  our multifarious shortcomings  which  our

erstwhile   admirers   and  followers   have   been

labouring this evening, have nailed our colours  to

the mast several years ago before we took power  in

the last elections. Those who are contemplating  an

assault  on  the  P.A.P. citadel  should  carefully

consider the injuries they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



would  be inflicting on themselves and on  us,  and

also their chances of ultimate success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time this House reconvenes, Mr Speaker, we

hope  everybody will have appraised  themselves  of

the facts of life in Malaya as they really are, and

will  have prepared themselves psychologically  for

the  decisions  they will have  to  make  on  their

future;   for  on  the  people's  decision  depends

whether  this  little experiment in  representative

government in Singapore survives or withers away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has insinuated that this is a

government of job-seekers, that we want to carry on

in  office after the electorate has rejected us  on

two  occasions. And he went further and accused  me

of  wishing to remain Prime Minister come what may.

I  wish  it were true, that I get as much enjoyment

out  of being Prime Minister as he did out of being

Chief  Minister, it is not the sensation  of  power

that  fills  me with elation. To abscond  now  when

trouble brews would be an act of cowardice, and  my

colleagues  have  asked me to  carry  on  and  have

assured  me that they are prepared to come together

in  the  battle. I myself was of the opinion  after

Hong Lim that the best thing for the country was  a

fresh  election  and  another government,  probably

still a P.A.P. one with a fresh mandate. Because we

have  insuperable problems to resolve and they  can

only  be  resolved  if  the  government  has  moral

authority  to  govern.  But now,  faced  with  this

challenge   of  capture  and  perversion   of   the

government  under  the  P.A.P. banner,  a   silent

transfer of the driver and a change in direction, I

say  it  is  our business to stay put and  see  the

thing  through  as  quickly  as  we  can  with  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Political Secretaries, Sir, I

think  the Member for Farrer Park made one valuable

point - that we knew in August 1959 and we knew well

before  August  1959  the  respective  position  of

everyone. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



is no smear, no name-calling. It is a waste of time

calling names, unless you can nail a man down.  And

from  now  on those who take us on must be prepared

to  nail us down and be nailed down by us. We  have

said  that.  Let  me read this document  which  the

Leader of the House has tabled:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of the eight men released, the most important

from  the  security point of view is Mr  Lim  Chin

Siong  for he was the person built up as  the  open

front leader by the M.C.P. in 1955-1956. Once he is

released, it makes very little difference from  the

point  of  view of subversion whether the remaining

forty-odd  detainees are released  or  not  because

they   cannot   materially  affect   the   security

position. Whether they be inside detention camps or

outside   in   active  participation  the   overall

position is not basically different. Of the  eight,

the  P.A.P. Government has reasons to believe  that

five,  not including Lim Chin Siong, genuinely  and

sincerely   subscribe  to  the  P.A.P. democratic

socialist ideology.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  do  not think anybody who  has  not  gone

through  the experience of working at ground  level

with  these  men  can understand the  metamorphosis

that  can  take  place  in men's  minds  and  men's

intentions.  You can guess what a man is,  but  you

are never really sure. You can know what a man does

because  it  is  an  overt act,  but  his  ultimate

conviction - whether  he  is  a   Communist,   or   a

socialist, or a social democrat - is something  which

you  have  to piece together over a long period  of

time. Constant and consistent conduct leads you  to

the  conclusion  that  a person  is  or  is  not  a

Communist. And even if he is at a certain time,  as

I  have  said of my friend Mr Bani in 1959,  quite

clearly  he  knew where he stood and he  knew  what

Communism  was  about because he has been  fighting

this and has met all these problems before, but  he

can  change his opinion, and has a right to  change

his opinion. Therefore, when they came out and made

a  declaration on their release on the 4th of June,

that  they  stood  firmly and squarely  behind  the

P.A.P. and stated their position in print - we  felt

that  it was worth a try. It was a battle for men's

minds. I would say, at the time when Mr Fong  Swee

Suan  came out from prison on the 4th of  June,  he

was  not a Communist, he was a democratic socialist

with us. And I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



would  say  that  at  the  time  he  was  appointed

Political Secretary to the Minister for Labour,  he

was  genuinely  and sincerely trying  to  work  the

system.  But  in  the process of  that  battle,  he

melted  and  was reformed in their  ranks,  in  the

emotional   hothouse   of   the   Chinese   Malayan

revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something which only those who have been

through  the  experience  can  know.  If  you  have

squatted  in  the  union, seen the  activists  work

absolutely selflessly, day and night, for a  cause,

utterly ruthless and fanatical, then you understand

how  a  man  suddenly melt away. That  is  what  is

happening  in  Singapore. That is the  world  which

Members  on  the  other side of the  House  do  not

understand, except perhaps the three former members

of  the  P.A.P.  I think the Member  for  Hong  Lim

understands  this very well. As my  colleague,  the

Minister  for Finance, has said, having  complained

of   the   undemocratic  nature   of   the   P.A.P.

Constitution  and  of  the  cadre  membership,  the

Member for Hong Lim has, from his own experience in

the  P.A.P., drafted and submitted for registration

a  constitution  which  is tighter  and  harder  to

capture   than  the  P.A.P.'s.  We  hold  a   cadre

conference  bi-annually.  He  wants  to  hold   one

triennially  and  so on. He has  gone  through  the

mill. He knows what it is all about. Let us not kid

ourselves  about intra-party democracy.  Every  man

who complains of it signed his application form for

membership  that  "I  accept  the  rules   of   the

constitution."   He   knew   what   was   in    the

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how the game is played. We allowed free

play on the ground in order to tap the neutrals, to

bring  the  activists into action in our  branches.

But  we  also  run  the risk - and  we  know  that - of

getting  chaps  planted in.  Therefore,  the  first

entree is not the ground organisation in the  open.

It  can be compared if you like to the Pope and his

pontiffs. The cardinals appoint the Pope; the  Pope

appoints  the  cardinals. It is a system  that  has

existed  some  2,000 years and there must  be  some

merit  in it. The Communists have that system  too.

And I say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



if you try to run the democratic system of the mass

political  party, unless it is a  party  not  worth

capturing,  like the Labour Front  or  S.P.A.,  you

will  have  no  end of trouble. We  are  worth  the

capture; that is the point. We have spent two years

in  office, and the Party is still ticking. We went

down  in  Hong Lim and I think the Member for  Hong

Lim knows - win or lose - we gave him a fight for seven

weeks.  The organisation is there, it is worth  the

capture. And I say to them who are thinking of

it - think again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important now for me to answer why

we  took them in. We took a chance. We lost out  in

several  cases.  It is a risk that was  calculated,

and so it has to be. It may be that many interested

people will say that what we, have disclosed  is  a

fairy tale. I do not think the Member for Anson  is

an  interested person. But I think there  are  many

interested  persons who would like to repeat  that,

and  if  they could get him to repeat it  and  help

more people to repeat it, to make them believe  it,

it  will help to cloud the issue. Those of  us  who

have lived through the events of the mass agitation

of  the last few years, especially since 1955, know

that this is not a bogey but an ogre which can send

the creeps into a man's soul. They can put the fear

of  God  into intelligent people and convince  them

that the future belongs to them. Hence the weak and

wobbly  line  taken  by some of the  speakers  this

evening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with sadness that I watch these men who have

been  my friends and comrades, some for many years.

But  most  of  them  are the newer  members.  Their

resolution  melted  as  the  heat  of  the   battle

intensified.  They are not crooks and  rogues  like

those  who sat on the last Government benches,  but

they lacked sternness of purpose in the face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



of  an  adversary  who mounts a massive  effort  at

persuasion and the silent intimidation  of  who  is

the  winner in the long run. But I am proud to  say

that many have stood up to the test of the occasion

as  the effort against us is mounted, and some feel

so  strongly that they have come out from  hospital

to  cast  a  vote tonight. It is not for  fun,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that these things are done. It is not

to  settle  a party conflict. That can  be  settled

because  we  have  built in the safeguards  in  the

constitution of the Party. They can rock us, damage

us;  but so can we them. But if a silent conversion

is  made  in  this Chamber, then I say the  country

will rock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a series of extracts from the

document  signed by the three political Secretaries

together  with Mr Devan Nair, and Mr  Chan  Chiaw

Thor when they were released. And I say - I have said

it  before - that it was on the basis of this written

undertaking of where they stood that they came into

the  Government  with us. And if  they  move  their

stand  from this, then we must part company. It  is

not   a  manifestation  of  courage  just  to  sack

Political Secretaries and make martyrs out of them.

They  have been my friends and colleagues over many

years  in  a common struggle. They have  chosen  to

betray us. But even in moments of anger I think  we

should   act  soberly  and  calmly  and  not   make

unnecessary martyrs out of people. Let me read what

they said: Page 1, paragraph 2 of the statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to immediate tasks, particularly in

the  new  phase since the achievement of  political

independence  by  the  Federation  of  Malaya,   we

endorse  the  stand  taken by  the  P.A.P. in  the

document "The New Phase After Merdeka - Our Tasks and

Policy" published in the 1958 annual souvenir issue

of the Party.'



<br><br>Page 2, second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The real struggle for socialism in Malaya can

only   begin  when  our  people,  Malays,  Chinese,

Indians are able to transcend the communal cultural

and  linguistic  barriers and  loyalties  which  at

present  divide them, and embrace a common  Malayan

loyalty    and   cultivate   a   common    national

consciousness.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



Page 3, paragraph 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would be a mistake to regard the non-inclusion

of  Singapore  in  the  independent  Federation  of

Malaya  as  being due solely to British  chicanery.

The  British, of course, cannot escape their  share

of  responsibility for this cruel  amputation.  The

fact  remains,  however,  that  the  exclusion   of

Singapore  is  also the reflection of  the  genuine

fear  of the Malay majority in the Federation  that

the Chinese majority in Singapore are incapable  of

a  Malaya-centred loyalty and cannot be assimilated

into  a Malaya-centred nationalism. It is up to  us

in Singapore to prove that the fears and suspicions

of  our  Malay  brethren across  the  causeway  are

groundless.  In  the words of the  P.A.P.'s  policy

statement, "The New Phase After Merdeka".'



<br><br>And  here they quoted this and adopted it as  their

own:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"It must be demonstrated to three million Malays

in  the Federation that the one million Chinese  in

Singapore  are  ready,  willing  and  able  to   be

absorbed  as one Malayan people, all able to  speak

Malay,  and  willing  to  work  together  for   the

economic betterment and upliftment of the Malays as

equals of the other races."'



<br><br>And  this is what is interesting. Page 5, paragraph

3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It was not the might of British arms which

defeated  the armed revolt led by the  M.C.P.,  but

the failure of the M.C.P. to establish itself as  a

nationally  based  movement. And  thereby  hangs  a

lesson  which  Malayan socialists  will  ignore  at

their peril.'



<br><br>And  I  say, on this issue of merger, if they could

ignore  it, they would fight it at their peril.  In

the last paragraph, page 6, they said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the achievement of political independence by

the Federation of Malaya, a new phase has begun.'



<br><br>I  am  afraid,  Sir, they have not  quite  adjusted

themselves to this new phase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that Mr Lim Ching

Siong  does  not  oppose  merger.  The  Member  for

Thomson has asked me to quote any single reference,

any  single line which is hostile to merger. I  say

the  open conflict would never have taken place and

they  would never have been so stupid as to  betray

us,  and dealt us a treacherous blow in Anson,  but

for  the  fact that they were bitterly  opposed  to

merger or super



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



merger.   It  is  on  this  basic  and  fundamental

division that we have now parted ways. Let me quote

you a series of extracts, Mr Speaker, Sir, to show

where  they  really stand on merger, although  from

time  to time, because it is such a difficult issue

on  which to back-pedal, wobbling has taken  place.

On  the  13th  of June, Mr Lim together  with  the

Member  for  Thomson  and  four  others  issued   a

statement which can only be taken as a challenge to

the statement made by the Chairman of the P.A.P. on

the  9th  of  June. They stated  that  it  must  be

understood that any constitutional arrangement that

frustrates  the people's struggle for  freedom  and

democracy will be resisted by the people. Here they

are  saying  that  merger, independence,  something

which  is  almost a dogma with the P.A.P. and  all

socialists,  is  a sell-out. "understood  that  any

constitutional arrangement that frustrates" freedom

and   democracy;  going  in  as  a  State  of   the

Federation to freedom; frustrating democracy.  What

are we talking about? Then on the 24th of June, Mr

Lim in a letter to the Straits Times said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merger, we have hitherto come to understand, was

a  thing  of  the  distant future. However,  recent

statements by leaders of the Federation hold out an

earlier   promise  of  the  union  of   these   two

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging as it is, the question now arises, on

what  terms  will this be effected? The  right-wing

government  in  the  Federation  and  a   left-wing

government  in Singapore apply certain  conflicting

principles.'



<br><br>All  kinds of difficulties are now contemplated and

envisaged because obviously somebody does not  like

it. He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merger is a matter that must be worked out to a

great  degree of clarity. It is not a thing  to  be

accepted without firmly defined purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great sacrifices have been made by the people to

achieve  their  present position in  Singapore  and

merger  must  never turn out to a sell-out  of  any

sort.'



<br><br>How  can  merger  be  a  sell-out  when  it  is   a

proclaimed  objective of the political  party  that

won  the last elections with this as a major  plank

in  its  platform? But then they have their various

reasons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



for   it,   their  different  fears  to  which   my

colleague, the Minister for Finance, has referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we could go on, Mr Speaker, Sir. But I

think  this is only the beginning of the  argument.

As  I have said, something which perhaps the Member

for  Farrer  Park may consider worth contemplating,

if you lock a man up and you have not divulged what

he  represents,  you have left  a  whole  following

believing in that idea. And new leaders will spring

up and lead the followers with those predilections.

I say this is an argument which we can win, because

I think if they oppose merger they will be making a

mistake  second  only  to  the  starting   of   the

Emergency in 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that if Singapore goes in with the

Federation we should have insured Singapore against

Communism. That is not the case. All you have  done

is to stabilise the position, give it a viable base

from  which to build a relatively healthy  society.

We  are  left with a dismembered portion of a  once

sizeable   Empire   which   included   the   Borneo

territories. We governed from Singapore - the British

did - Labuan,  North Borneo, the Cocos  Islands  (now

gone, to Australia), Penang and all the rest of  it

in  this  region.  And we are  left  with  all  the

monuments of a former colonial capital without  the

wherewithal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say the first objective is to ensure that you

win this battle in people's minds. This is the only

road  to  survival. It is so. If we cannot convince

them  that it is so, then I say the battle is lost.

And  then, of course, brute force will be used. And

why should we use brute force? Because I say it  is

unnecessary.  The  brute force, anyway,  is  there,

because  this is a S.E.A.T.O. base. If  people  are

foolish  enough to believe that they have  got  the

freedom  of the island to upset the base,  or  that

they  can  have the freedom of the island  provided

they  give  a verbal guarantee about the  base  not

being upset, then I wish them well. For my part, as

I  have stated at the opening, under conditions  of

absolute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



safety  for  the  life and limb of every  political

contestant, the raps are on. If we cannot  win  the

argument,  then we will never win, and I  say  that

this is the argument that we have to win. I am  not

unduly  optimistic  but reasonably  confident  that

logic and the inevitable course of events over  the

next  few  months  will bring the  two  territories

inevitably together in closer association - in  what

form,  I  am  unable to say as yet. The  time  will

come,  I  hope, when even sceptics like the  Member

for  Anson  will be surprised to see the  logic  of

history, geography, the military situation, and the

political situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this motion of confidence, I would like

to  say that we are prepared to do not what is best

for the P.A.P., as has been suggested by the Member

for  Farrer Park, but what is best for the country.

What  is  best for the P.A.P. is what  I  suggested

after  Hong  Lim - to return the mandate.  There  are

certain  inescapable problems. The  people  want  a

rapid  rise in the standard of living. There is  no

base  for  your  economic expansion. Your  entrepot

trade  is  restricted.  Your industrialisation  has

come  to  depend upon factors beyond your  control,

and  so  on.  Whoever remains in office  bears  the

odium of failure. After Hong Lim, when it was clear

that  the electorate wanted something quick and  it

was   not  possible  to  deliver,  I  said  to   my

colleagues, "Return that mandate." The people  will

learn  as  the  years go on, when the P.A.P. comes

back  in its pristine glory. We are staying on  not

for  the P.A.P., but because we will not allow this

Government to be sold down the drain and the people

ruined.
