<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara

before    the   Committee   proceeds   with    the

consideration  of  the  Main  Estimates  and   the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I

<div align="center"><h4>MAIN ESTIMATES, 1961</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main Estimates. For the

convenience of Hon. Members, 1 intend  taking  the

total  for  each head as it appears  in  the  last

column of the abstract of estimated expenditure on

page 31 of Paper Cmd. 26 of 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing now with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which amendments stand on  the  Order

Paper.  The  amendments are  in  the  Order  Paper

Supplement No. 3.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to seek

clarification from the Government as  to  what  it

considers the constitutional role of the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara  to be. Sir, in the constitutional

discussions  in  London, it  was  urged  upon  the

Colonial Secretary that it would be desirable,  in

the interests of focusing loyalty on the Queen, to

have a Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You mean

the contrary.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And in order that there should

be  no misunderstanding or misinterpretation  that

the   Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara  goes   with   the

government of the day, it was agreed that the term

of  office of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara should be

four  years as against the term of office  of  the

government  for  five  years,  so  that   whatever

government  succeeds the present  Government,  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara will be a nominee  of  the

government  of  the day. But, unfortunately,  Sir,

some leaders of the P.A.P. in the Party as well as

in  the  Government do seem to give the impression

outside and to the Members of the Opposition  that

the  present  Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  a  P.A.P.

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. It should not  be  so.  I

will   just  quote  an  instance  where   such   a

misinterpretation could have and has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



taken place. I refer to the visit of the Yang  di-

Pertuan  Negara in the early part of this year  to

the Southern Islands. It is good, it is right,  it

is  proper that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  should

visit  not  only  the islands  but  all  parts  of

Singapore, so as to bring it to the notice of  the

people  of  Singapore that we now have a  Malayan-born  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Unfortunately,  Sir,

he  was  accompanied on his visit to the  Southern

Islands by a Minister (we can have no objection to

that), by Parliamentary Secretaries (to that again

we can have no objection), but there were included

in  that  retinue P.A.P. Assemblymen; whereas  the

elected  Member  for  the  Southern  Islands   was

completely   ignored.  Therefore,   we   got   the

impression  that  here  was  a  P.A.P.  Government

trying to sell a P.A.P. Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  I

am  sure  that  that was not the  intention.  Then

there    was    another   instance   where    this

misinterpretation could be given credence. It  was

because  of the advice of certain of the Ministers

that  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara had, as reported

in the papers, given a speech making comparison of

Governments-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Will the Member take his

seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have been following the hon.

Member's  speech  very  closely  and  I  must,  of

course, be quite satisfied in my mind that  he  is

not  offending any of the Standing Orders. One  of

the Standing Orders is Standing Order 46 (8) which

reads:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The conduct of the Sovereign, Members of the

Royal  Family, or the Yang di-Pertuan Negara shall

not be referred to in any circumstances.'.



<br><br>So  that if the hon. Member is now embarking on  a

dissertation  on  what the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

had said in any of his visits, then I think he  is

coming  very near the line and is probably out  of

order. But if his speech is levelled solely at the

matter he has touched on, that the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara is accompanied by P.A.P. Members and P.A.P.

Ministers to the exclusion of Opposition  Members,

then perhaps he is just within the Standing Order.

Tun Lim.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, what I want to point out

in  my  speech is that Ministers of the Government

should  understand and realise that the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara is our Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the whole of the people

of Singapore. Any advice that any Minister tenders

to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  must  take  into

consideration  the fact that the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  is above politics. If any advice given  to

him  shows a political bent, then it is definitely

wrong  on  the  part  of  the  Minister,  or   the

Parliamentary  Secretary, or the Government  as  a

whole,  to  so advise him. It is just like  asking

the  people of Singapore to express loyalty to the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, to the flag, to the State

anthem.  We all will show loyalty to this  symbol.

But if the wrong impression is given to the people

of  Singapore that it is a P.A.P. Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  a P.A.P. anthem, and a P.A.P. flag,  then

surely one cannot expect that there would be  that

loyalty from the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry that the

leader  of  the Opposition has seen  something  to

complain  about  in the conduct of  the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara. I think it is generally  accepted

that  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  above  party

politics.  He  plays  an important  and  impartial

constitutional role. I do not wish to go into  the

circumstances  in  which it came  about  that  the

visit to the Southern Islands was made without the

Member  for the Southern Islands. It depends  upon

the  circumstances. If it is a visit in connection

with  a  government project, then it  may  be  the

opinion  of the Minister in charge of that project

that  the  Member of that particular  constituency

has  nothing whatsoever to do with the project  as

such. The tour of the Southern Islands referred to

was  in  connection with a project to give special

development, not just to the Southern Islands  but

to  the Malay community in Kampong Melayu. On that

occasion,  the Assemblyman for the  area  was  not

invited. But it might be of interest to Members of

the  Opposition  to know that the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  has  expressed the intention to  visit  as

many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



of the kampongs on the mainland as possible in the

coming year. I do not know if my Secretary has got

in  touch  with the Opposition, but it is proposed

that  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara makes visits once

a  fortnight  to  a  particular division  and  the

Assemblyman of that division will introduce him to

the  community leaders there. I hope that  Members

of  the  Opposition will co-operate and  make  the

visit  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  to   the

kampongs  a  success. I think the  principle  goes

without  challenge, and I am sorry that it  should

be the subject of any comment in this debate.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made

it  clear that it is quite all right for Ministers

to  go  to the Southern Islands with the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara and the Parliamentary Secretaries,

but  what  I cannot understand is why it was  felt

necessary that there should be a retinue of P.A.P.

Assemblymen; and it is because of the presence  of

P.A.P.  Assemblymen that I raised the  point  that

the    elected   Member   for   that    particular

constituency was not even informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill wish

to take the matter to a vote?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No. In view of the

explanation,   I   beg  leave  to   withdraw   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $192,160 for Head 1 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of items (70)  to  (73)

inclusive of sub-head 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject concerns the Rent Conciliation

Board.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, after having  had  some

experience  in Government, it is my  deep  feeling

that  the  Rent Conciliation Board in  conjunction

with the Planning Department and the Land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



Office - as a coherent whole - are the instruments  of

a  very privileged landlord class in Singapore  to

suppress  tenants  and, in  some  cases,  farmers.

Because   of   that  fact,  we   took   steps   to

reconstitute the Rent Conciliation Board,  at  the

same  time  re-organising the Planning  Department

and  the Land Office. Earlier, when the Government

was   being   formed,  I  asked  that  a   certain

practising  lawyer,  who had long  been  connected

with  the  P.A.P. and who had a  long  record  of

service  to  the  underprivileged  masses,  should

become  the  Chairman  of  the  Rent  Conciliation

Board.   Earlier,   when  this   appointment   was

discussed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I

think I had better remind the hon. Member that  it

is   not  that  there  is  anything  that  can  be

disclosed  which would disconcert the  Government.

It is the principle involved where breaches of the

Official  Secrets Act and other  things  would  be

concerned.  I would also like to remind  him  that

what is on the record is on the record; and if  he

in   his   peregrinations  chooses  to  refer   to

fictitious   events  in  order  to  build   up   a

particular theory, then he does so at great peril.

First, it is out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just trying to

indicate  that I would like to hear the  point  of

order before a speech is made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point of order, Sir, is

this.  Is  it  in  order for the  ex-Minister  for

National  Development to refer  to  the  processes

which led to the appointment which he made of  the

former Chairman of the Rent Conciliation Board?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the point that there is some

secrecy in it, Mr Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This was subsequently the

subject of some discussion among Ministers in  the

Cabinet, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In so far as this Assembly is

concerned, I do not think there is anything in the

Standing  Orders to say that the disclosure  of  a

secret  of that nature is against Standing Orders.

There is a Standing Order anent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



questions on matters secret in nature which cannot

be touched upon, but I cannot find anything in the

Standing Orders which touches on the point raised.

As the Hon. the Prime Minister has rightly pointed

out,  of  course,  hon.  Members  touch  on  those

subjects  at  their peril, because I do  not  know

whether  privilege would apply in  cases  of  that

nature.  I  would not like to give any  advice  on

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister was not telling us the truth when he said

that  the  subject matter of the Rent Conciliation

Board  was  discussed in the Cabinet. I  must  say

that  it  was  discussed in the Central  Executive

Committee of the P.A.P. on 10th January, 1960, and

although  the  members  of the  Central  Executive

Committee  are  also members of the Cabinet,  they

are  held under different conditions, and  perhaps

in  this  respect  the Prime  Minister's  mind  is

confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this issue, the reason why

the  Prime Minister stood up is that he has played

a very dubious role-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order</b>?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I just make this point,

that if we want to maintain decorum, it should  be

maintained at all times?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Prime Minister can rise

on  a point of order and leave it to the Chair  to

deal  with  that  point of order. Will  the  Prime

Minister rise on his point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not wish to call

people   names   which  I  am  not   prepared   to

substantiate outside. I am prepared to  call  them

names  here  which  I  am prepared  to  call  them

outside.  Perhaps you might consider, Mr Speaker,

Sir, for the peace of this House, whether you want

to start a little dog fight?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think hon. Members are

forgetting  that there are Standing  Orders  which

are  rather strict on procedure, that there should

not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



a  free-for-all  in these matters.  The  point  of

order  is well taken, and I do rule that the  word

"dubious"  is unparliamentary and the  Member  for

Hong Lim should not use that word in relation to a

Member of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hereby

withdraw the word "dubious".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Prime Minister is so

anxious  that his role should not be disclosed,  I

shall  save him from great embarrassment. I  shall

only deal with the principles of the issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Please do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only

trying  to  show  the fight that is  going  on  in

Singapore. Yesterday I spoke of the fight  between

European capital and local interests, and today  I

speak  of  the  fight between vested interests  in

land and the poor tenants.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> You have not forgotten Meadows!



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Woodbridge Hospital!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Very soon, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Labour and Law will be sent there

after  all his powers have been deprived  step  by

step.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He should be certified-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Of course, if the Ministers

on   the   Government   Benches   intervene   with

interjections, I suppose one cannot stop a  Member

from the Opposition Bench from responding. Perhaps

if  there is some quietude on my right, there  may

be progress on my left. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 11th

December,  1959,  in  the  debate  on   the   Main

Estimates  of  the Budget, the Member  for  Farrer

Park brought up the appointment of the Chairman of

the   Rent  Conciliation  Board.  He  asked   this

question in Hansard of 11th December, 1959, Volume

11, No. 15 at column 910;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



whether the House could be informed that the  then

Chairman  of  the Rent Conciliation  Board  was  a

practising member of the Bar. At column  912,  the

Member for Farrer Park went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As far as I understand the Minister's reply,

though  he did not specifically say so, it  would

appear,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  present President of the Rent Conciliation Board  is,  in

fact, a practising member of the Bar. If that  is

accepted,  then I will proceed on that  basis.  I

would  suggest to the Minister that it is  highly

undesirable for a practising member  of  the  Bar

to  be  appointed to such a post. In  his  normal

practice,  he  would come into contact  with  all

sorts of people-tenants, landlords and owners  of

property.   I  do  not  say  that  he   will   be

influenced  by them-but a number of  people,  who

might  not otherwise have gone to him on  matters

other   than  those  appertaining  to  the   Rent Conciliation Board, might go to him and seek  his

services  merely for the reason  that  when  then

matters  come up before him for consideration  as President, they might get an added advantage.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, it was very interesting to  see

the  way  the  Member for Farrer Park raised  this

question  a  year ago. I do not mean to  say  that

this  question was inspired by my former colleague

the  Prime Minister, but I would like to say  that

not  very long after it was raised, this issue was

discussed over and over again during the  meetings

of  Assemblymen  on  Thursday  afternoons.  At   a

meeting of the Central Executive Committee of  the

People's  Action Party on 10th January, 1960,  the

matter   was  discussed.  As  a  result  of   that

discussion,  a  decision  was  reached  which  was

conveyed  to all People's Action Party Assemblymen

and lawyers. It reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is to inform you that the Central

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Committee at its meeting on 10/1/1960

resolved  that  all statutory boards  which  have

judicial   or   quasi-judicial   functions,   for

instance,   the  Rent  Conciliation  Board,   the Income  Tax  Board of Review, should not  include Assemblymen,     practising     advocates     and

solicitors,   accountants,  and  persons   openly

connected with political parties.

</div>



Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as a result of this  circular,

the  then  Chairman and eight Assemblymen  on  the

Rent Conciliation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



Board resigned. The then Chairman resigned because

he  was  a practising advocate and solicitor.  The

eight  Assemblymen  resigned  because  they   were

openly connected with political parties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Obviously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for  Labour and Law seems to be inspired after his

recent trip to Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was this decision carried out in all

quasi-judicial  and  all judicial bodies?  It  was  not.

Although  the  decision mentioned the  Income  Tax

Board  of  Review, the President of which  is  Mr

Green  who happens to be a golfing friend  of  the

Prime Minister [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am going to be very

strict  about  asides of this nature because  they

are  completely irrelevant. They may sometimes  be

offensive and may lead to disorder in this  House.

So let us have no asides.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the then

Chairman  of  the Income Tax Board of  Review  was

also  a  practising  advocate  and  solicitor.   I

believe that not long ago the Chairman, Mr R.  H.

Green, was replaced - I have a copy here - but  he  is

still a member of the Board of Review. Taking  his

place is another European practising advocate  and

solicitor, Mr C. H. Smith. Mr Speaker, it is not

possible to ask the Secretary-General of P.A.P. to

dismiss  the Prime Minister, or, for that  matter,

the   Minister  for  Finance,  for  flouting   the

decisions  of  the  Central  of  the  P.A.P.   Mr

Speaker.  Sir, this is an up-to-date list  of  the

members of the Income Tax Board of Review, showing

no   less   than  seven  practising  lawyers   and

accountants.  So this flouts the decision  of  the

Central  of  the P.A.P. made on the 10th  January,

1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not interested in whether

members of political parties should or should  not

openly be members of quasi-judicial organisations.

I  think  there is nothing wrong in that.  In  the

case of practising lawyers, I say there is nothing

wrong too, particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



in  the case of the previous Chairman of the  Rent

Conciliation Board. Before he was appointed to the

Board,  I  extracted a promise from  him  that  he

would  not  take  any  case  concerning  the  Rent

not.  But that is not so with the members  of  the

Income  Tax Board of Review. The people know  that

the  legal firm of the Chairman of the Income  Tax

Board  of  Review  takes up cases  which  come  up

before  the Board of Review, although he does  not

attend those sittings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another difference is that the

members  of the Rent Conciliation Board, including

the   then  Chairman,  are  not  paid  for   their

services, but I believe the Chairman of the Income

Tax Board of Review is paid about $100 or $200 for

each  sitting, which might last from five  minutes

to one day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the composition of

quasi-judicial organisations, whether the members should

or   should   not   be  practising   lawyers   and

accountants,  or  whether the members  are  openly

connected   with   political   parties,   is   not

important.  This  is a clear and concrete  example

that  the present leaders of the Government, as  I

proved yesterday, are protecting the interests  of

vested properties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it gives me very little

pleasure  to expose the stupidities and  ignorance

of  Members  of  this Assembly, particularly  when

such an action will hurt innocent parties who were

appointed to take over the chairmanship of

quasi-judicial  tribunals. I am sorry that  I  have,  by

implication,  to  pass  this  review.  About   the

judicial  officers who should have stepped  in  to

prevent  the appointment, it is a basic principle,

Sir, that justice should not only be done but seem

to  be  done.  Whilst I really do not  place  much

weight  on the argument put forward by the  Member

for  Farrer  Park, that it was because the  person

concerned  is  a practising lawyer  and  therefore

should  not be the Chairman, I think the sting  of

the  criticism was this: here was a lawyer  openly

connected with a Party, a Party man, and a  member

of the Central Executive Committee right up to the

time of the elections. He was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



provided  with  eight  executioners,  all   P.A.P.

Assemblymen,    who    were   appointed    without

consultation.  They did not know  that  they  were

being  appointed -  the  ex-Minister  for  National

Development  thought  that  he  would  win   their

support  in  the Party if he appointed them.  Now,

Sir, let us get these things straight. Perhaps the

ex-Minister  for National Development thinks  that

he   is   a  great  champion  of  the  poor,   the

underprivileged and all the rest of  it.  What  we

heard  yesterday and this afternoon will doubtless

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rent Conciliation Board are concerned with

the implementation of the provisions contained  in

the  Control  of Rent Ordinance. They  can  do  no

exploitation, and they are not in a  position  to.

The  exploitation,  if any, is  contained  in  the

terms  of  the  Ordinance. The provisions  of  the

Ordinance,  in  so  far as they  are  against  the

interests  of  the farmers and in  favour  of  the

landlords, have been suspended, and legislation is

being  prepared  and  will be  introduced  in  the

process  of  this Budget session to protect  their

interests  permanently. But if you have  a

quasi-judicial  tribunal- first, you are the prosecutor;

then you appoint your friend to be the judge,  and

you provide him with powers to be the assessor; so

what  is the point of the quasi-judicial tribunal?

You  could just make an administrative order  that

that  shall be so. In the same way, the Assessment

Committee  and a few other stupidities which  have

since  been  rectified. That is the  simple  basic

principle - that you shall not be judge in your  own

case and you shall not be prosecutor and judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that Mr Tann Wee Tiong was involved.

He  had  a  discussion with me and  I  immediately

conceded  the difficult position in which  he  was

placed,   particularly  when  he   found   himself

accompanied by eight P.A.P. Assemblymen. They  all

resigned and Mr Tann Wee Tiong, with good  grace,

immediately withdrew. Since then a whole panel  of

people, with the Second Civil District Court Judge

as   President,   have  been  running   the   Rent

Conciliation  Board. They are  representatives  of

the Trades Union Congress and the Chambers of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



Commerce,    together   with   three    Government

pensioners  and  a  retired officer  of  the  City

Council.  I  should  hate to  imagine,  Sir,  that

representatives  of unions, Government  pensioners

and a City Council retired officer who are serving

on  a  quasi-judicial body - even if it  is  not  at

great  expense, at least some time and energy  and

effort    is   expended   on   these   matters - are

instruments of oppression of the poor tenants  and

farmers  at the behest of the landlords.  That  is

not  their  duty. They are there to allocate  rent

increases,  and  control rent of properties  where

sanitation is put in and roads built, and  certain

other specified or common improvements are made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want to point out is this: the stupidity

and  repetition of lies in which innocent  parties

are hurt makes this-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am not-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the word "lies"

used in this context obviously refers to what  has

been  said by the Member for Hong Lim.  I  do  not

think  the  Prime Minister is justified  in  using

that unparliamentary word in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am cheered to know that

you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, have more regard  for  his

personal reputation than he has himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Will the Prime Minister

withdraw that word?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I withdraw. I cannot help

making that remark, Mr Speaker, Sir. However, may

I  go on and say this? It is a principle which  is

extremely important - what we do should be right and

appear  to  be  right.  We have  no  intention  of

running  a police State; that is not what  we  are

here  for. If you are to implement a principle  of

the  rule of law, then let us at least observe the

bare   essentials.  And  for  that  reason,   that

directive   went   out-Party  accountants,   Party

lawyers and Party men should stay out of tribunals

where  they have to adjudicate on members  of  the

public, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



sometimes  the  interests of Party  men  involved.

Open  identification and open  bias  is  bad.  The

principle   is   simple.  If  that  principle   is

challenged and if the Member for Hong Lim believes

that  that principle is being enforced because  we

want  an instrument to oppress the people, then  I

think  he  is  well  on the  way  to  one  of  the

reputable  institutions that were referred  to  in

the asides.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> The Member for Hong Lim. Mr Speaker, referred to

the membership of the Income Tax Board and I would

like   to   make  some  points  of  clarification.

Yesterday  I  had  occasion to draw  attention  to

certain regrettable perplexities of the Member for

Hong  Lim, and I pointed out several serious

mis-statements  of fact which he made in  his  speech.

Today,  within practically the first hour of  this

sitting  of the Assembly, he perpetrated  another.

The Chairman of the Income Tax Board of Review  is

a  District Judge appointed in accordance with the

policy enunciated by this Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

correct  the  suggestion by  the  ex-Minister  for

National   Development   that   there   has   been

manipulation by the Prime Minister in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was aware of the directive

of the Central Executive Committee of the Party. I

was  present at the meeting and it was my duty  to

carry   out  the  recommendation  of  the  Central

Executive  Committee. If the Member for  Hong  Lim

will  just  look  at page 42 of  these  Estimates,

"Remarks"  column-against the  post  "First  Civil

District Judge", he will see that the salary scale

of  that post was revised by Establishment Warrant

No.  26/60  from the timescale salary  $1,100-40A-1,420  to  a  Grade F post,

drawing  a  salary  of $1,620.

It was my duty to take this matter up with

the  Minister for Finance in view of  the  Central

Executive  Committee's decision that there  should

be  no practising member of the Bar as Chairman of

the  Income  Tax  Board  of  Review.  It  was  the

intention, Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



Sir, that the person who was to fill this post  of

Civil  District Judge should also be the  Chairman

of  the Income Tax Board of Review. And we have on

our  side  faithfully implemented the decision  of

the Central Executive Committee, so that there has

been no manipulation whatsoever on the part of the

Prime  Minister.  I  was present  at  the  Central

Executive Committee meeting when that decision was

made,  and  it  was my duty to  see  that  it  was

implemented.  I  therefore took  it  up  with  the

Minister  for Finance. As a result of that,  there

has  been this revision of the salary of the  post

of "Civil District Judge". I cannot see how such a

suggestion can honestly be made by a former member

of   the   Central  Executive  Committee   and   a

responsible  person  who  is  a  Member   of   the

Legislative Assembly for the constituency of  Hong

Lim.  I  am  indeed surprised that that suggestion

should have come from him today.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

grateful for the impartial interpretation  of  the

decision  of  the  Central made just  now  by  the

Minister for Labour and Law. The decision was that

it   was  wrong  for  a  practising  advocate  and

solicitor  to  be  chairman of any  quasi-judicial

organisation  and not, as the Prime  Minister  has

said  just  now,  that  it was  not  wrong  for  a

practising lawyer to be chairman but that  it  was

wrong  for  a  political practising lawyer  to  be

chairman.  They  are two different interpretations

altogether.  So,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  very

grateful  for  the  assurance  given  us  by   the

Minister  for  Labour and Law,  that  there  is  a

Budget provision that a First Civil District Judge

has  been appointed. According to the Minister for

Finance, Mr Jeyaratnam has been appointed  to  be

Chairman  of the Income Tax Board of Review.  But,

Mr Speaker, I have had a letter from the Ministry

of  Finance  only  two days back saying  that  the

Chairman is Mr C. H. Smith. I wonder whether  the

Minister  for  Finance has control of  Mr  H.  G.

Wells' "The Time Machine",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



so that he can go forward and backward any time he

likes.  If  the Minister wants to have a  look  at

this  letter,  I shall pass it over  to  him.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in my opinion, that  issue  is  not

important. The issue is this: that the leaders  of

the  Government are now, in full force,  with  all

honesty    and   sincerity,   protecting    vested

interests.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

imagine  anything more stupid than the  concluding

remarks   of   the  Member  for  Hong   Lim.   The

explanation  for Mr Smith carrying on  with  some

cases  of which he was Chairman early on is  quite

simple.  Income tax review cases are often complex

and   require  prolonged  investigation.   It   is

obviously nonsense and it would be quite wrong  to

pass on cases that have been under his examination

for  a  long  time  to the new Chairman.  What  has

happened  was  that  all the old  cases  continued

under  the same Board of Review which sat on  them

at  the beginning, and the new cases have gone  to

the new Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I just want to try and

connect  the two points neatly, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

The  important and basic decision which was  taken

by  the Central Executive Committee on my proposal

was  one of principle - that a Party man cannot  sit

on  a  judicial  tribunal, and  you  say  you  are

dispensing  justice.  But there  is  a  subsidiary

point  that sometimes practising lawyers, although

unconnected  with  parties, do  derive  an  unfair

advantage or benefit from their occupancy  of  the

chairmanship  of certain tribunals. Therefore,  as

in  the case of the Income Tax Board of Review, it

being  a lucrative branch of the law, it might  be

necessary not to give anybody an unfair advantage.

But  the basic point contained in that resolution,

which  was adopted and which the Member so  kindly

read  without  knowing what it was all  about,  is

that   no  Party  man  should  be  on  a  judicial

tribunal. If anybody says that that is wrong, that

it  is contrary to democratic laws, and that it is

against  the interest of the people, then  I  say,

like  Alice in Wonderland. I think it is  time  to

talk of cabbages and kings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never

expected  that  an  experienced debater  like  the

Prime  Minister could find himself more  and  more

driven into the net. Here is a Press cutting  from

the  Free  Press  on the 30th of March,  1960.  It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Assemblymen are allowed to sit on Arbitration

Court.'



<br><br>And  is  not an Arbitration Court one hundred  per

cent a judicial organisation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Members of the Industrial Arbitration Court

will not be affected by the Government ruling that

no  Assemblymen  or official of a political  Party

may sit on a judicial or quasi-judical tribunals,"

the  Minister for Labour and Law, Mr K. M. Byrne,

said yesterday.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as I said,  the  issue  as  to

whether  he is a practising lawyer or not  is  not

important. These persons are fighting for property

interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it is very tedious. In

the  case  of the Arbitration Court, it  is  in  a

somewhat different position. The Arbitration Judge

is assisted b) one nominee of the employer and one

nominee  of  the union. Therefore,  a  balance  of

interests is maintained. It is just like assessors

helping a Judge. But the Judge himself should  not

be  biased  and  should not be committed.  If  the

Member for Hong Lim cannot see that, then I  think

a  lot  of time will be wasted if we try  at  this

rather late hour to initiate him into the niceties

of doing things in a fair and just manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when one is

ignorant  I think it is folly to be wise.  I  have

explained at great length in this Chamber what the

Industrial Arbitration Court is. I have  made  the

point  that  it  does not exercise truly  judicial

functions. When there is a dispute and the parties

fail  to  agree,  or they cannot reach  agreement,

they then go to the tribunal. They go to this body

on which both employers and employees are properly

represented, and this body makes the agreement for

the   parties.   There  is  no  judicial   process

involved. For instance, one party wants  $10.  The

Industrial Arbitration Court says, "You



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



get $5." The Court decides on $5. That is the sort

of   thing.  Being  an  accountant,  he  fails  to

appreciate these finer points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the same

position  also obtains with the Rent  Conciliation

Board or the Income Tax Board of Review. When  the

parties fail to agree, or when one party does  not

agree,  they  submit the dispute  to  this

quasi-judicial organisation for adjudication.  It  is  a

surprise  to me to hear the Minister say that  the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court  is  not  a   truly

judicial  body. I am sorry for the  President  and

members  of  the Arbitration Court.  I  think  the

Court   should   not  be  called  the   Industrial

Arbitration   Court.  It  should  be   called   an

Arbitration - it is very difficult to find a  word

meaning  that  you want to exercise the  law.  But

there  is  a  Chinese word for it. `A  person  who

mixes  marriages', we call him  "Kung  Chin".  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  from the debate  it  appears  that

there   are  three  types  of  quasi-judicial   or

judicial    tribunals,   depending   on   whatever

interpretation the leaders of this Government wish

to put to it. But that is not the issue. The issue

is,  as  I  have  said  just now,  that  they  are

protecting vested interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not heard that issue before

in  this  House.  The issue now  is  on  the  Rent

Conciliation Board. Mr Byrne.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I just want to point out that the

Member  for  Hong Lim did not take the trouble  to

look  into  that Ordinance. If he had looked  into

it,  he  would have found that the power of making

an  award, that is, making an agreement  when  the

parties  have  failed to agree, is vested  in  the

body,  that is, the President and the two  members

of  the Court; but the power to enforce the  award

that  is made is vested only in the President.  He

alone  can  enforce the award. That is  the  point

about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question now is, "That the sum

of  $1,614,380  for  Head  2  stand  part  of  the

Estimates." As many as are of that opinion say Aye

-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I just want to take

this opportunity to inform the House that the term

of the Chief Justice-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I take the vote first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,614,380 for Head 2 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> By leave of the House, the Prime

Minister will make a statement on the Chief

Justice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to take this

opportunity to inform the House that the  term  of

the  Chief Justice, which expires in January next,

has been extended by the Government. Under the new

Constitution,  Sir,  the Chief  Justice  shall  be

appointed  from  among  persons  qualified  to  be

Judges  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  on  the

recommendation  of the Prime Minister.  There  are

persons  suitable for this appointment,  Sir,  but

they  are at present required for much more urgent

and important duties. The leader of the Opposition

has  been  consulted. The Bar and, I am  informed,

the  Puisne Judges are happy that this arrangement

can continue for the time being. The Chief Justice

has  indicated to me that he is not here to  block

the  appointment of any local man. He is happy  to

continue  to serve for as long as we require  him,

and will vacate his office at any time we wish  to

make  the appointment. I would also like  to  add,

Sir,  that  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  vested

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which, of course, is also

irrelevant!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 4 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on Head 4, Legislature. Mr Rajah.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 4 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I have informed the Clerk of

the specific nature of the objection on which I am

going to speak, and I have requested him to inform

the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



The  particular point I wish to touch upon is  one

which  has already been dealt with at the previous

Budget  sitting in this Assembly, and that is  the

question of the independence of the staff  in  the

Assembly.   At  that  time,  the  Prime   Minister

indicated  to the House that the matter was  under

consideration.  I  should be  glad  if  the  Prime

Minister  would  inform the House if  any  further

progress has been made on this particular matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If only I can believe it is

true  that  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is  as

ignorant of these matters as he seems to be,  then

I  will  take  the  trouble to go through  copious

notes in order to keep the House up to date!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Prime Minister take his

seat?  I was so interested in the subject  that  I

have forgotten to pose the question!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

be  allocated for Head 4 be reduced by $100."  Mr

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That proves my point, Sir.

May  I  just refer to the various letters that  we

have  exchanged, Mr Speaker, Sir? I  almost  wish

that we can go round the Standing Orders and allow

the Speaker to participate in the debate. Sir, you

will recall that when you first wrote to me on the

subject  on  26th  June,  1959,  you  gave  me   a

memorandum on it. There was a subsequent  exchange

of  letters - on  26th June, and the  reply  on  2nd

July. On 8th September, 1959, a letter giving more

details  of  why and where perhaps  the  Executive

should  not  in the past have interfered.  Another

letter dated 30th June, 1960, followed up with the

letter  of 12th September. You will remember  that

after the last letter of 11th July, 1960, we had a

meeting  on 27th  July.  I think  the  position  we

reached  then was this. I have here a  note  which

was made immediately after the meeting, Sir, and I

think  it fairly represents the arguments on  both

sides.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then indicated to you that we were against

having  an Assembly with a closed service  because

of  the  paucity of talent that you would then  be

troubled with. You pointed out, Sir, that you  did

not  want  a  closed service. You  understood  the

position.  But  what you wanted  was  disciplinary

control  of  the Assembly staff to be  taken  away

from  the  Executive,  because  they  are  in  the

Assembly  service, although they  could  still  be

transferred  out of the Assembly provided,  as  in

the  case of the Clerk, the consent of the Speaker

is   first  obtained.  I  then  pointed  out   the

difficulty  of  having a government servant  under

General  Orders and Colonial Regulations (or  what

has  replaced  these Regulations) working  in  the

Assembly and outside the discipline of the service

he  is  in.  I indicated that we were prepared  to

consider a closed service for specialist jobs like

the Clerk of the Assembly, perhaps the Sergeant at

Arms,    and    such   other   very    specialised

appointments. I think the meeting ended  with  you

expressing unhappiness, and you indicated that you

would  pursue the question of closing the  job  of

the  Clerk  of the Assembly and perhaps  reviewing

the whole matter again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given this matter some further

thought,  and I had a further discussion with  the

Minister for Finance. I can only make this  little

concession.  Mr  Speaker, Sir. If  the  present

members of the Assembly staff feel that they  want

to  opt out of the Government service and be in  a

closed service of the Assembly, the Government has

no  objection. Then these people will  lose  their

avenues  of  promotion in the Government  service.

They  are  not  to compete with the  rest  of  the

Government servants when other appointments  occur

in Ministries outside this Assembly. But we cannot

impose  on  them, and I think it is the considered

opinion  of  the  Government  that  it  would   be

undesirable  to  close  the service  because,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, you will be unable to get that  wide

selection of talent which would be available in  a

wider  establishment. But if there is  anybody  in

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



Assembly who feels that his independence of action

would be better safeguarded if he were out of  the

Government service - perhaps I should not have  used

the  word  "out  of  the  Government  service" - and

should  forever be not transferable but remain  in

this  closed service, then so be it.  We  have  no

objection whatsoever.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not possible

for  the Prime Minister, together with the Finance

Minister,  to  devise a solution to this  problem?

Having  listened to the Prime Minister and to  the

problem,  it seems to me that there is a  possible

solution  which  I would like to put  to  him.  In

seeking  to  find a solution to the  problem,  one

must  try  to put one's finger on the difficulties

of  a situation such as this. As I understand  the

position,  normally a civil servant,  wherever  he

may  work  comes under the control of the Minister

for  Finance who is the head of the civil service.

Although the Clerk has statutory protection by the

Constitution, that protection might not exist  for

a  long time. Mr Speaker, Sir, so long as you are

the Speaker I dare say the problem does not arise.

But when the next elected Assembly meets, it could

well  be, Mr Speaker, Sir, that you might not  be

the   Speaker   of   that   Assembly.   In   those

circumstances, naturally the majority Party  would

in  the  normal course of events appoint a Speaker

from  their  side of the House. That is  the  time

when  the trouble begins. At the moment, by virtue

of  the fact that you are the Speaker and that you

are,  I hope, a non-Party - which I am sure you  are

not, - [Laughter] - which I am sure you are -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> You have to be quite sure!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - The position is quite clear. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as the Clerk and members  of  your

staff  cannot be transferred without your consent,

their protection lies in the fact that you are the

Speaker and that you are not a Party man. But when

you  cease to be the Speaker and when a Party  man

becomes the Speaker, then, in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



absence of tradition in these matters, there is  a

distinct  possibility  that the  Government  might

seek    to   influence   the   Speaker   in    the

transferability  of  the Clerk  or  in  his  being

allowed  to  remain in his post.  If  some  system

could  be  devised whereby the Clerk  and  certain

specified officers of the Assembly staff could not

be  transferred without the consent of a Committee

of  the House, then possibly that problem might be

solved.  Again, in the event of the Clerk  falling

down  on his duties and, therefore, should  either

be transferred or dispensed with, that again could

be left in the hands of the Committee of the House

and certain devices could be worked out whereby  a

certain  majority  would be  required  before  the

decision  of that Committee could be given  effect

to.  So,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, this  is  a  possible

solution  which will keep alive the  routes  along

which   recruitment  to  the  Assembly  could   be

preserved  and  promotion outside  Assembly  House

could   also  be  preserved.  The  point  of   the

discussion,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is  this - that  the

Clerk  and  his  assistants are  servants  of  the

Assembly.  The Assembly consists not only  of  the

Government  but  also of the  Opposition.  If  the

Clerk  is  to discharge his functions efficiently,

he  might  sometimes have to discharge them  quite

fearlessly, and in so doing he might tread on  the

corns  of certain Government Members; and  Members

being human, they might try to take it out of him.

In  a  democratic  system, Sir, one  must  try  to

devise  ways  and means, a system of balances,  as

the  Prime Minister once said, whereby everybody's

interests  could be protected. As the position  of

the  Clerk  of the Assembly and his assistants  is

vital   in   the   traditions  of   a   democratic

government,  I  think one should devise  a  system

whereby   the  Clerk  and  his  assistants   could

fearlessly carry out their duties without  looking

over  their  shoulders all the time.  I  put  this

forward  to  the  Prime  Minister  as  a  possible

solution, and we on the Opposition, Sir, would  be

very  grateful  if the Prime Minister  would  give

this his consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the healthy approach

to our problems is a practical one. This is not to

say  that  I am in any way disputing the principle

which  you have tried to implement from  the  very

beginning,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, particularly  after

your  sojourn  with the Speaker of  the  House  of

Commons,   that   you  should  have   a   separate

establishment  in this Assembly. But  we  have  to

face  certain practical problems. As I have  said,

if  all  the present Assembly staff drawn  largely

from   the   more  competent  and  above   average

Government servants say that they wish to stay  in

the Assembly, so be it. The problem is not that we

want  to  transfer  the Clerk  out.  I  think  one

resigned;  another man then became  Clerk  and  he

subsequently   moved   up  to   become   Permanent

Secretary.  If the others say that  they  want  to

stay  put, we have no objection whatsoever.  As  I

have  said, we are prepared to allow the Clerk  of

the  Assembly  and his assistants to remain  where

they  are  in  their  posts,  where  they  develop

certain  expertise.  They  cannot  develop  skills

which  would  be  of  much  value  in  some  other

Ministry.  But  if  you wish to  recruit  on  your

own - your  stenographers, your personal  assistants

and  your other clerical assistants - then I suggest

you  give  this matter further consideration,  not

because  you  cannot recruit  them,  since  it  is

likely  that  you  can do better  by  tapping  the

government services where there are other  avenues

for  promotion,  from  clerks  to  higher  clerks,

Executive Officers, Higher Executive Officers  and

so  on. The point that the Member for Farrer  Park

has   asked  me  to  consider  has  already   been

considered. As far as the Clerk is concerned,  and

I  have  also  included the Serjeant at  Arms  and

other  specialised officers, I  think  they  could

well  be in a closed service. But the question  is

whether  you  should have a separate establishment

as  apart from these specialised officers. That is

a  matter  which I think the Member for  Cairnhill

knew  full  well. It was debated  and  he  decided

against it, not against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



the  interests of the Assembly but because we felt

that  it would militate against the efficiency  of

the staff of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in this matter, I speak perhaps

from  a  selfish point of view as a Member of  the

Opposition. As a Member of the Opposition, Sir,  I

would  like to see a Clerk, whose terms of service

are  such that he could be expected to advise  any

Opposition  Member  quite fearlessly  and  without

being afraid of the consequences of the advice  he

may  tender. At the same time, Sir, I do not  wish

to  see  that  proper  avenues  of  promotion  are

blocked   either  from  outside  or   inside   the

Assembly.  As  the  Legislature  is  an  important

adjunct of the government of the country,  and  as

the  Clerk  is  an important person in  that  very

important  adjunct of the country,  could  we  not

devise  some  system  whereby  we  could  make  it

possible for the Clerk, while he is Clerk  of  the

Assembly,  to  carry out his functions  fearlessly

and without troubling himself as to whether he  is

going to be transferred outside this Assembly;  or

worse still, severely dealt with by some difficult

Minister?   I  am  not  talking  of  the   present

Government, Sir. So long as the present Government

is  in power, the Clerk is protected, because  you

are  there,  Sir. But when this present Government

goes  and some other government comes in, it could

well be that they might not be quite so reasonable

as this Government and -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): It could be yours!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It could be ours. I think, Sir, it is

important  that  just as you  are  an  independent

member,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  and  you  have   the

protection of the Constitution in regard  to  your

term of office here, so, in a similar way, I think

this Clerk, and all future Clerks, should also  be

given  that protection. With a little goodwill  on

both sides, surely it is not beyond the ability of

the  Minister  for Finance, as head of  the  civil

service, to devise some system whereby the Clerk's

service would be protected, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



well as give some assurance to the other important

officials of this Assembly so that their interests

too  will be protected and they could give  advice

to all Members of the House fearlessly and as they

think fit.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the issue really does

not  arise  because  the Clerk  is  already  in  a

protected  position, according to section  46  (5)

and  (6) of the Constitution. All he has to do  is

to  indicate to the Minister for Finance  that  he

prefers  to remain in the closed Assembly  service

and  it shall be so done. But I think it may  well

be that there are other considerations which might

bear  not on the Minister for Finance but  on  the

Government servants in the Assembly who  may  wish

not   to   seal   altogether  their   chances   of

advancement in the service by moving  out  of  the

Assembly.  Under section 46 (5)  and  (6)  of  the

Constitution, the Clerk can exercise that right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With due respect to the Prime

Minister,   Sir,   I   think   he   has    perhaps

misunderstood  the point. I am not  worried  about

the  present  Clerk. It is not  the  Clerk  as  an

individual  who worries me. I am thinking  of  any

particular Clerk who serves the Assembly  and  who

should be placed in a position whereby his removal

from  the Assembly, or his dismissal from his post

as  Clerk,  would  be  left  in  the  hands  of  a

Committee  of  this  House  composed  of   certain

individuals   from   the   Government   and    the

Opposition, and his dismissal would depend on  how

that  Committee votes. Whereas if the other clerks

remain  as  government servants  and  continue  to

remain as government servants, they can opt to  be

transferred and can come into the Assembly as  and

how  they wish. All I ask the Minister for Finance

and  the Prime Minister to consider is whether  it

would  not be possible to devise a system  whereby

the  transfer  of the Clerk from the  Assembly - not

the   present   Clerk,  but  any  Clerk - would   be

determined  by  a  particular Committee,  and  his

dismissal also would be determined by a particular

Committee  and  not  according  to  normal   civil

service regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I must make a final

effort   to   clear  the  air.  I  am   sure   the

misunderstanding  is  a genuine  one.  What  I  am

saying is that we have already agreed with you  in

principle,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the  Clerk  and

his  assistants  are specialised  men  who  should

acquire   expertise   in  Standing   Orders,   the

procedures  of  debate, and  all  the  intricacies

which  a good Speaker insists upon, and that  they

can   be  specialised  jobs - as  employees  of  the

Assembly  and not as government servants.  We  are

prepared to allow the present incumbents  who  are

government  servants  to switch  over  from  being

government  servants to servants of the  Assembly.

We have offered that, not only for this particular

Clerk,  but for all the Clerks and for  all  time.

The disadvantage of having to carry on an argument

by proxy, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that we, are unable

to  come to grips with the issue. The issue  is  a

separate establishment, with a House Committee  in

charge  of the whole of the staff of the Assembly.

The  point  I have made on behalf of the  Minister

for  Finance is that if they do not opt out of the

government  service, if they  still  stay  in  the

government service and they want their avenues for

promotion - and you have conceded, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  they should be given these avenues,  because

you  would  not otherwise be able to recruit  good

men - then  they  cannot  be outside  the  rules  of

discipline which bind all the other competitors in

the  same service with them. That is a little  bit

of logic which I hope I am able to convey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think I had better clear the

air.  There  seems to be an implication  that  the

Member for Farrer Park is arguing my case for  me.

I  think the word "proxy" was used. I may disabuse

the  mind of the Prime Minister when I say that  I

have  not, in fact, briefed the Member for  Farrer

Park.  If I had, perhaps he would have put forward

some better arguments!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

going  to make the point straightaway that if  you

had  argued  the  case yourself,  you  would  have

probably made a better case of it!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do appreciate what the Prime Minister is

saying.  He says that the government officers  can

opt  into  this service. By that, I take it  means

that once they opt into this service, they go  out

of  the government stream and remain here forever.

The  point I am trying to get across to the  Prime

Minister  is this: let them continue to remain  in

the   government  stream,  but  the   removal   or

dismissal  of  certain named  officers  from  this

Assembly - not  all - should  not  follow  the  normal

civil  service code. The removal or dismissal  and

the  question of discipline could be left  in  the

hands  of  a  Committee of  the  House.  Once  the

Committee  of the House has put them  outside  the

Assembly,  then  they will come  into  the  normal

government  stream  and be subject  to  government

discipline.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not quite sure whether I

understand  the  Member for Farrer Park.  Briefly,

his  object is to ensure some security  of  tenure

for  Clerks  of  the Assembly  so  that  they  can

fearlessly  perform their duties. He thought  that

if  they are to be able to achieve this, then  the

question of promotion and discipline of the  staff

of  the Assembly should be placed in the hands  of

the  House Committee of the Assembly. That was his

proposal. I would have thought that, in the  event

the  party  in  power changes, you might  have  an

unreasonable  party which does not  care  for  the

niceties  of the Constitution. Then the Clerks  of

the  Assembly would surely be at the mercy of  the

political  party  in  power.  Whereas  under   the

present  arrangement, they have the  safeguard  of

the   Public  Service  Commission,  which  is   an

impartial body and is the final arbiter in matters

of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The point which the Minister for

Finance  took,  I  think, could  be  got  over  by

looking very carefully at the composition  of  the

House  Committee  of  the Assembly.  Naturally  it

would  not  be on the basis of a Select  Committee

where  the number of Members to be appointed would

be  according to the majority in the  House.  This

particular House Committee I am thinking of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



would be composed of Members of the Opposition  as

well as of the Government where the removal of the

Clerk  is  contemplated,  then  he  will  only  be

removed  if the vote against him comes  from  both

the  Opposition and the Government side; the basis

of   the   suggestion  being  that  if  both   the

Opposition Members and the Government Members  are

agreed  that  the  Clerk should be  removed,  then

there is something really seriously wrong with the

Clerk.  But  where Members of the Opposition  vote

against the Members of the Government on an  issue

like  this,  it  could  well  be  then  that   the

Government  side want to get rid of him  but  that

the Opposition think him well worthy of the post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to make this

point.  Sir.  There is no real issue involved.  We

have spent a lot of time on this, and the point of

view,  of course, is sincerely held. But there  is

no  bone  of contention. We are saying that  there

are   these  specialised  jobs  and  that  we  are

prepared to let them be a closed service. That  is

the  end of the matter. But in so far as the rules

of  discipline are concerned, if they stay  within

the  government plane of the service and  if  they

are  still in the running for promotion  in  other

Government  Ministries, then  they  will  have  to

abide by the rules and regulations which determine

the  discipline of that service as  a  whole.  You

cannot  pull  them  out of  the  service  for  the

purposes  of  discipline, but leave  them  in  the

service for the purpose of promotion. That  is  an

illogicality  which  cannot be reconciled.  Either

they  are  in the service or they are  out.  I  am

suggesting  that  we are quite prepared  to  allow

them  to  be  out  of  the service  and  there  is

provision for that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my

opinion,  this  Assembly  is  the  only  place  in

Singapore where there is freedom of speech. I feel

the  same as the Member for Farrer Park does, that

there  should be some independence for the  Clerk,

the  Simultaneous Interpreters and the other civil

servants  engaged  in the Legislature.  The  Prime

Minister says that the solving of the problem in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



the  way  suggested is a contradiction: the  civil

servants   in  the  Legislature  must   be   given

promotion in the whole government service and  the

anxieties  of  Members of this  Assembly  must  he

allayed   by   granting  a   certain   degree   of

independence  to  the Clerk and  the  other  civil

servants  in the Assembly. In my opinion,  we  can

resolve  the problem by having a House  Committee,

comprising both Members of the Government and  the

Opposition, whereby disciplinary action and  other

matters  concerning the conditions of  service  of

the civil servants in the Legislature can at least

be  discussed in an advisory capacity in the first

instance, so that there would still be an  "oasis"

in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, by "oasis", I mean

this  Chamber. I do not mean outside this Chamber,

because  at  the sitting when the  debate  on  the

Malayanisation issue -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us stick to the issue,

shall we?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my

opinion, and from my own personal experience,  the

civil  servants engaged in work in the Legislature

should   not  be  subject  to  Treasury   control,

particularly  in  the  matter  of  discipline  and

transfer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I just want to repeat the

point made by the Minister for Finance. Government

officers  are  subject to the  discipline  of  the

service which is being administered by the  Public

Service Commission, and if they wish to opt out of

that  service  and  join  the  -  service  of  the

Legislative Assembly, we have no objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $588,260 for Head 4 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 5 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 5 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Public Service Commission to

ensure    that   appointments,   promotions    and

disciplinary action are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



taken  away from political control. But I am  told

that  there  have been instances where the  Public

Service Commission has been by-passed, and it  has

been by-passed in just one simple way: do not fill

the    appointments   permanently.    Unless    my

information is incorrect, I think there are in the

Government  service today hundreds of appointments

that  have  not been filled on a permanent  basis,

but  only  by temporary officers. I know there  is

difficulty   in   finding  suitable   people   for

important jobs. In the Ministry of Education, too,

there   has  been  difficulty  in  finding

fully-qualified    teachers   to   take   on   permanent

employment. But I do suggest that, in view of  the

allegations that have been hurled back  and  forth

about  "Meadowisation"  "Batu  Pahatisation"   and

"P.A.P.-isation", the quicker  we  get  away  from

these temporary appointments and make full use  of

the Public Service Commission, the better it would

be for all concerned.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Cairnhill  is  not correct in  assuming  that

temporary  appointments  can  by-pass  the  Public

Service Commission. All appointments for a  period

exceeding   two   months,  either   temporary   or

permanent, must be referred to the Public  Service

Commission, and to my knowledge this rule is being

carried out. Recently I have asked my Ministry  to

undertake  a  detailed  survey  of  all  temporary

appointments  to  make sure that  this  policy  is

carried out. I would say that this requirement  is

laid   down   in  the  Public  Service  Commission

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning Head 5, Public

Service   Commission,  I  would   like   to   seek

clarification as to the policy of the  Government,

be  it  a  colonial  government,  a  Labour  Front

Coalition government, or any other government,  in

regard  to Malay membership of the Public  Service

Commission. At present, there is not even a single

Malay represented in the P.S.C. As appointments to

the P.S.C. are made by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



Minister,  I  would like to ask  him  whether  the

reason why there is no Malay in the P.S.C. is that

there  is no suitable Malay in Singapore with  the

necessary  qualifications, although the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara was at one time the Chairman of the P.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moral point of view, I am sorry to see

that  there  is  no representative  of  the  Malay

community serving in the Commission. Could this be

due to the feeling of the Malays in the service of

the   Government - which  may  be  unknown  to   the

Government - that there is a suspicion that matters

of  promotion will meet with snags if there is  no

one to voice the cause of the Malays in the Public

Service Commission? It is within the power of  the

Government  to make nominations. I would  like  to

know  whether it is a fact that no suitable  Malay

with proper qualifications can be found to replace

the   former   Chairman  of  the  Public   Service

Commission, who is now the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is important that the

Public  Service Commission should  have  only  one

criterion  in  arriving at a decision.  In  making

selections  and  promotions, it  must  assess  the

value,  merit,  experience  and  ability  of   the

applicant.    That   is   the   only    criterion.

Considerations  of politics and the  race  of  the

candidate  are quite irrelevant. It  is  for  this

reason that we do not see any necessity, in making

appointments to the Public Service Commission,  to

attempt to balance the racial composition  of  its

members. I think it would be quite wrong to do so.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I understand that,

Mr  Speaker,  but I would like  to  have  a  more

positive  reply.  Is  that opinion  based  on  the

Preamble  to  the Constitution to which  both  the

Government and the Opposition have agreed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there is nothing in the

Preamble to the Constitution which refers  to  the

Public Service or the Public Service Commission at

all.  There is a separate reference to  the  Malay

language, religion, economic interests and so  on,

but  I  think there is no reference whatsoever  to

the Public Service Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



Whilst it would be wise always to try and maintain

a balance in these things, I think the over-riding

principle is to get a man to do the job regardless

of   race,   religion  or  any  other   extraneous

considerations.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it is

true what the Prime Minister said that there is no

reference   whatsoever  to  the   Public   Service

Commission  in  the Preamble to the  Constitution.

But  recently the Prime Minister mentioned,  among

other  things,  the economy of the Malays.  If  we

were  to  go  deeply into matters  in  respect  of

promotion  and higher remuneration for  Malays,  I

think it is proper that the appointment of a Malay

to  the Commission should be made. However, it  is

left to this socialist Government to decide. It is

not a big matter to us, but I would plead that  it

be given appropriate attention by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am surprised at the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan, because every  time

he  rises to speak, he touches on trivialities. Is

it  his  intention  to accuse the  Public  Service

Commission  for neglecting matters concerning  the

promotion of the Malay civil servants?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order.

Mr  Speaker.  I have been accused  of  making  an

allegation  against the Public Service Commission.

I want proof that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the proof

is  found in the speech of the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  himself,  when  he  insisted   on   the

necessity of putting a Malay in the Public Service

Commission, as otherwise the question of promotion

for the Malays will be hampered. Does he mean that

the  appointment of a Malay to the Commission will

cause  all  requisite  qualifications  to  be  put

aside?  If  this  is  done,  there  will   be   no

impartiality. Now appointments are made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



on  the  merits  of the candidates' qualifications

and  integrity. There is no doubt that selections,

matters of promotion and so on are based on merits

and qualifications, etc.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I was

under  the impression that all Malays are  sincere

to  their fellowmen, but apparently there are some

who are not. This is shocking. As a Malay, I often

speak  on sincerity. Today we know who are sincere

and who are insincere. Because I am sincere, I  am

still  here.  If I am not, I do not know  where  I

will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to the subject under discussion, the

question  is, does it follow that, if a  Malay  is

put  on the Public Service Commission, only Malays

be  selected? Surely not. There are other  members

in   the   Public  Service  Commission  too,   and

therefore  the  explanation of  the  Parliamentary

Secretary is out of place.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I will not

kill  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan  with  the

weapon  used by he himself. He says that from  the

point  of view of economy, if a Malay sits in  the

Public  Service  Commission,  it  will  mean  easy

promotion for the Malays. So I am using that  same

argument  to  hit back at the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the debate is

getting  a little heated. Let us try and  be  calm

and collected about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Could I have just one last

word  on  this,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir?  I  think  we

understand  the underlying anxiety of  the  Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan. I would like  to  mention

this,  particularly in respect of the Police Force

where  the  rank and file are largely Malays,  and

where  the  officers are not represented  in  such

equal  numbers. I can assure the hon. Member  that

so  far as I can see the way promotions have gone,

the  Public Service Commission is fully  aware  of

the  necessity  to  give  those  in  the  service,

whatever their race, and particularly if they  are

Malays,  opportunities for advancement  by  higher

education and every other means. If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



Member will look at last year's Estimates, he will

see  that we have a special commission for  Police

cadets,  for  Malays who join the service  without

the  School Certificate but are required  to  pass

the  School Certificate Examination at the end  of

their probationary service. I would say that  they

will be qualified Inspectors and later on gazetted

officers. We are trying to redress this problem of

unequal educational background. I do not think the

composition   of   the  P.S.C. would   make   any

difference - one Malay to five others. What  matters

is the policy underlying recruitment and promotion

in the whole Government administration. I think it

is  necessary  not  just for the  benefit  of  the

Government but for peace, good order and amity  of

the  races  that  the spirit of  the  Preamble  is

honoured in the actions of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

very satisfied not with what I have heard from the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National  Development, but  with  what  the  Prime

Minister,  who is wise, has said in answer  to  my

query.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In view of the fact that the

debate has toned down somewhat, may I beg leave to

withdraw?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $143,420 for Head 5 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 -



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask your permission,

when speaking on this amendment, to range over the

other  amendments that I have filed  on  Political

Secretaries in the different Ministries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member is speaking on

the  general  principle of Political  Secretaries,

then, of course, it would perhaps be convenient to

deal   with   the   whole  policy   of   Political

Secretaries in one speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I have submitted amendments in

regard to Political Secretaries too. May I however

point  out,  Sir,  that my  amendments  are  of  a

different character entirely? So I would  like  to

reserve the right to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not going to exclude any

other Member from speaking on the other amendments

of  which notices have been given by that  Member.

What I am trying to indicate is this, if there  is

to  be a debate on the general policy of Political

Secretaries - not   on   a   particular    Political

Secretary - then perhaps it would be  convenient  to

deal with that policy at once; and when we come to

the Member for Cairnhill's amendments, we can deal

with that particular appointment and not touch  on

the  general principle again. I hope I  have  made

myself clear.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful to you for allowing me to range over  the

other  heads of expenditure, because  I  shall  be

saving a lot of time by doing this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, each Minister has as his personal

assistants   a   Permanent   Secretary    and    a

Parliamentary Secretary. In some Ministries  there

are  other secretaries to help the Ministers  with

their  work. The duty of the Permanent  Secretary,

according to the Constitution, is, subject to  the

general direction and control of the Minister,  to

supervise  over  the department or departments  to

which  he  is  allocated. According to  the  Prime

Minister, in Hansard Vol. 11. No. 9, col. 536:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Parliamentary Secretary, carries the

burden of the Minister's parliamentary duties, to

the   extent  that  the  Minister  designates   or

delegates, he carries the burden of the Minister's

ministrial duties.'



He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Personal Secretary (Political), is the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister's closest confidant on the political

implications of the moves, plans and policies  of

the various Ministries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member quoting from

Hansard or paraphrasing?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I am paraphrasing, Sir, I

can   appreciate   the  Government's   desire   to

implement its policy to the satisfaction  of  what

the  Prime Minister calls the "four worlds".  That

is,  the Malay-speaking, the Chinese-speaking, the

English-speaking and the Tamil-speaking population

I sympathise with the Prime Minister, Sir, and his

Government  in their difficult task of  having  to

meet  the  requirements of a multilingual,

multi-racial and multi-cultural society. I will even  go

so  far,  Sir, as to agree with what  he  said  in

Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 9, col. 545:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the whole business of a government to

govern in such a way that at the end of its  term

of  office,  the people say, "Yes, we shall  have

more of it."'



<br><br>However, Sir, a lot depends on the incentives that

stimulate   the  people  to  say  this.   If   the

Government governs so well that the people benefit

and  prosper,  it is natural that they  will  say,

"Yes,  we want more of it." But there may be other

factors  that cause people to make this  decision.

For   example,   (i)   fear   of   reprisals   and

victimisation;  (ii) they might have  been  misled

into  seeing things through rose-coloured glasses,

or (iii) a funny mirror might have been put before

them, a mirror which contorts and distorts images.

These  are, of course, undesirable. If the  P.A.P.

Government   intends  to  win  the  elections   by

governing  so  well that people will  benefit  and

prosper  by  it, then it is a straightforward  job

that the Permanent Secretaries can carry out. I am

sorry,  but  I  have to disagree  with  the  Prime

Minister when he said that if the presentation and

implementation of policies were left  entirely  to

the  Civil Service, an unnecessary faux  pas  will

fail  their  way. I am quite sure, Sir,  that  our

civil   servants  are  men  of  intelligence   and

ability,  and  have  sufficient  integrity  to  he

entrusted  with the job of implementing Government

policies,  and  can be expected to implement  them

efficiently.   But   if   by   implementation   of

Government  policies is meant the  propagation  of

P.A.P. propaganda,  then  I   admit   Government

servants  will  not be capable of doing  it.  But,

Sir,  are Government servants not bound by General

Orders not to take an active part in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



party  politics? Or are they exempted from General

Orders  if  they happen to support a  party  which

happens  to  be  in  power? I can  appreciate  the

point,  Sir, that if the civil servant  is  not  a

member  of the P.A.P. then he will not be able  to

follow  the trend of thought that lies behind  the

policies  of the Government. But may I  ask,  Sir,

what better person is there than the Parliamentary

Secretary who is himself a leading member  of  the

Party, who knows all about the Party policies, who

is  so  well  versed  with what  goes  on  in  the

Ministry, and, most important of all, in whom  the

voters  have shown confidence and have  chosen  to

represent  them?  Should not such  a  person,  who

carries  the  confidence of  the  voters,  be  the

closest confidant of the Minister? Is there anyone

who  has  proved to the world better than  he  has

that he understands the masses, and is able to get

his  message across to them so convincingly as  to

secure  their confidence in him? If there are  any

people  who have shown to the world that they  are

able to do that, it is the 51 Assemblymen who  are

sitting  in this Chamber today. They have  managed

to  convince the public and they have  managed  to

secure  the  confidence of the  public.  And  that

includes  the  Parliamentary Secretaries  and  the

Back  Benchers  of the Government too.  So  I  can

think of no people who are better qualified to get

the  Ministry's messages and intentions across  to

the masses better than the Assemblymen themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P A.P. Ministers may be the personal friends

of  the Political Secretaries, and understand them

well  enough to have confidence in them. But where

the  electorate is concerned, they have  indicated

their  trust in and their choice of the 51 Members

sitting  in this Chamber. And to brush  aside  the

Parliamentary  Secretaries and the  Back  Benchers

and put in others as liaison personnel between the

Government   and  the  people  is  tantamount   to

ignoring  public  feeling and  the  right  of  the

public  to  choose their representatives,  because

this is exactly what the Political Secretaries are

in effect, Sir. They reflect public opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



to  the Government so that Government could  frame

their  policies  to  meet  the  requirements,  the

opinions  and the feelings of the people.  Do  the

public riot have the right to choose those persons

whom  they  think  can understand  - them  best  to

represent  their views and reflect their opinions?

Moreover,  Sir, - I stand corrected, but I  believe

it  was mentioned in this Chamber that many of the

Back  Benchers  of  the Government  resigned  from

their jobs and went into Government departments to

serve  the Government and the people. If  this  is

the  case,  Sir,  who  would more  deserve  to  be

rewarded  with the $1,100 monthly salary  that  is

paid  to  the  Political Secretary than  the  Back

Benchers  themselves who have resigned from  their

jobs to serve the Government and the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Are you trying to spread revolt?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I am expressing my

sincere   opinion.  And  following  my   line   of

argument,   Sir,  that  has  gone  before,   these

Assemblymen  are the people who have proved  their

ability  to  convince and to impress  the  public.

Surely  the  Ministers  do not  admit  that  their

Assemblymen are not capable of getting across  the

P.A.P.'s policies to the masses? Or that they  are

not capable of convincing the masses? Or that they

do not have sufficient confidence from the masses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health, Sir, is not here today.

He  is  absent. If he were here, probably he might

say  the  same  thing to me that he  said  to  the

Member  for  Tanglin on 11th December,  1959.  You

will  remember, Sir, that the Member for  Tanglin,

not  satisfied with the explanation given  by  the

Hon. the Prime Minister at the September  sitting

regarding the necessity of using public  funds  to

pay  for Political Secretaries, filed an amendment

and  sought further elucidation on the matter. And

because  of  this, the Minister for Health  called

him  a man of unsound mind. I can assure you. Sir,

and  I  can assure the House that it is no unsound

mind  that  made  me bring this subject  up  again

today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He does not mind it at all!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Rather it is sound logic

and  the  calculation of events  that  have  taken

place  in  the recent past. In September 1959,  it

was  not  deemed  that the Deputy  Prime  Minister

needed a Political Secretary. Even if it had  been

felt that he needed one, his need was not regarded

as  being  as  urgent as that of the Minister  for

Labour and Law.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This need of a Political Secretary in the

Ministry  of  Labour and Law would have  continued

had   not  Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan  criticized   the

Government's  policy. His criticism of  Government

policy  made the Ministry of Labour and Law  decde

that  it  no  longer needed a Political Secretary,

and  suddenly  made it necessary  for  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister's Ministry to need one. The public

cannot  see the logic in this sequence of  events,

nor can they understand the principle of cause and

effect  in  this. The conclusion they  draw,  Sir,

- and  we  agree with them - is that the creation  of

the  posts  of Political Secretaries  is  nothing,

but,  to  borrow the Prime Minister's  expression,

"distributing largesse among the victors". It  has

been  denied before, Sir, and I know  it  will  be

denied again today. But events in the recent  past

give  clear proof that the Ministers do  not  need

any Political Secretaries-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I need one!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Can the Government tell us,

Sir,  how much the Minister for Education and  the

Minister for Labour and Law have suffered  through

the loss of their Political Secretaries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> None.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> If they had suffered, then

why  had the vacancies not been filled? It is  now

quite  some time since Mr Devan Nair resigned  as

Political  Secretary to the Minister of Education.

The fact that this vacancy as well as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



vacancies for the post of Political Secretaries in

the other Ministries, and the vacancy for the post

of Publicity Liaison Officer Secretary (Political)

in the Ministry for Culture have been left vacant,

in  some  cases for 15 months, clearly shows  that

these  posts are not necessary, at least  not  for

the  good of the State and the people. They do not

in  any  way help the government machinery to  run

more  smoothly.  The Ministries without  Political

Secretaries have functioned as smoothly as, if not

more   smoothly   than,   those   with   Political

Secretaries. It is nothing but a waste  of  public

funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I could not help

feeling  that  perhaps had I met ladies  like  the

Member for Mountbatten, I would have decided  that

we should form a Men's Association to proclaim the

rights  of  men. Sir, in the nature of  things,  I

would  like  to hear a question once and  give  an

answer  once; and either we join issue or we  will

never join issue. Either we disagree for keeps  or

we  agree over the issue. But to have the same old

issue  churned up everytime because otherwise  one

cannot go to sleep soundly is, to say the least of

it, disconcerting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, may I assure the Member for Mountbatten

that  if  the  creation of the posts of  Political

Secretaries were a device to spread largesse, then

we would have filled up all the posts. The fact is

that  it is not easy to pick men who are of  value

to  the Ministers in those positions. That is  the

reason  why Mr Devan Nair's appointment  has  not

been  filled.  And  we  are still  looking  for  a

suitable  candidate to take over the  position  of

Political Secretary in the Ministry of Labour  and

Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give a little example of how

important  it  is that we should - and  we  do  this

openly  within  the ambit of the Constitution - have

the  services  of  men who, as a result  of  their

background,  are  skilled in  the  performance  of

certain  functions for the Minister. Let  me  take

the   example  of  the  negotiations  between  the

Government and the Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



University  authorities  to  which  my   Political

Secretary was asked to be a party of four from the

Government,    including    three    Parliamentary

Secretaries.  I  think it is no discredit  to  the

three  Parliamentary Secretaries who sat  with  my

Political  Secretary  in  the  Committee - and  they

would  be  the first to do that - to admit  that  he

gave  signal  contribution to  the  deliberations,

which  were  on  a  very  delicate  and  extremely

emotionally  charged subject. That is the  reason

why   it   was   handled  with  care,  sympathetic

consideration and thoroughness. Because these  are

men,  not  only the Parliamentary Secretaries  but

men  like  my Political Secretary, who  are  worth

much   more  to  the  Government.  If  the  former

Government had men such as these, they might  have

avoided  making  some  of the tremendous  blunders

they  did, like flushing out the Chung Cheng  High

School  and  the  Chinese  High  School.  That  is

another  matter. So these are men whom  we  value.

They  serve a specific function. If we had  wished

to  give jobs away, we would have filled the whole

lot  of  them,  regardless of their worth  to  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my position, Sir, as the Minister in charge

not  just  of  the  Government Ministries  but  of

statutory corporations like the Singapore  Harbour

Board, the City Council, if it were largesse  that

I  wanted to distribute, it could be done quietly,

without the slightest fuss and bother. We put this

on the record because this is the proper way to do

it.  If  the  Member  for  Mountbatten's  feminine

instincts  make her repeat this year  after  year,

then  I expect, Sir, at the end of it all we  will

have  to get together and form an association  for

the  rights of men! One of the rights  is  not  to

hear  the  same argument, which has been answered,

repeated  again and again as if it were  something

fresh out of the bag. We have had all this before.

All  I  need  add is to say perhaps  we  might  be

spared  the same repetition when we come  to  the

other  Political Secretaries. I am sure the Member

for Cairnhill has something special -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Of course!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - on the Political Secretary

to  the  Ministry of Labour and Law, and I do  not

think  he  expects either the Minister for  Labour

and Law or me to say the things that he would like

to hear; otherwise we shall give him value for the

time  and energy that he is going to spend on this

subject. But for God's sake let us not repeat this

any  more  for  the peace and good order  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the

Hon. the Prime Minister tries to make out that  it

was  feminine instinct that makes me  repeat  this

subject this year. Let me tell him that it was the

masculine  remarks  of  the  people  oustide  this

Chamber that make me bring this topic up again. If

he had gone out and spoken to people outside about

this matter, he would have found that they are all

puzzled  as to how the Deputy Prime Minister,  who

never  had or needed a Political Secretary before,

suddenly  needed  one when the occasion  arose  to

suit the transfer. The Political Secretary to  the

Ministry  of Labour and Law, Mr Fong  Swee  Suan,

attacked  Government policy, and all of  a  sudden

the   Ministry  could  do  without   a   Political

Secretary. It is the people who are puzzled, and I

seek  elucidation and clarification so  that  they

will  not be puzzled any more about it; and  I  do

not think the Hon. the Prime Minister has given us

that information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if

the  Member for Mountbatten had confined  herself

to  that, then we would all have listened  to  her

with  avidity, because that was a valid point.  It

is  not  because the Minister for Labour  and  Law

does not require a Political Secretary. The Deputy

Prime  Minister  had always required  a  Political

Secretary,  but  he had not been able  to  find  a

suitable one. Why was it necessary to transfer Mr

Fong  Swee Suan there? Because he had to be  moved

out  of  the  Ministry of Labour and Law,  and  at

once.  There  are  ways  of doing  things,  either

politely or impolitely. We did it the polite  way.

We  transferred him to the Deputy Prime Minister's

Ministry in order that his expressed views,  which

differed  from those of the Ministry's on  certain

labour matters, should not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



allowed  to influence the workings of the Ministry

of  Labour and Law of influence the unions in that

respect.  Whether his services in the Ministry  of

the Deputy Prime Minister would be as valuable  as

he had hoped be would be in the Ministry of Labour

and  Law we will, of course, have to wait and see.

But I am sure he will do his best.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Prime  Minister earlier said that these  Political

Secretaries  are  men who, as a  result  of  their

background,  are  skilled in  the  performance  of

certain functions for the Ministers. Sir,  I  did,

and  still  do, agree as I said last year,  or  in

fact  this  year, on the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

Speech,  that there are Political Secretaries  and

Political  Secretaries.  I  see  that  the   Prime

Minister has found it fit to illustrate his  point

with  his  own Political Secretary who, we  admit,

has done good work for him. But let us examine the

other Political Secretaries on the basis that they

are  men who, as a result of their background, are

skilled  in  the performance of certain  functions

for the Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the Political Secretary in the

Ministry of Finance. He is never there. What  kind

of  function does he perform for the Minister? You

will  find him in the Ministry of Labour and  Law.

What  kind  of a background has he, other  than  a

trade union background, to advise a man who  is  a

known  economist not only here but in other  parts

of  the world, to advise him when he is not there?

A  Political Secretary to advise the Minister from

where? From the back seat or the front seat? He is

not  even in the Ministry of Finance, and  is  yet

paid  $1,100 a month. I would not like  to  accuse

that  it is a distribution or largesse. [Laughter]

No, it is not. But I would like to say this. It is

nothing  but  political manoeuvring. You  want  to

give  a  job  to  a man who has been  the  Party's

comrade. Therefore, a job must be given to him. So

you  create  a job for the man to contain  him.  I

will  not  call it largesse. To contain  him -  but

have  we  contained him? He is never seen  in  the

Ministry  of Finance. And then to get a  Political

Secretary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



advise  the  Minister when they will not  look  at

each  other face to face! What kind of advice  can

there  be?  No,  it  is  not  a  distribution   of

largesse.  It is something else more  sinister.  I

would not like to touch on the Political Secretary

in  the Ministry of Labour and Law, because I will

have  something to say about the subject  when  it

comes  up.  But  to  suggest  that  all  Political

Secretaries are there because they are  performing

useful  functions  for the Ministers  is  just  an

untruth. There are some Political Secretaries  who

have done good work. I will admit it here and  now

that the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister

has  done a good job. But I cannot say for certain

about  the other Political Secretaries. We created

a  Political  Secretary for  every  Ministry  last

year, except the Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry,

and  then  we  suddenly created one this  year  to

contain  someone else. But if the other  Ministers

have  posts  in  their  Ministries  for  Political

Secretaries, they have not yet been filled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Do you know of any good ones?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Perhaps they have not yet

found  the comrades to contain, or maybe the other

comrades have already been contained!



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

shall look forward very much to hearing the Member

for  Farrer  Park when he talks on  the  Political

Secretary to the Minister for Labour and  Law.  He

and  I  share one advantage in that he knows  what

the  background was about, and so do I.  He  knows

that at the end of the election we had a group who

were  comrades with us in prison. Whether  in  the

new  phase  of  the struggle they  will  fight  as

closely   in  the  movement  for  an  independent,

democratic,   non-Communist,   socialist    Malaya

depends  upon their declaration and their  action.

At the time of their release, these gentlemen made

an open and firm declaration that they were behind

the Party stand; that they were in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



favour   of   an  independent,  democratic,

non-Communist,   socialist  Malaya;  and   that   they

supported   not  only  the  long-term   aims   and

objectives  of the P.A.P., but also the democratic

methods by which we hope to achieve them. Sir,  if

that   declaration  was  honestly  and   sincerely

believed in - and I am confident that it was  so  in

the   case  of  the  Political  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Education, who resigned  for  other

reasons - then I say that they are valuable men.  If

it  was  done  as a tactical manoeuvre  for  other

purposes,  then  I say that is a matter  which  is

bound  to lead to further developments at a  later

stage.  What I would like to say is this. What  is

said  is  sometimes less important  than  what  is

unsaid, and we have a lot of unsaid things on this

subject  because the matter has not  yet  come  to

finality.   The  declaration  stands - a   clear-cut

declaration on the democratic aims and  objectives

of   a  non-Communist,  socialist  Party  and  its

methods.  There  was  a minor disagreement  as  to

certain policies on the trade unions which made it

necessary  for the Political Secretary,  Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan,  to  be removed from the  Ministry  of

Labour. I think I need not say more, least of  all

to the Member for Cairnhill. Sir, he had access to

confidential  reports  and  all  other  kinds   of

material long before I had access to them. I would

like  to  make  this  point. Unlike  him  and  his

colleagues, we trade in the open. We are unable to

say,  "Ah,  although  you say  this,  you  do  not

believe it." In the nature of things, we have  not

only   to   do  what  is  fair  but  what  appears

manifestly to be fair; and believe you me we  have

never  been  afraid  to  pursue  things  to  their

logical  consequences  when  they  are  manifestly

fair.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, let me not now deal with

the  things that have not been said or things that

had  better be left unsaid. Let me then deal  with

the  things that the Prime Minister has  said.  He

says, in reply to the Member for Mountbatten, that

these  Political Secretaries are mainly  appointed

because  of  their skill, as, a  result  of  their

background, in the performance of functions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



for the Ministers. And now he says that there is a

different reason for their retention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is for the same reason.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I would therefore suggest

that  if an explanation is to be given, it  should

not  only be a fair one but also a manifestly fair

one. I would not want to touch on the niceties  of

the things that have been left unsaid, because  we

know  that there are so many things that need  not

be said and could be left unsaid; but I can assure

the Prime Minister that a lot will be said when it

comes  to  my  turn  to  speak  on  the  Political

Secretary to the Minister for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

am  glad  to hear that the Prime Minister believes

in  what  is fair and what is manifestly fair.  He

has  said  that Mr Fong Swee Suan  was  moved  to

another  Ministry  for having attacked  Government

policy.  He  goes  on  to  say  that  there   were

different  ways of moving him - either  politely  or

impolitely -  and that he chose the polite  way  of

doing  it. Sir, would he not deem it fair also  to

give civil servants the polite way of treatment if

they  happen  to violate any General Order?  Would

they  be  given  the  same  polite  treatment  and

transferred to another department instead of being

sacked?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The civil servants are

governed   by   General   Orders   and   different

considerations apply. They are dealt with  by  due

process  by  the Public Service Commission.  Since

the hon. Lady has raised this matter, I might take

this  opportunity  to say that  reorganisation  is

afoot  whereby  the Establishment Section  of  the

Ministry of Finance, which was inherited from  the

former  Chief Secretary's Office, is slowly  being

transferred  to the Public Service Commission,  as

it is in most other democratic countries where the

civil   service   is  neutral.  The   disciplinary

proceedings and the necessary staff to look  after

them  are  to  be  moved  from  the  Establishment

Section to the Public Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while

accepting, for the purposes of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



argument,  the proposition of the Hon. the  Prime

Minister that Political Secretaries were appointed

because  of  their  special  abilities  and  their

special  background to fit into certain Ministries

where  they  could perform a useful function,  one

saw the point of appointing Mr Fong Swee Suan  to

the  Ministry of Labour. But when he  was  removed

from  that  Ministry, instead of  sending  him  to

another  Ministry  where  there  was  already   an

approved  post, like the Ministry of Home Affairs,

I would have thought that if any Minister needed a

Political Secretary to get his views across to the

population at large, it would have been  the  Hon.

the  Minister for Home Affairs; but  he  seems  to

have  got on without a Political Secretary and  he

looks  very happy! Can I attribute that  happiness

to  the  fact  that  he has not  had  a  Political

Secretary?  A  special post was  created  in  1960

under  Warrant  No. 60/60 in the Ministry  of  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  and  the  basis  of  the

proposition  is  that Mr Fong Swee  Suan  is  now

going  to perform a useful function in the  Deputy

Prime Minister's Office. Therefore, let us examine

his  portfolio. The subjects under  his  portfolio

appear   at  page  81  of  the  Estimates.  "Civil

Aviation"-I wonder how Mr Fong Swee Suan is going

to  help  by advising on civil aviation! The  next

one is "Marine". I am sure that Mr Fong Swee Suan

will  be  completely  at sea  on  that  particular

subject! The next one is "Marine Surveys". I think

he  will  be m even deeper waters there!  Head  16

reads   "Meteorological   Services"-it   is   very

difficult  to  pronounce! Head  17  reads  "Postal

Services". Other than knowing how to post a letter

at  which pillar box, I wonder what Mr Fong  Swee

Suan could help the Deputy Prime Minister on!  The

next one is "Telecommunications". And the last  is

"Vehicles Registration". Really, Mr Kandasamy, do

you  think he could serve a useful purpose for the

Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think it does not require

a  Sherlock Holmes mind to trace the fact that the

Deputy  Prime Minister was originally not provided

with  a  Political Secretary for the very  obvious

reasons which have been heavily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



underlined.  As  I have explained to  the  Members

opposite,  there are polite and impolite  ways  of

doing  things. We wanted to be polite and fair  to

the  man  concerned, and nothing would gratify  us

more  than to have him develop a useful  and  keen

interest  in  the  subjects that  the  Member  for

Farrer Park has just mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on

this  matter of Political Secretaries, we can  see

very   clearly  the  various  goings  on  in   the

different Ministries during the past year. However

much  the  Prime Minister can tell us  as  to  how

Political Secretaries are regarded, as far as  the

Opposition  is  concerned, money  is  involved  in

paying for them. If the money paid to them is  not

from public funds, then it is not a matter for the

Opposition   to   raise.   If   these    Political

Secretaries can be of real benefit to  the  people

and  are  paid  accordingly,  then  there  is   no

question about it at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the second amendment

standing in the names of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>





Mr Rajah, Mrs Seow and Inche Mohd. Ali, Mr

Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (20) of sub-head

1.



<br><br>Item  (20) shows "Chauffeurs, five - One new post."

Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, perhaps  I

could  be permitted to speak at the same  time  on

the   next   amendment  of  which  I  have   given

notice - the amendment on sub-head 5. There is  also

another  amendment  which  I  can  usefully   take

together, i.e., the amendment on sub-head 14.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is, amendments (3)* and (7)+. Perhaps that would be convenient to the Prime

Minister?

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (3) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by $10 in respect of

sub-head 5.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+Amendment (7) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by $10 in respect of

sub-head 14.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present

position in the Prime Minister's Ministry  appears

to  be that there are four cars, for which he  has

four  drivers. One new post has been created under

the  vote,  and  he is asking for another  driver,

making  two  drivers in respect of  two  new  cars

which will be purchased under sub-head 14 - if I may

deal with all three at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Prime Minister

enlighten  the  House  as  to  why  his   Ministry

requires  two more cars when his Ministry  already

has the use of four cars? That is the first point.

The second point, Mr Speaker, is this: why is  it

necessary, under sub-head 5, for one chauffeur  to

be paid $3,040, that is, at the rate of about $253

a  month, when the five chauffeurs under item (20)

of sub-head I only cost about $120 each per month?

The  last point, Mr Speaker, is this: why  is  it

necessary for two new cars to be purchased by  the

Ministry  costing $32,400, that is  about  $16,200

each,  and what is the meaning of the phrase  "For

use  as  State  Cars."? I would have thought,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that the phrase "State Cars"  might

usefully appear under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



Yang di-Pertuan Negara's vote. If one looks at the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's vote, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that is, on page 37 of the Estimates, the Yang

di-Pertuan  has only five chauffeurs. And  the  total

cost  of  those five chauffeurs to  the  State  is

$9,400,  whereas the total cost of  chauffeurs  in

the Prime Minister's Ministry would be $7,150 plus

$3,040, making a total of $10,190. So that we  get

to  the  position  where, in the Prime  Minister's

Ministry, Chauffeurs will cost $10,190 whereas the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's vote is Only $9,400.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> In view of what the Member

for Farrer Park has said, I do not wish to speak.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali:</b> I share the same view as the

Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I save the time of the

House  by referring the Member for Farrer Park  to

Hansard,  Vol.  13,  No. 9,  col.  617,  where  my

Parliamentary Secretary has set out  the  position

regarding  State  cars? There are,  in  fact,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  three  State  cars  and  one  City

Council  car,  making four cars. There  are  three

drivers and one City Council driver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I first deal with the second amendment,

"Daily      Rated     Employee,     Wages      and

Allowance - Chauffeur"? This is a curious  situation

where  the chauffeur drives the car which formerly

was  used by the President of the Council, as  and

when  he is required; otherwise he drives the City

Council  vehicle. And he is paid at  a  very  high

rate because he drives one of the larger vehicles.

This vote is put in to ensure that, as and when he

is  used, he can be paid from this vote. But it is

not  intended  to transfer him into the  permanent

establishment   because  his   salary   scale   is

completely disproportionate to that which  obtains

for the other chauffeurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are four chauffeurs in the

establishment, and we are asking for  an  increase

of  one to look after the two cars which are to be

bought. I want to be very careful of what  I  say.

Our  guests are people who come here from time  to

time - visiting  World  Bank teams,  United  Nations

representatives,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



delegations  from  the Federation  of  Malaya  and

Indonesia  and elsewhere. They have to  be  looked

after,  and  looked  after  properly.  There   are

monthly occasions where three Ministers have to be

present at conferences and, at the same time, look

after  guests, and on these occasions we  have  so

far  managed by borrowing cars from the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara and, in some cases, by hiring  them

from the garages at about $90 per day, I think. We

are  intending to buy two cars to add to the  pool

to  meet  the contingencies which arise  more  and

more  frequently, when not only our  Ministers  on

official  duty  have to travel in  State  cars  to

attend  functions and conferences,  but  also  our

guests who are here have to be attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

although  two  new cars are being bought,  we  are

only  asking for one new post because, as  I  have

said,  we  will only use the City Council employee

as  and  when  required to drive  that  particular

vehicle;  and perhaps be able to use such  drivers

as  may  be free from the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

establishment when we have guests to look after.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of the Hon. the Prime

Minister's  explanation, may I be given  leave  to

withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> and <b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr A. P. Rajah and Mrs Seow Peck Leng :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 he

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (3) is in regard to

sub-head 5 which we have dealt with. I take it that it

will not be moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> and <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 10, Mr Speaker, Sir, is "Maintenance

of Vehicles". The Estimates show for 1960 a sum of

$9,300



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



which is to be increased by $2,500, making $11,800

for the ensuing year. The number of vehicles which

is  proposed in excess of the current ones is  two

and  both  of them are new. I notice, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that throughout the Budget estimates,  there

seems  to  be  a tendency to reduce  the  vote  on

maintenance  of vehicles in the other departments.

But  in the case of the Prime Minister's Ministry,

although  the  additional  vehicles  will  be  new

vehicles,  it is proposed that the vote should  go

up by $2,500.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Farrer

Park  is quite right as to the general trend.  The

answer  is  that  we now have to include  in  this

maintenance a City Council car which is about  ten

years  old,  a Humber Pullman, and which  will  no

longer  be  maintained  under  City  Council  vote

because  of  integration. Therefore,  we  have  to

carry out the repairs under this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I be given leave to

withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I make a suggestion that items

of  this nature are matters of detail? And perhaps

the hon. Member moving the amendment in respect of

such  an  item might consider whether  or  not  it

would  be a proper item to be investigated by  the

Estimates  Committee. We are  really  now  dealing

more   with  policy  matters  than  with  details,

although  of  course there is nothing  to  prevent

Members  from asking for information. But if  they

feel  that  it could be better dealt with  by  the

Estimates  Committee,  then  perhaps  they   could

indicate. Mr Rajah, amendment (5)*.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think there is no principle

involved  in  this  amendment, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.

Perhaps, as you have suggested, it is one of those

items  which could possibly be more usefully dealt

with  by the Estimates Committee. In view of that,

might I be given leave to withdraw this amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In any case, I would like to

give the information for the record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Prime Minister would like to

give  the  information. So perhaps the Member  for

Farrer Park will move formally?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is this: the Prime Minister's

Ministry  now  carries a Transport and  Travelling

allowance  of  $7,140. That I take  it,  would  be

transport  and travelling expenses of the  various

members  of  the staff engaged on  duties  of  his

Ministry.  But the vote is going up  to  $9,140 - an

increase  of $2,000. As the Ministry is  going  to

divest  itself of most of its duties in so far  as

the  City  Council is concerned, is  it  necessary

that that vote should go up by $2,000?



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The answer is that since the

last  Budget,  the Land and District  Offices  and

Planning  have  permanently  become  part  of   my

Ministry,  and  they  carry  an  establishment  of

permanent  officials who have to travel from  time

to  time.  This vote is to cover their  travelling

expenses,  and I will not be divested - not  in  the

foreseeable future - of either Lands or Planning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I be given leave to withdraw, Mr

Speaker?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, recently we have seen from the

newspapers  that  a Minister from  the  Federation

went  to  the  United Kingdom in  connection  with

Malaya Hall. I also notice that the vote is  being

reduced  from $54,000 to $39,000. Could the  Prime

Minister  inform the House whether  for  the  year 1961 Malaya Hall is going to be a joint venture of

the  Federation and ourselves, or whether  we  are

going  to  maintain  a separate  establishment  in

respect of which this vote is now being sought?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The provision made in the

Estimates  is  on  the  basis  that  Malaya   Hall

continues  to  be  a joint venture.  We  have  not

received   any  indication  from  the   Federation

Government whether any changes are being  proposed

and,  if so, in what direction. The reason  why  a

smaller sum has been voted for is partly that of a

more  economical  management of Malaya  Hall,  but

principally  because  the  development   cost   of

expanding the hostel, which was the reason for the

higher  expenditure  in  previous  years,  is  now

coming to an end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of that explanation, may

I be given leave to withdraw?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, with your permission range over

sub-head  17  as  well, because these  two  items  are

connected?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have no objection. It is for the

convenience of Members.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I would like to have some

information  from the Government side  as  to  how

these  two items could be used. What do they  have

in  mind  when  they want to open  an  office  and

residential  accommodation in  Kuala  Lumpur,  and

what  they  are going to put there? He is  just  a

Trade  and Information Officer. If it is necessary

to  have  closer  contact with the  Federation,  I

think  an  officer of a higher calibre  should  be

there. But I still think, Sir, that if it can,  be

avoided,  we  should  not have  a  sort  of  Trade

Commissioner's  Office  or Information  Office  in

Kuala  Lumpur, because Kuala Lumpur  is  so  near.

Kuala Lumpur has been treated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



more  or less as if it were in the same house.  It

is  just a different room. For the sake of  closer

co-operation  and  with a view  to  having  closer

understanding,  I  think it  would  be  better  if

Ministers would take it upon themselves to get  in

close   touch  with  their  counterparts  in   the

Federation  than  to  have a civil  servant  there

trying  to do a job which, in fact, is a political

job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is considerable

substance  in  the  argument  to  maintain  close,

friendly  and informal contact with the Federation

Government and their Ministers. The best thing  is

not  to  have any representative in Kuala  Lumpur,

Sir.  Personal  contact  both  in  person  and  by

telephone could be made use of frequently.  But  a

difficulty   has  arisen  in  that,   unlike   the

procedure  in  the  past, where officials  of  the

Singapore   Government  could  write   direct   to

permanent   civil  servants  of   the   Federation

Government, it has been the practice for some time

now  for the Minister first to take up the  matter

with  his counterpart before it goes down  to  the

civil  service level. There are two  arguments  to

this.  If  you  appoint someone there  of  a  high

calibre, he would substitute the personal  contact

which  would  normally have  taken  place  between

Ministers.   And,  therefore,  it  might   be   of

advantage  not  to  set  up  more  than  really  a

clearing  house  for  the  quick  passing  on   of

information  of what we intend to do and  of  what

they   intend   to  do.  We  often   have   little

difficulties  like  this:  sometimes  rumour,  and

sometimes  more  than  rumour,  spreads  that  the

importation  of,  for  instance,  pigs  is  to  be

prohibited into the Federation; or that  there  is

going  to  be  a higher duty on eggs. The  present

arrangement  is so cumbrous that the Minister  for

National Development has to take it up. Finally it

comes to me, and I have to write to my counterpart

in  the Federation. Then it goes back down to  the

officials, and finally it turns out that they have

no intention for the time being of either stopping

pigs  or putting up the tax on eggs. If we have  a

quick clearing-house for information, we hope that

a lot of this kind of difficulties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



could  be overcome. I am fully alive to the danger

that if you have a high-powered representative, he

would   supplant  the  personal  contact   between

Ministers,  which  is  absolutely  fundamental.  I

think  we  must go about this thing gradually  and

slowly - feel our way forward. What we do  not  want

to  do  is  to  develop any institution  in  Kuala

Lumpur, be it called a Trade Office or Information

Office,  which  will formalise  the  relationship,

which  is  at  present  on  a  very  informal  and

friendly  and  sometimes intimate  basis,  between

Ministers  in  the two territories.  But  I  think

there  is a need for someone to be there to  make

sure  that information is passed quickly  and  the

lines are kept clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, while the Opposition agrees that

everything should be done with a view to  bringing

about  closer  understanding, closer  relationship

and  quicker  clearance of  vital  issues  between

ourselves and the Federation, what we on this side

of  the House, Mr Speaker, are afraid of is  that

something  of  this nature would  rather  tend  to

emphasise  the separation of the two  territories.

It creates a psychological situation which I think

at the moment would be undesirable. It shows in  a

concrete  sort  of  way  that  Singapore  and  the

Federation  are separate and distinct territories,

and  that,  therefore, it is necessary  to  create

official establishments which would be used by the

two  Governments as a clearing-house. On this side

of  the  House  we rather feel, Mr Speaker,  that

although  we cannot deny that there are  desirable

features  about  this proposal,  it  would  appear

that,  on  balance, and in view of the  fact  that

there  seems to be a tendency for us to go further

and  further away from each other, something  like

this would tend to emphasise it rather than bridge

the differences. The Hon. the Prime Minister said,

and the impression I got from his speech was, that

we would start in a small way in Kuala Lumpur. But

the  nature of the work seems to indicate that  it

is  not  going  to  - be in  a  small  way.  It  is

committing   the   Finance  Ministry   to   nearly

$300,000. I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Finance will in this instance  agree

with me that it is not a small sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Again I regret to inform the

House of what the former Government wanted to  do,

namely, to exchange the use of Government quarters

which  were  in Government's hands. Unfortunately,

the   Federation  Government  has  already  bought

theirs  in Singapore, and all their quarters  have

been  taken  up.  Therefore, we are  committed  to

getting  a  lease on an extremely high  market  in

Kuala  Lumpur. Whatever it is, we have to  have  a

secretariat  for one man - whatever we call  him.  I

see a lot in the argument that if we start this we

might  finally  wind up in more  formal  and  more

distant  relations. It is for that reason that  we

have been careful not to call it more than a Trade

and  Information Office. Perhaps we might even  go

on  a lower note, and just have an office to clear

things  for  Ministers  and,  if  necessary,  have

Ministers  go  up to clear things for  themselves.

But  from  our  experience over the last  eighteen

months,  particularly in view of the  difficulties

about  channels of communication having to go  out

first to Ministers before the civil servants clear

it  among  themselves, I think that  will  require

some  kind  of office accommodation  on  a  modest

scale together with residential accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have no objection to the Prime Minister having  an

office  and  residential  accommodation  in  Kuala

Lumpur.  But what I do not understand  is  why  he

should    have    an   office   and    residential

accommodation which cost a quarter  of  a  million

dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, whoever goes to Kuala

Lumpur  has to live there, and there is  a  saying

that  "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." I would

say that the person going up to Kuala Lumpur would

have  to  move  amongst people  who  have  certain

standards of social and other official courtesies,

and  I  think  nothing would be more  damaging  to

Singapore  than  not to be able to  fit  into  the

scheme  of  things. I want to make this one  point

clear,  and  I am quite prepared to say unpleasant

things if need be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to this. One, this

Government  and  its Ministers  in  their  private

capacity.  We  have certain frugal  and  sometimes

puritanical  standards for a highly  sophisticated

political purpose, as political meaning behind the

sort of things we do, and the sort of things we do

not do. The other aspect is this. When we have  to

deal  with other Governments, be it the Indonesian

Government, the Consular representatives here  and

in  Kuala Lumpur, then there are certain standards

and  forms which we have to maintain on behalf  of

the  State.  As  I have said, what we  would  have

liked to do was just to exchange the houses as was

attempted by the previous Government. I  think  it

did  not  quite  see it through, and  it  was  not

successful.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation given me, I beg leave to withdraw  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (9)* is not being moved. Amendment (10), Dato Abdul Hamid, on page 64 of

the Estimates.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (9) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by $10 in respect of

sub-head 17.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the appointment of a Trade and

Cultural Representative in Djakarta, though it  is

late; but what worries me is the sum involved. The

House  has been asked to vote the sum of $215,290.

If  we  delete the expenditure to be  incurred  on

capital  outlay,  (two  bicycles,  furniture,  two

motor vehicles and office equipment and so on), it

still leaves a sum of $147,900 to contend with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here the Estimates of the Federation

of  Malaya Government for 1961. I notice  that  on

pages  133  and 134, for a total of 22  home-based

locally recruited staff, the Federation Government

has earmarked a sum of $149,584



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



in  personal  emoluments,  whereas  the  Singapore

Government  is budgeting for the sum  of  $106,240

for  a  staff  of 11, which means more  than

two-thirds  the amount for exactly half the number  of

staff. Then again the Ambassador of the Federation

of  Malaya  in Djakarta is being paid a salary  of

$1,850 per mensem, whereas we are now being  asked

to  vote the sum of $1,950 for our chief executive

in   Djakarta.   Although  the   post   of   Trade

Commissioner calls for a Grade G appointment,  the

salary being $1,520 per mensem, for reasons  known

only to the Government, the person to be appointed

will draw a salary of $1,950 per mensem. I wonder,

Sir,  who this superman is who is going to be paid

$1,950  per  mensem  for doing  a  job  which  the

Government  itself admits is worth only  $1,520  a

month. I wonder if the Prime Minister could assure

the  House  that  when  the appointments  do  take

place,  there  will be a bit of pruning  here  and

there.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

estimates for our Indonesian Office have been gone

through  most carefully by the Treasury  and  have

been  finally  agreed to after prolonged  argument

between the Treasury and the Commerce and Industry

Division  of  my Ministry. I can assure  you  that

there has been no undue extravagance anywhere.  In

fact, when running overseas establishments, it  is

important  that we maintain certain standards  and

that we do not allow the good name of Singapore to

be  lowered  by  having  poorly  situated,  poorly

furnished   and   poorly  managed  establishments.

Overseas  establishments are necessarily expensive

to  run  because of the prestige element involved.

What  we  have  done is to get  the  lowest  rates

applicable  in  the  overseas  establishments   of

various governments, and this is the final result.

For  a  number  of  reasons,  I  do  not  think  a

comparison with the Federation establishment would

be  fair. Firstly, of course, this being the first

time that our establishment is going to be set up,

we have to incur pretty heavy capital expenditure.

In the second place, you will notice that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



a  fairly  considerable sum of  $34,000  has  been

allotted to overseas allowances. I have not before

me  the Federation Estimates, but I am inclined to

believe that the allowances set out there, are  in

a  sense, only nominal and that they do have other

allowances  which would be paid out of  a  central

vote  in  the External Affairs Ministry.  This  is

because  of  the  practice which most  governments

observe  of  keeping  the  true  amount  of  their

overseas  allowances and the expenditure on  their

foreign establishments a State secret.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the proposed holder of the office of

Senior  Trade  and  Cultural  Representative,  the

Government  has  in mind the appointment,  in  the

first instance, of the present Permanent Secretary

of  the  Commerce  and  Industry  Division  of  my

Ministry. He has been working on this project  for

a long time and he has excellent contacts with the

officials    of    the   Indonesian    Government.

Eventually,  of  course, when we find  a  suitable

person  to  replace  him, the post  will  be  held

substantively by a Superscale G officer.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, in that case, why

do we not properly state in the Estimates that the

Senior Trade and Cultural Representative would  be

drawing  a  salary of $1,950 instead  of  what  is

stated - Grade G [$1,520]?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, I am not suggesting to the

Government that they should blindly follow what is

taking  place  in the Federation or in  any  other

part  of the world. My only point was to draw  the

attention of the Government to the fact  that,  in

spite of this being the first overseas office that

is  going to be established, they will be spending

twice  as  much as what the Federation  Government

will be spending for 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the explanation of the Minister, Sir,

I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, hon. Members do know

that there is the Estimates Committee. If they are

dissatisfied  with the amounts  appearing  in  the

Estimates,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



they  could always ask the Estimates Committee  to

look into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see, Sir, that under this sub-head a good

number  of  new posts are being created, obviously

with  a  view  to  making the Trade Commissioner's

Office in London more effective and of greater use

to  Singapore. If one were to base it on what  was

said during election time and on speeches made  in

this   Assembly,   that  the   colonial   economic

structure  is choking Singapore, then  how  is  it

that  we  are going to the United Kingdom  to  get

them  to come to Singapore to help in the economic

development  here? While on this subject,  Sir,  I

would  like  to  know  who is  the  present  Trade

Commissioner in London.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Two points have to be cleared

up,  Mr Speaker. The first is this: why this  new

post?  Second - the  incumbent of  the  office.  The

reason  for  creating  this  new  post  is  fairly

simple. It has nothing to do with having more ties

with the United Kingdom Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a number of services were performed

by  the  Crown  Agents for a  fee.  This  included

handling  of  payments of salaries to officers  on

leave, pensions, allowances to our students in the

United  Kingdom, passages to and fro and so forth.

A  fee  of  one per cent was charged by the  Crown

Agents,  and  this  worked  out  to  approximately

$42,000 a year. After due examination of the  work

involved,  we have decided that it is cheaper  and

more  efficient if we perform that work ourselves.

Accordingly,  this new post is created  to  enable

not only the work of payments, booking of passages

and  so on to be done, but better liaison with our

students in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question is this-the

present  holder of the post is the former  officer

in  the  Commerce  and  Industry  Division  of  my

Ministry, Mr G. F. A. Hibberd.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, from the information

given by the Minister for Finance, it would appear

that the present incumbent is Mr Hibberd, who was

only  recently  in  a  certain  division  in   his

Ministry. If I were informed correctly, Sir,  this

Mr  Hibberd was malayanised and he took away with

him the Malayanisation compensation. Yet, in spite

of  the compensation which has been given to  him,

he is now given quite a senior job in London. This

makes  it  more easy for him. Surely, Sir,  if  we

want a representative in London to look after  the

interests of the Singapore Government, I  am  sure

the  Minister for Finance will be able to  find  a

suitable   representative   from   Singapore    to

represent us.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the position at the

moment  is  that Mr Hibberd is running the  place

purely as an administrator, and for that reason it

is  still called the Trade Commissioner's  Office.

The  proposal  that has been put  to  us  to  send

someone who would be able to sell Singapore - so  to

speak - has  not  been forgotten by the  Government.

The difficulty is to find somebody who would be an

asset.  Such people, particularly for a  Left-wing

Government,  are  scarce  to  come   by   in   the

commercial   word,  and  they  are  in   lucrative

employment   either  as  Managing   Directors   or

Directors  of  companies, banks,  insurance,  etc.

When such a person is available, we will make  the

appointment,  as it is the ultimate  intention  to

change the Trade Commissioner's Office to that  of

a  Commissioner's  Office. Mr  Hibberd  has  been

employed  because he knows the background  of  the

work  that  is required of him, that is,  to  take

away  the  job that was done before by  the  Crown

Agents   and  to  run  the  office  more   as   an

administrator than as a trade representative.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation given, may I beg leave to withdraw?

not  see  it  in the corresponding  column  as  it

normally  appears  in  the Estimates.  Either  the

for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is a revote covered in

the  grant to the S.I.T. Budget. Sir, this  is  in

respect of the cost of printing provisions to  the

exhausted so far because there has been some staff

shortage,  and  one officer has now returned  from

training  from abroad and he expects  to  make  an

interim revision for at least part of the town map

area. The interim revision will cover Master  Plan

answered  the  point  I wish to  raise,  that  is,

whether this $20,000 is going to be spent  by  the

Government  on preparing documents in  respect  of

areas  in  Singapore which appear on  the  general

Master  Plan  as allocated for a specific  purpose

but  in respect of which no detailed plans are yet

available;   which  position  is   causing   great

hardship  to the owners of such land in the  sense

that  whenever  they go to the Planning  Committee

for  the  development of that land,  the  planners

always say, "No specific plans are available.  You

will  have to await developments." Now, that is  a

most  unhappy  state of affairs not only  for  the

owners  of  the  land  but also  for  the  general

progress  of  the State of Singapore.  Sir,  I  am

happy  that this money is being provided,  but  on

the question of whether it is a revote, I am still

not  satisfied.  If it was part of  the  Singapore

improvement Trust Budget, then surely it is not  a

revote but a new vote.

matter  in  more detail if the Member  for  Farrer

Park  is  so  desirous, but I would say  that  the

reason  could  well  have been that  the  planning

section of the S.I.T. was transferred to the Prime

Minister's  office sometime this year. That  might

have been the reason why that particular item  did

not appear in last year's Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,107,240 for Head 7 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 8 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of my moving this

amendment is to draw attention to the position  of

the  ketuas  and  penghulus, particularly  in  the

Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to know the duties and

responsibilities of these ketuas and penghulus vis

a  vis the Government in their respective areas. I

would  also  like to bring to the  notice  of  the

Government certain matters which have been told to

me   in  my  Southern  Islands.  The  ketuas   and

penghulus  are  not happy with their  duties  and

responsibilities.  It  was the  intention  of  the

previous  Government  that a District  and  Island

Council    was    to    be   formed,    comprising

representatives of the various Islands, to go into

matters affecting the progress of the people.  But

under  the present Government, this plan  was  not

proceeded  with.  I  do not deny  that  many  good

measures  have been introduced by the  Government.

But what I want to bring up is that there are some

penghulus   who  have  their  own  representatives

assisting them in some of the smaller areas. These

people  do  not  receive any allowance,  it  would

appear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



that  their  duties and responsibilities  are  the

same as those of the ketuas. From my experience, I

know  that  their duties and responsibilities  are

heavy,  as they have to look after the welfare  of

the  people. It seems to me that the powers of the

penghulus  would  tend to retard  progress.  Their

powers  are such that it would appear they do  not

like  people  to  have  direct  contact  with  the

departments  of  the Government. The  people  must

channel any matter through the penghulus.  I  feel

that this should not be so and that the people  of

Singapore  should  be aware of  the  position.  To

avoid  all misunderstanding, I feel that elections

should be held to choose the penghulus. The system

of  handling  down the posts to the  children  and

grandchildren  of the penghulus  should  not  hold

good  nowadays. In the Federation of  Malaya,  the

penghulus are elected in their respective areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

unable  to  give  any  considered  reply  to   the

proposal  by the Member for the Southern  Islands.

This  is a new one which has just been put on  the

Floor and there may be something in it I would not

like  to commit the Government as to whether  this

would  be an innovation worth trying. What we  are

doing is to use the existing system in which every

contact  between the islanders and the  Government

is  maintained by penghulus appointed partly by us

and partly by authority, by the fact that they are

accepted  by  the  people  of  the  Islands.   The

increase  in the vote is really to meet the  point

which  was  made  by the Member for  the  Southern

Islands, in that not only does the penghulu do the

work  but he has all kinds of helpers, and amongst

the  helpers  are  the ketuas.  Before  this,  the

penghulu  was given $500 per annum and the  ketuas

$250. Now, in view of the fact that they spend  $2

or  $3  a  trip  every  time  they  come  down  to

Singapore, it was thought that a $100 increase for

the ketua was justified. Whether we go further and

give  an  allowance to the ketua's  assistant  who

runs for the ketua, that is a matter which we will

have to look into very carefully. I would not like

to commit the Government on this. It is not just a

question of doing what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



is  right It is also a question of doing  what  is

acceptable  to the islanders and to the traditions

and habits to which they are accustomed.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Prime  Minister  himself  has  admitted  that  the

penghulus  are obliged to make frequent visits  to

Government offices, thereby expending their pocket

money. By travelling to Singapore, they are forced

to  be  away from their work. The allowances  they

get will not, I feel, be sufficient, and this will

have  a  more  marked effect if their visits  keep

them  away from fishing, especially during a  good

season.   But   because  of  the  responsibilities

entrusted to them by the Government, they have  to

carry  out their duties, which will cause them  to

incur financial loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the election of penghulus, I know of

two  or  three areas where the assistant penghulus

do  not  get the co-operation of the residents  in

the areas. The election of a penghulu should prove

that  the  people there desire to co-operate  with

him.  I hope that my suggestion will be considered

by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

stated,  I  am unable to commit the Government  to

changing  the system whereby penghulus  have  been

appointed.  But  I can assure the Member  for  the

Southern Islands that if there is any penghulu  or

ketua who is unsuitable and obviously unacceptable

to  the islanders - even though he was acceptable or

thought  to  be acceptable when he was  appointed,

but  subsequently  he lost the confidence  of  the

islanders or lost interest in his job - then changes

can  be made. But beyond this statement, I do  not

think I can go so far as to say that we would like

to  do what the islanders want. If they would like

a  certain  person  to  represent  them  and  they

accepted him as a penghulu, then we would  be  the

first  to  acknowledge him as  the  local  leader,

because  that  would facilitate  the  business  of

government. But whether there should be  a  formal

election, it is another matter altogether.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in

view  of  the  explanation given by the  Hon. the

Prime Minister, may I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 8 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 24.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is the vote of $8,000 for 1960 for

water  and  electricity supplies to  the  Southern

Islands.  If  I  am not mistaken,  at  the  moment

expenditure   is  incurred  on  the  water   boats

carrying  water to the islanders in Pulau  Sudong.

Electricity  supply  is  made  available  only  to

islanders  in  Pulau Brani, the electricity  being

supplied by the War Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the vote is to be increased to $22,000,

I  would  like  to seek clarification  as  to  the

nature of the increase of expenditure. About  nine

months  ago,  an application was made  to  provide

electricity to the residents in Pulau  Brani,  the

suggestion being to supply generated power supply.

I  am  told that this application has been K.I.V'd

without any finality. I feel that if there is such

an  enterprise,  it is proper that  the  applicant

should  get all encouragement, because  this  will

reduce  Government  expenditure  on  the  Southern

Islands.  If the application is approved  for  the

supply  of electricity to the residents  in  Pulau

Brani,  then it will set an example to  the  other

islanders   to   install  similar  amenities   for

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the vote of $8,000 for

1960 has been increased to $22,000 because, at the

beginning,  the vote for 1959 for the construction

of water tanks could not be completed in 1960, and

therefore  the  water supply could  only  be  made

available during the last few months of this year.

The  supply of water for these few months did  not

incur  much  expenditure. Now that  everything  is

completed,   it  is  necessary  to  increase   the

expenditure to cover water supplies for the  whole

of  next  year. We have to take into consideration

not only the water supply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



to  Pulau  Sudong, but also the  water  supply  to

Pulau  Bukom Kechil. The islanders in Bukom Kechil

at  present tap the water from Bukom Besar through

pipelines  laid by the Shell Company,  and  it  is

paid by the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the application for electricity

supply,  as  far  as  I know, it  is  still  being

considered because the cost to be charged  to  the

consumers by the applicant is exorbitant. There is

a   possibility  that  the  application  will   be

reconsidered in the not too distant future.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on

the subject of water supplies to Pulau Sudong, I am

satisfied  with  the explanation, except  that  I

hope  the  Minister  concerned will  give  further

attention  to the matter, because I am  told  that

there  are insufficient water boats carrying water

for  storage, tanks, and supplies are  transported

once  in  two or three-days. However,  this  is  a

small  matter which could be looked  into  by  the

Ministry concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards consideration to be given to the

applicant   for  electricity - supplies   to   the

residents in Pulau Brani, I hope the matter can be

expedited  so that I will not be further pestered,

as  the decision on the application has been  kept

pending  for so long. The question is whether  the

application will be approved or disapproved. I  am

so far satisfied with the explanation given. May I

beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

submit   for  the  attention  of  Government   the

following three points-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member first move

his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I am sorry. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 8 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to submit to Government for

consideration  and attention the  following  three

points.  First, an early revision  of  the  Master

Plan.  I  am glad to hear from the Prime  Minister

just now that work has commenced. Second,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



early legislation to take certain measures of land

reform,  because residents in the rural areas  are

facing   an   acute  land  problem.   And   third,

continuation  of  the work of  Government  in  the

Southern  Islands  because the  people  there  are

really  living  under  depressed  conditions.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I just want to dwell on these  three

matters, and I hope Government will give them  due

consideration. Perhaps my colleague might like  to

add  some words later, as he is more familiar with

problems in the rural areas.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Government has  done

nothing  to solve the problem. Many peasants  have

no  land.  On the other hand, there are many  golf

clubs.  For example, the Royal Golf Club possesses

more  than  1,000 acres of government land.  These

lands  are freely given to the foreigners to enjoy

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should utilise Singapore's

limited  land for the benefit of the  peasants  or

for  the  benefit of the State economy.  The  land

should  not  be  used for a few  persons  only  to

enjoy.  I  hope  the Government  will  requisition

these  lands for development purposes. Ever  since

the  P.A.P. came into power, the Government  have

promised land for the farmers. They have said that

they will exercise their right to requisition  the

land  which  is intended to help the farmers.  But

after  one year of office the Government  has  not

carried  out this promise. As a representative  of

the   rural  areas,  I  am  more  aware  of  their

hardships  and  difficulties.  For  the  past  two

years,  the farmers have suffered at the hands  of

the  big  landlords. Therefore,  their  livelihood

also  suffers.  The farmers need  land  badly  for

cultivation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for Hong Lim and

his  friend opposite have mentioned some  problems

relating  to  land. I wish to give my reply  here.

Everybody  knows  that the land  in  Singapore  is

limited and the population is on the increase. The

P.A.P.  Government already know this. We know  all

these problems confronting us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mention some of the actions of the former

Minister  for National Development with regard  to

his  work for the farmers. I think many understand

what  he  did  in the past. I feel that  the  work

which  he did as a Minister was not right. In  the

past,  he  always  said  that  he  wanted  to   do

something for the rural farmers; for instance, how

to solve the land problem. Did he do any reform in

this  respect when he was the Minister? I  believe

the  rural  people are very clear about  this.  In

this  connection, I wish to touch on this  problem

again because I myself come from the rural area. I

am  a  representative for the rural area.  I  have

been brought up there. Therefore, I know very well

the conditions there. And as such, I can speak for

the rural people. Since the P.A.P. Government took

office,  the  rural  areas  have  undergone   some

improvement. If we look back, we can see that many

of  the  land problems have been dealt with.  With

regard to these problems, we will have in future a

programme,  by way of legislation, to rectify  and

solve  these  problems  in order  to  protect  the

people.  We  will put forward this legislation  in

the  near future in this Assembly. These are  some

of  the  measures we intend to adopt in  order  to

protect the rural people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to land disputes, there has been

some  improvement. For instance,  there  has  been

improvement made to roads and other things. If the

Opposition  Members wish to talk about  the  rural

and  land  problems, they can go with  me  to  the

rural  area  in  order  to better  understand  the

actual  conditions  there.  They  should  do  this

before  they  talk about the problems relating  to

the  rural  areas.  They  must  not  sit  in

air-conditioned  rooms and talk about  the  rural  and

land   problems.  Their  attitude  towards   these

problems   is  n  t  realistic.  We   must   first

understand  the  issue before we  talk  about  it.

Looking  at things superficially is not practical.

Without  understanding the  real  facts  and  only

talking  of the issues superficially in  order  to

gain the praise of s me people will not solve  the

problem. This may be just an opportunistic  tactic

in  order to gain the support of the people.  This,

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



course, will cause the persons concerned to be  in

the same position now that they have gone over -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have tried to indicate

that    perhaps   we   should   keep   away   from

personalities, and if the hon. Member  will  speak

on  the policy of the Government in so far as land

reform is concerned, he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  will deal with this problem in the  right

way. It takes a long time and careful deliberation

to  solve  the land problem in the rural area.  We

must also understand what use this land can be put

to.  After  this has been done, we can  start  our

work.  Only in this way can we solve our  problem.

We  cannot  just talk about it, because that  will

not help us to solve the real problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

raised  these  three  points in  all  seriousness,

hoping  that the Government will give them serious

consideration. But what has happened  is  that  we

have  heard "H.M.V." - His Master's Voice.  For  the

benefit of the Member for Jurong, who was attached

to  the Ministry of National Development for about

three  months,  when  he  thought  he  could   get

promotion by-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must not allow these

personalities.   I  did  stop   the   Member   for

Jurong-perhaps not early enough, but  I  did  stop

him-and  the Member for Hong Lim will  assist  the

Chair in that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

short  period  from about June to  about  October,

when   I  had  more  effective  control  of  those

departments  which could give help  to  the  rural

areas.  I  could not do much because many  of  the

things  that I wished to do had to go through  the

slow  process of finance and staffing. But  within

those  limitations, I tried to do  something.  For

instance, just to mention Jurong alone,  we  tried

to complete the building of a railroad and others,

and we built 200 standpipes within the short space

of four months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Are we talking about -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Are we talking about Land and District Offices for

which  I  am responsible, or are we talking  about

the   ex-Minister   for   National   Development's

proclivities  to create standpipes  on  paper  for

which I am not responsible?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is my difficulty, of course,

to  find  out where the responsibility starts  and

where  it  ends. If the Prime Minister  says  that

standpipes   are  not  his  responsibility,   then

possibly  the Member for Hong Lim should bide  his

time  end  deal  with  standpipes  at  the  proper

moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

translation just now was not fast enough.  It  had

nothing  to  do  with the translator  but  it  was

because  of simultaneous translation.  I  am  only

replying  to  some  of the points  raised  by  the

Member  for Jurong. I am not digressing on to  new

grounds. What I wish to say is this. Work  started

in  July 1959 in the Southern Islands. A plan  was

drafted  and it was completed. Since then no  more

was  done.  A  plan to revise the laws  concerning

land  reform  was  drafted but it  was  torpedoed.

Measures were taken to build roads and other steps

were taken to bring about land reform, but most of

them  were torpedoed. But earlier I have tried  to

bring  up  these points again without touching  on

what  had  happened,  hoping that  the  Government

would  give  these three matters due consideration

without touching on personalities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



the revision of the Master Plan. I do not know how

the logic runs, but anyway, there it is for what

it is worth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As a new approach to this,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in all seriousness, we must now

look  at the problem that has been posed, that  an

earlier  revision of the Master Plan is absolutely

basic  and fundamental. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  have

just  explained to the Member for Farrer Park  why

an earlier revision was impossible because all the

expatriate master planners were chased out of  the

Planning  Department and we have had to  wait  for

the  one local chap to come back. He has just come

back.  No doubt the valiant efforts of the  former

Minister  for  National Development  assisted  the

farmers in that he held up



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have 224 square miles of land. There is a

dispute  as  to  whether it  is 219  or  224.  Some

authorities  have it as 224 and  some  as  219.  I

found  out  from the Land Office not so long  ago,

when  I had to clarify just how much we had,  that

it  depends  upon whether you include those  parts

which  are covered by tidal waters. If you exclude

those parts that are covered by tidal waters, then

you  drop to 219. But if you say you can dam  them

and  make them into fish and prawn ponds, then  it

becomes   224.   Then   we   have   the   military

establishments and so on taking one third  of  the

arable land. We are dead against having a military

base. We do not want it here any more than anybody

else. But we also know that there are no less than

30,000  civilian  employees of  the  military.  So

there  are  two propaganda angles on this.  First,

out  with  the  military base and  up  with  local

nationalism,  which is necessary  and  inevitable.

More  land  for the farmers and out with  military

installations  occupying  land.  We  are  also  in

favour  of  that. But, of course, the  Member  for

Hong  Lim  has  forgotten that  there  are  30,000

families  of  civilian employees.  So  the  P.A.P.

policy   is   as   we   have  enunciated   it   in

Sembawang-that  we  shall  do  it  in   a   phased

programme.  Nobody loses his job quicker  than  is

necessary,  quicker than before he  finds  another

job. These things have to be carefully thought out

In  the old days, we provided the Member for  Hong

Lim  with  the careful thinking, the  Master  Plan

before he went and poured it out. But if you start

shooting Les without having decided where one line

is going to conflict with the other, you will soon

come  a cropper. Let us face these facts. Even  if

we  drive all the military bases into the sea,  as

one  day  it  will be done, and we  save  all  the

civilian  employees  by  creating  industries  and

civilian  dockyards, we will still face a  housing

and  land  shortage. One of the  problems  of  the

master planners is this, Sir. Already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



we  are  having to resist the demands of  industry

and  industrial  expansion from  eating  into  the

limited arable land we have got.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pose a concrete problem. Toa Payoh - it is

in  the  town  area - is also fertile farming  area.

According to the master planners, the ideal Master

Plan  means that Toa Payoh should be part  of  the

City belt for high density, not for rural farming.

For the time being, we manage to hold the position

and  say, " Well, for the foreseeable future  that

we  can plan, it shall be farming." It is just  to

hold   the   fort,  because  it  is  serving   the

community, it is a fertile belt, and the  pressure

from  the  industrial  development  is  not  acute

enough.  But I think we have to face up  to  this,

Sir. Whatever we do, we face a land shortage,  and

the  problem is how to make the best  use  of  the

limited   land.  I  shall  be  treating  it   very

seriously,  and  I  should be greatly  obliged  if

people  like  the Member for Hong Lim would,  with

his  careful thinking, make a contribution  as  to

how  we could make better use of the land we  have

got, apart from recovering land from the sea,  and

from  the Army, Navy and Air Force, which we  must

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the Southern Islands. I am grateful

to the Member for having raised this, because as a

result  of  the Parliamentary Secretary  answering

the   Member  for  the  Southern  Islands  on  his

amendment   about   provision   for   water    and

electricity for the Southern Islands, I missed the

opportunity to explain that the Rural  Board  (for

which  I  am responsible) used to carry a separate

budget.  Rural development, Malay settlements  and

so  on have a clear-cut vote, which you will  see.

Now,  because of integration, all these votes have

been lost in the various Ministries. I do not wish

to  anticipate the many items on which I have seen

amendments put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the vote which was formerly

shown for rural development, Malay settlements and

so  on  has  now been scattered, particularly  the

development votes in nearly 15 heads, according to

the  respective  uses that would be  made  of  the

vote.  It  is  my  hope  that  the  Treasury,   in

presenting  the  Budget next  year,  will  have  a

summary which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



will  show, for easy reference, just how much goes

to  rural  development, how much to roads  in  the

rural   areas,  Malay  settlements,  the  Southern

Islands  and  so on. This is no criticism  of  the

hard  work  that has been put in to integrate  the

Budget,  but  because it is the  first  time,  the

point   was   overlooked  that   in   presentation

sometimes,  for easy reference of Members,  it  is

useful  to  have a summary to show just  what,  in

fact,  goes to town development and what, in fact,

goes  to country development. I will deal with  it

in detail as the various amendments crop up. But I

would like to make the point that there is a total

of  $7.8  million intended for rural  development,

which includes the Southern Islands, and this also

includes a sum of $200,000 intended specially  for

Malay  development,  which includes  the  Southern

Islands. I would say that this is a generous

vote - $200,000  specially for the Southern  Islands  and

three Malay settlements so far. We are spending an

extra  sum of money per head on the Malay  section

to  honour  the  spirit of  the  Preamble  to  the

Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reply

given  by the Prime Minister does not tell us  how

he is going to tackle these three problems, except

to  say that he has started revision of the Master

Plan, which I am very happy to learn-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> One plan -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - but, Mr Speaker. Sir, I must

clarify what the Prime Minister has said just  now

about  the  expatriates, in the S.I.T. There  were

already lots of expatriates in the S.I.T. in  the

Planning Department, but there was no revision  of

the  Master Plan. Numbers do not count. It is  the

will  and  the  policies.  After  all,  the  Prime

Minister is not well acquainted with what goes  on

in  the  Planning  Section of  his  Ministry.  For

instance,  just  now he could not even  understand

where  the  $20,000 in preparation of  the  Master

Plan Documents in his own office comes from. May I

tell him where it comes from in the Budget? If  he

turns to page 131 under Head 20-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we have finished

with that item. Let us deal with Head 8 now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope a

better  brief  will  be  prepared  for  the  Prime

Minister.  It is my opinion that the  Land  Office

should  perhaps  be transferred back  to  the  new

Minister  for  National Development, because  with

his multifarious activities the Prime Minister has

no time for plans, lands and other problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am always obliged for

gratuitous advice. In my position, Sir, I am often

the  recipient of sometimes valuable and sometimes

not  so valuable advice. But may I say that it  is

because I have been judicious in the reception  of

advice  that I am still with my comrades, with  my

Party, and with my colleagues? If I were to accept

the  gratuitous  advice that is often  flung  with

evil  motives, I would wind up the way the  Member

has wound up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $677,330 for Head 8 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 9 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of sub-head I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Planner - in the Estimates we are

discussing, Mr Speaker, Sir, the vote in  respect

of the Chief Planner is $10. I take it that is the

way  of  indicating to the House that  it  is  not

proposed  to fill that post for the ensuing  year.

If  my assumption is correct in that respect, then

I  wish to ask the Prime Minister, particularly as

he  has  indicated that a revision of  the  Master

Plan  in  some  of its aspects is  going  to  take

place,  whether it would not be wise to  have  the

post filled in order that the revision of the

Master Plan may go on as best it possibly can?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is another reason why

a  token vote has been asked for. It is true  that

the present incumbent is the Acting Chief Planner,

and no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



doubt  final  confirmation will  follow.  But  the

reason  why  there  is a token vote  is  that  the

salary for the Chief Planner has to be decided  in

relation   to   the   salaries  for   commensurate

positions  in other departments. Sir, the  curious

position is that a senior planner, which  is  what

the  present  Acting  Chief Planner  is,  has  a

maximum  of $1,620 for his salary scale.  That  is

$100  more  than a Grade G post. Superscale  G  is

$1,520,  which is the equivalent of the scale  for

the  Commissioner for Labour. So  we  are  already

tied down by the responsibility, on integration of

City Council and S.I.T. employees, not to pay them

less than what they are getting and there must  be

some adjustment somewhere - either the post has  to

be a Grade F post, in which case it would not even

be  a promotion for the senior planner, or it  has

to  be  a superscale D post. But these are matters

which require time to look into. I do not think an

early confirmation will make any difference to the

work that is progressing. There is a man acting in

that  capacity,  and  in due  course  he  will  be

confirmed.

the  Prime  Minister, might I be  given  leave  to

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (5) of sub-head 1 reads "Cadet

Planners,  three  ... New posts".  I  welcome  the

creation  of  these three new posts. I  understand

how important it is that we should have cadets  in

training  for the Planning Department.  Could  the

Prime Minister inform the House how it is proposed

to  appoint these three Cadet Planners, and  where

their  training is to take place, whether it would

take   place  locally  or  abroad  in  the   first

instance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, can I also, in the

explanation,   take   item   (21) -   "Expatriation

Pay" - against which there is set down an amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, if they are connected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, they are tied up, Sir.

There  are  seven  planners on the  Establishment.

Four  of the posts are being held by local  office

who  have  just  returned from training.  All  the

expatriate  planners have left.  Three  posts  are

vacant and cannot be filled although we have tried

to  fill  them with local recruits. Therefore,  in

order  to  expedite the work, it  is  intended  to

recruit  three  expatriate planners on  three-year

contracts.  At  the same time, we  are  recruiting

three cadet planners. The posts will be advertised

when the vote has been passed in the Assembly, and

I  hope  University graduates will apply  for  the

jobs.  They will initially receive their  training

here by learning the job and will subsequently  be

sent   overseas  for  the  appropriate   technical

qualifications,  such  as the  Institute  of  Town

Planning Membership, Associate Membership Diploma.

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already had the benefit of the Prime

Minister's explanation. I was under the impression

that,  when  officers are recruited on  contracts,

they get an inclusive pay and that the question of

expatriation  pay does not arise.  Perhaps  I  was

mistaken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That was so in the case of

the  S.I.T.,  but  now that the  Planning  Section

becomes  part of the Government, the  practice  of

the  Government's Establishment should be followed

where   contracts   are   given   on   basic   and

expatriation  pay  and  variable  allowances   are

separate items in the contract.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I be given leave to withdraw the

amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 6.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 6 reads "Hospital and Medical

Charges... $5,500". Under an integrated Budget,  I

would have thought that this should not appear  as

a  chargeable item on the Budget, particularly  as

the   hospital  and  medical  charges   of   other

Government officers are borne by the Government. I

have  searched the Budget and I think this is  one

of  two instances where such charges are made. But

this  particular item seems to run counter to  the

general terms of the Budget. Normally, if you take

any  Ministry - the Ministry of National Development

or  the  Ministry of Health - they do not  carry  a

vote for hospital and medical charges. But in this

particular  case there is a vote for hospital  and

medical  charges,  and this gives  the  impression

that the monies will be physically paid out by the

Planning   Department  either  to  the  Government

hospitals or to private practitioners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is quite so. The monies

will  have to be paid out. As I explained  when  I

move  the  Second and Third Readings of the  Local

Government (Financial Integration) Bill, there  is

no complete integration yet because this has to be

worked out: how do the staff integrate? These  are

S.I.T. members, and by section 5 of the  Planning

Ordinance,   every   officer  on   the   permanent

establishment  of the S.I.T. when  transferred  to

the  Government shall be deemed to be  transferred

to  the service of the Government at the same rate

of  pay  and  as  near  as may  be  on  the

same conditions  of service as those on  which  he  was

employed by the S I.T. And the S.I.T. paid this to

the  City Council to provide them with medical and

hospital  care. The S.I.T. was tied  up  with  the

City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same facilities will have to be used

until  they are completely integrated,  when  they

will  use the Government hospitals. Therefore  the

necessity  for this vote, Where the  City  Council

staff  are  involved as against the  S.I.T.,  that

will  not be shown because they never had  to  pay

anything. They were already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



on  the  City Council Establishment.  Can  I  also

touch upon sub-heads 7 and 10?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps, if the hon. Member wishes

to move. I do not know. Are they connected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then let the Member move them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of what the Prime

Minister  has said, may I have leave  to  withdraw

amendment (6)?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps I have not made myself

understood. I do not know whether the  Member  for

Farrer  Park would like to touch on - I  should  not

have said move - sub-heads 7 and 10. He could say  a

few  words  on  those sub-heads before  the  Prime

Minister touches on them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I will, Sir. The point that is

exercising  my  mind is sub-head  7,  which  reads

"Management  Fee - Municipal Provident  Fund",  and

sub-head   10,   which   reads   "Public   Utility

Services - Subordinate    Staff    Quarters".    The

Municipal Provident Fund was managed by  the  City

Council  to  which  membership the  staff  of  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust were admitted.  I  am

not quite sure whether the Trust paid a management

fee  to  the City Council. But the point is  this.

This  is  about the only item in the Budget  which

provides  for a management fee in respect  of  the

Municipal Provident Fund, whereas there are  other

members  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  who

might  have moved on to other departments. So  the

question  is,  why  is  it  necessary  to  have  a

management   fee  in  respect  of  the   Municipal

Provident Fund for the Planning Department and not

in  respect of other departments where either City

Council employees or Municipal employees or  Trust

employees might have found their way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one, sub-head 10, "Public Utility

Services-Subordinate Staff Quarters",  I  take  it

here again that this is necessary to maintain  the

status quo.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point is that Municipal

employees who are members of the Fund do  not  pay

this management fee. The management fee is charged

to  non-Municipal employees, like the S.I.T.,  who

joined  the  Provident Fund. They are  to  pay  an

equal  portion  of the cost of management  of  the

Fund  and the only staff of a department that  has

moved  from the S.I.T. into a Government  Ministry

is the Planning section.



In  the  same  way, Sir, we have to  maintain  the

status quo for subordinate staff. There are  about

seven  of  these  quarters  and  they  have   been

accustomed  to  free light, water and  conservancy

charges, and by the terms of the transfer, we have

to  pay  the  S.I.T. now for the costs  of  light,

water and conservancy.

Registration  Board Branch appears in  the  Budget

Estimates, it is therefore part of the Government.

This  is probably the first instance in the Budget

where  such  an  item appears -Rent on  Government

Quarters. Now, I know that Government officers  do

occupy Government quarters, but in those cases the

Departments  concerned do  not  pay  rent  to  the

Treasury;  in fact, it is the officers who  occupy

the quarters who pay rent to the Treasury. But  as

the vote stands here, it would appear that the Air

Registration Board Branch is called  upon  to  pay

$11,100 to the Treasury.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, perhaps if I

were   to   explain  the  functions  of  the   Air

Registration   Board   the   position   would   be

clarified. The Air Registration Board is a private

company  which  is,  at  the  moment,  under   the

direction  of the Director of Civil Aviation.  The

function  of this Board is to survey the technical

requirements to ensure that aircraft  comply  with

statutory technical requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Air Registration Board was set up in 1951

and since then it has been under the Department of

Civil Aviation. There are two persons employed  as

Air Surveyors. Both of them are living in quarters

to  which  the Government contributes  $11,100  as

rent.  Part  of this money is apportioned  to  the

Federation  of Malaya and the Borneo  territories,

Singapore's share being one-third of this sum. So,

strictly speaking, these two officers in  the  Air

Registration Board are not civil servants  on  the

establishment, and therefore the charges  incurred

by them will have to be paid by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if I understood the Hon. the

Deputy  Prime  Minister,  he  says  that  the  Air

Registration  Board  Branch is  not  part  of  the

Government but some private organisation,  and  as

it   is   doing  work  for  the  Government,   the

Government   has  agreed  to  contribute   towards

payment of its rent. Therefore all the other items

are in connection with obligations incurred by the

Government in connection with an agreement reached

with  the Air Registration Board Branch. I  wonder

if my appreciation of the situation is correct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, the Member for Farrer

Park  is  quite correct. The officers in this  Air

Registration  Board are not civil servants,  as  I

have said. We have to fulfil certain international

statutory  regulations concerning air  navigation.

There is an Act called the Colonial Air Navigation

Order,  1955, which was passed on 1st July,  1955.

Under  this Act the D.C.A. has to ensure the

air-worthiness of aeroplanes. There were no  qualified

local  personnel  who could be classified  as  Air

Surveyors  and therefore, under arrangements  with

the  United Kingdom Government, two officers  from

this private company, the Air Registration. Board,

which  is also known as the Air Registration Board

in  the U.K., were despatched to Singapore to  act

on behalf of the Singapore Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, a further question that arises

from the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister's reply is

this: is it a statutory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



obligation   that  we  should  engage   this   Air

Registration  Board  Branch?  That  is  the  first

question, Sir. The second question is:  if  it  is

not a statutory obligation to engage somebody from

this Air Registration Board, then, of course, this

must  be a voluntary association of the Government

with  these people. In those circumstances,  could

not  this  work  be  done by  the  Civil  Aviation

Department?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> We are not under a statutory

obligation to engage these two officers  from  the

Air  Registration  Board.  But  we  are  under   a

statutory obligation to observe that all  aircraft

which leave Paya Lebar Airport are certificated as

air-worthy.  This  statutory intituled  the  Civil

Aviation  Colonial Air Navigation Order, 1955.  On

the  second point, as I have mentioned previously,

we  had  no local personnel who were qualified  to

examine   into  the  air-worthiness  of  aircraft.

However,  it  is our intention that in  future  we

shall  malayanise  the Air Registration  Board  so

that  the functions of this body can be taken over

completely by the Department of Civil Aviation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the explanation of the

Hon. the  Deputy Prime Minister, may I  be  given

leave to withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 13 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) sub-head 43.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will refer to the next page of the

Estimates,  sub-head 61, they will see  that

sub-head  43 could be a duplication sub-head 61.  Both

items   are   "Maintenance"  and  both   are   for

maintenance of the airfield. In the case  of

sub-head 43, the vote is $40,000, and for sub-head 61,

it  is  $70,000.  I  would like  the  Minister  to

explain whether these two items are the same  and,

if  they  are not the same, in what way  are  they

different? And if they are different, why are they

described  in  the  same manner,  "Maintenance  of

Airfield"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, under sub-head

43,  item  (1) "Maintenance of Airfield, $40,000",

the  explanation that has been given to me is that

that  sum  of money is expended on labour required

for daily sweeping and collection of refuse at the

airfield,  grass  cutting, earth spreading,  etc.,

overtime  pay  for emergency work due  to  floods,

emergency  work  in  connection  with  visits   of

V.I.P.s.,  etc.  The  labour  employed  for   this

purpose is calculated on a daily-rated basis,  and

altogether  27  persons  are  employed   on   this

project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to sub-head 61, 1 am afraid I do

not   have  enough  notice  from  the  Member  for

Cairnhill that he is going to bring this item  up,

and   so  I  just  cannot  supply  him  with   the

information.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In view of the difficulty that

the  Deputy Prime Minister is having in  supplying

the  information, may I beg leave to withdraw  the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Which motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think, in fairness to the

Minister,  he is quite correct. If the Member  for

Cairnhill  wishes for information on sub-head  61,

he  should have given notice. In respect  of

sub-head  61, I think the Minister is entitled to  say

that he will supply the information later.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With due respect, Sir, I do

not  think the Minister said that he would  supply

the  information. He said that  he  had  not  been

asked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Minister could

supply  the information. That is all there  is  to

it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Oh, it is quite easy!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Let us make it easier, Sir - I

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think leave has been asked to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,932,360 for Head 13 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 19 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 19 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 6, "Hire of Breakdown Trucks - $1,900".

As  I understand it, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  an

item  in  respect  of vehicles registration  which

previously  came  under  the  City  Council.   The

question  is,  how did the Vehicles Department  of

the   City   Council  get  itself  involved   with

accidents which necessitated the hire of breakdown

trucks?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, having been a

City Councillor before, the Member for Farrer Park

is  quite  well  versed in  the  business  of  the

Registry  of  Vehicles. However, he has  forgotten

that  one  of  the  functions of the  Registry  of

Vehicles  is that, if there are motor or non-motor

vehicles  which do not pay their licence  fees  or

other  taxes, then they will have to be impounded.

To  impound these vehicles, it is necessary to tow

them  into  the yard of the Registry of  Vehicles.

Therefore,  it is necessary for the  Registrar  of

Vehicles to hire, not really breakdown trucks, but

trucks  to tow those vehicles which have not  paid

their  fees  or  their taxes. The  City  Transport

Centre at present owns the vehicles which are used

by  the department for towing those vehicles which

have  not  paid their licences. In previous  years

the  provision  was  included under  the  Hire  of

Office  Station-wagons and Hire of Trucks  in  the

City  Council Estimates. This year these  vehicles

have  been passed over to the P.W.D., and  to  use

these vehicles, a charge is made by the P.W.D.  We

have  estimated that it will cost us about  $1,900

to hire these trucks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if the real point and purpose of

this  is to deal with owners of offending vehicles

who  have  not  paid  their taxes.  I  would  have

thought that the easiest way to do the job  is  to

get  inside  the  car and drive it  to  the  yard,

rather  than hire some truck to pull it along  the

street.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But you cannot drive it when

the car has not got an engine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Deputy Prime Minister

will have an opportunity to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Maybe there is a point in it if the

hire  of breakdown trucks is intended to deal with

the  results  of motor accidents.  But  if  it  is

merely  to deal with vehicles the taxes  on  which

have  not been paid up, then the implication,  Mr

Speaker, is that the vehicles are in good  running

order. The fact is that because of an oversight or

something  else the taxes on these  vehicles  have

not  been paid. Therefore, it is necessary for the

Government  to  impound  them,  which   they   are

entitled  to do. Now, in impounding the  offending

vehicle, I see no reason why the Government should

not  employ a driver in the P.W.D. to  go  to  the

house and drive it to the yard.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The explanation is quite

simple. There are vehicles which sometimes do  not

have  a  tire or an engine. It is hardly  possible

for anyone to drive such a vehicle to the yard  of

the  Registrar of Vehicles. I am sure  the  Member

for   Farrer  Park  will  realise  the  difficulty

involved.  Not even the best driver in the  world,

even  Sterling Moss or the Member for Farrer Park,

can achieve that purpose!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if the hon. the Deputy Prime

Minister  will  look  into  the  Local  Government

Ordinance,  he will find that motor vehicle  taxes

can only be levied on motor vehicles which can  be

used  as  such.  If this particular motor  vehicle

which  the Deputy Prime Minister has on  his  mind

has  no engine in it, then I would suggest to  him

that it is not a taxable vehicle, and, as such, he

would be committing trespass. And as a responsible

Member  of  the Opposition, I must try to  prevent

him  from doing it, because he will get the  State

of  Singapore into paying very severe damages! But

if that is the only explanation, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I think there is really no need for this vote. But

if it were to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



cover some other item, whether it is necessary  to

hire  a vehicle to tow something, then, of course,

I have nothing against it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have

just  heard what the Member for Farrer  Park  said

with  reference to this subject.  He  was  a  City

Councillor  and perhaps he had some experience  in

the Vehicles Department. The Deputy Prime Minister

had  just  now said that if a car is  damaged,  we

should  use a truck to tow it back. Some cars  are

damaged and their owners refuse to pay the  taxes;

they allow the damaged cars to remain on the road.

According  to the regulations, the Government  has

the right to confiscate the car. If the Government

does  not  confiscate it, it loses money.  If  the

Member  for  Farrer Park is careless  when  he  is

walking and he is knocked down by a motor car  and

loses a leg, he is just like a damaged car. And if

the owner of the card refuses to pay tax, then the

Government should use a truck to tow the car back.

Similarly, when the Member for Farrer Park  breaks

his  leg  and he cannot walk, the Government  will

have to hire some truck to tow him back!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Moulmein has

indicated that if the Member for Farrer Park could

not walk, he would be towed back!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I want to give my assurance to the

Member for Moulmein that I have paid up all the

taxes!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Including income tax?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Including income tax, and any other

tax  which  the Government can extract from  me  I

have  paid  up!  Sir, for the sake  of  peace  and

sanity, may I be given leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

move,



That the sum to be allocated for Head 19 be

reduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 18

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment stood in the name of' Mr A. P. Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this amendment refers to the parking meter scheme, where Government has made a

provision of nearly $1 million. From what  I  have

seen of the staff under this Government scheme,  I

feel  that  it is necessary that their  conditions

should be improved so as to protect the status  of

the  State of Singapore as a cosmopolitan city.  I

believe   the  Government  has  plans  to  attract

tourists to Singapore. One of the means to attract

tourists  is to show that we have the  ability  to

govern  or  to administer our State. For  instance

Mr Speaker, Sir, the uniform of the attendants in

the  parking space is not proper. It is  difficult

for  us to identify the attendants who look  after

the  cars. I therefore think that it is not in the

interests  of Singapore. It goes to show  that  we

are  not able to maintain our status. I hope  this

state   of  affairs  will  be  rectified  by   the

Government.  Besides  that, there  are  complaints

regarding  the  service rendered by these  parking

car   attendants.  If  there   is   a   means   of

identification, it would be a simple thing for the

public  to  lodge  such  complaints  against   the

attendants concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to
