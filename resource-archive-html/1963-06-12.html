<div align="center"><b>MAIN ESTIMATES OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE FOR 1963</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply

[1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will a Minister signify the

recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara before  the

Committee  proceeds with the consideration of  the  Main

Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes, I do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the Main Estimates - Paper Cmd.

14  of 1963. For convenience, I intend taking the totals

for  each head as they appear in the last column of  the

abstract of estimated expenditure on pages 35 and 36  of

the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing now with the Heads of Expenditure in

respect of which amendments stand on the Order Paper.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 8 is a vote for two cars and, according

to  the  notes  here,  these  two  cars  are  meant  for

replacement.  I  have  gone  through  the  Estimates  of

previous  years  and  I find that for  1962  a  vote  of

$12,350 was asked for a motorcar for replacement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how many cars there are in Istana

Negara and how old they are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

inherited from the former Governor one Rolls Royce which

is  still in commission, one Humber Pullman which is now

scrapped and replaced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



by a Rover, one Austin and one Rover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacements are in respect of the Austin A60 and

the  Rover. The Austin is eight years old with a mileage

of  130,000 miles and the Rover is 12 years old  with  a

mileage of 76,000 miles.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill require a

vote?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, Sir. In view of the explanation

given by the Prime Minister, may I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for Furniture and Furnishings of

$20,800.  Will  the  Prime Minister be  good  enough  to

inform  this House in what way this vote will be  spent?

What is the type of additional furniture and the type of

furnishings that will be required?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there are five

guest   rooms  at  the  Istana  and,  in  view  of   the

celebrations in August when we are anticipating a number

of guests arriving for the occasion, it is deemed proper

that  these  furnishings which have not been refurnished

since 1945 should now be refurnished for the occasion.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In view of the explanation given,

may I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $392,230 for Head ordered Ito stand part of

the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I must say how gratifying it is to

note  that  the  practice  of  having  expatriate  Chief

Justices  has  finally given way to a  new  era  in  the

judicial history of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that no one would feel disgruntled at this

basic  change  from  our great misfortune  to  have  had

colonial  Chief  Justices  whose  contributions  to  the

defence  of  the Empire are notorious in the  annals  of

British colonial administration.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must warn the hon. Member that

we  have  a  provision  in the Order  in  Council  which

provides that the conduct of a Judge or Judges cannot he

referred  to  except by a substantive motion  on  notice

given  by at least one-quarter of the number of  Members

in  the Assembly. Therefore, there cannot be any comment

on the conduct of Judges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am aware of the provision in the Order in

Council,  Mr  Chairman, Sir, and I do  not  propose  to

touch on the conduct of the Chief Justice as such. I was

merely  making  some general comment on  the  fact  that

today  the  high state of respectability  of  the  Chief

Justice of Singapore is held by a local man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the extent that the present Chief Justice is a

Malayan - more  so  a  Singaporean - we  are  happy.  It  is

appropriate  though that we reflect this appointment  in

the  perspective of an independent Judiciary on which  I

propose to elaborate under my next amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to say that the appointment of Justice

Wee  Chong Jin as the Chief Justice has not created  the

jubilation that it should have, if not for anything else

then  at  least for the fact that it is the first  local

appointment.  Sir, the discontent over this appointment,

I am sure, is known to many. It is unlikely that Members

of this House are not aware of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for me to talk of the competence or

otherwise  of Justice Wee, but what is paramount  is  to

stress  the  need  for a non-political approach  by  the

Government to the Judiciary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is an open secret today that the appointment

of  Justice  Wee is regarded as a political appointment.

Sir,   having  witnessed  the  conduct  of  the   P.A.P.

Government  in the last four years, it is not  difficult

to  understand  the  legitimate  apprehension  that  the

P.A.P. is capable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



of  making  the  law  courts P.A.P. law  courts.  It  is

regrettable that the P.A.P. persists in converting State

institutions into P.A.P. organs. Sir, the people  cannot

place  trust  on  justice  if  political  colouring   is

introduced  into the administration of  justice.  It  is

needless  for me to say that it will be a  sad  day  for

Singapore if British colonial Chief Justices are  to  be

replaced by P.A.P. Chief Justices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I do not wish to demean the

position of the Chief Justice by entering into a  debate

on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Thomson is so inclined as to pursue

this  point  and  I  think having  made  this  point  in

passing,  I suggest that he pursue it. Then I  am  quite

prepared to have the matter investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, before the appointment is made

by  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the Prime Minister  who

has  to  give  the  advice is obliged  to  con-suit  the

retiring  Chief  Justice,  which  I  did.  I  think  the

retiring  Chief Justice deemed it fit and proper  before

he  left the country to indicate what he thought of  the

advice  he gave me. I also took advice from all  members

of  the  Bar Committee. Amongst the members I  consulted

was  the  Member  for Farrer Park. I  do  not  wish  any

justification for the choice made, which I can  in  good

conscience  say was the best that any Prime Minister  in

my  position could have done. The fact that  the  Member

for  Thomson  should have chosen in a  sly  way  to  try

somehow  to  bring discredit to an institution  of  some

importance in a democratic State without really  wishing

to pursue the point is, I think, a sad reflection on the

standards  of the Opposition. Men who have not  got  the

courage  to  pursue  their allegations  publicly  should

desist from making sly and oblique references.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I merely wish to say this. As I did explain,

I was not making any reference to the conduct of Justice

Wee  as  such. I was merely airing a grievance over  the

appointment ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Whose grievance?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- which I think is widely known and which

I am quite sure the Prime Minister is aware of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I am astounded to hear the

grievance. The Member for Thomson may not know that,  in

fact,  the Bar Committee was unanimous that this  was  a

fit  and  proper choice. To begin with, Mr Justice  Wee

was  already  on  the  Bench when this  Government  took

office.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a choice of elevating one of the members of

the  Bench  or  seeking someone from the  Bar.  The  two

choices  were both exhaustively surveyed and resurveyed.

All I can say is I am grateful to the members of the Bar

Committee and several leading members of the Bar of  the

advice they gave. I am sure that in doe course everybody

will realise the wisdom of the appointment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Thomson require a

vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 2 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the manner of appointment of Judges and

magistrates today in Singapore dues not inspire ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point of order. I think

before the Member for Thomson pursues further and  casts

a  general  slur on the Judiciary, I must bring  to  his

attention first the fact that he is casting an aspersion

on a small group of men. The law has it that if you cast

an  aspersion  on a group of men so small  - all  are

identifiable - then you do so at your own peril. And I say

that  if a Member commits a breach of privilege in  this

Chamber,  using  the privilege of this Chamber  to  cast

aspersions on the conduct of Judges, then he must be prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



to face the consequences. It might interest him to

know  that  under  the Constitution to  the  Judges  are

appointed  by  a  commission  consisting  of  the  Chief

Justice  and  his  brother Judges, including  the  State

Advocate-General.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think, at the moment, the Member for

Thomson  is in order as he is just attacking the  method

of  appointment. The method of appointment  has  already

been indicated by the Prime Minister and is provided for

in the Order in Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is quite so, Mr Chairman, and under

this  amendment, I merely wish to discuss the manner  of

appointment of Judges to the lower courts. Sir, I  would

say that the ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> It is a point of order. He is

going  to attack the manner of appointment to the  lower

courts  and I suggest he move under a different subhead.

This deals with Puisne Judges.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is under Judicial.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I thought he was moving under

subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Wake up! Do not sleep.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The amendment is in regard to the

whole of Head 2



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I can understand the anxiety of the Prime

Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is no anxiety.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I can only tell him to contain himself and

reply at the time when he will definitely be allowed  to

reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was saying that the manner of appointment of

Judges   and   magistrates  does  not   inspire   public

confidence ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You mean your confidence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- in the administration of justice. Now,

this is especially so in present day Singapore with  the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



Government  whose  manipulation  of  State  organs   for

political  purposes  is unprecedented.  Sir,  under  the

Constitution, the powers to appoint, promote or transfer

district  judges and magistrates is vested in the  Legal

Service Commission under section 93 of the Constitution,

page 42. The Legal Service Commission consists of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Chief Justice;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Chairman of the Public Service Commission;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated

generally or specially by the Chief Justice;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the State Advocate-General; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) not more than two members of the Public Service Commission nominated generally or specially

by the Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, the Chief Justice is appointed by

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in accordance with the advice

of  the Prime Minister. For practical purposes, it means

that  he  must be a man of the Prime Minister's  choice;

secondly,  the Chairman of the Public Service Commission

is  also  in the same manner appointed by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in accordance with the  advice  of  the

Prime  Minister; thirdly, the State Advocate-General  is

also   appointed  in  the  same  manner.  The  remaining

members, as has been pointed out, are appointed  by  the

Chief  Justice  and the Chairman of the  Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legal Service Commission as constituted, as

has  been  explained, is a body which has the  authority

for  the  appointment,  promotion  or  transfer  of  all

district judges and magistrates. That is the first point

that  I  wish  to  make  in respect  of  the  manner  of

appointment of Judges and magistrates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is the current practice in the

appointment  and transfer of district court  judges  and

magistrates. Art officer who is a magistrate  today  can

be  transferred  tomorrow  to  become  a  Deputy  Public

Prosecutor and vice versa. There are many examples:  one

outstanding example is Mr Francis Seow Tiang  Siew.  He

was a D.P.P. at one Time: then he was transferred to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



a  district court judge for some months and now, Sir, he

is  transferred once again to he a D.P.P.  Incidentally,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, Mr Francis Seow is a gold medallist,

though not in the Olympics, but in the legal service for

having run the race well on behalf of the P.A.P. He  was

awarded the ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There the Member is treading on

very  dangerous ground. He is now reflecting  indirectly

on the conduct of a legal officer. He must not do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> All I wanted to point out was that he was

awarded    the    Public   Administration   Medal - Pingat

Pentadbiran ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Those medals are awarded for

conduct and therefore there is an indirect reflection on

the  officer's conduct. That must not be  done  in  this

Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, Sir, that was just

one  example. Then there are many other examples, and  I

do  not  propose  to  go  into  them  now.  But  if  the

Government wants, I am quite prepared to list out a  few

more examples later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the practical effect of all this is that a

district   judge,   before  whom  the  Solicitor-General

appears and whose conduct is subject to the authority of

the Judge, can one day be transferred and he expected to

work  under the Solicitor-General. Again. Sir, the other

way  round. A Deputy Public Prosecutor, who works  under

the  Solicitor-General and takes instructions  from  him

today,  may be transferred tomorrow to become a district

judge  before  whom the Solicitor-General will  have  to

appear.  I  am  quite sure the Government  Members  will

agree  that there are very illustrious examples of  this

to  be quoted. It is hardly necessary for me to say that

this practice puts the district judge or a magistrate in

an  invidious position in the administration of justice,

particularly  too,  when  the Solicitor-General  himself

appears in the courts. The least I can say is that  this

practice  is  scandalous. Perhaps you will  recall  that

there was a case of a district judge who was transferred

soon after a particular case in which six trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



unionists were involved. Sir, some Members of this House

have   suggested   on  a  previous  occasion   that   an

independent   Judiciary  is  one  of  the   pillars   of

democracy.  Sir,  there  is no  doubt  that  this  is  a

laudable acclamation, though it is regrettable  that  it

came  from  some  people who merely pay lip  service  to

democratic  practices. The basis of my argument  is  not

democracy  or  what have we. There is  no  democracy  in

Singapore,   and  Singapore  is  hardly   a   democracy.

Therefore, Sir, it would be futile to talk about pillars

of    democracy.   I   hope   that   Members   of   this

House - particularly  those  self-acclaimed  champions  of

democracy sitting across the Floor - will forgive me if  I

put  aside  democracies and pillars of  democracies  and

talk of hard reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the administration of justice, in our view, is

the   essence   of  a  civilised  human   society.   The

independence  of  the Judiciary is  a  fundamental  pre-requisite  for  the  administration of  justice,  as  it

should  be. Justice in one form or another has been  the

crux    of   struggle   in   human   society.   However,

unfortunately,  institutions for the  administration  of

justice  have  been more often than not  instruments  of

oppression in the hands of the ruling class.  Today,  in

Singapore, the P.A.P. takes honours for having  excelled

in   the   use  of  State  organs  for  repression   and

oppression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, but for the aspersions that

have  been cast not upon me, but upon the Chief Justice,

the  State Advocate-General, the Chairman of the  P.S.C.

and  a  whole  host of other appointments  made  by  me,

including  the  Speaker of this Chamber,  I  would  have

deemed  the  remarks  made by  the  Member  for  Thomson

beneath comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the nature of things that somebody has to

make  an  appointment and in the new Constitution  which

came  into  operation in 1959. I inherited in my  office

the  powers of a Governor, the Chief Secretary  and  the

Mayor.  If  these powers, Mr Speaker, Sir, are  wrongly

used,   then   the  institutions  of  the   State   will

disintegrate.  I  am proud to say that  at  least  as  a

result  of the appointments made, housing has succeeded,

the Polytechnic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



is  expanding, the Public Utilities Board is well on its

way  to being established, and a whole host of statutory

corporations, including the Singapore Harbour Board, are

functioning efficiently, discharging their duties to the

community.  But  to suggest, as the Member  for  Thomson

suggests, that one makes political appointments for  the

purposes  of having yes men is a proposition  so  absurd

and  so  stupid that if ever he got endowed  with  these

powers and uses them in the way he believes I have  used

them, then the State would collapse ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is collapsing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With one flat going up every 45

minutes, with more roads built than ever in four  years,

than  ever in the history of Singapore, with more street

lights going up than ever before, with more kampongs  in

receipt  of  electricity  than ever  before,  with  more

standpipes  in  all the rural areas  than  ever  in  the

history  of  Singapore - [Interruption]. These  things

cannot  be  done in a matter of months. These are  plans

formulated   in  1959  and  1960,  when  the  unpleasant

decisions had to be made to up the taxes, to put on  the

economy  measures, in order to produce results in  1961,

1962  and  now 1963. If only the Member for Thomson  had

more  moral  fibre,  he  would  have  stood  up  to  the

Communists at the unpopular moments that we went through

and  he  would have seen sunshine at the end of it  all.

Instead of that, they switched sides and now they  found

out  that it was the wrong side. I suggest to the Member

for Thomson seriously to consider whether he is wise  in

his  own interest to make these suggestions. Mr Francis

Scow  is  one of the outstanding officers in  the  State

Advocate-General's Department, and the  State  Advocate-General,  I  am  proud  to say, recommended  him  for  a

citation, together with other officers.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A D.P.P. prosecuting or a Solicitor-General

prosecuting  before  a  district  court  is  no  unusual

business.  I defended certain friends of the Member  for

Thomson  before  the District Judge with the  Solicitor-General then prosecuting, Mr Shanks. The District Judge

acquitted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



and  he  is  now sitting as a Puisne Judge. As  District

Judge,  Mr  Francis  Seow sentenced  Mr  Bani's  close

associate  and  stooge, Mr Foo, in the Business  Houses

Employees  Union,  to  nine months for  putting  lighted

cigarettes  on  the back of non-striking  workers  in  a

cowardly and dastardly manner. They appealed. The  Chief

Justice,   who  is  not  my  appointment   - it   was   an

appointment   by  a  former  Governor - Sir   Alan   Rose,

confirmed the sentence, and he served his nine months. I

hope  he  is the wiser for it; for if there is any  more

such foolishness of brutality and bullying next time, he

will   find  that  the  first  offence  is  taken   into

consideration when the second conviction is considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political appointments? District Judge? Mr Choor

Singh  was  there for years before the P.A.P. Mr  Jamit

Singh  got  a  full and proper trial.  I  will  not  say

whether he got his deserts. It is a matter for the Court

of  Appeal  to  decide. Everybody heard every  scrap  of

evidence, every lie that went on in the court for a full 2½  months.  Is  the Member for Thomson suggesting  that

this   Government  should  allow  prosecutions  to  fail

through lack of police investigations?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister is

going  a  bit wide of the subject. Can he come  back  to

"appointments"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Appointments. There is no new

appointment   that   I  know  of,   no   important   new

appointments  anywhere. The Judges  are  the  same.  One

Puisne  Judge becomes the Chief Justice. The  Solicitor-General has become a Puisne Judge. The Registrar of  the

Supreme  Court has gone and become the Acting Solicitor-General. The No. 2 District Judge has become the  No.  1

District  Judge. These were appointments  we  inherited.

And so it went on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Member for Thomson that he and his

friends  should  really examine their  own  heads.  They

always  do this, Mr Speaker, Sir: first, they say  they

are going to win the referendum. Right on the very eve ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the Prime Minister is not

opening a debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



on that. He can mention that only in passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To prove a point. Then when they

lost,  they  said it was a fraud, phoney and  cheap.  We

said petition. They did not petition. They have got  the

right to petition. Three M.P.s came. They welcomed them.

One  thousand people went to the Airport. The Member for

Queenstown insisted that he had invited the three M.P.s.

He said so. He was proud that he had invited them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Can the Prime Minister explain

how that arises from this debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is the point. They insisted

that they address the meeting. Then when the verdict  of

the  three M.P.s was against him, he whereupon denounced

all  three  and said they had been taken on a  conducted

tour  and  they  were gullible old gentlemen.  Similarly

with the Courts. We know that Members on the other side,

on  a  certain day not so very long ago, came with other

gentlemen  to look for me. I do not know how lucky  they

were  that I was not in. I do not know whether they were

aware  that certain definite security arrangements  were

made  when  the  Cabinet is in session, as  we  have  no

intention  to be wiped out like the Burmese Cabinet.  It

was  well that we were not in session, and therefore the

police were forbearing in extremis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that those remarks

are  proper  because the case is sub judice.  I  do  not

think any reference should be made to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir,I just

wish to point this out, that now having felt the rigours

of  the law run their course in the case of Mr Foo  and

the  case  of Mr Jamit Singh, they wish to prepare  the

ground  for a denunciation of the whole Judiciary.  Why?

Because  their  conduct  will  now  be  put  to  serious

scrutiny.  It  is not my fault, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that

they  choose  to do mad things; that they choose  to  do

things of their own volition. But I say this. Say  these

things here and breach privilege, and they face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



the  consequences. Say these things outside and  I  have

not  the slightest doubt that the gentlemen referred  to

will defend themselves. If the Member for Thomson is  at

all  serious about these allegations, I say  make  these

suggestions  outside, because I really do  not  want  to

tight  their battle. It makes it difficult for me. These

are  their own battles. Any aspersions he likes to  cast

on  them  outside, they have their remedies. I wish  the

Member for Thomson well.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not rise to

participate in the debate between the Prime Minister and

the Member for Thomson. But I cannot allow the claim  of

the Prime Minister pass unchallenged. He claims that the

P.A.P. has put up more stand-pipes. I say all  that  is

nothing  but  a  cruel  joke. More  stand-pipes  without

water?  More stand-pipes for what? He claims  that  more

houses  are  being  built. Yet there  are  4,000  vacant

houses  not yet occupied. Would it not be wiser  to  see

that   the   4,000  units  built  by  the  Housing   and

Development Board are occupied?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is exactly what I fear - a

debate  completely  away  from  what  we  are  in   fact

debating.  Perhaps  the hon. Member for  Cairnhill  will

raise  those  points again when we come  to  the  proper

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister, to escape the basic

issue, goes around ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Repeat these things outside.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- beating about the bush. Sir, he always

misses the point. We realise that the Prime Minister has

acted within the law, within the powers vested upon  him

by  virtue of the fact that he is the Prime Minister  of

the  State of Singapore. I am not suggesting that he has

done anything illegal or ultra vires the Constitution. I

was  saying that it is undesirable to have a  system  of

appointments  and  transfers  of  district  judges   and

magistrates  whereby a person who is a magistrate  today

can be transferred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



to  become a Deputy Public Prosecutor  tomorrow.

Sir,  we  realise  that  in these  transfers  the  Legal

Service Commission is acting according to the rules. But

is it desirable? That is our basic point', and we think,

if  the  public  and  those who are accused  are  to  be

expected  to have confidence in the courts  and  in  the

administration   of  justice,  then   such   undesirable

practices  must not be allowed to continue.  I  was  not

casting aspersions on officers in the legal service.  My

grouse is against this basic practice ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are back-pedalling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- which the Government apparently is not

doing  anything to rectify. Sir, if I may just say  this

before I sit down, because the Prime Minister with a lot

of vigour has suggested that so many thousands of stand-pipes and housing flats and so on have been built ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have stopped the Member for

Cairnhill  from  raising that point. I  do  not  want  a

debate  on  stand-pipes or roads or  any  housing.  That

debate  can  arise  when  we come  to  the  Ministry  of

National Development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> All that I wanted to say was - because this

was  said  1w the Prime Minister - in the context  whether

the  State  organs are disintegrating. Sir, I share  his

views that the State organs must not disintegrate.  That

is  precisely why we are trying to tell the  Government,

"Do not utilise State organs. Do not make it a farce  by

turning each and every single State organ into a  P.A.P.

organ." [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am trying to channel the debate

now. Criticism of the Prime Minister as to the state  of

State organs and as to appointments in these other State

organs,  I  think, can come when we deal with the  Prime

Minister's Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

congratulate the Prime Minister on his clever distortion

of fact. I have already said that the P.A.P. excels only

in  one  department,  and  that  is  the  department  of

distortions and sell-outs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is two already. You cannot

even count!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He has just said a little while

back  that I insisted that I invited the three M.P.s.  I

never  did say that. But I am telling the Prime Minister

once  more, in case he should forget, that it was  as  a

result of my challenge to the M.P.s that they came along

to Singapore to see for themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And spend so much time and effort.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I did not denounce them after they

had  so-called passed judgment on us. In  fact,  when  I

made my speech in the Happy World Stadium, I had already

given  them my speech telling them that I was  answering

every point raised by Mr Bottomley. So what is all this

about  our  denouncing  the  three  M.P.s?  We  did  not

denounce them. We never expected too much from them.  We

knew  what to expect from M.P.s in the Labour  Party  of

Britain  who  hold views not very different  from  those

held by Conservatives ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Queenstown

has  made his point up to now, and I am sure there  will

be  other  opportunities in the Committee of Supply  for

the  hon.  Member to expand on it. I will not allow  any

debate on that particular aspect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I just wish to reply to the Member

for  Thomson on the system of transfers. I can only tell

him  that the only mitigation I can find for him is that

probably  he  is ignorant of the system of law  that  is

applied in this country, and indeed that applies in  all

other  countries where members of the Bar and the  Bench

are small in number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that the Member for Anson is not

here, because I think on an occasion like this he serves

a  useful purpose, because I use him as a sounding board

for  concessions  and admissions. All over  the  British

Commonwealth,  this system prevails. Before  a  man  can

ever  become a Judge of the High court, he should  have,

in   his   career,  acquired  a  varied  experience   as

prosecutor, as counsel for the defendant and the plaintiff,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



adviser,  draftsman, magistrate,  Registrar,  and

Official  Assignee. In other parts of  the  world,  they

have   recruited  their  puisne  judges  from  the  Bar.

Different systems prevail. A man picks up his experience

in  the  wider  world and then retires on  his  year  of

largest  income, off income tax, on the Bench.  That  is

not possible here, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Farrer Park will remember that

I  went through the Bar list of 130 names with him. That

is  all there is to it in Singapore. And you have to run

a  judiciary,  you have got to run a legal service,  you

have  to  man all your other departments connected  with

the  law, Trade Marks, Official Assignee, with the  same

group  of men. You have got to be fair and give  them  a

varied  experience. This is purely a professional matter

which  is  settled  between the State Advocate-General,

the Chief Justice, one Puisne Judge and the Chairman  of

the  Public  Service Commission. It was  so  decided  in

London in 1957. We defended the Constitution - the Member

for  Thomson  may  remember - in  the  Tanjong  Pagar  by-election. We fought on the basis of this Constitution in

1959.  Now we are on the verge of changing it. I do  not

know  if  the Member for Thomson thinks it a change  for

the  better. But right at this moment, we are  seriously

considering  the  problem of future  appointments  after

Malaysia. Perhaps the Member for Thomson does not  know

that in the Federation the Chief Justice is appointed by

the Prime Minister and so are the Puisne Judges. That is

an  independent  country. And here in a semi-independent

country,  we  allow  the Judges  to  sit  together  and

appoint  another  man to join their august  ranks.  What

system  is  to endure after Malaysia? This is a  subject

for   careful  debate  between  the  Chief  Justice   in

Singapore and his brother Judges and the State Advocate-General, who is at the present moment in Kuala Lumpur in

a  conference of lawyers, a conference which I may  have

to join shortly within



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



the  next  day or so, if I may have the consent  of  one

Member on the other side of this House. If not, then  we

will  have  to  run  the risk of having  the  Government

defeated  and  voted out of office, and the  Member  for

Thomson  or perhaps the Member for Queenstown will  feel

the  noose slip from round his neck again. But there  it

is.  These are the problems. And I am glad that  in  his

second  speech  he has decided - as the  Leninist  phrase

goes -  "one step forward, two steps back wards"; it  is

not  two steps forward, one step backwards, but one step

forward and two steps backward. That is right. There is

nothing wrong with these appointments. What is wrong is,

it  is  a pity that they should be shunted about in  the

way  they are. If the Member for Thomson has any  really

bright ideas, let him give serious thought to them,  not

with the idea of getting Judges or Magistrates who will

let  off  criminals  by  being  intimidated  from  this

Chamber.  I  do not think  - not the men I know - that  they

will  likely be so inclined. They are not likely  to  be

rattled by the fierce noises here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what I have suggested to the Member for

Thomson  is, I think, the most honourable thing  he  can

do.  If  he  really  believes that these  are  political

appointees who do my bidding - are puppets - then  I  say,

"Say  it  outside." He has retracted now, and  he  says,

"No.  It is the system." I say that if he can suggest  a

better  system  of  having  these  four  men  sit   down

professionally  and  decide  how  to  give  everybody  a

chance,  because  this is a competitive  race  within  a

service to the top, and the top is the High Court Bench,

let him put up his proposals. The constitutional lawyers

are  at the present moment in Kuala Lumpur. Lawyers from

Brunei,  North  Borneo, Sarawak, London,  Singapore  and

Kuala Lumpur arc all there drafting. On this matter, may

I  take  this  opportunity to say that when  the  House

rises en Saturday, the Leader of the House will formally

move that we adjourn to the beginning of August  - I think

it  is  the 7th of August. But I am hoping, Mr Speaker,

Sir, and I would like to give due notice now that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



these  constitutional provisions will be finished before

then.  There is no hope now, in view of the delay  that

has  taken place partly because of us and partly because

of  Brunei -  difficulties over oil in one case and common

market  and surplus in the other - that the constitutional

provisions will be ready before 27th June, when  we  are

supposed  to initial the broad principles. But  I  hope,

before  7th August, to be able to reconvene this  House,

if  it  is  possible. And I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir,  you

will  give  due  weight  to the request  then,  because

otherwise we will run into the 31st of August whilst  we

are still debating these provisions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Prime Minister has a knack of

quite  nicely  going away from what we are debating  and

getting away with it. The Speaker has been -brought into

it.  It is not really the Speaker. It is Standing  Order

No. 5.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I would just like to ask the Prime Minister

one  question. But before I do that, I must accept  what

the  Prime Minister says. I am not a legal student, Sir.

I  must  say  that I have not been as fortunate  as  the

Prime Minister who has gone to Cambridge and acquired  a

legal degree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I want to ask him is this. He says

that  it  is necessary to have a variety of  duties  so

that  varied experience is gathered for officers in  the

Government legal service. What I would like to  ask  him

is  whether it is necessary for an officer in the  legal

service,  after  having been a D.P.P.,  to  have  to  be

appointed  a District Judge and then go back  to  be  a

D.P.P. to   acquire  experience  in  the  process   of

prosecution, etc.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to mention to the

Member  for  Thomson how the system operates when  there

are  more  bodies  that one can move about.  In  England

every  Q.C. who is a private practitioner, every leading

silk,  is at the same time a Judge and a Recorder, which

means   the  status  of  a  District  Judge  and   First

Magistrate  in  some town. He does it  as  a  matter  of

public duty. One day he is Judge and the next day he  is

Prosecuting Counsel, and the third day he is Counsel for

the Defendant. These are normal procedures. Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



a  man  knows  what  counsel  does  when  he   is

prosecuting, what counsel does when he is defending,  he

is  all a better Judge when he sits on the Bench.  I  am

quite  sure  of  that. I have never  sat  on  the  Bench

myself,  Mr Speaker, Sir, but I have not the  slightest

doubt  that quite a number of the people who are at  the

Bar  would make very good Magistrates. It might interest

the  Member  for Thomson to know that the Chief  Justice

and  his  brother Judges are considering, together  with

the  Bar, a system whereby one District Court is  manned

by  a  senior member of the Bar in roster, in  order  to

help  out  in the duties so that from Time to Time  when

there are difficult cases, here is a completely unbiased

member of the Bar who could sit as District Judge.  That

requires  the co-operation of the Bar which  means  that

leading  lawyers  whose  average  income  is  $4,000   a

month - any  member of the Bar with more  than  12  years'

standing  would  deem himself a failure  if  he  is  not

earning at least $4,000 a month - would have to give  that

up  while sitting on the Bench. The High Court Bench  is

paid  only $1,950 a month. This is another problem  that

we face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would also like to take this opportunity to say

that  far from wanting to demean them, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I have a little constitutional problem in that I have to

raise their status by way of a Supplementary Estimate in

the  very  near future. It has been agreed in  principle

that the Judiciary will be Pan-Malaysian. Therefore,  as

such,  the  basic  salaries of Puisne Judges - at  present

$1,950 - will  go up to $2,100, and certain  Establishment

matters  will  have  to be cleared regarding  the  other

peripheral  allowances. And before 31st  August,  I  may

have  to move the Supplementary Estimate to bring  their

basic salaries into line with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I said to the Member for Thomson, he ought to

be careful before he ventures into this field. These are

men of some scholarship, learning and integrity. And  he

is  unlikely  to  rattle them into doing things  against

their better judgment just by casting wide aspersions ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not retracting from whatever I have

said.  The Prime Minister suggested this once  or  twice

and  I  just  kept quiet so as to avoid interruption.  I

stand by every word I said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of elucidation being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just want to have this point clarified

before the Prime Minister goes on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member rises on a point of

elucidation,  he must indicate his point of  elucidation

for  something  which the Prime Minister  has  said  and

which   he  does  not  understand.  He  will   have   an

opportunity  of speaking again, because we  will  go  on

until 3.45 p.m. on this Head. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if he wishes to

cast his aspersions and, as he says, he still insists on

them, then I suggest that he make them outside, and  let

these  gentlemen  at  least  have  the  opportunity   of

vindicating  themselves.  But  to  seek  the  cloak   of

privilege  in this Chamber and just dance on the  fringe

of it is, I think, contemptuous in the extreme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just want to repeat once again that what I

have  touched  on  is  the  system  of  appointment  and

transfer of Judges and Magistrates in the Lower  Courts.

There is no question of retracting whatever I have said.

If  the  Prime Minister wants me to mention these things

outside ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- I am quite sure, Sir, if the occasion

arises  I  will  do so. I do not want to  stand  in  the

middle of the street and just make a speech because  the

Prime  Minister  asks me to make a speech.  But  if  the

occasion were such that there was a necessity, we  would

do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point the Prime Minister was making about the

necessity of having a District Judge to go back  to  the

duties of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



a  Deputy Public Prosecutor is something that we  cannot

understand,  and  I  personally  feel  that  this  is  a

farcical system. If the Government is genuine in wanting

people  to  have  confidence in  the  administration  of

justice, then the Government ought to do something about

it.  In principle, I am not objecting to the need for  a

Government legal officer to acquire experience. But what

I  cannot understand is the manner in which these people

are being shifted about from one post to another.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did

not  intend  to participate in this debate, because  the

Prime  Minister  is quite capable of looking  after  the

debate.   But  I  feel  I  am  personally   obliged   to

participate in it now because I consider myself part  of

the  system of the rule of law. I sincerely believe that

if  we  do  not  have the rule of law,  then  the  whole

concept of democracy in the way that we want to practise

it must collapse ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> There is no democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In this system that we operate, the

Judiciary is vital to the survival of the rule  of  law,

and  therefore the survival of our concept of democracy.

I  think  the  Member  for  Thomson  genuinely  under  a

misapprehension.  He thinks that if you  are  a  D.P.P.,

then  you cannot he a good district judge; if you are  a

district judge, then you cannot be a good D.P.P.; if you

are  a  first-rate D.P.P., then you cannot make a first-rate   Assize  Judge.  He  seems  to  suffer  from  that

misapprehension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to be able to understand how one trained in the law can administer each of these functions to the best of his ability, and without being frightened of or in any way subservient to the other aspects of the law is, I think, something only one can understand if one has been trained in the law and in the

different aspects of the law. Merely to say that because

one has been a D.P.P. and that therefore when he gets on

to the Bench he is going to side with the prosecution is

not correct and is not fair to the profession.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I wish to raise: it is a

technical  point, Mr Speaker, Sir. We are on  the  Head

Judicial. A number of these appointments like the  Chief

Justice  and  the Puisne Judges, all their salaries  are

items  of  statutory expenditure. There is no indication

in  this Head that any of the items of expenditure under

the  Chief  Justice or the Puisne Judges  are  items  of

statutory  expenditure. Now, in a minute  or  in  a  few

minutes,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you are going  to  ask  this

House  under Head 2, for the amount of $2.05 million  to

be  voted.  This Assembly cannot vote that  full  amount

because statutory expenditure is not voted upon. Because

you will notice in Head 1 that statutory expenditure was

not  voted  by  the  Assembly;  and  the  only  item  of

statutory expenditure which should have been included in

page  35  and which should have come under Judicial  has

been  omitted.  So  I do not see how you  can  ask  this

Assembly to vote for the amount to he voted in  1963  in

the extreme right-hand column.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to make one remark

concerning  what  the  Prime  Minister  has  said  about

Assemblymen  being  charged or something  like  that.  I

think  all  Singapore knows that the Prime  Minister  in

persecutor.  All  Singapore knows that  our  case  is  a

political case ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have said all that is

completely   irrelevant  and  I  am   trying   to   stop

might arise - I do not know - when we deal with the Prime

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to raise a few points, Sir. You will

remember that the Prime Minister in this very House gave

as  a reason for guillotining our debate on the 9th  and

10th  of  April  that he had to go to Kuala  Lumpur  for

negotiations, when in fact he went there to  play  golf;

and  in  explanation in page 86 of the Hansard  of  10th

June, [Unrevised transcript] [col. 737 of Hansard,  Vol.

20,  No.  6],  the  Prime Minister said  in  the  second

paragraph near the end:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, for reasons which I thought to be in the

interests  of the people, I did not attend a  particular

meeting  in  Kuala Lumpur and chose to stay  in  Cameron

Highlands with the Prime Minister of the Federation  who

was golfing with me.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little bit of a statement shows one or two

points:  that  the  Prime Minister did  not  attend  the

meeting  because he chose to stay in Cameron  Highlands,

and  therefore it could be interpreted, because of  what

had   happened  between  the  Prime  Minister  and   the

Federation Ministers, that the Prime Minister was trying

to  inflate his own bosom and flex his own muscles in  a

show of toughness. He never really had the interests  of

the  people  at  heart. Because if  he  really  had  the

interests of the people at heart, he would have gone  to

negotiate under any circumstances as befitting a Head of

Government  responsible  to  the  people.  He  did  not,

because  he wanted to inflate his own bosom,  hoping  to

give  the  impression that he was a tough guy.  That  is

point No. 1, and it shows that our Prime Minister is too

arrogant  even to negotiate on behalf of the  people  in

spite of his own protestations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sir, may I refer you to page 95 of the same

Hansard  [col.  750], when the Member for Cairnhill,  in

reply,  revealed the true story. Somewhere in the middle

of the second paragraph, the Member for Cairnhill said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He did not attend the meeting in Kuala Lumpur when the

Finance  Minister did, because he agreed with the  Prime

Minister  of  the Federation of Malaya  that  no  useful

purpose could be served for a meeting to be held.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, unless the Prime Minister tells us

that  this is an incorrect statement and that the Member

for  Cairnhill has been speaking an untruth,  the  Prime

Minister himself has been speaking an untruth. I do  not

know  what  we  in the Opposition can do  to  the  Prime

Minister who chooses to speak an untruth in this  House.

But  I would draw the attention of the House to comments

in  the  newspapers as regards the Profumo  case,  which

says that telling lies in Parliament hits at the root of

Government ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You are not sincere.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and the telling of lies in

Parliament ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, is the Member for Queenstown then

suggesting that the Prime Minister has told a lie? If he

suggests  that, then he is out of order. He  cannot  use

that word in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I said "untruth", Sir,If the Prime

Minister  wishes to correct the statement of the  Member

for Cairnhill, he can easily do so. I merely quoted from

the Hansard, One of them was (telling an untruth. If  it

was  not the Member for Cairnhill, then it must  be  the

Prime  Minister.  In  the case of the  War  Minister  in

England, well, he took courageous action. I do not  want

to  suggest anything to our Prime Minister. But we would

like to see what he has got to say on this subject about

telling untruths or lies, if you like - according to  the

statement  in the Press - in Parliament or, in  our  case,

this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I want to raise, Sir - of course, it

may  have nothing to do with government work - is that the

Prime  Minister at one time, when the P.A.P. first  came

to  power, gave specific instructions and directives  to

all P.A.P. Assemblymen that they must not attend dinners

and  private  functions.  Nowadays,  we  see  the  Prime

Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime Minister

is  responsible to this Assembly for what directions  he

gives  to  his own P.A.P. members. I do not  think  this

Assembly   is   interested.   There   must    be    some

responsibility to this Assembly for any action  done  by

the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The connection with the Assembly is

this,  Sir.  Because all Assemblymen's  actions  outside

this  Assembly can be accounted for in this House, I  do

not want to ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member

for  Queenstown could get round it that  way.  If  there

have  been  directions  to P.A.P. Assemblymen  vis-a-vis

their  actions  in this Assembly or in  connection  with

this  Assembly, then yes. But if it is on social  visits

and so on. I say no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not wish to pursue that

subject. Sir. We will leave it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer to the Prime Minister's constituency

visits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is nothing to stop you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister has been going

round  visiting all the constituencies, bragging to  the

people what the P.A.P. can do. We do not mind him  going

around. In fact, it is a good thing that he goes  around ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister : You cannot stop me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nobody would like to stop him. He

will  be  stopping himself unfortunately.  Because  very

soon he will not have the opportunity of doing so again,

not with this bally-hoo



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



with  arches,  and students and Work  Brigade  boys

lining   the  streets.  If  the  Prime  Minister  really

intended  to meet the people as he says, then he  should

not have adopted the style of an emperor going on visits

to  the  country.  He reminds us of  emperors  in  China

visiting  the  countryside. Drums were  beaten, cymbals

banged,  dragon dances, lion dances - is that the  way  to

meet the people?



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, the Work Brigade boys have to put up posters

all  over the place. Merely putting up posters sometimes

can bring in a bill amounting to thousands of dollars. I

do  not  know  who  pays for all that. Maybe  the  Prime

Minister  can answer. But this building of arches  along

the  route and on the roads is a nuisance to the people,

because  it obstructs traffic. Today, the Prime Minister

was  supposed to have visited Ulu Pandan. I stay not  so

very  far  from  Ulu Pandan and I have seen  two  arches

already erected for the last 10 days ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> By the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> One in Bukit Timah Road, just past

Adam Road ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Are you contributing for me?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- another one in Adam Road itself.

And mind you, Sir, both these arches have their feet, so

to  speak, right on the road. Previously, two  lanes  of

traffic  could pass; now only one lane, with the  result

that  during rush hours, there is a terrific congestion,

and people have to wait for 20 or 30 minutes to get past

the junction. Children who have to go to school have  to

turn  up late because of the congestion in traffic.  Let

us  ask  the Prime Minister: who is responsible for  the

building  of  these  arches?  According  to  the   Prime

Minister, it must be the people. Well, if it  is  not  a

government structure, then who has given permission that

these  structures be built on public roads? And what  is

our  Traffic  Superintendent doing  about  this?  Is  it

because  the  people are to welcome the Prime  Minister,

therefore, everything is all right?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Are you

jealous?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister for Finance just

walks  in  and he interjects. I do not know  whether  he

knows what the Member is talking about.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He does not know what he is talking

about. But the most objectionable thing about the  Prime

Minister's constituency visits is this. Either with  his

knowledge  or with his connivance, there are people  who

have  been going around collecting money -  $5,  $10,  $15

from  the  hawkers; $10 up to hundreds of  dollars  from

shopkeepers. For what? You know, Sir, the talk  that  is

going  round.  These hawkers say. "What can  I  do  when

people  from  the Government come along? You  cannot  do

anything but contribute. If you do not want to  give  $5

or  $10, you will be called a Communist. I would  rather

be  $5 short than be called a Communist." The Government

is  using these methods of intimidation and coercion  to

get   people  to  "contribute"  money  for   the   Prime

Minister's  "Welcome" arches. Does  the  Prime  Minister

realise that he is causing a lot of inconvenience to the

people?  In  fact, I can say that far from  getting  the

desired  result, he is going to get a boomerang  because

the people are more annoyed than ever ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then why raise it now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Good, but he does not know it. I

think it is good that the Prime Minister should know  it - [Interruption]. Yes, we would like you  to  be  popular,

Mr Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Oh, no, please!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So that you need not prosecute and

persecute Assemblymen - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was afraid of that, that the

lead  given by the Front benches of the Government  side

will  be  taken up by the Back benches on the Government

side. There will be a rabble soon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I met a couple of Work Brigade boys

and  they complain that if they do not go along to  line

the  streets  and form a welcoming crowd for  the  Prime

Minister,  they  would lose their daily pay.  They  have

roll-calls,  and  if they do not answer the  roll-calls,

they lose their money. Is that what the Work Brigade  is

meant  for? The Prime Minister, of course, says that  he

goes to the rural constituencies to meet the people. But

whom  can he deceive? He cannot deceive the people. When

people go to meet the Prime Minister, he disappears.  He

scoots from his office. Families wanted to meet him, but

he  dared not meet them. So how can he say that he  goes

to  meet the people? When he goes to a constituency,  he

makes  sure that all his bodyguards are around him,  and

if  anybody should want to hand a memorandum to him,  he

has  first  to go through a certain sieve, so to  speak,

before  he  has even a chance of just handing  over  the

memorandum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was so embarrassed that he made sure that such people who wanted to meet him were completely prevented from

doing so. These are only a few facts about his constituency visits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Prime Minister is also in charge of the ex-City Council and the Public Utilities Board is also

under   him.  Everybody  is  suffering  from  the  water

shortage.  If you go home at any time in the  middle  of

the  day, you just do not have water for a wash.  But  I

understand that Oxley Road has no water rationing. I  do

not know who stays in Oxley Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, I know that the Prime

Minister  stays in Oxley Road. I might shift  there  and

enjoy  no  water rationing. But is this the proper  way?

Let  the Prime Minister answer this. Why should he  have

water all the day when other people who need it most  do

not get it? Let him answer all this. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I wonder if the Member for Tanglin is

touching on the same point raised by the Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On one point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps if the hon. Member touches on

that  point  only  for the time being,  then  the  Prime

Minister will he able to reply to that point as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the subject of

the    Prime    Minister's   visit   to   the    various

constituencies, may we know whether he was doing  so  in

his official capacity as the Prime Minister of Singapore

or  as  the  Secretary-General of  the  People's  Action

Party?  If  he was confused over the two,  then,  in  my

opinion,  he  should have paid two visits,  one  in  his

capacity as the Prime Minister and later on unofficially

as  the  Secretary-General of the People's Action Party.

It  is  because he went in his dual capacity that people

were  confused. When he attacked other political Parties

in  the  course of his visit, I think that was improper,

because  if he, as the Prime Minister, made a  political

speech  before a crowd that was there to meet  him,  he

opened  himself  to  the criticism that  he  is  like  a

Government  servant  making  use  of  his  position  for

personal  profit.  Sir, I am sure he does  not  want  to

expose  himself  to that criticism. In future,  I  would

suggest that he make two separate visits instead of one,

as  the Prime  Minister and as the Secretary-General  of

the People's Action Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I expect we will have to dwell at

great  length on this Head. I hope that Members  on  the

other  side will get it off their chest, because I  like

to  have happy Members of the Opposition, not men filled

with  venom  and frustration. It leads to  neurosis.  My

heart  goes  out  to the Member for Queenstown.  On  two

occasions,   he   found   the  burden   of   his   heavy

responsibility too much for him, and he literally passed

out.  I  really ask him  - if it helps him in any way -

to denounce, abuse or otherwise to get it off his chest,

and  I  say  please do so in the sanctity and safety  of

this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Oxley Road and water. Now, Mr Speaker. Sir,I

sincerely hope that the Press will note this, because if

indeed  Oxley Road is getting water and other roads  are

not, then this is a valuable piece of information to all

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



neighbourhood. I am sorry to say that all the Member for

Queenstown  has done now is to enrage all my  neighbours

who  will run around wondering how I can get water  into

my  house when they cannot get it into theirs next  door

and  in  front  and behind and when there  has  been  no

special  road-digging to connect a special  pipe  to  my

house.  Apart  from  the fact that  he  will  enrage  my

neighbours,  I  am quite happy that he should  have  got

this off his chest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have been likened to Baron Profumo, a man

of  great prowess in many fields of war and love. It  is

being  suggested  that, like him, I have  lied  to  this

House.  Now,  Sir,  I have many shortcomings,  like  any

other  human  being.  But I hope that  I  am  reasonably

circumspect  never to be a blatant liar. I said  in  the

House  on  the  night of 9th April that  we  had  urgent

talks,  and we had talks, because Tun Razak was  leaving

after Easter for Washington and London and he would  not

be  hack for a month. Talks were held - I have the records

here -  and meetings were held. I was there the very  same

night  while  the Member for Queenstown was  talking  at

great  length in this Chamber. I was told I missed  very

little.   However,  if  there  is  anything   of   great

importance which he thinks I ought to know,  I  hope  he

will  refer  me to the relevant sections of Hansard.  We

were  in Kuala Lumpur meeting on 10th and 11th, and  the

12th  was Goad Friday. We returned to Singapore. We were

due to go back for another meeting on the 16th, Tuesday.

In  the  meantime,  in  the Finance  Ministry  of  Kuala

Lumpur, the thermometer went up. I was going up to  join

the  Tunku for Easter at Cameron Highlands to play golf,

amongst other things, in a special plane - there was  a

special  reason why there was a special plane; a special

R.M.A.F. plane picked me up at Kuala Lumpur, landed  me

at Bidor, flew on and picked the Tunku up at Butterworth

and  brought him back to Bidor, and we sojourned in  the

Highlands for four days.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan originally was that I was to be down on

Tuesday  for  further  talks  - I read  that  the  Finance

Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation said this in the Sunday  Times  of  14th

April at page 1 referring to what Tunku Abdul Rahman had

told Mr Lee:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He added, "What the Federation Prime Minister told Mr

Lee  was that the Federation was the goose that lays the

golden eggs. But it was Singapore who has benefited from

those  eggs. In other words, Singapore derives the  main

benefit as middleman from the goods, the toil and  sweat

of  the Federation. It was therefore only right that the

Federal Government should be entitled to a fair share of

Singapore's   prosperity,  for   without   the   natural

resources of the Federation, where would Singapore be?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan said it was clear that on Thursday [that was the week before, on the 10th of April when the meetings were held] the talks were

on the verge of breaking down. Then  he said, "It was in fact at his

(Mr Lee's) urging that  the  Federation Government agreed to continue

the talks next week."



<br><br>Sir,  I read this with some interest. I did ask for  the

talks.  I  seriously  urged that we  should  meet  again

before Tun Razak went off because Time was running  out;

and  when  I  read that in the open Press, I felt  that,

rightly  or  wrongly,  the  Finance  Minister   of   the

Federation had misunderstood my position. He  thought  I

was  on  the verge of a nervous breakdown because  there

was  no  agreement and that I went down on my knees  and

pleaded  for another. If I turned up at the  meeting  on

Tuesday  with the Finance Minister of the Federation  in

that  frame of mind, and he suddenly found that far from

going  down  on my knees I started telling  him  exactly

what I thought of it all, he would probably fly off into

a  rage,  which would not help things at all. Therefore,

from  the  rarefied  and comforting  atmosphere  of  the

Highlands, I let it be known, with the agreement of  the

Tunku who had spoken to his Deputy, that I was not going

down  to  Kuala  Lumpur until the temperature  had  gone

down. This was reported in the Straits Times of 17th.  I

think I am entitled to choose my own tactics. This is  a

gruelling  process in which I am engaged with a  company

director  of  no  mean  skill as a company  director - and

company  directors are hard-headed men who have a  glint

in  their  eyes when they see money, and when  they  see

Singapore's  surpluses there is more  than  a  glint  in

their eyes. And whilst I like to keep everybody



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



happy, I must do it on conditions which make sure that I

keep  Singapore  and  the people of Singapore  generally

happy,  including the Member for Queenstown,  because  I

can  assure  him that if there were not all  this  money

around  the place, you can send any number of  thugs  to

beat the man up and he would not have the $5 to give you

for  your  arch.  It is not possible. He  must  have  $5

first.  I make no apologies for choosing my own tactics.

I   have  said  before  that  we  are  always  ready  to

negotiate. We still are. But I have made it quite  clear

that the formula - and I am now fortified by the unanimous

support   of  the  House  because  there  was  not   one

dissenting voice that night. I went home fully confident

that the Government was not going to ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid the Prime Minister is

now going far away from the point raised. I think he has

answered it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point. Mr Speaker,

Sir.  Facts. Was there a lie? I said I was  going  to  a

meeting.  I went to a meeting. The meeting nearly  broke

down. We never disclosed it. The Finance Minister of the

Federation disclosed it and said I begged for a  further

meeting.  I decided that in those circumstances  it  was

hardly  likely that there was going to be  a  reasonable

argument, and he was probably under the impression  that

I  was going to fall down on my bended knees and entreat

him for a settlement. So I thought the best thing to  do

was   to  allow  things  to  cool  down.  My  very  able

colleague,  the Minister for Finance, looked  after  all

the  matters  that  normally he and  I  together  looked

after.  He did all the talking on our side, and  reading

from  the minutes, I must say that I could not have done

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to say this to the Member for

Queenstown. He should be careful when he thinks of Baron

Profumo,  because if he only knew the  things  that  the

Member for Hong Lim regularly tells us about him ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think that arises. Can

we   go   on  to  constituency  visits?  It  is   rather

interesting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I implore him

never to make a false statement in this House or he will

be  confronted by the Member for Hong Lim who  is  quite

prepared,  he  told  me, to swear  on  oath  as  to  the

qualities of the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> These are insinuations and

innuendoes  and I wish the Prime Minister  will  sustain

what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am not going to sustain what I

have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> On a point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am going to repeat what the

Member for Hong Lim said to me and he will sustain  what

he  said  of the Member for Queenstown. I think that  is

fair enough.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is completely out of order.

It is completely irrelevant. The Member for Hong Lim,  I

think, is entitled to say something if he wishes to  say

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the usual

tactic  of  the  Prime Minister when he cannot  confront

arguments of the Member for Queenstown and he  wants  to

get me to help him confront the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us come on to the next topic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So much for Baron Profumo, and I

hope his name will never he forgotten by the two Members

opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, my rural tour. The Member for Queenstown was

greatly  upset.  I  think he increased  the  hazards  of

driving for Dunearn Road. Thugs have been sent out, Work

Brigade  chaps;  Government  officials  go  around   and

collect $5, $10. What else could they do? Otherwise they

would  be dubbed Communists and so they paid up. Sir,  I

quite  believe  that if you employ a  gang  efficiently,

they  might collect some money. But I think  it  is  not

easy, having made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



them  pay  that money, to make them wait for  you  at  a

specified  Time;  and worse, to stand  in  the  sun  and

listen  to you. It is a fact that the Member for Tanglin

finds  it  deplorable  that people  should  be  standing

around  listening and that I should go there in  a  dual

capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of information?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I did not say that it was

deplorable for people to be standing there to  meet  the

Prime Minister. That would have been the right thing  if

he  was  going as Prime Minister alone. But what I  want

him  to  clarify is this: was he going in  his  official

capacity  as  Prime Minister or as Secretary-General  of

the People's Action Party?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was so careful in these visits

that regularly the P.A.P. branch in the constituency  is

not  visited. Because I went there as Prime Minister,  I

did not wish to associate the party organisation with my

visit. It is as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited every one of them, and that was covered by

the Press. The P.A.P. branch dresses up for the occasion

like  any  other shops and other people. But I  did  not

visit  the  branch, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  went  there  as

Prime  Minister, and as Prime Minister I am entitled  to

tell the people what I think. One political Party in the

Federation with branches in Singapore was trying  to  do

us,  and  I  think  the  open confrontation  helped.  It

cleared  the air. The two Senators have not appeared  in

Singapore  for some Time, and I am told it  is  unlikely

that they will appear. [Interruption] Well, not for some

Time  any  way. I make no apologies for this. These  are

chosen, deliberate moves, made in what I believe  to  be

the  best interests of the people. If you find your  arm

being  quietly  twisted on a dark and  lonely  night,  I

think the right thing to do first will be to switch  the

light on so that everybody can see who is twisting your

arm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



Next, having done that, to apprehend the culprit who has

been  doing it, and thirdly, to make sure that  he  does

not  do  it  again. I think that is good.  That  is  the

democratic  procedure of the open argument.  If  what  I

said  was  wrong,  about setting up lottery  boards  and

buying chaps over, well, I am liable, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

Here  I  am  imputing to two venerable Senators,  august

gentlemen  in  the  hierarchy of the  nation  and  their

interest  in Malaysia. They thought that all the  effort

and  energy we were expending in keeping the Member  for

Queenstown  and his ilk down was to the benefit  of  the

Social  Welfare Lottery sellers, like him. I  understand

the discomfiture of the Member for Cairnhill because  he

was left out of the Lottery Board.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is now trying

to  persist  in  being irrelevant.  That  is  completely

irrelevant  to  what  we are now debating.  We  are  now

debating his constituency visits, and he has brought  in

something which he has said in one of his visits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point, Mr Speaker.

The  Member for Tanglin asked: what right had  I,  if  I

went  as Prime Minister, to attack political Parties?  I

expect  he wants a Prime Minister who just kisses babies

and  loves  everyone, including his enemies,  like  good

moral rearmamers. I am told that if you slap their  left

cheek,  they  give you their right cheek. Finished  with

the  right,  you can kick them in the groin;  they  roll

down  on  the floor in agony and never utter a  word  of

anguish.  But that is not the way Singapore is governed.

Anybody who thinks he can outdo the Singapore Government

is  quite welcome to try. Like Sumo wrestlers,  Sir,  if

you  fail, then there is a heavy thud, and that is that.

It is a well-known fact now: I mean the collision is on;

it  must  be settled at some date. I have not  increased

affection  and  general  bonhomie  as  a  result  of  my

disclosures. The Member for Cairnhill - I do not  know.  I

have  asked  him not to be too worried about being  left

out from the Lottery Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister has

made  his  point.  I do hope he understands  what  I  am

trying  to  do.  This  is Supply  day  and  there  is  a

guillotine on the different items. Therefore, if he  can

be as relevant as possible on every item, I think we can

get on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. But

what  I  want  to  do  really is  to  help  the  Members

opposite.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, I think they feel the world is not quite

right. Traffic is wrong; there are arches; extortion  is

going  on. It is quite right if the Member for  Tanglin - no  doubt I hope one of these days when I visit Tanglin,

I  will  have  the pleasure of meeting him,  unlike  the

Member  for Queenstown who would not be in, as ho thinks

it  is wrong altogether - but whatever  it is, never doubt

that  this  is a Government that is prepared to  justify

everything  it  does,  publicly  and  privately.  It  is

prepared  to justify publicly. Water for Oxley Road - test

with  the neighbours; test with the Water Department  to

find out where the valves are. Rural tours, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  boomerang on me. The Member for Queenstown  loves

me  so much that he was driven to anguish at the thought

that  all  this  may come to grief on  me.  Well,  I  am

indebted to him for the great concern and solicitude  he

has shown for me. But every foolish remark he makes, let

him  remember - the Member for Hong Lim is a  much  wilier

person ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

for Hong Lim has not even spoken!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of information. The Prime

Minister knows, Mr Speaker, Sir, where his match comes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There comes a great man! He never

picks  a fight where he is likely to get hurt. He  is  a

wise man. In saying these things, there are hundreds  of

people  in  each of these constituencies who  know  that

what  the Member for Queenstown said was a lie  and  who

would be offended by the lies; not a matter for me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He said "lies", Sir, I never used

the word "lies" about him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member said "untruth". But

may  I  point out that there are 22 items under  Head  7

(Prime  Minister), and we have not even  completed  one.

Let us get on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on the same topic?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have

refrained from entering into the fray of mud-slinging by

comrades and ex-comrades. But the Prime Minister in  his

mental  anguish  chose to bring me  into  the  arena.  I

cannot understand it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Do not worry. They can sell

aeroplanes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would seem that what he has

said - I  would not have come into this and I  would  have

let  the  Prime Minister have his fun at the expense  of

the  Member for Queenstown. But he thought it was a good

thing,  while he is on this, to go on twisting everyone.

He  mentioned  the  meetings of  the  Inter-Governmental

Committee  in  Kuala Lumpur. The Member  for  Queenstown

tried  to pinpoint the statements made in this House  on

the  10th, and he said that one of us (either the  Prime

Minister  or  I)  was  telling  an  untruth.  The  Prime

Minister  therefore  had to stand  up  and  explain  the

situation,  to  try to say that what he said  about  the

10th  was  the  truth. I would not have wanted  to  pick

flaws  in his statement if he had just left it at  that.

He  said, about the 9th, that he left for Kuala  Lumpur

on  the 9th. That was true in that while the debate  was

going  on,  he was in Kuala Lumpur on the 10th.  On  the

10th, in the morning, he was having a wonderful game  of

golf, and in the afternoon when the meeting was to have

been held, he did not attend that meeting. Right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point of

order. I was just telling the Member that I attended the

meetings on the 10th and the 11th. The newspapers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



are  there, the minutes are there. If he says that I  am

lying,  then  the minutes are lying, the newspapers  are

lying.  Then  I  have  my conduct investigated,  because

obviously  either  I am a liar or he  is  persisting  in

repeating a lie after I have told him the truth.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He can have all his newspapers to

say what he wants to say. I am not interested in that.

This is what I said. And therefore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, in that case ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Prime Minister will have an

opportunity of replying. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is a point of order, Mr

Speaker. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister : It is. I have stated, as a matter

of fact, that I was in Kuala Lumpur on the 10th and 11th

for two meetings. There are minutes of the meetings. The

Member for Cairnhill is insisting that that is a lie and

that, in fact, I did not attend the meetings. I say that

if  that is so, then one of us has committed a breach of

privilege  by  calling  the  other  a  liar.   Have   it

investigated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. It

is  one statement as against another statement, and  the

Prime  Minister has his remedy. If he thinks  that  the

Member  for Cairnhill is alleging an untruth,  in  fact,

stating  a  lie,  he may refer it to  the  Committee  of

Privileges by way of a motion. That is all there  is  to

it -  one statement as against another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister : Well ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not here to judge. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, therefore, on the 10th in

trying  to answer that, he said, "Well, I was in Cameron

Highlands. I consider it to be in the interests  of  the

public."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is, and on another point of

order. I am suggesting to the Member for Cairnhill  that

he  desist, because I intend to move this as a matter of

privilege. He leaves me with no choice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. But that is not a point of order.

The  Prime Minister is entitled to do that if, in  fact,

the Member for Cairnhill is not telling the truth.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I was just saying that on the 10th

he  said  something else. He said that he was at Cameron

Highlands  and he considered that it was in  the  public

interest  that there was no need for him to  attend  the

meeting.  I forgot the date, and he said "16th".  And  I

said that that was not true. I still say that it is  not

true.  It  was not he who said that there should  be  no

meeting. It was the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya  who  told  him it was not worth having  another'

meeting.  He agreed. Therefore, he did not go.  But  the

Minister for Finance, not having been informed that  the

meeting was cancelled, wept to Kuala Lumpur and they had

a  meeting  no doubt with the Minister for Finance.  The

Prime  Minister  can say what he wants to  say,  but  it

would  seem that he does not allow other people  to  say

what they think is the true position.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning we have been talking about

the  rural  visits of the Prime Minister.  I  myself  am

quite interested in this matter, and so I would like  to

give  my  own  views on it. I personally feel  that  the

Prime  Minister of the State is not only a  clever  man,

eloquent  and  capable, but today  he  is  also  a  very

outstanding actor in this House. As a matter of fact, we

can  see for ourselves that when the Prime Minister goes

on rural visits, his performance is very outstanding and

wonderful.  Sometimes he cries, sometimes he jumps,  and

sometimes  he laughs, and there is a lot of  banging  of

gongs and drums.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a very interesting matter for the Prime Minister to go to the rural areas. We originally did not bother about these things. But because the Prime Minister has said in this House that we cannot stop his visits to the rural areas. I would like to reply that we do not have any intention of

stopping  him from going there. We can see  clearly,  as

our  Party Chairman and other Members of this House have

pointed  out, that the Prime Minister has been going  on

rural  visits  to waste public funds. We know  that  the

market is not so good these few days, and the visits  of

the  Prime Minister have -not been of any benefit to the

pea-pie.  Instead  it has cost them some  money  in  the

building and construction of arches. So we say that this

is  a  suicidal  move  of  the  Prime  Minister  in  the

political  field. We do not care to stop him. [Laughter]

It  is  not  a  joke.  I  think you  are  crying  inside

yourself. This is not a joke, you know. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

rural visits of the Prime Minister, as he explains,  are

made  to enable him to understand the livelihood of  the

people  in  the rural areas. But what is the method  and

how does he go about this thing? He goes about it in the

grandest way. How can he say that he can understand  the

way  of living of the people? From the history of  China

we  can see that those officials who were interested  in

the  livelihood of the people, when they went on  visits

to  the  people,  went in a very plain  manner,  without

being  noticed by members of the public.  They  did  not

make  a  lot  of fuss and visit places where there  were

lots of arches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, actually the aim of the Prime Minister in his rural visits is only to make political propaganda. We can see that when the Prime Minister said things during his visits, they were said with threats or deceit, especially recently with regard to the breakdown in the financial talks. The Prime Minister made use of

the   opportunity  during  his  rural  visits  to   make

complaints before the people. When he met with difficulties,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



he  said  that  they  were  difficulties  in  the

financial  talks;  and then all of a sudden  he  made  a

twist and said that there was much progress. So he tried

to  make use of his rural visits to show that he is  one

who is a hero looking after the interests of the people.

But  how  has he helped in the livelihood of the people?

If  one says that the amenities of any constituency must

depend on the rural visits of the Prime Minister, then I

say that this Government is incapable and incompetent. I

would  say that a responsible Prime Minister should  not

do  a  thing of this nature. If you want to develop  the

rural areas or to construct any road, then you must  not

wait until the Prime Minister goes on a rural visit. Mr

Speaker - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not understand these

interjections in Mandarin!



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, so, on

the whole, we can say that the rural visits of the Prime

Minister  have been made in order to try  and  save  his

political life. That is all.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quite irresponsible when he said that he

agreed  to the detention of these people during February

of  this year, because he wanted them to have some  rest

and free meals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that this kind of talk should not have come from a responsible Prime Minister. I would like to explain to you further about this matter. I am a citizen of Singapore. Is that not right? If the Government is so irresponsible as to detain anybody and make use of public funds to feed them when they can work for their own livelihood, then the Government is being

irresponsible. If these persons have not  committed  any

crime, the Government cannot do this. If they have, then

send them to the court.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Lady Member is now

entering into a different debate entirely. She will have

the  opportunity, I am sure, to speak on that particular

aspect. Shall we carry on with the constituency visits?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, all

that  I  have  said is actually closely related  to  the

rural  visits  of  the Prime Minister, because  when  he

makes  his rural visits, not only has he failed to  keep

his  promise to understand the people, but he makes  use

of   the   opportunity  to  carry  out  his   -political

propaganda   and   make  irresponsible  statements   and

allegations. I say that this is wrong. On one  occasion,

during  a  rural visit, he said that he  agreed  to  the

detention of these people because he wanted them to have

some  rest  and  free  meals.  I  say  that  responsible

citizens were very unhappy about his statement. So I  am

pointing  out to him that from this it can be said  that

the Prime Minister is irresponsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the whole, the rural visits of the Prime Minister provide occasions for him to get across his own feelings, his laughter and his emotions to the people. He wants the people to share his own feelings but they will not do this. It exposes his nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> <i>(In Mandarin)</i>: First of all, I must

thank the Member for Stamford for using so much time and

effort to advise me on how to become a responsible Prime

Minister.  I welcome her help and I thank her very  much

for it. She says that she does not intend to obstruct me

in  my  rural visits because it will not be  to  my  own

advantage.  That is well and good. I would like  to  ask

her, during my first visit to Thomson District, why  did

all the people get these old people to visit me?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Member wishes to

raise a matter for elucidation. Miss Fung.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Prime Minister claims that during his rural visits,

some  people used to organise rural dwellers and country

people  to  welcome  him. I would like  to  ask  him  to

explain this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> <i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Facts are facts. The

first  time  I  visited Thomson District,  their  youths

dared  not  come  out;  so  they  sent  out  their   old

womenfolk;  that  was more convenient. This  is  nothing

different from the Barisan Sosialis tactics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I would suggest that the Member

for  Stamford make a few notes. It would be much simpler

for interpretation. The Prime Minister completes what he

has  to  say,  and  then  I will allow  the  Member  for

Stamford to reply. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister (In Mandarin): The Rural Dwellers

and   Country  Peoples  Association  wanted  to  protest

against  the  anti-colonialist heroes. I am  an  elected

Prime  Minister. Therefore, I cannot help  but  persuade

them to meet me in an open front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same womenfolk in Jalan Kayu and the women in

Thomson  District  said  that I did  not  satisfy  their

needs.  What  are their needs? Do they want  payment  or

material  compensation?  Why  all  these  arrogant   and

unjustifiable claims? All these are false statements. If

the  question of compensation is settled, they will then

bring  up another question. All compensations have  been

paid. So if both say that they are right, then one  must

be lying. So I asked one old woman to come and see me on

Sunday  and  then  on Monday when Press  reporters  were

present,  she  dared not turn up, because  her  master's

supporters did not dare come out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young Lady Member has described my rural visits as

a  show of putting across my emotions and feelings. If I

have  made any errors, I will ask her to excuse me.  She

has  paid so much attention to my rural visits.  I  feel

very  touched and happy. To have such attention paid  by

her shows that there is a real need for my rural visits.

Then,  in future, we shall be able to disclose  step  by

step  whatever false statements they have  made  to  the

people  since 1959. I personally hope that  one  day  so

young   a  lady  like  her  will  get  more  and  richer

experience  and then perhaps she may help us  to  manage

our  affairs.  As to telling me how to be a  good  Prime

Minister, it is very kind of her, but if she says that I

have  been irresponsible in my talks to the people, then

I say it is not a fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that those detained are having a rest and

free meals. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



true,  because they are actually having free  meals - two

eggs a day, a pound of butter, three pounds of beef  and

various  dishes of vegetables. Therefore, I  hope  these

people  can  review what they have done in the  past  in

these   quiet  surroundings.  Once  they  have  reformed

themselves, they can come and help in the development of

Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

the  Prime  Minister  has said  just  now  that  in  his

personal  Visits  to  the rural  districts  some  people

organised  old womenfolk to embarrass him. In the  past,

because  the educational policies in schools were  in  a

chaotic state, the future of the students was in a  very

bad state: so they stood up to protest against this. The

Prime Minister then said that these people are young and

inexperienced and can easily be made use of. I must  ask

him what about these aged womenfolk? Will they be easily

made  use of too? By this argument, he will feel ashamed

of  himself. Old women have their own ideas. With  years

of  life  and  experience behind them, how can  they  be

easily made use of?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has said just now that he wishes that I must have full and rich experience before I can help him. He does not know himself. If I wanted to help, I would not help reactionary people like him to work. He does not know his own standing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister always says that those under detention are living very well, but I must point out that if a person loses his liberty and has only good meals, then he is no better off than a pig. It is only our Prime Minister who envies such a way of life. He says those people have good meals. Is it true?

We  must  know. But the money they use to  pay  for  the

meals -  is it being brought out from their own pockets or

is it from public funds?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. As I have said, that topic. I am

sure,  will  be  raised Time and Time  again  as  we  go

through  these  Estimates. Unless any Member  wishes  to

raise  another  topic,  another point  on  item  (1).  I

propose to close the debate on that item.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (3)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has on many occasions defended

the  Political Secretaries by saying that  they  act  as

bridges between the Government and the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister did not say

that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He said that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What are these Political

Secretaries then? What is Jek Yuen Thong? Is he  one  of

the bridges for the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is very useful ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Did he try to act as a bridge

between  Singapore  and Moshi? If Political  Secretaries

are to serve a useful purpose, then they must really  do

some  work: and if they are supposed to meet the  people

and  feel  their pulse, then they must really  meet  the

people.  On the 22nd of April the families of  detainees

went to see the Prime Minister but they did not see him.

They found Mr Jek Yuen Thong in the office, but Mr Jek

did  not see the families of the detainees. Why  did  he

not?  What  was he paid for? We would like to hear  some

explanation from the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to go too much into

the details of this famous incident on the 22nd of April

for  obvious reasons. I asked Mr Jek Yuen Thong and  he

assured me that they went there to see me and not to see

him.  He  told  me that had they seen mc, some  of  the

bottles  and  sticks which he saw might well  have  been

suitably employed. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, Sir, I can

assure them that I am usually in the office on Mondays.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (4)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (4) and item (5) are for Permanent

Secretaries. For item (4)  in 1962, we had a  token  vote

of  $10, and we are still asked to give a token vote  of

$10  for  1963. But in the meantime a post of  Permanent

Secretary (Special Duties), Grade C, has been created in

1962. I thought that when that post was created it would

have  filled that vote for the Permanent Secretary  with

the  token  vote of $10. Can the Prime Minister  explain

why  he  should  want two Permanent Secretaries  in  one

small Ministry, which will get smaller and smaller after

Malaysia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. One

Permanent  Secretary is at the moment acting as  General

Manager  of the Public Utilities Board: hence the  token

vote  of  $10. The position is quite simple.  I  get  no

benefit  out of having two Permanent Secretaries because

they  are  doing  their respective duties  whether  they

appear on my list or somebody else's list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my Ministry shrinking after Malaysia, I think

the  Member for Cairnhill must have got his White  Paper

wrong,  as  mainly  it  is  the  Home  Affairs  that  is

shrinking.  So  all the questions that  Members  on  the

opposite  side  behind him find so much  interest  in  -  on

Prisons,  the  shape  of windows, sunshine,  fresh  air,

exercise,  free  meals, companions to  talk  to,  birds,

rabbits,  vegetables  and so on  -  they  will  all  be

directed  to  the  Minister for the  Interior  in  Kuala

Lumpur  after August 31st. Mind you, I am ready  at  any

Time now to collect any memoranda that they wish to give

me  on their behalf. But, Sir, as far as I am concerned,

my  Ministry continues as before. If it is shrinking, it

is because the programme for setting up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



the  Public  Utilities  Board has  been  completed;  the

Integration  Bill winding up the City  Council  will  be

taken  through all its stages, I think, in this Session,

and there will be a devolution of these responsibilities

on to other people.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If I understand him right, Sir,

although  there are two posts in his Ministry, there  is

only   one  Permanent  Secretary  working  as  Permanent

Secretary. In view of that explanation, I beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ng

Teng Kian ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have made a mistake about this amendment. I

therefore wish to withdraw it. I am not moving it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Dr Thio

Chan Bee ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (7)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (11)  of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Thio, amendment (5) .



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Thio, amendment (6) .



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am not moving too.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is for Entertainment. I see the sum of $10,000 is

the  same  as  voted for last year, and it  is  a  pity,

because I thought that sum should be increased. Sir, the

Prime Minister entertains so many people nowadays in Sri

Temasek



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



that  I  am  sure  he  needs  more  money.  Instead   of

extracting  money from the people in the  constituencies

who  subscribed $5 and $10 for his arches,  surely  this

money could be put to better use, and the people may not

have  to  pay any money. I wonder if the Prime  Minister

will seriously consider this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was thinking that there could be

a  fair case made out to increase the vote, but in  view

of  the  general austerity of the Times, in case  it  is

believed  that  we  have got more  surplus  than  it  is

already  reckoned that we have, it is best that we  keep

our  expenditure more or less as it is. But perhaps next

year if the Member for Queenstown would let us know  how

far  he  would  go in supporting us, once the  financial

terms have been settled and there can be no question  of

its  being  believed  that we have more  money  than  we

require,  then  I  will  be very happy  to  receive  any

recommendations  from him and his  Party  and  from  any

other Members of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I must remind the Member for Queenstown

that this invitation to receive recommendations from the

other side does not include a recommendation to increase

Assemblymen's allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that

after  each  visit by the Prime Minister  to  the  rural

constituencies, those people who have contributed $10 in

some  places  and in other places perhaps a few  dollars

more to the building of arches and the purchase of fire-crackers for the Prime Minister's visits would after the

visit  receive an invitation card embossed in gold print

for  a  dinner in Sri Temasek. Now, what I wish to  seek

clarification  is  this.  In  addition  to  these  rural

visits,  there ore many other forms of entertainment.  I

believe, held almost night after night in Sri Temasek. I

agree  that  this  $10,000 is  not  sufficient  for  the

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you. Hooray --- more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> It is only enough for three rural

visits. I believe in any of these big parties where  800

people are usually gathered together, each person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



who has paid $10 for fire-crackers can get  back  a

certain  amount, depending on how much he can drink.  If

you  can  drink two bottles of Hennessy,  you  get  hack

three-fold. Therefore, Sir, I wish, first of all, if the

Prime Minister agrees, we on this side of the House vote

for a 50 per cent increase, or 30 per cent increase.  If

it  is  not  necessary, then there must  be  some  other

reason. The entertainment expenses being incurred in Sri

Temasek  almost  every night must have  come  from  some

other  hidden vote. On this I wish to seek clarification

from the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am gratified by the warmth and

charity  shown  by  my political opponents.  Sir,  I  am

indebted  to  them  for  their  consideration.  I   will

seriously  give consideration to upping the vote  by  50

per  cent next year. As I have said, for various reasons

I  think it is impolitic at this moment to increase  our

entertainment  allowances as it may be  deemed  that  we

have  more than enough funds for our State purposes.  So

let  us first settle our financial discussions at  Kuala

Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer that I will give to his other solicitous

enquiry, as to how much I spend on my guests, is the one

that  I  have  given to the Member for  Cairnhill,  that

there  is  a  Public Accounts Committee, and  if  he  is

genuinely  interested, not for the purpose  of  publicly

humiliating  my guests by having it said  how  much  per

head  they are worth, then he can seek clarification  in

the Public Accounts Committee. That is the proper place.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the answer the Prime Minister

gave me was that there have been no such receptions, but

the  Member for Hong Lim says there have been receptions

almost every night. I do not know who is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Cairnhill often

plays  the  joker.  It  so happened, he  asked  me  the

question  when there were no receptions. The  fact  that

the  Member  for  Hong Lim says we are tottering  around

with  whisky every night does not mean that  we  are.  I

have long



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



ceased  to worry about what he says, because if what  he

says  is true, then we must all be here sodden and laden

with  whisky and food, incapable of meeting the constant

fusillade  that comes from the Opposition  benches,  and

therefore  we would all be grovelling away on the  floor

prostrate through sheer good living.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Queenstown wish for

a  vote?  Yes? Oh. I thought lie wished to increase  the

vote!

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is time to suspend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (3)  of subhead 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote shows an increase of $4,000 over last

year's  estimate. The building, I understand,  has  been

renovated  and  I  therefore cannot understand  why  the

maintenance  costs should be more than  those  for  last

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think last year the domestic

staff  was not in residence because the house was  being

renovated.  It has just been in use since the  beginning

of  December or the end of November last year,  and  the

increase. I think, is for domestic staff.

a washerwoman - she does the laundry.

this Kuala Lumpur Temasek? Do civil servants make use of

it too, or only the Ministers?

rightly,    I   think   all   Ministers,   Parliamentary

Secretaries  and Division I officers, when they  are  on

duty,  and  all  Division II and Division  III  officers

accompanying Ministers and Division I officers on duty.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that the provision for last year was

$39,290  and  for this year it has gone up to  $161,900.

The  note  referring  to the Appendix  merely  seeks  to

clarify  the  proportion of Singapore's contribution  to

the  upkeep of Malaya Hall. Sir, what we would  like  to

know is why there has to be an increase of over $120,000

in  this  vote. Sir, we are not against any increase  in

the  vote so as to provide improvements in Malaya  Hall,

provided,   of   course,  that  such  improvements   are

justified. What we would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



like  to know, Sir, is why the increase, and whether  it

is  justified because we cannot trust the P.A.P. and  we

know,  Sir,  that  they are quite interested  in  Malaya

Hall. As a matter of fact, the P.A.P. is more interested

in  the  occupants  of Malaya Hall than  the  upkeep  of

Malaya  Hall  itself, and we would like to  ensure  that

this fund is not used for activities which may help  the

P.A.P. to  make  their political activities  easier  in

London.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I wonder whether Tun Lim wishes to say a

few words.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am cheered by

the  remarks of the Member for Thomson that he considers

the  maintenance and upkeep of Malaya Hall an  important

matter,  even  more  important than  the  occupants  of

Malaya Hall in whom he suspects we have a great deal  of

interest.  He  does not trust us and in this  particular

respect I can assure him, since he trusts the Federation

Minister for Internal Security more, I am sure  he  will

accept  the  explanation that this  is  because  we  are

implementing  the  Ismail Report. He will  remember  Dr

Ismail, the Minister for the Interior of the Federation,

who  went there to investigate student affairs and  made

some  recommendations  which  included  extensions   and

renovations of Malaya Hall. This is our share  ratio  of

one   to   two   for   the   implementation   of   these

recommendations. If he accepts Dr Ismail's word for it,

then  I  am  quite sure he will give us his support  for

paying  our share and I can assure him that one  of  Dr

Ismail's  predominant interests is to  ensure  that  Mr

John Eber gets no credit out of Malaya Hall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we want to know what our Trade and Cultural

Representative is doing in Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Trade and

Cultural  Representative is right  here  in  this  House

waiting  for a free moment to report to me  on  what  is

happening  to  our business in Indonesia right  at  this

moment.  As  the  Member  for Queenstown  quite  rightly

pointed out, his services were suitably acknowledged  by

the  State  of Singapore in the National Day Honours.  I

think he has conducted his duties there as our Trade and

Cultural  Representative with a great deal of  tact  and

diplomatic competence. I am happy to report that through

the  somewhat difficult period of the last  few  months,

when  boats  and  aeroplanes were  buzzing  between  the

Straits of Malacca and Malaya, we maintained correct and

cordial relations with our big and powerful neighbour.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of Malaysia, would this

particular  department  not  come  under  the   External

Affairs  Ministry  of Malaysia, and  if  so,  would  the

Government not start considering in what way economy can

be  achieved  right  now? I refer to a  particular  item

which  is fortunately just a token vote of $10  for  the

purchase of houses. If as a result of Malaysia, while we

may  still  have the representation, but  it  will  come

under  the  wing  of the External Affairs  of  Malaysia,

then, I think it would be a wise thing if we try to  cut

down on our expenses in Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I do hope the Members on the

other side take Command Paper 33 of 1961 seriously,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



because  it  does  set  out the main  framework  of  our

relations with the Central Government thereafter  and  I

would  like  to  refer the Member for Cairnhill  to  the

second half of paragraph 5 of the White Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`While the Federal Government will be responsible for

the  conduct of external relations, the special position

of  Singapore  in  relation to entrepot  trade  will  be

safeguarded.  Measures  to  protect  the   interest   of

Singapore  trade overseas will include the establishment

of  a section within any of the Federal missions as  may

be necessary to deal with trade matters of Singapore. In

any  trade  negotiation  or arrangements  undertaken  or

entered  into  by  the Federal Government  with  another

country   due  consideration  will  be  given   to   the

commercial needs of Singapore.'



<br><br>In   other   words,   all  these  trade  representatives

representing Singapore's special interest will continue,

but  as  part of the Malayan Embassy. But they  will  be

looking  after Singapore's special interest and entrepot

trade. I do not think the vote can disappear because the

vote will have to appear.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister has misunderstood

me.  What  I have said is borne out by what he has  said

just now. What I say is, would it not be a wise thing if

we  could consider some economy? Will it be necessary to

buy houses when these people can come in under the same,

shall we say, housing compound as the Malaysian Embassy,

instead  of  having  separate houses?  What  I  am  more

concerned  about  is the purchase of houses  which  will

mean a lot of money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, whether or not the trade

representative  is  there  on  his  own  as   of   right

representing   Singapore  or   is   there   representing

Singapore as part of the Malayan Embassy, he must have a

place  to  reside in, and if we do not pay for  it,  the

Federal  Government will have to pay  for  it  and  will

charge us for it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Queenstown wish for

a vote?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> indicated dissent.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a number of decorations and honours

which have been given to various people in Singapore. By

what  yardstick  do they give these honours?  Would  the

Prime Minister enlighten us?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

delighted  that the Member for Queenstown  shows  proper

and  due  interest  and  respect  for  this  matter.   I

sincerely  hope  that when the citations  are  read,  he

would,  I am quite sure, be invited to be present  as  a

Member of this Assembly to do honours to those who  have

served the State of Singapore, and I hope he will listen

to the citations with the interest that they deserve.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Have medals and honours been given

to   chairmen  of  welcoming  committees  to  the  Prime

Minister's visits to constituencies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> There may well have been. Mr

Speaker, Sir. We established a Public Service Star,  but

if  they  were, it was purely incidental,  because  they

were also leaders of the communities that they live  in.

I  am  quite sure that if the Member for Queenstown does

not  think they are leaders of communities, he is  quite

at liberty to criticize.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I think by right, this

subhead   should   be   renamed  "P.A.P.   Honours   and

Decorations"  instead of what it reads now.  It  is  all

very  amusing. On May Day, Mr Devan Nair gave the Prime

Minister a medal, and on National Day the Prime Minister

gave Mr Devan Nair a medal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Jealous, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we are not, in principle, opposed to

giving   citations  to  public  servants  who  genuinely

perform functions in the interests of the State and  its

people.  But what we do not want to see is  the  use  of

public funds to buy silver medals, gold medals and  what

have they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



to  give  people whose services are recognized  only  if

those   services  are  to  the  advantage  of   P.A.P.'s

political interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that if we go through the names - and

the  Prime Minister himself has accepted it to  be  true

just  now  in the reply given to the Member for  Queenstown - in  the  list there are many whose only meritorious

service appears to be activities which are political and

in  the interest of the P.A.P. There are a lot of people

like   Devan   Nair - for  example.  Mr   Gopalakrishnan.

Practically all the P.A.P. trade union leaders have been

given  citations - gold  medals, I  suppose.  Sir,  it  is

strange again that some equally well-known P.A.P. trade

unionists  have been omitted. I am quite sure that  this

is  not  a  mistake,  but quite a  deliberate  act.  For

example,  the  former  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Culture whose standing, I believe,  in  the

P.A.P.'s small trade union world, is equivalent to  that

of  Mr  Devan Nair, or if not Devan Nair, at  least,  I

believe,  Sir, to that of other people like Ho See  Beng

and  so on. But the Parliamentary Secretary did not  get

one.  There is one other interesting example, Mr T.  V.

Gomez, who is also a notorious P.A.P. trade unionist. He

has  also  been left out. Perhaps the reasons  are  that

giving  citations to these people would only make things

more obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not think it is proper for the Government to

utilise public funds in the region of $20,000 - next  year

$23,940  merely to give citations to individuals because

their activities favour the P.A.P.'s interest. This,  we

think, is a complete waste of Time and a waste of money,

particularly in a period which is described by the Prime

Minister as a period of austerity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is another

instance  where  the Government has  been  using  public

funds  for  its own party purposes. We are  not  against

giving  decorations  to  people.  But  in  order  for  a

decoration  or medal to be accepted by the  people,  the

person  who  receives  it  must  have  contributed  some

substantial  service to the State, otherwise  the  medal

would be no more valuable ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> --- than the metal it is made of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in its last days of power, we see the Government coming out with emergency laws and by-laws, and putting forward new prizes for those who have helped the P.A.P. I understand that, in some cases, people did not want to take these prizes, because they did not want it to be known that they had taken sides,

or  they  did  not want to be in the bad  books  of  any

future  Government. I have no doubt that some  of  these

medals   were   given  to  those  who  have  contributed

meritorious service not to the State as such but to  the

P.A.P. There is one single instance where I wish to seek

clarification  from the Government.  I  remember  a  few

weeks  before  these medals were given,  the  Organising

Secretary  of the P.A.P., who is the Minister  for  Home

Affairs,   opened  a  P.A.P.  Branch   in   Jalan   Kayu

constituency, and in his speech he paid tribute and  was

grateful to one of the contractors - a famous contractor - building  lots  of houses in Sembawang and  Jalan  Kayu

area by the name of Mr Ang Oon Hwee, who had given  the

P.A.P. the branch premises in Jalan Kayu. Not many weeks

later after that, Mr Ang Oon Hwee got a medal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think the Member for Hong Lim  has  got

his facts wrong. He is referring to a wrong person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister and Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let the Prime Minister reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> May I clarify, please?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let the Prime Minister reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think he will have plenty of

time. May I first make my point? Mr Speaker, Sir, quite

rightly as the Member for Hong Lim says, these ought  to

be  given  to persons who have rendered service  to  the

State. He approved, when he was a Member of the Cabinet,

the establishment of these various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



orders  and  decorations, and  so  did  the  Member  for

Queenstown  when he was on the Government side.  Amongst

those  who  got  the meritorious service medal  are  two

members  of the Special Branch, Mr Ahmad Khan  and  Mr

Richard  Byrne Corridon. They did their work  well,  not

for the P.A.P., Mr Speaker. Sir. They were there before

the  P.A.P., they will be there after the 31st of August

when they will not be working for the P.A.P. at all, and

they  will  be working direct to Kuala Lumpur.  But  we,

nevertheless,  acknowledge their  valuable  services  in

tracking  down all the activities of vile and  evil  men

out  to destroy the State. So tot) Mr Koh Teck Kin, the

President  of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce,  and  Mr

Assomull. They are not P.A.P. members. Mr Speaker, Sir.

They  rendered valuable services as the leaders  of  the

communities  at  a Time when men who were  faint-hearted

ducked  for  cover before it was known that  the  battle

would  be  fought and won. They took a stand,  when  the

fight  for merger and Malaysia was on. So with  Mr  Abu

Bakar Pawanchee. He was there before the P.A.P. came in:

he  will be there after the next elections whether it is

the P.A.P. or any other Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Thomson, he lacks the guile. The

Three  Kingdoms method of the Member for  Hong  Lim.  He

must  read more of The Three Kingdoms. He is a  bit  too

obvious, trying to stir up trouble between Mr Kandasamy

and me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Well, you have trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed, we have trouble because we

stick to principles.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of information, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely, after this. Let me first

dispose  of the Member for Thomson before the  point  is

brought  home.  No Member of the Government,  whether  a

Parliamentary  Secretary,  a  Minister  or  a  Political

Secretary, got any decorations, because as a  matter  of

principle we felt that they are not eligible. Therefore,

Mr  Kandasamy, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, Mr Rahim Ishak  did

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



qualify. Whether they were or they were not, the  matter

does  not  arise.  But I say Mr Devan Nair  rendered  a

public  service,  having successfully  and  consistently

exposed  the duplicity of the Communists both  here,  in

Cairo,  in Moshi and a lot of other places besides,  and

will continue to do so. And I say the State of Singapore

owes  him  that  star. And let me tell  the  Member  for

Thomson  this, that Mr Devan Nair has got more iron  in

his  soul than the Member for Thomson. Twice he went  to

prison  for  long periods, and he has got  the  guts  to

stand up to fight for his beliefs. I hope the Member for

Thomson  will emerge as much a man of iron as Mr  Devan

Nair. Then he is in a position to deride Mr Devan  Nair

and  the medal which I think the State owed him, not for

what  he did for the P.A.P. but for what he did for  the

country  in exposing the Communist conspiracy  here,  in

Cairo,  Moshi and a lot of other places besides, and  he

will continue to do so to the great discomfiture of  the

Communists, all the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to

the  Prime Minister. First. I wish to clarify about this

person who gave a house in Jalan Kayu. Anyhow, it  is  a

Mr  Ang  who gave the house and it is the same Mr  Ang

who got the decoration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How many Mr Angs are there in

Jalan Kayu?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> There are two Mr Angs in Jalan Kayu

and the one who gave the house was Mr Ang Keong Lan and

the one who got the medal is also Mr Ang Keong Lan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the point of The Three Kingdoms, I must clarify

this.  It  is  true that I have read The Three  Kingdoms

very thoroughly, and because of that reason we have been

able to escape so far unscathed from the repression, the

oppressive methods, the cunningness and the ruthlessness

of  the  Prime  Minister, because he typifies  the  same

person   in   The  Three  Kingdoms,  Chou  Chou,   whose

characteristics  are  cunningness,  ruthlessness,  small

eyes and cruelty in the extreme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, as the political life of the Government is

coming to an end, it is apparently doing something which

is  very good at first sight. In 1962, on National  Day,

the  Government gave away quite a great number of  State

honours  and decorations but at that Time the number  of

recipients did not exceed 30. But this year,  all  of  a

sudden and out of the blue, the number increased to 424.

Does it mean that these people who have been given these

honours  did not give any service to the State in  1962?

Does it mean, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, that

these  people have done a great deal for the  Government

in 1963 and nothing in 1962? No, that is not the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the intention of the Government is to make use of these honours and decorations to achieve its political aim. Of course, we do not have any objection to those who have really rendered services to the State receiving State honours and decorations. But in the list of recipients made public by the Government, there is a great number of people who actually work for the

Government itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the Prime Minister visited the Sembawang constituency, there was a welcoming committee organised for this purpose and among the recipients of the State honours are members of this welcoming committee. One of them was the Chairman, Mr Yeo Kok Wah, and the other was a working committee member. For example, in Tam-pines, a recipient of the State honours

was  a member of the welcoming committee on the occasion

of a rural visit by the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, why

is it that the Prime Minister wants to do this? Well, it

is  all  because  he knows that in the near  future  the

P.A.P. will  have to face the judgment of  the  people.

That  is why it has to do these things to buy over  some

people in order to save its political life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister mentioned Mr Ko Teck Kin and says that he is not a member of the P.A.P. True, but we must not forget that the Vice President, Mr Yap Pheng Gek, was not given any honour or decoration. Why? Well, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



is  because he has crossed over to the M.C.A., and  that

is why the Government did not give him one. Mr Speaker,

I can assure this House that if Mr Ko Teck Kin had been

a  member  of the M.C.A., he, would not have been  given

any State honour or decoration. So all this goes to show

that  the intention of the Government in giving  honours

and  decorations  to  certain  people  is  for  its  own

political  end.  Mr  Speaker,  if  my  information   is

correct,  in  1962, the recipients of State honours  and

decorations   included  the  Vice  Chancellor   of   the

University of Singapore, Dr Sreenivasan. But he did not

accept  this honour. So we can see that it is  not  good

for  people  to  receive honours given  by  the  P.A.P.,

because  they know that by receiving them they  will  be

bought over by the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it grieves me to have to

berate Members on the opposite side. I often wonder  how

stupid  people can be. A policeman risked  his  life  to

save a child in a burning but and be has got a medal for

conspicuous gallantry. Only three awards have ever  been

given.  Two  police  officers  of  high  calibre  worked

ceaselessly to track the activities of vile and evil men

who  manipulated the persons who are now in Kuala Lumpur

and in other places of rest in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Ho See Beng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister : Ho See Beng contributed in no

small  measure in breaking up the Communist united front

and  their trade union organisation. [Laughter] Oh, yes,

let us not laugh. Let us be quite realistic, and let  us

admit that the fight goes on relentlessly. There are men

in the Army Services Union who are not P.A.P. - never have

been.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Admiralty civilian staff. They are

not  so simple. They stood up to the Communists and they

were  not  manipulated in the Communist united front  in

S.A.T.U. So I think they deserve honours. And I make  no

apologies  that Mr Devan Nair deserves  honour,  and  I

hope  that  if  there should be a subsequent  Government

which is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.,  he  will continue his good work, carry  on  the

battle  against the Communists and receive high honours.

Why  the  number? It took us four years to see  who  was

who. The Chief Architect of the Housing Board got a gold

medal for public administration. I think he deserves it.

So  does  the Acting Director of Primary Production  who

has  done  a  splendid job in the rural  areas - pig  stud

service,  chicken inoculation, ploughing  service,  tree

infection  service, educating, advising and helping.  He

was  there  before the P.A.P. He will be  there  if  the

P.A.P. is not in Government next year. [Interruption] He

was  there before the P.A.P. He will be there after  the

P.A.P. is gone. He deserves a gold medal. And I think it

is  only  churlish  silly men who  wish  to  bring  into

disrepute the whole of this Assembly as men who have not

got  the  stature and sufficient maturity to know  which

are  areas which should not be included in the political

arena.  It  is  foolish. About the Public Service  Star,

yes, there can be an argument. Yes, Mr Ko Teck Kin  got

a  Meritorious  Service Medal for  taking  a  stand  for

merger and Malaysia before the battle was fought and won

when it looked as if it could have been fought and lost.

And he would still have the Star if he joined the M.C.A.

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong of the Hakka Association got a Public Service Star, and he is a member of the M.C.A. We do not hold that against him. It is his wish, but he took a stand at the Time of the referendum when he joined 100 other associations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Under pressure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Under pressure? When Lim Ching

Siong  was  saying  at Hong Lim, and Lam  Tian,  another

M.C.A. man, came up to me in my conference room - recorded

on the tape in terror - what did he say? "Suan ching ching

suan. We will finish them. Clean up the thugs." Who  was

threatening whom? I say that these are men who  rendered

service to the State, to the democratic State, who stood

up  against  the Communists and we honour  them   - M.C.A.

regardless.  And if Mr Yap Pheng Gek deserves  one,  he

will receive one regardless of his being a member of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



the  M.C.A. And let me tell the Member opposite that  on

31st  of  August,  we are forging Malaysia  Medals.  The

Minister for Culture was suggesting that we should  have

lead ones for booby and name them. Those who fought  the

nation,  let  them  go down in posterity -   names  to  be

ashamed  of,  people who were manipulated into  fighting

national  unity,  manipulated until finally  exposed  as

puppets of outside forces - the Member for Queenstown, the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang. I make no apologies  for  not

recommending them for any Medals for Malaysia Day. And I

think  we  ought  to give serious consideration  to  the

Minister  for Culture's suggestion that we  should  have

lead ones to commemorate their stupidities and idiocies.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> All that the Prime Minister said merely

confirms  what  we said earlier on. We said  that  these

awards - citations - are being used for political  purposes.

Sir,  we  are  not  denying that  it  is  necessary,  in

principle,   for   an   administration   to    recognise

meritorious service. We have no objection, for  example,

to  the corporal that the Prime Minister quoted. If  the

Government is going to give citations to individuals for

having  performed  well  in the  political  arena,  then

surely  it  is  nonsense to use  public  funds  to  give

citations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P. wants to set up a P.A.P. Citations Fund

and give meritorious awards to P.A.P. personnel or other

people who are prepared to bend backwards to please  the

P.A.P.,  that  is their business. We have no  objection.

But  to  use  public money to give medals to people  who

fight ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- political opponents is another matter.

Sir,  by  Communists we know they refer to  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If it is not true, why not sue me

outside?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I have told the Prime Minister once before,

Sir. It is not for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



me  or for any person accused of being a Communist to go

to  court and prove that he is not a Communist.  It  the

Prime  Minister  has  the guts to  accuse  us  of  being

Communists or pro-Communists, then let him have the guts

to  charge  us in an open court and prove  that  we  are

Communists.  I  told the Prime Minister once  before  in

this  House.  I challenge him to take me  to  court  and

prove that I am a pro. Communist. He could not more. His

face  went red. And I tell him the same thing now. If  I

accuse  the Prime Minister of being a robber, surely  it

is not for the Prime Minister to go to court to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You say that outside and see what

happens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- disprove what I have said ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- though the institutions of law are

theirs. Sir, I have called the Prime Minister all  sorts

of  names outside. I am sure if he gets his boys in  the

Special  Branch  to play the tape recordings  that  they

make,   he  will  get  a  host  of  them.  If  not   for

parliamentary purposes, Mr Chairman, Sir, I would  list

them  out  here myself. He can take legal action  if  he

wants. As far as we are concerned, if the Prime Minister

calls us names, we could not care less. It does not make

an  iota  of difference. He wants to call us Communists,

pro-Communists,  cowards, chaps  who  have  no  courage,

unlike Mr Devan Nair. Incidentally, Mr Speaker, it  is

true Devan Nair was brave enough to go to prison once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Twice!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He was brave enough to go to prison twice,

but  he was not brave enough to face the possibility  of

going to prison a third time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ha, ha! Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister knows. It is no use

playing  hypocrisy. He knows the reasons why  Mr  Devan

Nair decided to be a stooge of his. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



reasons  are embarrassing to Mr Devan Nair. It  is  not

because  Mr Devan Nair is, a courageous man. Sir,  what

does  courage  mean?  According to the  Prime  Minister,

courage means you say yes to the Prime Minister. It does

not  need  courage to say yes to the Prime Minister.  It

takes courage to say no. I cannot put Mr Devan Nair  in

prison, but the Prime Minister can put me in prison.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no; come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He can.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He can. Sir, courage, bravery, a Government

which  has  the use of the police, all State  organs - are

they more courageous? Or is it the Opposition, which  is

being  consistently oppressed'? And yet we stand  up  to

fight them. Who has the courage?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their talk does not bother us. They can say what

they  like  to  say. Mr Chairman. We say  history  will

prove.  Five  years, ten years, we  like  to  see  these

courageous  men - the  Prime Minister,  the  Minister  for

Culture,  the Minister for Finance - we like  to  see  the

courage of these men here, including Mr Devan Nair.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Why ten

years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the future will prove that they are

merely  a passing force, while we are a permanent force,

because we represent the aspirations of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Cheers!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Cheer me, yes. I am gratified. The Prime

Minister cheers me. That is a fact. We say that so  long

as  we  do  not cheat the people, we do not distort  the

will and aspirations of the people, we shall continue to

be a permanent force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Go back to Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You hold elections first.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not think I need go into this

long  justification of why the Member for Thomson  is  a

brave  man,  after all, even though he has not  gone  to

prison  and Mr Devan Nair is a coward although  he  has

gone  twice. All I am interested in saying  is  that  he

glossed  over the point he set out first in the  attack,

that   this  was  one  of  the  P.A.P. instruments   of

manipulation. I indicated to him how people who  are  in

other political Parties have also been honoured. I might

as  well  add  that the Member for the Southern  Islands

knows many of these penghulus.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> They are not our members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Nor are they P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then he is a coward.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They are not P.A.P. I have shown

in  one instance how a man has been honoured even though

he  is  in an opposition camp -  a camp that I despise - but

he took a stand, and if this is for political reward for

services rendered to the democratic State, then  I  say,

yes, it is, but not for P.A.P. political party purposes.

If  they say we have not honoured those who work for the

Communists, I say quite right, why should we?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I ask the Member for Thomson to remember is this:

We  are as youthful as he is. We will last as long as he

lasts.  We will endure as long as he endures. And  never

make   the  grave  error  of  believing  that  we   lack

resolution  or iron in the soul. They melted away.  Some

Members on the other side are now less vociferous.  They

are   attending  to  all  their  private  duties.  Quite

rightly, I think they are intelligent men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They see that they were mistaken

about   this  howling  tempest - the  East  Wind   blowing

stronger  and stronger. Suddenly they found the  monsoon

has changed. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



East  Wind diminishing! So, instead of going out  sowing

wild cats, they are now nicely at home every evening, no

more  wild oats, no more midnight sessions, pumping each

ether  on Marxism-Leninism. They are safely at  home  in

case  any  questions are asked. And  I  say  that  is  a

sensible  man, although, mind you, he deserves  a  medal

for  all  this. Of course, there are some who feel  they

must   justify  their  mistakes  whatever   the   price,

otherwise  the world will laugh at them.  Some  of  them

find it difficult to sleep at night. They lose weight. I

cannot  say in any honesty that I have any sympathy  for

them,  but  I really feel sometimes that some  of  their

clothes  are a bit too big for them these days, and  for

obvious reasons. Where is all this talk of the masses on

our  side, the wrath of the people? We were supposed  to

be  on  the rum we were going to hide under tables;  the

masses would he looking for us; to beat us; to pulverise

us.  The imperishable strength of the working class! The

hammer  was  going to knock us all out. We opened  those

blank ballots. They saw it; we saw it. They were in  the

rural  areas. And I say we go out to meet them.  We  are

not  running away from anybody. They got the  blanks  in

the  rural areas through deceit - the big lie  repeated

by   mouth - which  we  at  that  Time,  in  the  time

available,   were  unable  to  counter   for   lack   of

communications - radio, Rediffusion, newspapers.  We  were

unable  to  reach the isolated village.  So  we  go  out

there. Run away from them? Never! Never make this error.

They  made  it  once already in 1961 that our  will  was

going  to  melt under the impact and the will  dissolved

away.  Do  not believe that. We are born and bred  here,

and  we  die here. I say that if you want to  make  this

into  a  Communist State, then it will be over  my  dead

body.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the

Prime Minister very cunningly evaded many questions.  He

mentioned  that the recipients of these awards  received

them because they are brave and resolute. They stand up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



for  their  opinions.  Mr Yeow  Kok  Hua, one  of  the

recipients,  was the chairman of a welcoming  committee.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this Mr Yeow Kok Hua was unknown  to

all  the  people  in Sembawang before. Even  during  the

referendum  they  did  not  come  out  to  support   the

Government's  merger proposals. Where is  their  courage

and bravery? Where is their achievement? His only merit

is that he was the chairman of a welcoming committee for

the  Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister went there,

he shook hands with him. In return for this service, the

Prime  Minister  gave him a medal.  The  Prime  Minister

mentioned why the people in Choa Chu Kang were not given

any medals. The answer is that there will not be any by-election in Choa Chu Kang. The Prime Minister knows that

in  the very near future there will be a by-election  in

Sembawang,   and,  therefore,  this  is  a   very   good

opportunity to buy over these people. Therefore, in  the

citations,  at  least  two members from  Sembawang  were

awarded  medals. Their only merit was that they went  to

welcome the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts are very clear. The Government's motive in giving these citations and awards is only to further their own political ends.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is guilty

of  repeating himself time and time again. Can he go  on

to something different?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

only wanted to point out to you that the answer given by

the Prime Minister a little while ago was only meant  to

evade  the  many  questions  raised  by  the  Opposition

Members, which were all based on facts.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite obvious

that  the  Barisan Sosialis do not quite understand  the

purpose  of these awards. They have every reason  to  be

opposed to the conferring of medals and awards on people

who  have shown that they are not Communists, that  they

are not prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



to be intimidated by the Communists or by their threats.

What  I  am  told  is that in some Communist  countries,

receiving honours is a dangerous thing, because  certain

writers and patriots get medals one day and the next day

they  vanish  from the scene. They are repudiated,  they

are  condemned. In fact, Sir, I am told  that  even  the

leader,  the  boss of the Communist Party who  conferred

honours on other people, like Mr Josef Stalin, you will

remember,  Sir,  he was honoured in the  mausoleum -   and

when somebody took over, his bones were disinterred  and

reburied elsewhere. At least in democratic countries  we

have no need to confer honours on people just because of

their  services to the Party. In fact, very few of those

who  are  members  of  the Party have  received  honours

because they are Party members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Devan Nair, for example, Sir, I think his

name  has  been  mentioned. Apart  from  being  a  trade

unionist,  he  is  a  member  of  a  number  of  Boards,

including the Adult Education Board - a kind of service

which  I do not think any member of the Barisan Sosialis

has  ever  rendered to the people. Their  only  kind  of

education  is  to  mislead young children,  to  mobilise

them, to participate in strikes, and riots, to use  them

as  cover for their own safety, to hide behind them.  At

least Mr Devan Nair, in addition to his service to  the

cause   of  democracy,  in  addition  to  exposing   the

Communists,  has also done a great deal to  educate  the

people.  And these are among his many other achievements

for which there will be citations, and so will there  be

citations also for the others who have received honours.

In  fact, when the citations are made, as far as I know,

there  is  no  reference to their contributions  to  the

P.A.P. All the references will be to their contributions

to  the  service  of the State, education,  welfare - and.

therefore,  I  would ask the Members of the  Barisan  at

least  not  to make these honours a matter for political

football  here.  And, Sir, if any  Member  even  of  the

Barisan   Sosialis  suddenly  decides  to   vacate   the

Communist camp ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He will get a medal!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- and come and fight for the cause

of  our country and not in the service of outside powers

as  traitors, then we may consider their names when  the

next  Honours List is drawn up and I am quite sure  they

will be included in the next Honours List.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we have seen in the newspapers

this  morning  that  the Foreign Ministers'  meeting  in

Manila  is already paving the way for a meeting  of  the

Heads of State. I do not know whether the Prime Minister

here  still  thinks his Malaysia will be  coming  on  so

nicely or not. But one thing is certain. If he wants  to

talk  so  much about blank votes and all that,  let  him

give the people a chance to decide in a true plebiscite,

as advocated in the Manila conference today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 21.*





<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Rajah and Tun Lim Yew Hock.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to know, Sir, what function our Trade

Commissioner's Office in London is having, and  what  is

the  Commissioner doing in the United Kingdom! How  does

he help Singapore in our trade?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The point I want to raise, Mr Speaker.

Sir,  is  whether  this Office would be necessary  after

Malaysia  has been set up. The Australians in  the  U.K.

have  Federal  and  State representation.  From  what  I

understand from some Australian representatives  whom  I

met  in  London when I was there last, they had come  to

the  conclusion that it was undesirable. I was wondering

whether thought has been given to whether we should have

both Federal representation in London after Malaysia and

State representation as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have given thought to this

matter,  and  as I referred the Member for Cairnhill  to

paragraph



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



5  of the White Paper, I similarly refer the Member  for

Farrer Park to the same paragraph, that it was agreed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Measures to protect the interest of Singapore trade

overseas  will include the establishment  of  a  section

within  any of the Federal missions as may he  necessary

to deal with trade matters of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jakarta and London are our two missions at the moment.

They  will continue after merger as part of the  Malayan

Embassy or of the Malayan High Commissioner's Office  in

London.  And,  in  fact,  in  the  case  of  the  London

representative,  it may well be that  his  duties  as  a

financial  officer of this Government may increase.  The

Crown  Agents have increased their charges for  handling

our matters, such as payment of pensions and hooking  of

passages and advertisements for consultants and  so  on.

We  have therefore terminated the services of the  Crown

Agents, and we are saving money. The Office in London is

now directly handling all payments of pensions, passages

and  other  cognate  matters.  The  Federation  External

Affairs   Ministry  may  well  decide  to  expand   this

particular    function    of   the    Singapore    Trade

Commissioner's  Office  to include  their  Crown  Agents

handling of matters too. The other function, of  course,

is  to  give  information that may  be  enquired  of  by

importers  and  exporters in London  and  general  trade

enquiries. We have adverted our minds to the possibility

of  getting  them completely absorbed in the  Federation

External  Affairs Ministry, but I think, for  the  first

phase,  we are convinced that we have sufficient special

interest   in  entrepot  trade  to  merit   a   separate

commercial  representative, or a Commercial  Attache  or

Consul, to look after our special interests. As  far  as

we  can envisage, there are four places where ultimately

we  may want to establish a section in the Malayan  High

Commissioner's Office or the Malayan Embassy abroad, and

they are Jakarta. London, Tokyo and New York.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the hon. Member for Queenstown wish

for a vote?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh indicated dissent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> I beg

to move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 24.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to have some information from the

Prime  Minister as to the exact position with regard  to

the  Malay  Settlement  at Kaki  Bukit.  First  of  all,

whether   there   are  any  more  lots   available   for

distribution to applicants; and, secondly,  whether  the

Ayer  Gemuroh  Malay Settlement will be proceeded  with,

and  similarly  with  the West Coast  Malay  Settlement.

These Settlements have been gazetted for quite some Time

now,  anti  I believe the Government have only proceeded

with  the  Kaki Bukit Scheme, and have not done anything

with  regard  to the Ayer Gemuroh Scheme  nor  the  West

Coast Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to raise on this

same  item  is with regard to the staff problem.  I  see

that  the  staff doing the work on the Malay Settlements

have  been  on a temporary basis for the last  three  or

four  years. I wonder whether it would not be convenient

both  for the Government and for the stall to have  them

put on a permanent basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, the Malay Settlements. I

think  the  Member  for  Geylang  Serai  is  aware  that

progress  has  been  made  in  three  out  of  the  four

Settlements that have been gazetted. The only one  where

progress  has  not been made is West Coast Road  because

the area has these squatters. At Kaki Bukit Phase 1, 282

lots  where allocated; in Phase 2, the area on the west,

with an estimated expenditure of $30,000, it is expected

that  50 allotments will he soon available; and in Phase

3,  the area to the north, on an expenditure of $400,000

there will be 376 lots available. In Sembawang, 108 lots

have  been  allotted on the 1st of June,  old  residents

occupying 24 lots. And in Phase 2, 68 lots will he  made

available.  At Ayer Gemuroh, an expected expenditure  of

$105,900 for constructing a sea wall and filling of  the

earth  has  been set aside and in due course allocations

will  be  made, although we are not quite sure just  how

many allotments there will be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai, I think, as the former Deputy Chief Minister in charge of lands and the S.I.T., understands the problem acutely. There are less and less lands available for the traditional Malay house in the urban areas. The traditional Malay house is one on stilts with a hit of

land  on  it for fruit trees and the rearing of poultry.

And  in  the  Geylang  Serai Scheme  we  are  trying  to

acclimatise  our  Malay population to flat-dwelling.  We

have succeeded in the case of the Police and the S.I.R.

where  large  blocks  of  flats are  allocated,  all  to

similar types of tenants in the same establishment,  and

they  seem to have adjusted very well. And we are trying

it  out  at Geylang Serai - there are two blocks,  one

block we are hoping will be completely for Malays in the

area, the other for the Chinese and the other races  who

were  displaced from the area as a result of the Geylang

Serai Scheme. And, with, I hope, the co-operation of all

Malay Members, if this scheme proves successful, then we

are  hoping in Phase 3 of the Kaki Bukit Scheme to  have

housing  flats  instead of the traditional  Malay  rumah

pondok. For, on the same land where you can put up, say,100

Malay  rumah in the traditional Malay  fashion,  no

less than 500 units of housing flats can be erected. And

it might be arranged to give them suitable plots of land

nearby for the rearing of poultry or the cultivation  of

fruit trees.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That really is the core of the problem. I think the

Member  for Geylang Serai must be honest and admit  this

publicly  that  there is no hope of  solving  the  Malay

housing problem, unless we push the Malays more and more

into  the  outer  areas where there is  no  electricity,

water,  bus  services, and proper roads.  Unless  we  do

that,  the alternative is to get them to live in  flats,

and I think it can be done, provided certain adjustments

are  made by them and by the Housing Board, so that  for

religious and other reasons. It may be necessary that  a

whole  flat is set aside for Muslims only; as the Member

for  Geylang  Serai suggested, a corner of  the  Geylang

Serai Market should he set aside for sellers of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



food prepared in the Muslim way, makanan halal. So these

adjustments  will  be tried, all with the  intention  of

trying  to  acclimatise the Malay kampong dwellers  into

the  urbanised conditions of Singapore. Whether we  like

it or nut, this is a relentless trend and the Malays, as

a  group,  either  fit  in  with  the  modernisation  of

Singapore  and  live in flats, as they are  successfully

doing  in the S.I.R. and in the Police quarters, or,  it

they  insist  on a piece of land around  the  house,  in

which  case,  our problems will continue to become  more

and  more difficult as they are pushed into the more and

more  remote areas. I do not think the Members  opposite

who  represent the Malay constituencies would like  that

to happen. The Member for the Southern Islands knows the

enormous  amount of effort and money that has gone  into

the Southern Islands. In Pulau Sudong, there is no water

supply.  We  have to bring water there.  More  and  more

fishermen  are  catching the same fish  population, and

more and more kelongs are trapping the same fish. So the

fishermen are getting less and less fish. Their children

have to go to school, It would be so much easier for all

of  us if they could come and live on the mainland.  But

for various reasons, they prefer to live in the Islands,

and  so  we try to make the adjustments. So it  is  with

Blakang  Mati, Sambu, Tekong, Bukom and a lot  of  other

places.  But  finally we have to face the  problem.  The

problem  simply  is, how do we help the whole  community

adjust  to the new problems? I would be grateful if  the

Member  for Geylang Serai would give us his co-operation

on this.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I am glad the Prime Minister has

given  us the assurance that one block of flats will  be

allotted to the Malays in the Geylang Serai Scheme.  But

I  would also like him to consider, in the case  of  the

second  block  of flats, where there will  be  vacancies

after  the  flats have been allocated to the  non-Malays

who  have  been  de-housed in the same area,  that  they

would be allocated to the Malays in the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is with regard to the West Coast Road.

He  said  that it was not possible to proceed  with  the

scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



because of the squatter problem. But, as I know  it,  it

is not so much a squatter problem as a swamp problem.  I

believe that if the Government are willing to spend some

money,  they could reclaim no less than about  fifty  to

sixty  acres  of  land in West Coast  Road  which  could

easily be allocated to Malay applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I raised was also with regard to

the temporary staff. They have been on a temporary basis

for  the  last three years, I think, and since  this  is

going  to  be a permanent feature of the administration,

would  it  not be wise for the Government to  place  the

officers on a permanent basis?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that the last point?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think eventually we will have to

face  up to this problem. Somebody has got to administer

these  Malay  Settlements and I think the existing  ones

will  continue, whatever happens, for a very long  Time,

and, sooner or later, we will have to decide whether  or

not  the establishment of one secretary, one Malay clerk

and  one Malay typist three of them could be put on  the

permanent establishment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that there are thousands of flats going up, but I notice that there is only a $220 increase as against last year for Lady Housing Visitors. I was just wondering whether we would not need more of these Lady Housing Visitors because of the number of flats that are going up now. I seek

information  as to how many ladies we already  have,  at

what salaries they are employed ----



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is given there --- four, in the third

column. It gives the number as four.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes. And what are their

qualifications  and their duties? I feel that  specially

trained personnel are required, because their duties are

very  important. In fact, they are there  to  see,  with

tact - it  is a very difficult duty to carry out - that  the

standards of living in the housing estates are what they

should  be and that the standards of the slums  are  not

brought  there,  and  to help the people  there  to  fit

themselves  into  the new pattern of  life,  as  against

their  old  pattern  of  life. For  instance,  desirable

community  living,  such  as consideration  for  others,

where  you  have to have more consideration  for  others

when  you  are living in a housing estate than when  you

are  living as squatters on a piece of land all on  your

own:   mutual   co-operation,   religious   and   racial

tolerance - all very important  - and all these will  have

to  be  very cleverly and very tactfully carried out  by

these  Lady  Housing  Visitors. I  feel  that  specially

trained personnel are required to carry out this job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am seeking information from the

Government    about    their    salaries    and    their

qualifications, and also whether we would not need more

of them in view of the fact that more and mere flats are

coming up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Mountbatten has confused the Housing  Board

with  the  Land Office. The Land Office Housing Visitors

look  after  some 2,300 State-reverted properties  whose

leases have fallen in, and their duty is to see that the

T.O.L.s which are issued after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



the  leases  have been exhausted are not transferred  or

otherwise abused pending demolition and rebuilding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems which the Member for Mountbatten has

quite  rightly  raised in respect of the re-conditioning

of  attitudes and patterns of behaviour really arise  in

the  case of the Housing Board where, as she has pointed

out,  more and more such officers are being employed  as

larger and larger estates are developed.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. The principle is the same. Perhaps

we can discuss the principle.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, both my amendments are on

transport  and travelling. I notice that under  Head  8,

subhead  5,  and under Head 9, subhead 7, the  Transport

and  Travelling allowances have been reduced.  If  I  am

wrong,  I  hope the Government will correct  me,  but  I

presume  that "transport" means locally incurred  during

the  course of duty, and "travelling" probably  includes

overseas travels to attend study courses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



conferences  and so on, in connection with the  work  of

the officers. I was just wondering why the decrease?  Is

it  because  the  cost of transport has  come  down;  or

because lower rates of allowances are now given to civil

servants;  or, if it does include travelling abroad  for

studies  and  conferences, whether fewer  personnel  are

being sent abroad?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 5."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over amendment (1) in Head 9 and

the amendment in Head 11.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the answer is that last year,

when  the  Estimates  provided for $20,000,  the  actual

expenditure was only $17,473. This is all local  travel,

not  foreign  travel,  and the  Treasury  has  therefore

considered that the estimate this year should he reduced

to  what is expected to be a more realistic estimate  of

$18,600.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does that apply to Head 9?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 9, amendment (1) . Head 11 has no

reduction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The same explanation applies.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Am I right then in assuming that

the rates of allowance remain the same?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, that is so.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Teng Kian.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. have always claimed that they are

honest  and sincere and that the  departments under  them can run smoothly

and efficiently. It was  so when the P.A.P. came to power,

but it is not so now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Land Office is one of the

worst of all the Government departments. The poor people

always  go  to the department to seek help in  order  to

solve  their  problems, but when they  go  there,  their

problems  are always unsolved. There are many  instances

which  can he quoted. When they go there, their problems

are  not solved; they always see their Assemblymen.  But

if   their  Assemblymen  happen  to  be  the  Opposition

Assemblymen,  their  problems still  cannot  be  solved,

because    their   Assemblymen   are   the    Opposition

Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to quote a few examples that affect the

lives of the people directly. According to information I

have  received, I know that there is a committee to deal

with  the  transfers  of  T.O.L.s.  and  this  Committee

consists   of   three  Parliamentary  Secretaries:   the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for   Home

Affairs,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Prime

Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for National Development. If this Committee consists  of

only  three Parliamentary Secretaries of the Government,

I  wonder  whether it is fair to the people,  especially

those  people living in the rural areas who  oppose  the P.A.P.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You oppose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the transfer of

the  T.O.L.s is very important. As you know, the  people

living  in the kampongs, especially the old men and  old

women,  because they are afraid something may happen  to

them,  so  they want to transfer their T.O.L.s to  their

children. If that person first goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



to  seek  help  from the Opposition Assemblyman,  and  a

P.A.P.  Member  or P.A.P. Assemblyman  knows  that  this

person  goes  to  see that Opposition  Assemblyman,  his

application will not be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask the Government to make

sure is that, as you know, Sir, on Crown land people are

not  allowed  to build two houses in one  lot.  But  the

Government must be aware that the people living  in  the

kampongs  are  usually poor and their  families  usually

live  in  the same place. Because they cannot build  two

houses  they  must  be allowed to extend  their  houses.

Usually their application for building two houses cannot

he approved, but the application for an extension of the

house  is  usually not approved very quickly.  It  takes

months  to  approve the application for an extension  of

the  house.  I hope the Government in future  will  take

steps quickly and not to delay the application for  many

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to seek clarification from the

Government, concerns boundary disputes. In kampong areas

many   people  have  boundary  disputes  because   their

boundary  stones  have been lost. Because  of  this  the

people ask the Government to go there and re-survey  the

land. Before the Government resurvey the land, they want

to  charge a fee which the poor people cannot afford.  I

hope  the Government in future will not charge  any  fee

because  that  is Crown land, and the responsibility  of

the  Government  is  to see that  there  is  no  quarrel

between two families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth matter I want to ask the Government to help

the  people  is this. There are many people, especially

the Malays, who have illegal houses built on Crown land.

These  people live on Crown land for many,  many  years,

and  suddenly they receive notices asking them  to  move

from their land. The Government offer no alternative  to

these  people.  I  hope  when the Government  ask  these

people  to demolish their houses they will offer them  a

place to settle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Punggol wish to add

anything? Perhaps a short speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

know whether the P.A.P. Government remember that in 1959

during  the general election one of the election pledges

concerned this matter - that the P.A.P. would give special

consideration to the allocation of land for farming  and

rearing of poultry to the rural people. Four years  have

passed  since then. But we have not seen the  fulfilment

of  this  election  pledge. I would  like  to  find  out

whether it is the Government's intention to fulfil  this

pledge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, the Member for Changi. I am

afraid that the points made by the Member for Changi are

so  nebulous  that I am unable to put my finger  on  his

complaints.  He makes a wild allegation  that  the  Land

Office  is  the most inefficient of all the departments.

He  does not set out any particular instance, or set  of

instances  which justify his making such an  allegation.

He lists out his complaint No. 1 as the inability of the

Land Office to deal with Assemblymen all equally because

Temporary  Occupation  Licences  are  dealt  with  by  a

Committee   in   which  there  are  three  Parliamentary

Secretaries,  but he forgot to mention  that  there  are

also  three  officials on the same Committee. Opposition

Assemblymen, such as he, are stymied in their efforts to

get  things  done. Sir, I am glad that  the  Member  for

Changi  can  only  cite  this  as  his  illustration  of

maladministration.  The  whole purpose  of  putting  the

three Assemblymen in charge of the T.O.L.s was to remove

the  stigma that there was some funny business going  on

with  regard  to T.O.L.s. The only thing  is  that  they

could be influenced in their duties for a consideration.

Therefore,  every T.O.L. goes through this Committee  of

three  officials and three Parliamentary Secretaries  in

order to protect the officials. If they are doing right,

I  can  assure the Member for Changi that  there  is  no

reason whatsoever why anybody who is in the right should

ever require his services. I can also assure him that if

they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



in  the  wrong,  his services will not  help  them.  For

instance,  building  two houses on the  same  T.O.L. is

something  which  is wrong. By the very  nature  of  the

T.O.L.,  it is implicitly stated that the land would  be

required in the immediate future for public use. And the

more families you allow on the land, the greater will be

the  responsibility of the State in re-housing them. For

every  public project which has to be preceded  by  land

clearance means a re-settlement programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other complaint was, and I do not know why he

should particularly mention Malays, because I think  the

Chinese  and  Indians are equally at fault  in  building

unauthorised houses on Crown land. If the land  bailiffs

are  not swift enough in their detection, the houses  go

up   in   one   night   and  are  immediately   occupied - [Interruption] - old houses. The Member for Changi  knows

well  that  there is a Committee which  sat  on  it.  We

decided in 1061 that all houses up to a certain date  in

1960 would be allowed, and as from that date we issued a

warning  that  houses  put  up  would  be  struck   down

immediately.  All  houses up  to  that  date  have  been

allowed.  I cannot remember now off-hand that particular

date,  but  the  Member for Changi participated  in  the

deliberations in which I took the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> 1st April, 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> 1st April, 1960, says the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  He

has  a  good memory for these matters. We have a  scheme

whereby we enforce savings to help them in resettlement.

They  pay  a  small  sum of money as rent.  They  pay  a

slightly  larger sum as deposit, which will be  returned

to  them when they are resettled, an enforced saving  to

ensure  when resettlement takes place that not  all  the

burden of resettlement is en the State. I really do  not

understand the Member for Changi. He really has  got  to

make  the  grouse, but I do hope that he would  try  and

justify  his allegations, if he were to choose  to  make

sweeping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



allegations  like maladministration in the  Land  Office

and that it is the worst department of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Punggol. Sir, I will be quite frank

about  this.  Two Committees have sat on this,  and  the

problem was - as you know. Mr Speaker, we brought this

out  in  the last debate - how to fit the law into  the

realities  of  the situation. A man is in occupation  of

land,  like  a  rubber estate. The  owner  is  still  in

occupation  of the trees and he has got his  workers  to

tap  them,  but the squatter uses the land for  chickens

and  other  things.  I am afraid right  up  to  now  the

S.A.G.'s  department  has not  been  able  to  devise  a

concept in law whereby possession is with two persons at

the  same Time. Possession is with the owner because  he

is  still  tapping.  The squatter is  also  in  physical

possession as licensee. But that really does  not  salve

the  problem. If you try and give to the tenant  or  the

licensee  the  tenancy of the place, then the  owner  is

debarred  from occupancy: in other words, he  no  longer

taps  the rubber. Then the rent must go up to take  into

account  the fact that the tapping of rubber is lost  to

the  owner.  But  if  the tenant cannot  pay  that  rent

because he does not know how to tat the rubber and  make

money on it, then the thing ends in a stalemate. Here is

a  concept  of  law of the absoluteness   - of  possession

meeting the technical problem of joint possession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the owner who has his rubber tappers

tapping and the squatter who has his chicken run in  one

corner  of  the estate and uses a large section  of  the

estate for the feeding of his chickens and ducks. It may

well  be  that we may ultimately have to resolve  it  by

creating a new creature in the law - a tenancy which has

not got absolute possession. That I do not know - I do not

want  to  go into the intricacies of it. The problem  is

there  and  I raise the problem. All I can say  is  that

legally  a solution is not at present apparent. We  have

done what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



we  think is the best in the circumstances, namely, hold

the status quo until we find the problem to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem which I would like to mention and to

which again we have not found the problem is the sale of

flats.  We  want to work out a scheme whereby  not  only

will  the  Housing  Board  build  flats  but  they  will

subsequently sell these flats. The question is:  do  you

sell  air  space  or do you sell to all the  people  one

block  of flats, who jointly own the floor space of  the

ground  floor,  and build upwards? Or do they  own  that

particular  sector  of the air space above  the  ground?

This  solution has been found in different countries  in

different  ways. In certain continental  countries,  the

solution  is to sell air space: in other words,  if  the

building  comes down, then the tenant of that particular

floor still owns that air space and provided you can get

the  co-operation of the other tenants,  you  can  build

back with the same air space ---

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 9 - Planning. Amendment (1)* is not being moved. Mrs Seow, amendment (2).



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  Amendment (1), standing in the name of Mrs Seow Peck Leng, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7.

<hr size="2" noshade>







<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it says here - Preparation of Master Plan

Documents. I do not quite know whether it is preparation

of  the  Master Plan Documents based on the  old  Master

Plan  or  whether  it is intended to revise  the  Master

Plan. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



I  would like to draw the attention of the Government to

this  fact, that if there is to be revision, which  must

take place sometime or another, then it should take note

that  the  old system on which the Master Plan has  been

worked  is  not  practical  these  days.  I  refer,  for

instance, to certain areas where it is insisted that  to

build  a  house  in that area, you must have  a  minimum

space of land as the surrounding houses. In some areas,

Sir, which are so-called first-class areas, people built

houses  on one acre, two acres, at a time when land  was

about  10, 20, or 50 cents a square foot. Today, in  the

same  areas,  the land is about 2, 3, 4 or 5  dollars  a

square foot, and it is no longer possible for people  to

build houses on such big pieces of land. Because of  the

scarcity  of  land  in Singapore and  also  because  the

concept  of building skywards has been accepted  by  the

people  nowadays. I think the Government should  have  a

new  system of basing their decision on how big a  space

of   land  it  should  be.  In  some  cases,  Sir,  this

insistence  has made it impossible for that area  to  be

developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out, and give as an example, one

area  which  I  know of where it has made it  physically

impossible to develop that place. I will give this as an

example because I feel that as the Housing Board  builds

more  and more flats, this problem is going to  crop  up

more  and  more. One end of Ridout Road is a first-class

bungalow  area where houses have been built on  one  and

two  acres  of  land. The other end of  Ridout  Road  is

within  hearing distance of Queenstown. It is impossible

to  develop  the land there because nobody is  going  to

spend  $200,000 on land alone to build a bungalow  which

is within hearing distance of third-class flat buildings

like those built by the Housing Board. Therefore, it  is

causing stagnation there. As I have said, more and  more

Housing  Board  houses are coming up and more  and  more

areas  are  similarly  affected, and  I  feel  that  the

Government  should look into that when they  revise  the

Master Plan and see that certain areas are not being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



prevented from developing because of impractical laws

that are being insisted on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, the

purpose of the preparation of the Master Plan Documents.

They  are  for  a revised Master Plan and also  for  the

written  statement which accompanies the Master Plan.  I

think  the problems raised by the Member for Mountbatten

really   turn  upon  the  question  of  density   limit.

Revisions have taken place, and I myself must say that I

am  very dissatisfied with the existing law because when

we  allow density to increase, the land owner profits by

the  increase  in density and immediately puts  up  more

housing  units  on  the  same  piece  of  land,  thereby

increasing traffic and other problems. The price of  the

land  also goes up because more can be built  on  it.  A

social  problem  is created, a burden which  has  to  be

borne  by the State at large - traffic, utilities  and  so

on. I am seriously considering, when altering densities,

at  the same time to put a premium on the alteration  of

densities to pay for all the runabouts and the  flyovers

that will be necessary in order to keep up the same rate

of  flow  of  traffic with the increase  in  density  of

population  allowed on various pieces  of  land.  I  can

assure  the Member for Mountbatten that this  matter  is

receiving attention. The only problem is that there  are

no  easy  precedents  that we can  follow.  The  English

practice  here, on which most of our planners have  been

educated,  is unsatisfactory because of the sanctity  of

property.  If  density goes up, the land  owner  gets  a

profit  on  it.  But I do not think  that  that  is  the

principle which should guide us because the profit  that

the land-owner makes can only become possible because of

the  burden  which the State has to carry  with  heavier

density.  Therefore, I think it is only  fair  that  the

land-owner  should not altogether derive profit  out  of

increasing density which we may ultimately have to allow

in  many  of the suburban areas which the hon. Lady  has

pointed  out. It may have cost a few cents a  few  years

ago,  a  decade or two decades ago, but it is now  being

sold at dollars per square



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



foot.  I  myself am not prepared to say that we  have  a

ready-made solution, but I am quite prepared to consider

any  practical  proposition.  I  think  it  has  to   be

approached  radically from the point of view of  society

as  a  whole,  not the point of view of the sanctity  of

property. And once we accept that the standpoint is  the

benefit of society as a whole and not the benefit of the

individual  owner, then the whole approach changes, and

it means, of course, a basic alteration in our land laws

and rates of compensation.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

point out, before I withdraw my amendment, that I am not

interested in the individual or owner or the sanctity of

property,  as  has  been  spoken  about  by  the   Prime

Minister. But I am interested that certain areas  should

not be prevented from developing. It has been brought to

my attention that certain areas have been prevented from

developing   because  of  impossible   requirements   of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Lady has said something and she

cannot  withdraw if what she has said calls for a reply.

Does it call for a reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I do not think I, can allow

that  to  pass. From Time to Time allegations have  been

made  against  the Planning Department and  I  think  we

cannot  allow  these  allegations to pass  unchallenged.

They  have to be investigated because, if they are found

to  be true, then obviously misdemeanour is going on and

there  is  an abuse of power. But what often happens  is

that  a  land-owner's  interest is  not  necessarily  in

coincidence with the planner's interest. The planner  is

interested  in certain deployment of use of land-varying

densities,   green   belt,  suburban  areas,   lay-outs,

roundabouts  and  pieces of land. Whether  it  is  worth

thousands or tens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



of  thousands  of  dollars depends upon  whether  it  is

classified as a green belt or a heavily built-up area or

is meant for suburban terrace houses and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell the Member for Mountbatten that one of the

acute problems is that developers like to find the  easy

way  out - ribbon building. As a road is hit through, they

like  to  build along the road. That is the easiest  way

out.  But  that is not the planner's way of solving  our

housing problem, and often we do not allow it. We say if

you  want to develop, then these are the conditions.  It

may  be  that property and other sociological conditions

have  not reached that point where development can  take

place in housing estates. But that does not mean that we

should  allow  ribbon  building.  I  do  not  know  what

specific  instances  the Lady has in  mind,  but  I  can

assure  her that I am fully alive to the massive  powers

of  the  planner  and he has a committee which  includes

members of the professional organisations interested  in

planning - association  of  architects  or  society  of

architects,  structural  engineers - not  the  ratepayers.

There   is  a  balancing  of  interests  and.  I  hope,

sufficient checks and counter-checks to prevent  anybody

from  getting his way, and certainly to ensure that  the

planner  (1)   discharges his duties in an unbiased  way,

(2)   is also protected from malicious criticism when any

particular  group of property owners do  not  get  their

way.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to make

it clear that I am not accusing the department at all of

being  biased  or of malpractice, as the Prime  Minister

seems to think. No. I was just pointing out that certain

human  elements might have been overlooked and too  much

of  the theory and rules apply. I am just bringing  this

to  the notice of the Government so that when the Master

Plan  is  being  revised, these matters will  be  looked

into. I am not accusing anybody of malpractice or bias.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 9 be

reduced by $100.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last general election, the P.A.P. promised

that  it would go ahead with the revision of the  Master

Plan and the P.A.P. has been in office for four years. I

would  like  to ask whether it is able to  complete  the

revision of this Master Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this: I would like the Prime

Minister to note that applicants in the rural areas will

have  to go through many governmental departments before

their applications can be approved. Sir, I will ask  the

Prime  Minister  whether and how he can  expedite  their

applications and to wipe out any malpractices, if any.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Member for Farrer Park like to

say just a few words before the time expires?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The only point I wish to ask the Prime

Minister  is  whether he expects the completion  of  the

second  Master Plan within the year, so that  objections

could  be heard and the whole thing finalised. A  second

Master  Plan gazetted as such could have been  completed

within  the year. That is the only question  I  wish  to

ask.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

guarantee that it will be done within the year.  It  may

well  be  that we may have to ask for a further  revote.

But  I think the Member for Serangoon Gardens could  not

have been listening to what I was telling the Member for

Mountbatten. There is constant alteration going on  with

the Master Plan - revisions of density, changes in plan to

face realities - and that is the reason for asking for the

vote  of  $20,000  for the printing of this  new  Master

Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his other scandalous allegation, that is exactly

what   I  have  said.  If  they  keep  on  making  these

allegations,  in  all fairness, we have  to  investigate

them,  because  it  may  well be  that  there  are  land

bailiffs who have abused their position, particularly as

we have known in the past



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



of  their  overlooking unlawfully built houses on  Crownland.  If  you can get a land bailiff to ignore  illegal

building  for  48  hours, you  can  get  a  family  into

residence.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you can get a family into residence, then the

social  blackmail starts. He says, "I dare you  to  move

me,  my  children, my family. This is all I have got  in

the world. I am squatting here. Now lift me." This is  a

serious problem. Hence, from time to time over the  last

few years, we have done regular switches, as they do  in

the  Customs, so that nobody really gets to settle  down

into a routine and then begins to take short cuts in his

duties.  As  against that, of course,  is  the  constant

problem of the man not really knowing his area.  If  you

have  too  many  switches, the man never really  becomes

familiar with the locality he is in charge of.  He  does

not  know  the back-lanes and the by-lanes. The  various

bits and pieces and illegal buildings can well be put up

and  occupied  and the tenant securely ensconced  before

this  has come to the notice of the Land Office.  But  I

have  said  that  all these allegations  of  malpractice

arise  out of T.O.L.s. For that reason, we have  put  up

this  Committee  of three Parliamentary Secretaries  and

three officials, the idea being to see that nobody sells

or  transfers T.O.L.s which are not supposed to be  sold

or transferred; and that nobody puts up another house on

the  same T.O.L., thereby increasing the burden  on  the

Government  of  subsequent resettlement. His  colleague,

the  Member  for Changi, condemns this Committee.  Quite

forgetting  my  reply to his colleague, the  Member  for

Changi, he said that the land bailiffs are corrupted and

that  we  should look into the matter. This  is  exactly

what  we are doing. And when we do look into the matter,

and we are straight, his colleague was not satisfied. So

I   do  implore  him  to  pay  some  attention  to   the

proceedings  that  have  just  taken  place  before  his

questions arrive; at least he can follow up the argument

instead of having to regurgitate the same old facts in a

new form.

the problem of the Singapore River will very soon be the

responsibility of the Singapore Port Authority. In fact,

I  believe  that at the First Reading of  the  Singapore

Port  Authority  Bill, Members would be aware  that  the

Port Authority will have jurisdiction over the Singapore

River.  Now, from my knowledge up to date, it  has  been

concluded  by a committee of experts that  it  would  be

very  dangerous  to  dredge the  Singapore  River  to  a

greater  depth  than  what is already  being  done.  The

reason  is  that  there  is a possibility  that  further

dredging  will  cause  the walls of  the  embankment  to

collapse. This, of course, would be to the detriment  of

those  who are using the Singapore River as a  place  of

trade. However, this problem will be studied in relation

to  the  possibility  of extending other  parts  of  the

Singapore   Harbour  for  lighter  trade.  Whether   the

Singapore  River  itself  can be  expanded  to  increase

lighter trade I cannot say at this moment. All I can say

is that the overall problem of increasing the facilities

of  the  lighter trade will be studied in due course  by

the Singapore Port Authority when it is formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 19 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the P.A.P. came into office, every one in Singapore thought that it would bring about a better life for them. The Vehicles Registration Office has close relation with the people of Singapore, and the staff employed by this office are also having this sort of hope. At the moment, there are many cars which are emitting smoke. To whom do these cars belong? I can say

they  belong mostly to the poorer people and also  those

who own taxis. If they do not have money to buy cars, of

course, most of their cars will be emitting smoke.  When

they receive summons, the car owners will be fined,  say

$20, even in the case of a first offence. This will be a

great burden on people who own such cars. I do not  know

how  the Government will treat the larger vehicles owned

by other bodies or Europeans, e.g., the S.T.C. How is it

that  the  Government  is  not taking  the  same  action

against   cars,  vehicles  or  buses  owned  by  foreign

capitalists?  Instead the Government  has  taken  action

against the cars owned by our poor people here.  To  the

poor people, of course, $20 means a lot. But $20 to  the

foreign  companies,  who own big vehicles,  is  a  small

amount. They can pay up to $200 or even more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fines imposed upon taxi drivers should also be reduced

to,  say, $2. In the P.A.P. pamphlet, that is The  Tasks

Ahead,  at  page  5,  it is stated that  the  people  of

Singapore  are mostly poor. They support us not  because

we have talents among us. They support us because of our

principle of equality to all. I would like to point this

out.  Since all the friends and relatives of the  P.A.P.

have  deserted the P.A.P. it is now trying to intimidate

the  people. I would not like to waste any more Time  of

this  Assembly. But I would like to point out  one  more

thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car park attendants were formerly P.A.P. members.

They  had been recommended for this type of work by  the

P.A.P. These people have a conscience. They do not  like

to  toe the P.A.P. line. Now the P.A.P. is sacking every

one  of them, but not because they have offended against

any  regulations. They merely receive notices  from  the

authorities terminating their services within 24 hours.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what is stated in The Tasks Ahead, the so-called equality to all is a far cry from this principle.

Of  course,  these people do not like to become  running

dogs  of  the  P.A.P., and because  of  this  they  were

sacked.  The  P.A.P.'s way of doing things  is  a  great

threat to the staff of Government departments because if

they do not toe the P.A.P. line, they would be sacked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is applying psychological pressure on these

people so that they are under mental torture. So I  hope

that the P.A.P. could give up this sort of practice  and

not  try  to  put the people under fear of losing  their

bowl of rice. Formerly the P.A.P. asserted that it would

do  all  sorts  of things for the workers and  the  poor

people. But what do we see these days? I ask the  P.A.P.

not  to resort to these practices again. In the past the

P.A.P. said that it wanted to protect the interests  of

the  workers. This has been one of its slogans. But  now

this has been seen through by the people. The P.A.P. is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



not  looking  after the interests of  the  workers.  For

example,  the  interpreters of Assembly  House  are  not

being paid during tea and dinner breaks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am surprised how the

interpreters of the Assembly House have come  under  the

Head Vehicles Registration. They come under Legislature.

And  whether they are paid during tea breaks or  not,  I

really do not know: I suppose they are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

just  giving you an example to show that the  P.A.P. is

not looking after the interest of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. But that does not arise under

Vehicles  Registration.  I think  the  hon.  Member  has

mentioned  car park attendants, and he could concentrate

on the car park attendants, if he likes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you very much for

your  advice. Mr Speaker, I am saying that I  hope  the

P.A.P. should give up the unreasonable treatment that it

gives  to  the people and the workers. There  should  be

some  reasonable treatment. For example,  the  car  park

attendants are actually making money for the Government,

amounting to $1.2 million a year, but their pay is  very

small compared to the amounts that they can earn for the

Government.  In addition to their small  pay,  they  are

subjected to threats by the Government. So I say this is

very unreasonable.

Speaker can be addressed by name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, many

car  park  attendants have had their services terminated

just because they are against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P.  Anyone  who  now  wants  to  be  a  parking

attendant  must pass an examination set  by  the  P.A.P.

committee.  This examination is very simple:  (1)   you

must be a P.A.P. member or you work in a P.A.P. branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Bluff.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Say that again.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Many instances can be quoted, Sir.

When we quitted the P.A.P., members who are against  the

P.A.P. were  expelled  from  their  work  as  car  park

attendants. Sir, this is very, very dishonest.  How  can

you  say that a person who is against the P.A.P. cannot

be  a parking attendant? The policy of the P.A.P. now is

that those who are against the P.A.P. must starve; or if

you want to work in the Government departments, you must

either be a P.A.P. member or working in the branches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I will deal first with

the point raised by the Member for Moulmein on penalties

imposed  upon  owners of vehicles which  emit  offensive

smoke.  The Member for Moulmein surely must ask  whether

we  should enforce laws that are for the benefit of  the

public  or  do  not enforce laws at all. Everybody  will

agree that vehicles which emit offensive fumes from  the

exhaust are a danger to public health. In fact,  one  of

the  things which we wish to prevent in Singapore is  to

allow  this city to degenerate into a smoke-filled town.

It  is  well known that fumes from incomplete combustion

of petrol can give rise to offensive chemicals which, if

breathed  in  for a long Time, may be a  cause  of  lung

cancer;  just  as it is very much a possibility  that  a

person  who  keeps  on smoking a very  large  number  of

cigarettes and inhaling the smoke may suffer  from  lung

cancer,  it is in the interest of public health that  we

are  enforcing  this regulation so as to make  the  city

clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolute nonsense for the Member for Moulmein to

say  that in enforcing this law, we are making the  poor

people suffer. In the first instance, poor people do not

own motor cars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



You  can hardly say that Members of the Barisan who  are

sitting opposite us today arc poor when they have  motor

cars.  And  if  their motor cars should  emit  offensive

smoke,  I  have no doubt that complaints will be  lodged

with  the Registrar of Vehicles and lie will take action

accordingly. However, I do not think it is the intention

of  the  authorities to impose a fine on all and  sundry

simply  for the pleasure of collecting money from owners

of  vehicles who are guilty of this offence. Usually, in

the first instance, a warning is given but in most cases

this  warning is not heeded and, therefore, more drastic

action has to be taken. It is also incorrect 10 say that

S.T.C. buses are exempted from this regulation. The  law

is  applicable to every vehicle. Any person who  reports

on  such  and such a vehicle, whether it be a privately-owned  vehicle or whether it be a taxi or  a  bus,  will

find  that the R.O.V. will investigate the case and  the

owner  of  the  vehicle  will be asked  to  produce  his

vehicle  and  tests  will be made  to  see  whether  the

allegation  is  true  that  offensive  smoke,  which  is

detrimental to public health, is being emitted by such a

vehicle.  However,  Members  will  agree  that   it   is

necessary now and then to enforce this regulation. These

regulations  are  not new regulations  which  have  been

introduced  by the P.A.P. Government. These  regulations

have  been  in  existence ever  since  the  Registry  of

Vehicles  was  formed.  It is necessary  in  the  public

interest that these regulations must be enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the complaint by the Member for Moulmein and the

Member  for  Changi that car park attendants  are  being

dismissed simply because they are not P.A.P. members,  I

must  say  that  that  is an utterly  irresponsible  and

mischievous charge. Car park attendants are  engaged  by

the City Council Committee, and they are taken on not on

account of their party affiliations. I am quite sure the

Member  for Moulmein will know that many of the existing

car park attendants do not belong to the P.A.P. He ought

to  know,  because obviously his keen interest  in  this

subject  year by year should show that many of  the  car

park attendants are his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



personal friends. Or would he say that at one time  when

he  was  in  the Ministry of Labour (was  it?),  he  was

responsible for introducing these very same persons into

the Registry of Vehicles?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will let the House know that some of these car park

attendants   had   been  dismissed  or  their   services

terminated on very unsatisfactory service. I can cite  a

number   of  instances.  For  example,  some  car   park

attendants  apparently have a hatred for motorists,  and

one  of  their  ways  of venting  their  hatred  on  the

motorists is to make false reports.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again car park attendants have been making

false  reports  to  the Registrar of Vehicles  that  the

owner  of  such and such a car had not paid his  parking

fee.  When  the report is received by the  Registrar  of

Vehicles it is natural that his first action is to issue

a  summons to the owner of the car; the owner of the car

appears  in  Court,  and when investigations  are  fully

made,  it  is found out that the car park attendant  had

been  telling  a lie. This is one example  of  car  park

attendants  not doing their duty; there are  others  who

have  been  dismissed on account of their  laziness.  We

have  received  many complaints from  motor-car  drivers

that they have been kept waiting for a considerable time

before  a car park attendant comes to issue them with  a

parking ticket, although the car park attendant was only

a  few  yards  away.  Any  car  park  attendant  who  is

dismissed  is  usually asked for  an  explanation  by  a

Disciplinary  Committee consisting of  officers  in  the

City  Council.  This  Committee  investigates  all   the

charges made. There arc parking supervisors who do their

rounds  to  watch  the  work of the parking  attendants.

Sometimes,  they receive reports from motorists  on  the

behaviour  of  certain parking attendants and  all  this

comes before the Disciplinary Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 172 parking attendants at the moment and so

far,  of  this  number, only 25 have had their  services

terminated. It can therefore be seen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



that  there  has  been  no  spite  vented  on  car  park

attendants on account of their political affiliations. I

personally  have very little intimate knowledge  of  the

political  thinking or the political prejudices  of  the

car  park attendants. I do not see them at all.  And  25

termination  of services out of a total of 172  is  very

small  indeed. That is a number which will be in keeping

normally  with  dismissals concerned with unsatisfactory

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also add that besides car park attendants, we

have also postmen who are employed at a lower level, and

any termination of service or dismissal of a postman  is

decided  by a Disciplinary Committee which includes  the

head of the Department and sometimes this goes up to the

P.S.C. level.  In the case of the car park  attendants,

the termination of their service is closely examined  by

a  Committee  of officers. As Minister, I  have  nothing

whatsoever  to do with their termination of  service.  I

must  once again refute the lie of the Member for Changi

that  a  car park attendant must be a Branch member,  or

must  be - what is it?  - a member of the P.A.P. in order

to be employed. It is all utter rubbish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  must be aware that the termination of services

of  the  parking attendants took place after we  quitted

the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is quite nonsense to say, Mr

Deputy  Speaker, that the termination took  place  after

they  left  the P.A.P. They left the P.A.P. in 1961 - was

it  not? I have just given him the figures for both 1962

and 1963.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  Singapore is a densely populated city.  Therefore,

the  control over vehicles is a very great problem.  The

Government should be very careful in going about it.  As

far  as I know, the Deputy Prime Minister has set up two

Committees   to  investigate  the  traffic  problem   in

Singapore.  The  first Committee  was  the  Bus  Service

Inquiry Committee which was chaired by his Parliamentary

Secretary. This Committee spent some time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



in  carrying out investigations into all aspects of  the

traffic problem. It also issued its Report to the Press.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, in the Report, the  Committee

suggested many recommendations as to how to improve  the

bus  service and to safeguard the passengers, especially

the  schoolchildren. But ever since the  publication  of

this  Report,  we  have not been able to  see  that  the

Government has actively implemented the recommendations.

We  urge the Deputy Prime Minister to tell this House to

what   extent  the  Government  has  carried   out   the

implementation of the recommendations contained  in  the

Report and what are the difficulties of those which have

not  been  carried out? Is it possible  to  improve  the

situation immediately in this respect?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very important problem. If the

Government  is only interested in setting up  Committees

and  not  in  carrying  out the recommendations  of  the

Committees,  it is only a tactic of deception.  Sir,  as

far  as I remember, after the publication of the Report,

the  Government  also  set up  a  Taxi  Licences  Review

Committee.   This   was   done  after   the   Government

temporarily suspended the issue of taxi licences.  After

some  Time, the Government also announced that Singapore

citizens  are  entitled to apply for taxi  licences  but

that  they must be recommended by the taxi-owners before

their  applications can be considered by the Government.

Can  the Deputy Prime Minister tell this House how  many

applications   have  been  received  by   the   Vehicles

Registration  Office  since  the  announcement  of   the

Report;  how  many applications have been approved,  and

how  many applications have been rejected, and what  are

the  reasons for the rejection? I hope the Deputy  Prime

Minister  can give a very detailed explanation  to  this

House on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I listened to the reply  by  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister. He seems to twist the facts to  deceive

the  people by saying that I am not interested in public

health.  But  the crux of the problem  is  that  if  any

action is to be taken against cars which emit smoke,  it

is the taxi-drivers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



who  are  the greatest offenders. The Government  cannot

solve  the  problem  by imposing  more  fines  on  taxi-drivers.  The Government should educate these people  by

pointing out to them that they should minimise the smoke

emitting from their cars or taxis. We all know that taxi-drivers are poor people. They earn only a few dollars  a

day,  and  they have to be on the alert to  avoid  being

summoned by the traffic authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has twisted what I said by saying that I am not concerned with public health. I do not object to the enforcement of the law on traffic offenders. What I am asking is that the Government should reduce the fines, especially the fines on taxi- drivers. The fines should be reduced to two or three dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the car parking attendants, the Deputy

Prime  Minister  said  that the  reason  why  I  was  so

concerned about those who were sacked was that they  are

my  relatives  or  friends. I come  from  the  labouring

class, and I stand on the side of the labouring class; I

understand  their  sufferings.  Termination  of  service

without any reason is very unjust to them. He said  that

when  I was in the Labour Ministry, I was in close touch

with  these people. Not only do I know this; the  P.A.P.

also  know  it. How are car parking attendants promoted?

They  know it, and I also know it, and there is no  need

for  me  to  say how. Among those who were  sacked,  the

first  was the Secretary of the Moulmein Branch  of  the

P.A.P. The Deputy Prime Minister also told us that  only

25  were sacked. It might be possible that all these  25

were once their P.A.P. members and they were not all  my

friends.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> May I answer the Member for

Moulmein first so that we will keep our trend of thought

in line?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Moulmein is aware

that  the  majority of taxi-drivers do  not  own  taxis.

Therefore,  the  fines which have been  imposed  by  the

court  are  paid by owners of these vehicles;  in  other

words, by people who own taxis, not by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



taxi-drivers. It is utter rubbish for him to say that we

are prosecuting taxi-drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to the quantum of the fines, I

have  no  control  over  it; it is  the  magistrate  who

imposes  the amount of the fine. It may well be that  if

the  plea  put  up  by  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  is

sufficiently  convincing, the magistrate  may  not  even

impose  a  fine.  The magistrate could  issue  a  severe

warning, or, at the least, impose a small fine of two or

three  dollars, as suggested by the Member for Moulmein.

Perhaps  we  might even think of making the  Member  for

Moulmein a magistrate to sit upon these cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the questions raised by the Member

for Yio Chu Kang ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not again. Choa Chu Kang.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Choa Chu Kang. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, there is no innuendo in my

remark,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker. I  always  get  mixed  up

between  the  two. It is true that a bus  committee  was

appointed  by  me  to  study the conditions  of  service

provided  by  bus companies, and a report was  duly  put

forward. This report was circulated to all bus companies

and  bus unions. Now, the Member for Choa Chu Kang asked

whether  we have implemented the recommendations  stated

in the report. I must say that it is a bit difficult for

us   to   force   the  bus  companies  to   follow   the

recommendations made by this committee.  At  Times,  you

require  a  stick by which you can enforce  regulations,

but  sometimes  I  think it is better  if  you  can  use

persuasion rather than force to get into effect what you

want. Well, in this case, we have tried to persuade  the

bus  companies and the unions to give improved  services

to  the  public  and, in some instances, I  believe  the

recommendations  have  been carried  out.  But  in  some

instances  they  have  not been carried  out.  This,  of

course, is largely the responsibility of the bus owners.

If they wish to extend their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



business,  they  should  see that  the  public  is  well

treated and well served.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the committee which sat on the issue of

taxi licences and taxi drivers' licences, this committee

has  not completed its investigations. I believe it sent

out over 10,000 questionnaires to people who are holding

taxi  drivers' licences. Many answers have come in,  and

the  R.O.V. is overwhelmed by the amount of work it  has

got to do to study the answers which have come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will be aware that there are

slightly  over 3,000 taxis which are now being  operated

by over 10,000 people who own taxi drivers' licences. We

have  had  complaints in the past from the taxi-drivers'

union  that business has not been good, because  of  the

excessive  number of taxis in this City. On  account  of

this  complaint, we have temporarily suspended the issue

of  licences to people who wish to drive taxis. That  is

one  positive  way  by which we hope  to  alleviate  the

plight  of  taxi-drivers, and I believe  this  has  been

favourably  received by the majority of people  who  own

taxis as well as people who drive taxis. When the Member

asked  me  whether  I  could  give  him  the  number  of

applications for new taxi licences and applications  for

new  taxi drivers' licences, I am afraid I am not  in  a

position  here to give him the figures, because  he  has

not given me due notice that he was going to ask me this

question.  However, I will only add that this  committee

which  is investigating into the conditions of the  taxi

service in Singapore will carefully consider whether  it

will be advisable to increase the number of taxis or the

number of people who wish to drive taxis. With regard to

the  latter problem of the number of people who wish  to

drive  taxis, one point of view is that really  not  all

those  who  apply for taxi drivers' licences  enter  the

trade.  Many  of  the  10,000  who  hold  taxi  drivers'

licences  are in some other profession or in some  other

occupation. For example, a person may be a tinsmith,  or

he  may  be working in the Harbour Board, or he  may  be

working elsewhere, but at the same time he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



carries a taxi driver's licence. In the old days, a taxi

driver's  licence was issued very readily to any  person

who  holds a driving licence and on payment of  a  small

sum  of  money.  This  indiscriminate  issuing  of  taxi

drivers' licences has been to the prejudice of real taxi-drivers - people who are earning a living  by  driving  a

taxi. For one thing, it makes it very difficult for  the

authorities to judge how many people are really  engaged

in the taxi driving profession, and how to protect taxi-drivers  in  the  profession from excessive  competition

among themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is also the complaint from some taxi-owners that the ratio of about 10,000 persons who hold

taxi  drivers'  licences to about  3,000  taxis  is  too

small. They say that sometimes it is quite difficult for

them to find a person to drive or operate a taxi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these questions must be carefully looked into by

this  committee before a decision can be made. Obviously

to  make  a  decision one way or the other is  going  to

annoy  the taxi-drivers or the taxi-owners. But whatever

decision  we arrive at, it must be a fair and  just  one

which would be in the interests of the operators as well

as in the interests of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is now four

years  since  the  P.A.P. came to  office.  It  will  be

remembered that as early as 1955, 1956 and in  the  days

when  the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General  of  the

P.A.P.,  was  in the Opposition, a lot was talked  about

the  Singapore Traction Company and the monopoly it  has

in  maintaining  bus routes. I would  like  to  ask  the

Deputy Prime Minister what steps have been taken by  the

Government  during  these  four  years  to  break   this

monopoly of the Singapore Traction Company?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, the Singapore Traction Company,

Limited,  is  a foreign company operating  with  British

capital.  The Minister for Finance says that he believes

in local industries. And here in Singapore, in so far as

the  bus companies are concerned, we know that the local

bus companies are not allowed to operate the routes that

the Singapore Traction Company has. Sir, anyone will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



know  that  the  routes the Singapore  Traction  Company

operates  are  the most lucrative routes  in  Singapore.

Although  to  some  extent, taxi  competition  may  have

affected  the revenue of the Singapore Traction Company,

nevertheless,  the Singapore Traction  Company  operates

the  most  lucrative routes in Singapore. And  also,  of

course, taxi competition is also a problem to the  local

Chinese bus companies which operate the routes which are

largely  outside  City  limits. Also,  to  make  matters

worse,  I  am  told that there is a bias  against  local

companies  in  the  rate  of calculation  of  road  tax,

passenger tax, etc, of the bus companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. I think it is time

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of time

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 19 be

reduced by $100."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 19 (contd.) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We were talking about the fact that the

Singapore  Traction  Company,  Limited,  has  its  buses

operating  on  more  lucrative  routes  and  having   an

advantage in the fact that the amount of taxes that  the

S.T.C. has  to pay is much lesser than what  the  local

Singapore bus companies have to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we would like to know is what the Singapore

Government  has done, a Government which  claims  to  be

socialist,  though non-Communist socialist - I  think,  in

fact, they are at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



moment fanatically anti-Communist sort of socialists, if

there  are  socialists  of  that  nature   - and  also   a

Government  which  claims  to  give  priority  to  local

investors  with a view to encouraging local  industries,

etc.  Sir,  in Singapore, we have, insofar  as  the  bus

companies are concerned at least, a position where there

is  only one bus company, namely, the Singapore Traction

Company, Limited, which is a foreign concern, a  British

concern,  operating with British capital, and all  other

bus  companies are locally owned - owned by local  Chinese

businessmen.  And yet, although four years  have  passed

since  this  Government took office,  nothing  has  been

done - absolutely  nothing  has  been  done - to  break  the

monopoly  of the S.T.C., although in the days  when  the

Prime   Minister  was  in  the  Opposition,  he  decried

attempts  of  the  previous Government  to  foster  this

monopoly of the S.T.C. It will be remembered how in this

House,  in  those  days,  it  was  suggested  that   the

Singapore Government should take over the S.T.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister

what  steps the Government has taken and, if it has  not

taken  any steps, what steps it proposes to take in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I must first preface

my  remarks by saying that I hold no brief for  any  bus

company,  be  it  the  Singapore Traction  Company,  the

Chinese  Bus, the Hock Lee, the Changi or the Green  Bus

Company. My responsibility is towards the public. It  is

my  duty  to  ensure that the twelve odd  bus  companies

which are licensed in Singapore provide services as best

they  can and as efficiently as possible for the benefit

of   the  travelling  public.  The  routes  of  the  bus

companies  are  under the control of the Road  Licensing

Authority. Whenever any bus company wishes to apply  for

a  new  route,  the  application goes before  this  Road

Licensing  Authority,  and any  bus  company  which  has

objection  to  this  application can lay  its  objection

before this Licensing Authority and will be heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say here that the Member for Thomson does not

understand in the least the running of the bus  services

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  Sir, I hold no brief for the S.T.C.,  but  I

say here that the S.T.C. holds no monopoly. There is  no

bus company which holds any monopoly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> There is a monopoly of routes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> There is no monopoly of routes.

Name me one city route on which it holds a monopoly.  It

is not possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Take, for example, the routes from Serangoon

Gardens  Estate  to  Raffles Place, Upper  Serangoon  to

Raffles Place, the Chinese bus companies are not allowed

to operate on these routes, and if applications are made

by  the local bus companies to operate on a route  which

clashes with the S.T.C. bus routes, that application  is

turned down.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is quite natural that no sane

Licensing  Authority will want to  grant  the  same  bus

route  to  several  companies.  It  will  only  lead  to

confusion of the services and the competition which will

arise  among  the bus companies fighting  for  passenger

fares  along the same route will be so keen that instead

of  having a proper service there will be madness  along

this  route. If the route had been given to the  S.T.C.,

it was probably because it was earlier on the scene. You

cannot expect a late-comer, if it applies for the route,

to  be  given the route. These are considerations  which

must apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in any case, it is not necessary for the Member

for Thomson to come to this Assembly to lay the case for

the  Chinese bus companies. I have, in fact, two  months

ago,   had  a  meeting  with  the  Chinese  Bus   Owners

Association together with their solicitor. Many problems

were  raised at this meeting. We spent a whole afternoon

discussing  these problems, and they went off  satisfied

with  my explanations. This point of monopoly was raised

by  their solicitor and I asked him, "Which part of  the

S.T.C.  Ordinance  indicates that a  monopoly  is  being

given  to  the  S.T.C.?" There  is  no  section  of  the

Ordinance which at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



the  moment  says  that the S.T.C. has  a  monopoly  of

routes.  It  is  all nonsense. Sir, it is all  nonsense.

[Interruption]  The routes which are given  to  one  bus

company  cannot  obviously  be  given  to  another   bus

company. If one bus company is not allowed to operate on

another  bus company's routes, the position  holds  vice

versa.  You may as well say that a bus company which  is

only  allowed to run a service from the Capitol  to  the

end of Changi is holding a monopoly. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> All right. I will give the House

the real reason why the Member for Thomson is so keen on

this problem, and it is very simple. He does not run the

S.T.C.  Union,  and that is the real reason  why  he  is

raising these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He was thrown out!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Members will be aware that some

years  back,  there was a Commission  of  Inquiry  which

investigated into the possibilities of unifying the  bus

services in this city. There were two propositions.  One

was  to get the bus companies to federate or amalgamate,

and  the  other was for the Government to take over  all

the  bus  companies. This Government is not  anxious  to

spend  or  dump several million dollars into the  second

proposition  by  merely taking over  the  bus  companies

without  the possibility of providing more opportunities

for employment to the people or even the possibility  of

improving  the  bus  services.  I  have  discussed   the

question  of  nationalisation  of  bus  companies   with

several   Ministers  overseas,  and  it  has  been   the

experience that when you nationalise a bus company,  for

several years that nationalised bus company loses  money

and  efficiency drops. It has happened not only  in  one

country but in several countries. It is our policy  that

the  millions of dollars which we will be spending  must

he so invested that opportunities for employment will be

created. I do not see how you are going to increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



employment of busmen, drivers or bus  conductors

by  mere  nationalisation. I do not  agree  that  is  an

admirable  step, however socialist one's ideas  may  be.

Nationalisation  just  for the sake  of  nationalisation

without  positive benefits arising out of it  is  not  a

very rational step at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first proposition suggested by this Commission

of  Inquiry, I have, in fact, had several meetings  with

the S.T.C. management and, in fact, with the Director of

the  S.T.C. when he was in Singapore sometime ago,  that

the  S.T.C. should open its shares to local citizens.  I

even  suggested  to him that some of the  S.T.C. shares

should  be  sold to the local bus companies. I  believe,

according to my report, that approaches have been  made,

but the offer was not accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to face one simple fact, Mr Speaker, and that

is  many bus companies today are not solely involved  in

the  business  of  running buses.  There  are  many  bus

companies  which  do  not try to  plough  back  whatever

profits  they  earn  into the business  of  running  bus

services.  We  find many bus companies are  involved  in

putting  up housing estates, simply because it  is  more

profitable. There is also the complaint that the takings

of  a bus company are not what they ought to be. And  it

is  not  unnatural that any offer made by the S.T.C. to

local  citizens that some of its shares can  `be  bought

does not meet with very keen response.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the granting of routes to bus companies,

that  is the job of the Road Licensing Authority,  which

is  composed of officials. I have taken very great  care

indeed  that no politicians should ever be in this  Road

Licensing   Authority  so  that  applications   can   be

considered   solely   on   their   merits,   and    that

consideration  be given to the fact that the  travelling

public  will benefit by these applications.  As  I  have

said before, the Member for Thomson just seeks to make a

political issue out of this when there is none  at  all.

If he were in charge of the S.T.C. Union today, probably

he would have kept his mouth shut.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>9.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not see how the S.T.C. Employees' Union

comes  into  the picture at all. For the information  of

the  Deputy Prime Minister, as early as 1959 when I  was

still  in the S.T.C. Employees' Union, I told the  Prime

Minister,  in the presence of Mr C. V. Devan  Nair,  of

the  necessity to break the monopoly of the  S.T.C.,  to

take over, to nationalise the bus transport industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that I raise this now has got

nothing - absolutely  nothing - to  do   with   the   S.T.C.

Employees'  Union. Whether I am in the S.T.C. Employees'

Union  or not in the S.T.C. Employees' Union is not  the

issue.  The issue is very simple. The Government  claims

to  give  priority to local capital, local industry  and

what-not.  The Singapore Traction Company is  a  British

company, operating with British capital, and it enjoys a

good monopoly. This is by virtue of the fact that it  is

a  very old company, that it is a British company,  that

the rulers of Singapore were the British. Therefore,  it

has the most lucrative routes in Singapore. There is  no

doubt about it - you can ask anybody in Singapore, and  he

will  tell  you  that the S.T.C. operates  on  the  most

lucrative  routes, routes which are most  yielding.  And

what  have the Singapore Government done to try - as  they

always say they want to - to encourage local companies  to

flourish? The Deputy Prime Minister merely says  in  law

there  is  no  monopoly. But in practice, there  is.  He

knows  as  well  as anyone else that there  are  certain

routes  on  which the local companies cannot  ply  their

buses.  And  from  time  to time  local  companies  have

objected to this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member that

he  is just repeating what he has said? What he has said

has   already  been  replied  to  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister, and all the Deputy Prime Minister has to do is

to  repeat what he has said in reply to what the  Member

has  already  said. So let us get to something  new,  if

possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I want to say this again because the

Deputy  Prime Minister has not replied to this.  I  have

said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



that,  in  addition  to the fact that  they  operate  on

lucrative  routes, there is the fact that  the  taxation

policy  is  such that it is advantageous to the  S.T.C.,

and  the Deputy Prime Minister has made no reply at  all

to this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I say again that the Member for

Thomson is just nuts. He does not understand how the bus

services are run. I do not think he has even bothered to

read  the  legislation  regarding  the  running  of  bus

services. The S.T.C. pays royalties - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let the Deputy Prime Minister

finish.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And here he is confused himself.

One  moment  he wants us to nationalise the S.T.C.,  the

next  moment he is asking us to encourage local capital.

To do what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> To take over the S.T.C.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Just to take over the S.T.C. I am

quite sure the S.T.C. is quite willing to pass over  its

shares to loca1 capital. In fact, it was only too  eager

at one time to get the company off its hands. That would

mean  not only the disruption of bus services, but  also

throwing several thousand workers out of jobs. If  there

is  abundant local capital doing nothing, then the  best

they could do would be to invest in industry which would

provide  bigger  opportunities for  employment  for  our

people.  That is the pressing problem. I do not see  how

nationalising  the S.T.C. or local capital  taking  over

the  S.T.C. can  create more jobs. And I  will  repeat,

although  the Member denies it, his interest  is  mainly

because he has not the control of the S.T.C. Union.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Thomson wish to

elucidate something?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I did not say the S.T.C. does not pay

taxes.  I asked the Deputy Prime Minister a very  simple

question,  whether he knows there is a  different  basis

used as between the S.T.C.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



and  the  local  bus  companies in assessing  royalties.

Obviously, he does not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister says that the  people

of  Singapore do not have enough money to take over  the

properties  and  shares of the S.T.C. I personally  feel

that  in  saying  this  he is perhaps  disregarding  the

capacity of the people of Singapore. As far as we  know,

in  the  fields  of  transportation,  this  s  the  most

lucrative line. If the S.T.C. had been prepared to  sell

all  its  shares  to  the people of  Singapore,  then  I

believe overnight all the shares would have been  bought

over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that, as far as I know, the S.T.C.,

at  the  present moment, is paying taxes on a  different

basis  from  that  of  the Chinese  bus  companies.  The

Chinese  bus  companies have to pay taxes  once  in  six

months,  whereas in the case of the S.T.C., their  basis

is  different. If a bus from the S.T.C. is on  the  road

for  six  hours, then tax will have to be paid  only  in

respect  of those six hours. So from this, you  can  see

that  the  companies of the suzerain country  have  been

given special privileges over others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the routes of the S.T.C. have

already  encroached  on  the  routes  of  the  Singapore

Chinese  bus  companies. That is why great  losses  have

been  suffered by the Chinese bus companies.  Obviously,

we  know  that the P.A.P. Government now is  encouraging

foreign capital and not local investment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Pasir Panjang is

only a little echo to the Member for Thomson. I have got

to  repeat all over again the arguments which I  brought

out  a  little while ago. As I pointed out very clearly,

in  so far as the bus routes are concerned, this is  the

business  of  an  independent Road Licensing  Authority,

which  judges the merits of each application  and  which

hears  any  objection. If he says  that  the  S.T.C. is

encroaching on the routes of the Chinese bus  companies,

why  does  he not also say that it holds vice versa?  It

holds vice versa. I do not think the public want to  see

S.T.C. buses,  Green Bus Company buses,  Hock  Lee  Bus

Company buses and Changi Bus Company buses, all racing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



one  another down Nicoll Highway to look for passengers.

That  will  only  bring confusion in the  bus  services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a minute. It is not necessary for Members of the

Barisan Sosialis to pretend that they are looking  after

the  welfare of the Chinese bus companies here.  I  have

just  mentioned  to them only a minute ago  that  I  met

their  Association with their lawyers  only  two  months

ago,  and  we  thrashed out many  problems.  It  is  not

necessary for them to bring up all these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns the salary of the Minister to the

amount  of  $30,000 a year. As far as I know, since  the

P.A.P. Government came to office, it has all along  been

carrying out colonial economic policies. That is why the

rural  economy has gone into bankruptcy. The rural areas

come within the control of the Minister. So I would like

to  find out from the Minister concerned whether  it  is

possible now to solve the many problems and the economic

crisis in the rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

say  that  the Member for Choa Chu Kang was out  of  his

mind.  Now we are faced with the Member for Jalan  Kayu.

He  is from a rural constituency. But he is seldom  seen

around  the rural constituencies because I have been  to

his  constituency so many Times lately; I have heard  so

many things against him that it is not necessary for  me

to go into the details of his activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he said that since the Government came to power,

our   activities   in  the  rural  areas   have   caused

bankruptcy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, on a point of order. Mr Bath.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I would like to ask whether it is

proper for the Minister to refer to the Member for  Choa

Chu Kang when the question has been raised by the Member

for Jalan Kayu?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose it is quite in order for

anybody  in  this Chamber to compare one Member  of  the

Assembly  with another Member of the Assembly.  That  is

quite in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> To say that there is bankruptcy in

the  rural areas shows that there is bankruptcy in  that

Member. I am not talking about whether he is financially

bankrupt,   but   I  think  that  politically,   as   an

Assemblyman, he is bankrupt of ideas, of activities  for

his constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows how much we have done for the

rural constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How much?

well.  And I know very well that the Opposition will  go

on repeating untruths -  that the Government, since taking

office  for four years, have done nothing for the  rural

areas. Sir, they choose to close an eye to these things.

As I have said the other day, the Member's mind needs to

be examined.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yio Chu Kang!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Since 1961, Sir, Time and again

during Budget Time, they have been saying things against

my  Ministry  for not doing anything. I do not  mean  to

repeat  all  these  things just  because  they  keep  on

repeating them -  the Government is not doing anything for

the  rural constituencies, and is not doing anything  to

help the rural dwellers. To say that the Government  has

not  done  anything for these people is enough  to  show

that they are out of their minds.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You keep on repeating; that is

wasting time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, anyone who takes an interest in

the  rural areas and the farming activities and who  has

compared  the  farming conditions in  1958,  before  the

P.A.P. Government came to power, with the conditions  in

1962, four years after the P.A.P. Government has been in

power,  knows  that  this  accusation  is  the  greatest

distortion of the true facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that the P.A.P.

Government  is extremely proud of the efforts  and  work

that have been put into the rural areas since we came to

power in June 1959. It has been our policy to assist the

farmers,  to  help them increase production,  to  reduce

production  costs,  so  that their  farm  produce  could

become competitive not only against foreign imports sold

in  the  local market but could also compete  in  export

markets. This achievement can be borne



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



out  by the fact that in 1962 we exported 12,000 locally

produced pigs, 68 million locally produced hen eggs, and

about   2  million  locally  produced  poultry  to   our

neighbouring countries. Prior to 1959 we were not  self-sufficient.  What  is  the reason that  has  transformed

Singapore  from an importing country into  an  exporting

one  in agricultural produce? The simple answer is  that

Singapore  farmers have been able to  produce  not  only

enough  for home consumption but also to have a  surplus

for  export, and not only have a surplus for export, but

the  cost  of  production has been  reduced  to  such  a

competitive  level  that  they  could  sell  Singapore's

agricultural   produce   on  foreign   markets   against

competition  from foreign imports and local products  of

these foreign markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago a question was asked in one of the

Legislative Assemblies in the Borneo territories  as  to

why   they  had  to  import  Singapore  eggs  into  that

territory.  The  answer  was that  Singapore  eggs  were

cheaper  than the locally produced eggs in Borneo.  What

do  all  these  facts show? They show  that  Singapore's

farming  activities have expanded tremendously over  the

last few years, making it possible to produce enough for

home  consumption as well as a surplus  for  export.  It

also  shows that the cost of production of farm  produce

in  Singapore has been reduced to such a level  that  it

has  been  able to compete effectively not only  in  the

local market but also in foreign markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would not want to claim all the credit

for this advance and expansion of farming activities  in

Singapore.   Singapore   farmers   are   hard   working,

intelligent and are very receptive in adopting new ideas

in  modern farming activities. And the agricultural  and

veterinary  services  provided  by  the  Government  are

second to none in South-East Asia. Without the increased

staff  and the money that the Government has put  in  to

improve   and  expand  the  various  primary  production

services  over the last few years since the P.A.P. came

to power, farming conditions in Singapore would not have

been what they are today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you an idea of what the Government has done in

the field of primary production over the last few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



years,  I  would like to inform the House that  we  have

produced improved strains of pigs and chickens for  more

efficient production and distribution to farmers at  low

prices. In 1962, 47,000 day-old chicks were sold at  the

reduced  price  of  20  cents  each,  and  425  improved

piglings were distributed. We have also initiated a  pig

artificial insemination service to improve the pig stock

in  Singapore. To assist farmers to reduce the  cost  of

production  by cutting down losses of livestock  through

mortality   and   sickness,   the   Primary   Production

Department  vaccinated 11.5 million heads of poultry  in

1962, as compared with 6.7 million heads in 1959, nearly

doubling the figure in only three years. In addition,  a

new   service  to  protect  young  chicks  from  getting

ranikhet  disease was initiated in 1961. The  Government

also  built  more veterinary centres in the rural  areas

where   poor  facilities  existed  before  1959.   These

veterinary centres bring the very services to  the  very

doorsteps  of  the  farmers,  and  each  centre  has   a

veterinary   surgeon  and  a  team  of  six   to   seven

subordinate  officers  permanently  stationed  there  to

assist  the farmers. Since 1959 three more centres  have

been  built, three are under construction and  two  more

will be built next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from veterinary surgeons engaged in research and

other   veterinary  services,  there   are   now   seven

veterinary  surgeons working full-time on the  treatment

of farm animals and poultry in the rural areas alone, as

compared to only one full-time surgeon in 1959.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of elucidation, Mr Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I shall be very grateful if the

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a matter of

elucidation.  I think the Member for Thomson  asked  for

it. I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



the Minister is quite correct in giving a resume of what

has happened. Please continue, Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, it only shows that - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> You have asked for it!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Minister, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, apart from veterinary surgeons

engaged  in  research  and other veterinary  activities,

there  are  now seven veterinary surgeons working  full-time on the treatment of farm animals and poultry in the

rural  areas alone, as compared with only one  full-time

surgeon in 1959. The number of livestock treated  was  2

million in 1962 as compared with half a million in 1960.

It  is the Government's intention to build more of these

veterinary  extension centres in the rural  areas  where

veterinary services are needed, and it is also  intended

to organise a veterinary mobile unit to provide services

to farmers in Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong, and the Southern

Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disease incidence in livestock has reduced

considerably due to these animal treatment services  and

the  sale of veterinary drugs to farmers at cost  price.

The sale of $18,000 worth of drugs in 1959 compared with

$80,000  worth in 1962 reflected how much more Singapore

farmers have become conscious of utilising modern  drugs

to  reduce  livestock losses and to reduce the  cost  of

production. This year the Government also intends to set

up   a   veterinary  diagnostic  laboratory  to   combat

livestock diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have been to the rural areas recently

would  be  struck  by  the change  in  animal  husbandry

methods  used by the farmers. In the past,  poultry  and

pigs  have  been reared on a free range  basis  and  the

animals  fend  for themselves. Through the demonstration

and  advice  given by the Primary Production Department,

many  farmers  are now adopting labour saving  and  cost

reducing  devices such as rearing poultry in  cages  and

rearing pigs in simple



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



hygienic pig sties. Through the efforts and research  of

the Primary Production Department into animal nutrition,

many  farmers are now feeding their livestock on  a  dry

feed basis using well balanced rations which will ensure

maximum  production at minimum cost. To assist vegetable

farmers,   the  Department  has  initiated  a  ploughing

service to save the farmers a lot of Time and hard work,

and  an  anti-pest service to help the farmers to combat

agricultural  pests  and  plant  diseases  with   modern

insecticides   and  fungicides  using  modern   spraying

implements. We have also recently initiated  a  sale  of

fertiliser  service  to help the farmers  to  use  these

cheap  and effective fertilisers in order to reduce  the

cost  of  production. It is also the  intention  of  the

Government  to  produce  improved  seeds  and   planting

materials  for  distribution  to  farmers  in  order  to

improve the yield and to reduce the cost of production.



<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that these agricultural services

were  not  available to the farmers of Singapore  before

the  P.A.P. Government came to power. Recently a Primary

Production  Extension Unit has been established  in  the

Department  with  the  object of  bringing  the  various

primary  production services even closer to the farmers.

It  will  bring  a knowledge of improved  techniques  of

farming  to  the farmers through illustrated  talks  and

films  on  all aspects of primary production. Handbills,

pamphlets,  booklets on these subjects  are  also  being

produced for distribution to farmers so that they may he

acquainted    with   all   the   up-to-date   production

techniques. Primary Production Department personnel will

also   be  able  to  apprise  the  Government   of   the

difficulties and problems faced by the farmers  so  that

new schemes could be formulated to assist them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the above, the Government has

spared  no  effort in trying to assist the farmers,  and

nobody in his right mind could accuse the Government  of

want of trying to better the lot of the farmers, to help

Them increase production and reduce production costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that in 1958 the total number of Government

officers,  including  monthly  and  daily-rated   staff,

engaged in primary production work was 236 compared with

1963 when the total strength of personnel in the Primary

Production  Department increased to 434 persons,  nearly

doubling  the strength of the establishment strength  in

1958,  shows that the Government is very concerned  with

the  welfare  of  the rural communities.  As  the  rural

communities have been neglected by past governments,  we

are  now  doing  everything possible to help  the  rural

people  and  to  develop the rural  areas  in  order  to

rectify the mistakes and neglect of past governments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

every time the P.A.P. Minister gives reports on figures.

That  is  why they are afraid of their lies. The present

condition  is  also  caused by  the  concept  of  P.A.P.

Ministers.  I  have  here a Sin Chew Jit  Poh  newspaper

report  dated  the  4th of June. It touches  on  certain

merchants  dealing in animal feed. They are  faced  with

business  difficulties,  and  they  convened   a   Press

conference  and issued this report. This  clearly  shows

rural  difficulties. I will just quote from it  here  to

show you:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chinese Animal-Feed Merchants Association convened

a  press conference, the Chairman of which said that the

committee of this Association had a meeting on the  13th

of  this month at which the question of dropping  prices

of  eggs  was discussed. The rural economic  bankruptcy

and crisis were discussed too. Many merchants dealing in

this line and farmers were meeting with difficulties.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they mention all this? I would like to tell

you. These merchants are dealing in animal feed which is

supplied to the farmers. If the prices of their  produce

are lower than the cost, then they will lose money. They

will  have  to  calculate how much they  can  pay  these

merchants. There are certain merchants who are  able  to

supply  these goods on credit to them, and  the  farmers

will  have to calculate what is the amount they will  be

able  to produce every month in order to cover the cost.

The  present situation is that when prices drop, farmers

will  not be able to pay for the supplies they get  from

the merchants, thus leading to their economic bankruptcy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



The middlemen too have become bankrupt  because

of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has talked about setting up various veterinary stations and surveying teams in the rural area. These are not fundamental solutions. On the face of all this, they look very nice. If the Minister goes down to the rural areas, he can find that everywhere chicken sheds are in a very bad condition. Because of the poor market, the farmers cannot maintain the repair

of these sheds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you more about the prices of eggs.

Recently  the price of an egg has dropped to  six  cents

each.  This is the first Time in postwar years that  the

price  of eggs has fallen to such a low level. Normally,

in  postwar years, an egg costs about 10 cents. Even  in

the  Lim  Yew Hock Government's Time, it was about  nine

cents  per  egg. Now under the P.A.P., it  is  only  six

cents.  The  farmers are therefore unable to meet  their

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the chicks are mostly meant for

the  table.  The  selling price is about  90  cents  per

katty.  Chicks must be fed for about four or five months

before  they can be sold at $2 each. So let the Minister

calculate  how much the cost is and how much  the  price

is,  and  then  he will know whether any profit  can  be

made. For instance, a pig will cost about $80 per picul.

But  the piglings will have to be fed for about  six  or

seven  months  before they can be sold as  fit  for  the

table at a price that cannot meet the cost. That is  why

I   would   like  to  ask  the  Minister  for   National

Development how he is going to solve the difficulties in

the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a

little  while  ago,  we  have  heard  the  Minister  for

National  Development reading the Annual Report  of  his

Department,   showing   the   grand   achievements   his

Department  has  made. But he has forgotten  one  thing.

Today,  the  present Government, in the field  of  rural

primary  production  services,  is  only  treating   the

symptoms  but not the disease itself. The Government  is

only  buying more stud pigs and is setting up a few more

veterinary stations here and there. Can this  raise  the

living standard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



of  the farmers? There is grave doubt about this. We all

know  that the prices of domestic animals are  very  low

and  they  are usually sold at a price that cannot  meet

the  cost.  I  believe the Political  Secretary  to  the

Deputy  Prime Minister himself is keeping  hens  to  lay

eggs.  But he does not make money out of this.  That  is

why  I  say  the  Government is not tackling  the  basic

problems.  The Government is only treating the  symptoms

but  not  the  disease.  What the Government  should  be

concerned with is how to enable the farmers to have good

prices for their agricultural produce in order to better

their livelihood.



<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I quite

appreciate  what  the Minister for National  Development

has read with regard to the so-called grand achievements

of  the Government in the rural areas. But what he  says

does  not  provide us with anything new at  all.  If  we

compare what he has said just now with what he said last

year,  with  regard to the budget of his  own  Ministry,

then  we can see that there is not much difference. This

is actually the same as white-washing an old house. This

is  only  what the Government can do so far  and  it  is

claiming much credit for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the P.A.P. candidates took part in the elections in 1959, all the voters in the rural constituencies supported the P.A.P. in office because they believed that the rural development plans of the P.A.P. would ultimately improve the lot of the rural people, especially poultry farmers and farmers in general. Under those circumstances, the people in the

rural constituencies gave them full-hearted support  and

attached  great hopes to the P.A.P., praying that  their

livelihood  would be improved eventually. In  fact,  the

P.A.P. at  that Time did give very good  and  practical

plans  for the improvement of the rural people. In fact,

if the P.A.P. Government had done something practical to

these  plans, they would have indeed raised the standard

of   living   of  the  rural  people.  So  it   is   the

responsibility of the Minister for National  Development

to implement all the plans that were promised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



the  rural  people  in 1959  during  the  general elections. Unfortunately,

however, from the reply  given by  the  Minister  concerned and the work

done  by  the P.A.P. during the past four years, it can he seen  that the

Government,  especially the Minister  for  National Development,

has not given full-hearted attention to the development of the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us look now at the booklet of the P.A.P. during the general election concerning the development of the rural areas.

It is The Tasks  Ahead, volume  1, paragraph 3. One of the paragraphs here

says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is our aim to encourage the establishment of co-operative

societies of the farmers  and  to  give  them financial  assistance,

so that  co-operative  societies will  replace  the  farmers' own ways of

buying  animal feeds  and  fertilisers. In this way,  the  co-operative

societies  will  be able to buy cheaply the  fertilisers and  then  resell

them  to the  farmers  without  great profit.  And  then by and by the

co-operative  societies will  be able to build up their own capital so that

the farmers will no longer be exploited by the middle man In the purchase

of the feeds and fertilisers.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the departments under the Minister for National Development, as far as I know, include one

so-called  co-operative society division. But what I  would like

to know from the Minister concerned is this.  What has this co-operative

division of the P.A.P. done during the  past four years? What has it done

in respect of co-operative  society establishments? Has the  P.A.P. done

its  best  to  foster the establishment of  co-operative organisations among

the farmers? Mr Speaker, the answer is  very  obvious. It is emphatically no.

It is entirely no.  If  there had been any achievements in this  field,

then  when  the  Member for Jalan  Kayu  raised  certain queries,

they should have been answered accordingly.  In fact,  there  would

have been no necessity  for  him  to raise  such  queries.  So we can see

clearly  that  the Minister for National Development has not spent all

his Time  and  made use of all the departments available  to implement

the election pledges of the P.A.P. That is why up  to the present moment

the lot of the farmer is still very bad and remains unimproved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker,  no doubt the Minister has been  able  to quote a great number

of figures in order to tell us that the Ministry of National Development

and he himself have done  a  great  deal  to improve the livelihood  of

the farmers  His  explanation is  that  there  has  been  an increase in

the produce of the farmers over these years. But  one  must  not forget

one fact. In  the  past  four years,   there  has  been  a  tremendous

increase   in population  in  the  rural  areas.  When  the   farmers'

children leave school, they could not find jobs  in  the factories. The

only thing for these people to do  is  to crowd  round their vegetable

gardens in order  to  raise their  crops and thereby provide a livelihood

for  their own family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not deny there has been an increase in

farm produce.  But this does not mean that the livelihood  of the  farmers

has  improved. This is  because  increased production  is closely related

to the cost of production and  the  selling price of agricultural produce.

So  it would  be a grave mistake if you only talk of the volume of production

without taking into consideration the cost of  production and the selling

price of farm produce.  I believe  his  colleague, the Minister for Finance,

will not base this as his logic and say that this is proof of the improvement

of the livelihood of the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for National Development has also mentioned other matters connected with his

Ministry.  Bust he has not been able to  show  from  his speech  that

the promises made by the P.A.P. in  those days  have been fulfilled.

When the Minister for Finance made  his Budget Speech, he was very proud of

The  Tasks Ahead  of  the  P.A.P.  But the  Minister  for  National

Development  has  made no mention of  the  P.A.P.'s  The Tasks  Ahead.

That means that he himself knows that  the Ministry  of National Development

has not done what  the P.A.P. has  promised.  For example,  Mr  Speaker,

the Government promised to set up a model fisheries  village in  order  to

help  the  poor fishermen  improve  their livelihood.  There is a Fisheries

Department  under  the Ministry  of National Development. But I would  like

to ask this question. Has the Fisheries Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



done  anything? Has the Minister himself fulfilled the promise by making

the Fisheries Department carry out the promise made during the elections?

The answer is no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from all the available facts, one can see that the Minister for National Development should be ashamed of the answer

that he has given us.  He  should not  be  proud of what he has said.

In the past, he  has talked  about  the allocation of goats to  the

Southern Islands.  But  I  have not as yet seen  him  making  any report

on the work of distributing goats to the  people of the Southern Islands.

There has been no report on the rearing  of goats in the Southern Islands.

What  is  the progress  made in this respect? If there  has  been  any

progress and success in this field, I am quite sure, Mr Speaker, the Minister

for National Development would not have  neglected this aspect of his

achievements. So  one can  see  very  clearly  that he  has  not  been

paying attention   to  the  livelihood  of  the   farmers   and fishermen.

Neither has he carried out the promises  made by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the present lot of the rural people is extremely difficult.

They are in great misery. The  eggs produced  by  the farmers are taxed

if they  are  to  be exported   from   Singapore  to  the   Federation.

The Government has not been able to explain why that  should be  so.

Neither has it been able to pacify the  farmers over  this  matter.

All that the Government can  say  is that on the advent of the common market,

everything will be solved. This actually amounts to drawing a biscuit on the

wall,  and telling you that the biscuit is  on  the wall  and

that you can enjoy it. But, as  a  matter  of fact,  a biscuit on the wall

is of no use to the stomach at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the Minister for National Development wants to establish confidence among the farmers

in  all the departments under him, then I think he should go all out to

implement the promises made. It is no use for him to boast about figures.

They are not very useful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is fully aware of

the difficulties now being experienced by farmers,  particularly those

engaged in the  rearing  of poultry.  My  Ministry  and  the  Ministry

of  National Development   have  been  keeping  the  position   under

observation for quite some time. It is quite unnecessary for Members of

the Barisan opposite to make reckless and unfounded charges. You will

remember, Mr Speaker,  Sir, that towards the end of last year and the

first month or two  of this year, the farmers were experiencing an even

more  difficult time than they are passing through  now. At  that  time,

the reason was largely due  to  certain measures  taken by the

Government of the  Federation  of Malaya when it restricted the

export of eggs and poultry from  Singapore to the Federation. That matter,

you will remember, Sir, was solved in a very satisfactory way and brought

immediate  improvement  to  the   economy   of Singapore's  poultry farmers.

Now they are  experiencing difficulties partly because of the fall in the

price  of eggs. We are fully aware of the reasons for this decline in

prices, and measures to meet the situation are  well in  hand  and

preparation of these measures  is  in  an advanced  stage. It is merely

a matter of  examining  to what  extent  the present decline in the price

of  eggs reflects  the basic imbalance or disequilibrium  in  the supply

and demand position, and to what extent it is due to  temporary factors.

It is an experience common to all countries  because prices of agricultural

products -   not only  eggs - are extremely sensitive to changes in  supply and

demand. Other countries also have experienced a very rapid and catastrophic

decline in prices of agricultural products. This is inherent in many

agricultural products because  of  the  delicate balance  between  supply

and demand.  The  measures that are required to improve  the situation are

fairly easy to carry out. But, at the same time, we must remember that

we have to take into account not  only  the  livelihood of the farmers

but  also  the effect on the consumers in general. It is quite easy  to

bring about a high level



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



of   prosperity  for  farmers  by,

say,   creating   an artificial shortage of food-stuffs.

The farmers would do very  well;  they  would make a lot of money.

But  that would be at the expense of other people who have to  pay high

prices  for  food.  That  obviously  is  not   the desirable  thing,

because it means that you  are  really shifting prosperity from one

sector of the population to the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Mr Speaker,

Sir, measures  to remedy  the  situation  are  in  an  advanced  stage  of

preparation  and  will be carried out  in  the  not  too distant future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this point here because I want to make it clear that when these

measures are carried  out,  they  are entirely  measures undertaken by the

Government  in  the interests of the farmers. They do not at all reflect

in the slightest degree anything that is said by Members of the  Barisan

opposite, because what they have  told  us today   is  nothing  new.

Further,  they  have  grossly distorted  the  picture  to the extent

that  they  have deliberately neglected to give a proper picture  of

the measures  that the Government has taken in the past  and is taking

and is continuing to take and will continue to take in the future in the

interests of the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is very

easy  for Members of an irresponsible Opposition to make political capital

out  of  the  hardships of  a  section  of  the population. It is easy to

blame the decline of prices of eggs  on  the wickedness of the Government,

but such  an argument  can  only  deceive little  children,  and  the

immature  minds which make up the bulk of the  followers of the Barisan

Sosialis. They will not deceive any adult with any brains to think,

eyes to see, and ears to hear. Just  as  in  the same way. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have Members  of an irresponsible Opposition saying that

the present  water shortage is duo to acts of negligence  of the

present  Government, when it has been  demonstrated clearly  by facts

and figures that if there was any  one person who was responsible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



for past neglect in the carrying development schemes for water  in

advance,  that  one person  former  Mayor  of Singapore, at the Member

for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I advise the Barisan Sosialis

not to shed any crocodile tears on  behalf  of farmers   whom  they

claim  quite  wrongly  have   been neglected by the Government?

The position is being  kept under  close  observation, and measures to

correct  the situation are in hand, and they will be taken at a

time of our choosing and not at a time when these foolish and immature

young irresponsible politicians think  that  we should.  And,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  when  we  take  those measures, not only will the measures and the

timing  and the  manner in which they are carried out be made  clear to

them but they will also see the purpose behind it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we know that the policy of the P.A.P. concerning

farmers and fishermen is to  help them increase their daily produce.

But what  do we  see now? The fishermen and farmers are now suffering

very much, and I want to know whether the Government has any plan to

help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true the Government has built quite a

number of veterinary centres in the villages, but it  is not  enough

because the daily produce  of  the  farmers still cannot be increased.

For the fishermen it is  even worse.  The policy of the Government to

help the farmers and  fishermen  has failed. The plan to  set  up

a  co-operative society has not been carried out by the P.A.P. Government.

This plan is stated in The Tasks  Ahead  of the P.A.P. Most of the people

living in the kampongs earn their living by rearing poultry and planting

vegetables. The  Government  does not help them but only  make  them suffer.

It  can be seen in the case of Toa Payoh  where many people earn their living

in the way I stated above. These people have now been forced to move out from

their houses and to live in places which they cannot afford. I hope

that before the Government collapses, it  will  do something for the

farmers and the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

regarding the items under the Head Ministry of  National

Development, Members of the Barisan Sosialis  have  made

many  allegations. They pretend that they are  champions

of   the   farmers.  Although  they  come   from   rural

constituencies,  they  very seldom  go  to  their  rural

constituencies. If they should go to the rural areas, it

is only for their own individual benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on any matter, theory is one thing and

practice is another thing. Members of  the  Barisan Sosialis

can  put forward many beautiful  theories  but when  they want

to put them into practice, they can only draw biscuits on the

wall to satisfy their hunger.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding farming activities in the rural areas, we

have  to  understand the background to these  activities

and  the background to all the occupations in Singapore.

Farming is only a secondary industry, and that is why we

have  to  push  forward  our  industrialisation  scheme.

Without industrialisation, to whom can you sell eggs and

poultry?  If  there  had been more blank  votes  in  the

referendum  last  year, perhaps the farmers  would  have

been   more  miserable  this  year.  They  cannot   even

understand a simple and fundamental issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to see that the increase in farm produce is in

keeping  with the increase of population.  This  is  the

result of farmers using modern techniques of production.

If there has been an increase in their produce, the only

problem is the problem of marketing their produce. If we

were  to  talk only without devising a method to  expand

our  markets,  it  would not help. The Members  opposite

always talk of helping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



the farmers, but when we carry out construction of roads

and  bridges in the rural areas, they make use of  their

united   front  organisations,  such  as  the  Singapore

Country  People's Association, to frustrate and obstruct

our work. Can they say that they are helping the farmers

in  this way? Can they deny what they have done? As  far

as  I know, when we carry out some schemes, many persons

pretend  to be farmers, but when we want to check  their

identity cards, they all run away. These are facts.  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to waste the time of this House, but I

wish only to rebut their argument. That is the end of my

speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister like to wind up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu was

quoting  prices of eggs and poultry. If  they  were  not

incorrect prices, I would not have taken up the time  of

the  Assembly. He mentioned that the price of an egg  is

now  6  cents as compared with about 10 or 11  cents  in

1948/49.  I  have  here, Sir, ex-farm  egg  and  poultry

prices  compiled by the Department of Primary Production

dated  9th June, 1963. There are two prices of eggs  ex-farm,  one  for small eggs and one for large  eggs.  For

small  eggs it was 7½ cents on 8th June, 1963. For large

eggs  it  was 8½ cents 19th June, 1963. The  Member  for

Jalan  Kayu mentioned just now that the price is only  6

cents. What was his intention in saying those things? We

have  officers who go round the farms all over Singapore

island. The Member for Jalan Kayu has a farm of his own.

He rears ducks, poultry and pigs, but he comes into this

Assembly  and deliberately gives false information  with

the  idea  of  saying that the Government is  not  doing

anything  for  the people of Singapore.  He  quotes  the

prices  of poultry as 80 cents or 90 cents per katty.  I

have  got  here official figures. There are two  figures

for  poultry  - cockerel per katty on 8th June, 95  cents;

for pullet, $1.45 per katty. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



in  the  figures that he quotes and the official figures

that  are  collected by my Department,  there  are  wide

margins  of  differences. As I have said, he comes  into

this Assembly deliberately to mislead people and to give

false information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are doing it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> When he mentioned rural bankruptcy, I

thought he meant the bankruptcy of the farmers,  but  he

stood  up the second time and mentioned something  about

feed-merchants - merchants  who  sell  feed-stuff  to  the

farmers.  He  is more concerned about the bankruptcy  of

these feed-merchants than the farmers. He mentioned that

because these feed-merchants have to give credit to  the

farmers  and because some of these farmers have  refused

to pay up their money, so the retailers and whole-salers

of  feed-stuff  arc going bankrupt. These  are  entirely

different  matters. He is more concerned with the  feed-merchants who are losing money than the farmers who  are

having  more  produce from their farms  - as admitted  by

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang. But the Member for Changi

stood  up later on and said the exact opposite  to  what

the Member for Choa Chu Kang said. He said that there is

no increase a production in the rural areas. They are ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are twisting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Member said that I am

twisting.  I would like to refer to the Official  Report

of  what  he said. They are good for twisting what  they

say  and  what other people say. How do you  expect  the

people  of Singapore to believe in the Barisan  Sosialis

if they keep on doing this sort of thing!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why do you not go to Paya Lebar?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> My friend, don't you ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Minister, let us carry on

with this debate. Ignore the interruptions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu - I call him

the   Member  for  Kayu - mentioned  about  farmers  being

bankrupt, poultry rearers having chicken runs  that  are

empty  and  dilapidated now. Sir, I have  recently  been

visiting  the  rural constituencies  together  with  the

Prime  Minister  and,  in  fact,  I  have  visited  more

constituencies unofficially because it  is  my  duty  as

Minister  for  National Development to  look  after  the

interests  of the rural folks. [Interruption] These  are

the  Members  from the Barisan Bench who do  not  bother

about  their  constituents;  they  only  go  into  other

constituencies  to  disturb the progress  of  Government

construction work in these constituencies. That  is  why

they do not know what is going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last constituency that I visited with the

Prime  Minister  was the Punggol constituency  and  this

constituency,  as  can be verified  by  the  Member  for

Punggol, has the most number of poultry farmers. In  the

Punggol  constituency, wherever you go into the  kampong

tracks,  you  will  find the residents  have  their  own

chicken runs. As I have said, they are now having  their

chickens  kept in cages and all these cages seem  to  be

expanding more and more and occupying more space,  which

simply  means that the Barisan Members are just  talking

through  their hats. The poultry-rearers  and  the  pig-rearers  in Singapore are enjoying a boom in production,

although prices have fluctuated, but they have not  gone

so  low,  as suggested by the Barisan Members, that  the

farmers are going bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Pasir Panjang, he was half-laughing and I could not understand what he was saying.

Sir, if Members in this House cannot understand what  he

is trying to say, how do you expect him to be able to do

anything for his constituency? [Interruption] The Member

for  Choa Chu Kang, as I mentioned the other day, is out

of  his mind again. He mentioned, in the same way as the

Member for Changi did, that we have not done anything to

help  the  farmers and the fishermen and  that  we  have

failed  to form a co-operative society which we  put  in

our The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



Tasks  Ahead.  Sir, I have not intended to say  anything

about this thing because it reflects on someone in  whom

I  had  faith at one time. When I took over the Ministry

of National Development from the Member for Hong Lim,  I

worked  out a scheme with a gentleman whom I  sent  away

twice in two years for special training to initiate this

farming co-operative work. But, unfortunately, after his

second trip overseas when he had imbued himself with all

the  necessary knowledge and experience to come and form

this  co-operative society, he deflected from the Party.

That,  more  or less, dashed the hopes of the Government

to  form the co-operative society. It was wrong  on  our

part in this sense, that we had placed too much faith in

a  man  whom we thought would be going along with us  to

help  the  farmers of Singapore. But because  he  is  no

longer  with  us,  we have suffered a  setback  in  this

respect. But, as is stated in The Tasks Ahead, this  co-operative society is to help buy feed-stuff, import feed-stuff,  and sell it cheaply to the farmers and to import

fertilisers and sell these fertilisers at low prices  to

help farmers reduce their cost.



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the fact that we have suffered a setback

in  forming  this  rural co-operative society,  we  have

managed  to  produce a cheap fertiliser which  has  been

experimented and used by farmers themselves and liked by

them.  This  cheap fertiliser is being sold through  the

extension centres and the rural community centres to the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards fisheries, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  has  again  said  that the  Ministry  of  National

Development  has not kept its election pledges.  I  have

many times mentioned in this Assembly what the Fisheries

Department  has done for the fishermen of Singapore.  We

have  started  two Fisheries Training  Schools  to  help

children of fishermen in how to service their boats  and

how to go around using modern techniques of fishing.  We

have  also  a  mobile  unit attached  to  the  Fisheries

Department  which  is  on  call to  service  fishermen's

boats.  We  have  also  encouraged local  fishermen  and

fishing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



merchants  to go in for deep-sea fishing.  All  in  all,

Sir,  the Fisheries Department has done what it possibly

can to help the fishing industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come back to the Member for Changi. He has

mentioned just now about Toa Payoh farmers being  forced

out  of  the  area by the Government, whether  they  are

deprived  of  their livelihood. Sir,  I  have  mentioned

before in this Assembly the scheme in Toa Payoh and what

we  are  doing  to help the settlers move  out  of  that

place.  Sir, out of 184 families who are living  in  the

Phase  1  project of this Toa Payoh Scheme, 125 families

have already moved out. To cater for the different needs

of  these families, flats, house lots, farm lots,  basic

terrace  houses and shops have been offered and accepted

by  these  people. Acceptance of such offers means  that

they  will  continue to have a livelihood of their  own,

and   in  many  cases  it  will  improve  their  present

conditions.  People  have  been  offered  basic  terrace

houses  from  which they can carry on with  their  small

cottage  industry. Others have moved into farm lots  and

house lots whereby they can carry on with their farming.

Industrial resettlement cases will be considered for the

Kallang  industrial site. Compensation rates  have  also

been well received by settlers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have not been able to move these

people  and carry on with this Toa Payoh Scheme for  two

years  is because of agitation from the Country People's

Association  and the Barisan boys. But as I  have  said,

Sir,  those  farmers from the Toa Payoh  area  who  have

moved  out have moved out to a place which is acceptable

to them, and unless they are good offers, they would not

have accepted them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (3)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns Political Secretary. This

subject  has been brought up at every Budget debate  and

hon. Members will remember that in 1961



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



when  we  had  our  last  Budget debate,  there  was  an

assurance given by the Deputy Prime Minister that if  it

was  found  by  the  Government that the  post  was  not

necessary,  they  would abolish  it.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister, in accordance with that undertaking,  has  now

abolished  the  post  of  Political  Secretary  in   his

particular  Ministry. In this Ministry and  as  well  as

other   Ministries,  where  they  have  the  votes   for

Political  Secretaries, it would seem that the  Minister

for  National  Development  wants  to  keep  this  vote,

although, since that vote was put in, there has been  no

Political  Secretary at all in that  Ministry.  Sir,  we

cannot  forget  the  tragedy of  Political  Secretaries.

Three of them are now in gaol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said in 1961,

I  had to be very careful in selecting a person to  this

post.  Sir,  in the past 12 months, I have  been  trying

some  people  out  to see whether they would  suit  this

post. I have yet to find the man. But I am hopeful  that

in  the not too distant future I will be able to find  a

man to fill this post.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am happy that the Minister

has been trying his best to find a man to fill the post,

but  I  do  hope  that the Minister  will  not  find  it

necessary  to  put that man in gaol as  other  Ministers

have found it necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Tan

Cheng Tong ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (22)  of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (3). Mr Tan Cheng Tong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (48)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item concerns Assistant Primary Production

Officers.  All  that I want to know is  that  last  year

there  were  ten such appointments; so why  is  there  a

necessity to increase the number to 34? Another question

is,  what  are  the  duties of these  officers?  In  the

meantime, what is the manner in which these officers are

appointed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, when we came te power in 1959,

we felt that there were many problems in the rural areas

which needed to be looked into so that solutions can  be

found to assist the farmers and fishermen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there were 24 temporary posts of Rural

Organisers  created. After some time, it was found  that

the work carried out by these temporary Rural Organisers

was  essential,  so it was decided this work  should  be

expanded  and  the  temporary posts of Rural  Organisers

should be made permanent so that the holders could carry

out their work more effectively and efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 24 permanent posts of Assistant Primary Production

Officers  (Rural Development) were created in  order  to

bring  them  in  line  with the ten  existing  Assistant

Primary  Production Officers (Rural Development)  posts.

These  24  new posts were advertised in the English  and

vernacular  papers  by application. Out  of  nearly  395

applicants, the Public Service Commission selected 24 to

fill the posts. As it is the policy of the Government to

provide better and more efficient services, the work  of

these  Assistant  Primary Production Officers  has  also

been increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now posted in the various rural districts of

Singapore   to   investigate   farmers'   problems   and

complaints,  to  carry out agricultural surveys  and  to

provide  primary  production services such  as  sale  of

fertilisers,   tractor  service,  poultry   inoculations

through the rural community centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

surprised  that  it took the Government  four  years  to

realise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



importance  of the primary production of the State.  And

eventually  they  have  to  make  these  24  new   posts

permanent. I want to ask whether these 24 new posts  are

meant  for  those  temporary officers  or  entirely  new

officers.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I would

like  to ask the Minister concerned this question. Since

new  appointments have been made, why is  it  that  five

holders of the original posts were dismissed from  their

posts?  As far as I know, these five dismissed employees

started  work in 1959. They were living in the  district

of Punggol. Their work was in the region of Tampines and

Punggol and the farmers who had been served by them were

very  happy and satisfied with their services. So  I  do

not  know for what reason they have been dismissed.  Can

the Minister enlighten us?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> First, I must correct the Member for

Punggol. These posts that we are talking about  are  for

Primary Production Officers (Rural Development) and they

are  not part-time inoculators whom he meant. The  part-time inoculators come under the temporary posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come back to the Member for Havelock. What I

have  said  just  now. Sir, is that when  we  came  into

office,  we  knew  the  importance  of  having  services

supplied  to the rural areas, so we created 24 posts  at

that  time.  Last  year  we  changed  these  posts  into

permanent posts. It does not mean that when these  posts

were temporary the people were not doing their work. But

he  is  saying it took us four years to realise that  we

have to have these posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the men to fill these 24 posts, 22 of these

24 posts are filled by new applicants and two of the old

Rural  Organisers were selected to fill  the  other  two

posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

explanation given by the Minister just now was that  the

24



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



posts  were  temporary until this year  when  they  were

changed  to permanent. What I do not understand in  that

those  five  who  were  dismissed  were  also  temporary

officers.   Why  were  they  not  made  into   permanent

officers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I do not think the Member

understood what I said. What I meant was that these  are

higher  posts than the posts filled by the five  persons

that  he  mentioned just now. Those five whose  services

were terminated were part-Time inoculators. They were in

temporary  posts  which are different  from  these.  The

posts  of  Assistant Primary Production Officers  (Rural

Development)  are  Grade III-24. The  qualification  for

these  posts  is  Senior Middle III or Cambridge  School

Certificate or equivalent qualification, and  the  posts

were  filled by these five gentlemen who were  dismissed

sometime  ago, as mentioned by the Member  for  Punggol,

and  who carried no such qualifications. What I mean  is

that  these  five  gentlemen  cannot  fill  these  posts

because  they  do  not have the qualifications  to  fill

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as

far  as  I  know, one of these five people  possesses  a

School Certificate.

and Mr Ng Teng Kian.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the work of the Director of the Work

Brigade  is  to  supervise the work of  members  of  the

Brigade,  but he has not only been unable to fulfil  his

duties,  but he also took instructions from the Minister

to  send  members of the Work Brigade to  certain  rural

areas  where the Prime Minister was touring  to  put  up

banners  with  slogans  such as "Our  meritorious  Prime

Minister".  He  was also instructed by the  Minister  to

send  members of the Work Brigade to erect  arches  even

during the middle of the night in rural areas where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



the  Prime Minister would be going. During the  national

referendum, the mass rallies organised by the P.A.P. did

not  attract the masses, and so they had to send members

of  the Work Brigade to attend the mass rallies. If they

did  not  turn  up, then they would have their  salaries

cut.  Apart  from  this,  if the  Ministers,  the  Prime

Minister,  or  trade  unionists  are  going  abroad   or

returning from abroad, members of the Work Brigade  will

be  sent to the airport to receive them or to send  them

off. If they do not do so, they will have their salaries

cut. Their duty should be to work during the daytime and

do some useful construction work, and they should not be

regarded  as a sort of instrument or as machines  to  be

carted here and there, or to disguise as the masses,  or

as   residents  of  rural  areas  welcoming  the   Prime

Minister.  The  significance  of  the  Work  Brigade  is

entirely lost.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Pasir Panjang

should  take  notice that there are  only  five  minutes

left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Furthermore, we know

that  the  Work Brigade is also engaged in  sandwashing.

When the Work Brigade was washing sand at Kaki Bukit  at

a  time the whole of Singapore was water-rationed,  they

made  use of pipe water for washing sand. The Government

sells  the  sand  at only $9 per lorryload  whereas  the

actual cost is very high. And now that the price of sand

has risen to $17 or $18 per lorryload, the Government is

selling it cheap to building contractors as if this sand

is  valueless. That is why I ask for a reduction of  $10

for this vote.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Tanglin wish to say

a few words before the Minister replies?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The Member for Pasir Panjang has

mentioned that the Director of the Work Brigade is  only

obeying  what  I instructed him to do,  and  not  to  do

duties  of the Work Brigade like building kampong roads,

bridges and all the other amenities that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



we  are  bringing to the kampong folks through the  Work

Brigade.  What  he is trying to do is to get  people  to

believe that the work of the Work Brigade is only to  go

out  and prepare for the Prime Minister's visits and  to

send  people  off  at the airport. These  are  practices

which  were carried out by the Barisan Sosialis Members,

like  the  Member for Toa Payoh, when they were  running

the  Work  Brigade. He was a Supremo  at  that  time.  I

remember  when he left for Europe sometime in  1960.  He

had  a  group of these Work Brigade members to send  him

off without my knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Supremo?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Well, he was known as Supremo at that

Time!  He was then trying to make believe that  we  used

pipe   water  for  sandmining  operations  of  the  Work

Brigade.  This is a clear distortion of fact.  He  knows

very  well that no sand-miner uses pipe water. All sand-miners use water from ponds that collect rainwater,  and

some operators even use seawater to wash sand. But he is

trying to twist facts in such a way that the sandwashing

work  of  the Work Brigade is wasting water from  pipes.

Then  he  mentioned about a lorryload of sand  from  the

Work  Brigade being sold at $9 or $10. Sir,  I  remember

reporting  to  this Assembly sometime ago - probably  in

answer  to  a question asked by him - that at that  Time

the price of sand was $12 for 4 cubic yards. Last month,

the  price  of 4 cubic yards of sand has been raised  to

$l6.  But  he  is trying to tell us that  we  are  using

Government land, mine this sand, and sell it at  a  loss

to  the  profit  of con-tractors. What a  distortion  of

facts!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang lives in Tampines. He is

not  living  among his constituents, nor does  he  visit

them. But he lives in an area where mining operation  is

in  full  blast. He knows the method of mining sand.  He

also knows what are the illegal ways of mining sand.  He ---

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I ask the Minister concerned whether he is aware that whenever the Prime Minister pays a visit to the rural areas, he always promises the people there that he will install street lights and build road-drains and bridges. Is the Minister for National Development aware that these actions of the

Prime  Minister  are to show that it is  his  merits?  I

should  say that it is not his merits. All these  things

should  have been carried out by the Government, because

the people are paying taxes. The Government levies taxes

on  them, and it has the duty to carry out all this kind

of  construction  work, to build roads  and  to  install

street lights where they are lacking. Sewerage should be

looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be repaired whenever it is necessary to do

so. Whenever the Prime Minister goes to the rural areas,

he  will promise the people that the Government will  do

this  and  that for them in order to carry out political

propaganda.  That  is  why  I would  like  the  Minister

concerned to pay attention to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. In many outlying rural areas,

in   the  Sembawang  constituency,  the  Government   is

installing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



many street lights and metalling the roads, whereas  the

Government  is not going to in the other constituencies.

Does  it  mean  that  this is  a  way  to  do  political

propaganda,  to  prepare  the way  for  the  future  by-election  in that constituency? Is it to make  political

capital for that event?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the

Prime  Minister has explained the objects of  his  rural

visits,  the Member for Serangoon Gardens still  insists

on  twisting those objects The development of the  rural

areas  with  regard  to roads, lighting,  drains,  stand

pipes,  has  been going on for the last four years.  The

Prime  Minister  goes  to  the rural  constituencies  to

understand  further the needs of such  people.  But  the

process  of supplying all these amenities in  the  rural

areas has been going on for four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member brought up the subject of the

Sembawang constituency. I do not think he has been  down

there. I do not think he knows the conditions that  have

existed  since June 1959. For his information, the  late

Assemblyman for that constituency did a lot of  work  in

that constituency for his constituents. The constituents

of  Sembawang knew very well, much more than the  Member

for  Serangoon Gardens knows, that when the  late  Inche

Ahmad was alive, he was looking after their welfare very

well.  He  did it very much better than the  Member  for

Serangoon   Gardens  who  has  not   appeared   in   his

constituency for over a year. I say this, Sir, because I

have been down to his constituency lately to see to  the

needs  of  his  constituents. And in the same  way,  his

constituents told me that their Assemblyman was  not  to

be seen, was not to be heard and when he goes back ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has lost his revolutionary fervour!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> --- and when he goes back, they say

they will see to it that he loses his deposit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the  Public  Works  Department  is  in  charge  of

building projects throughout the whole island  - urban  or

rural - projects relating to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



building  of roads, street lights and other such  works.

At  the  moment, this department is not doing its normal

round  of duty. This round of duty is being handed  over

to  the Prime Minister to carry out. I do not understand

whether  the present Public Works Department has already

been   transferred  from  the  Minister   for   National

Development to the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have seen in the past that many roads, bridges and lights in the rural areas were in such a condition that the Members of those constituencies suggested to the Government to improve them. The Public Works Department did not carry out the work of maintenance and repair. Only when the Prime Minister was about to visit the rural areas did they

issue  the so-called development projects, in  which  it

was  announced that various works and projects would  be

carried out. All this is the normal round of work to  be

done  by  the Public Works Department, but the villagers

have  to  wait  until the Prime Minister  comes  to  the

constituency  before  they  can  get  all  these  normal

services   which  they  deserve;  whereas  the  projects

announced by the Prime Minister when he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



visited the rural areas were past projects, and not new

ones. But the Government, in order to achieve its

purpose of propaganda
