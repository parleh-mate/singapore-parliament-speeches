<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I, on behalf of all the  Members

of  this  House, extend to you our congratulations

on the occasion of your re-election as Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my pleasure, Sir, in January, 1970, on

your  election to this high office for  the  first

time, to extend to you the congratulations of  the

House.  I  stated  then that you were  the  fourth

person   to  hold  this  high  office  since   the

introduction of parliamentary government, and that

you had broken what could have crystallised into a

convention  that the office of the Speaker  should

fall  on  the  shoulders of  those  with  a  legal

training.  Over  these  last  two  years  and  ten

months,  you  have  ably demonstrated  that  legal

qualifications are not a sine qua non for  wearing

the mantle of this office. The aplomb, dignity and

mariner in which you have so ably discharged  your

responsibilities amply confirms  you  as  the  one

most fitted to guide our proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will be presiding over deliberations of

an enlarged Chamber of 65 Members, of whom no less

than  11 will be taking their seats in this  House

for  the first time. I have no doubt that you will

give   these  new  Members  the  same  considerate

guidance that you have shown to all of us  in  the

past.  You may be assured, Sir, that for our part,

we  will continue to give you all the co-operation

necessary for the speedy despatch of parliamentary

business.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would first like to thank the

Leader  of the House for his kind words on my  re-election

as Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Prime Minister, honourable Ministers,

honourable  Members, you have greatly honoured  me

by re-electing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



me  as  Speaker  of this House  and  I  feel  very

privileged to continue to serve the House in  this

high and responsible office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first election to this Chair on the 27th of

January,  1970,  was a proud  moment  in  my  life

though  I  must  say  it  was  not  without   some

trepidation as I appreciated then, as  I  do  now,

the  responsibilities of this office. However, the

unstinted  co-operation of honourable  Members  of

the   House  greatly  lightened  my  task  in  the

Speaker's Chair. The majority of you here now were

then  with  me in Parliament and I would  like  to

express my gratitude to you for your kindness  and

indulgence at any of my shortcomings and also  for

your  loyalty to me. If I had seemed on  occasions

to  have been stern, believe me, I was striving to

adhere strictly to the rules of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to welcome the new honourable Members who

have  joined  us. I have no doubt that  the  older

Members  will be happy to advise you on  procedure

not  only in this House but also in the Committees

of  the House. Do remember that Mr Speaker is your

friend though he may at times not appear to be so.

I may add that my staff will also be ever ready to

assist you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I would like to assure honourable

Members  that I will do my utmost to be worthy  of

your  confidence  in me and to uphold  the  rules,

dignity and decorum of this august body.

the  Chamber, accompanied by Mr Speaker,  who  was

preceded  by  the  Serjeant at Arms  (without  the

and the Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Clerk announcing "The President", the

President delivered his Opening Speech.

<br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</b></div>



<br><br>6.46 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares):</b> Honourable Members, we meet today under

circumstances   vastly   different   from    those

prevailing  when the last Parliament was  convened

on  6th May, 1968. Then, the prospects were  grim.

We  faced the stark question of survival:  how  to

hold  up  the  economy, to generate jobs,  of  any

kind, to mop up massive unemployment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will to succeed was decisive. Sheer

determination,  hard work and  realistic  planning

enabled  Singapore to make the grade.  Imaginative

policies,  combined  with  tough  measures,   have

minimised  the  economic and  social  dislocation.

Today's  continuing and controlled boom is  giving

Singapore that glow of success. There is  a  bloom

which  will spread from the city to the new towns,

and  through to the villages and kampongs  in  the

rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the challenge is to maintain and continue

this  rapid  pace  of  growth for  continued  high

growth rates. Then the trend towards a better life

for  everyone  willing to work  will  become  more

pronounced, and in more gracious surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot seek fame for sheer size. But we can

achieve  higher standards in everything, with  the

emphasis  on  quality, whether in  jobs,  schools,

hospitals,  social and recreational  amenities  or

homes.  We  can become a centre for excellence  in

all  fields important to our economic and cultural

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, we must fulfil two pre-conditions.

First,  smaller families-ideally  two

children  per family - so that more resources  and

care can be given to each child by the family  and

the  State. Second, Singapore must eschew  one  of

the characteristics of the welfare state syndrome,

where  everyone  expects others, not  himself,  to

work  harder  to carry the subsidies for  services

everyone wants. For us, a yet to be developed  and

fully   industrialised   society,   this   selfish

rejection  of  the  work ethic is  fatal.  On  the

contrary, hard work and high performance  must  be

encouraged  and rewarded. No one should  get  away

with enjoying services subsidised through the hard

work   of   others,   without   making   his   own

contribution,  to  the best  of  his  ability  and

capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last war, several countries in the West

set  out to create a more "cushioned" society. The

state  promised  to  provide  for  everyone,  from

cradle to grave. In the beginning, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



promised free pre-natal and accouchement services,

free medical and dental treatment, free spectacles

and  dentures, free education, free school  meals,

heavily  subsidised public housing,  and  generous

old-age pensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idealistic social philosophy was to cushion

people    from    the   harshness   of    personal

inadequacies,    and    the    sometimes     cruel

dispensations  of fortune. But, in the  course  of

the  last  27  years, this ideal  has  had  to  be

modified,  because of escalating  economic  costs,

and    worse,    because   of   the   debilitating

psychological   consequences   on   the    working

population. Policy makers soon found out that free

services  led to excessive use, and  much  abuse.

Gradually,  but  inevitably even  under  socialist

governments, substantial charges have  had  to  he

imposed on these initially almost free services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greater damage to the spirit and morale

of  a  people  was harder to correct.  A  profound

change  in  attitudes to work, and the absence  of

personal   shouldering  of  responsibility,   have

permeated   considerable   portions    of    their

societies.  They have reared a younger  generation

who now believe that the state owes them a living,

a  good  living. They believe the good  things  in

life  are  easy to come by, by mass agitation,  by

strikes,    and    through   confrontation    with

established authority. Quite a few of the  younger

trade  union  leaders do not believe that  rewards

should   be  equated  to  hard  work  or  personal

performance. They believe that all should be  paid

equally,  the industrious as well as the indolent.

Others,  who they are not quite clear about,  will

generate the wealth, the larger part of which  the

state  can  cream off to pay for the  comfort  and

welfare of themselves and their followers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, professionally trained men and

women,  instead  of  creating  wealth,  use  their

knowledge   and  ingenuity  to  defeat   the   tax

collector.  Many  high  income  professionals  and

entrepreneurs stop trying, and even stop  working,

in  order  not to make profits just before  surtax

rates. Or they spend lavishly on expense accounts,

and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



frills,  to  defeat the tax collector.  Some  even

commute  to  tax-free havens in the Caribbean  and

elsewhere, for more than six months of a year,  to

escape  income  tax on dividends from  investments

they   made   in  foreign  countries.  Singapore's

policies  must not cause this kind of  distortion,

or  the  workings of the competitive, achievement-oriented

society which have brought us to where we

are, will fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must and can keep our population growth small,

so  that  every child can be better fed,  clothed,

trained and nurtured. We cannot afford to get into

this  unhappy  vicious circle, the  something  for

nothing  syndrome. We must pay for what  we  want.

Everyone  must work to earn and pay  for  what  he

wants in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two fundamental areas, there must be heavy

subsidies. Good health and good education must  be

available to all. These are costly objectives. But

the user must pay a small percentage of the actual

cost. It is to remind him of the enormous cost the

rest  of  society is paying for him. This  nominal

payment  will also prevent abuse in  the  user  of

these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government intends to allow wages to go up,

but  in  a  steady  and orderly fashion.  However,

instead  of  increasing  taxes  on  his  increased

earnings, we shall leave the worker with  most  of

the increased income. Thus, the responsibility  of

what  he does with this increased income will rest

with each individual. He has to decide whether  be

wants  to  spend his money on luxury  articles  or

expensive services he does not really need, or  to

save his money in buying a home, or putting it  in

the  Post Office Savings Bank or investing  it  in

Government  bonds and stocks which yield  interest

or dividends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of our taxation policies must

encourage people to want to work hard and  to  cam

more,  so  that they can save more.  High  savings

lead  to  high capital accumulation,  and,  as  in

Japan, will enable more wealth to be generated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



Taxes will fall at least as much on spending as on

earnings, to encourage savings. We should not  get

caught  in  the  consumer-society before  we  have

become fully developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will try to earn more if he is allowed

to  retain  the  major part of  his  earnings,  to

invest  in  sound  enterprises which  can  further

increase  his  income. Many  a  newly  independent

state,  barely  developed, that have  promised  to

carry their voters from cradle to grave, have  had

their  backs broken. And it will take  decades  to

mend  the damage. Even highly developed industrial

societies  have  been beset with  ever  increasing

taxation  to meet ever higher subsidies in  social

services.  Even the most affluent  have  not  been

able to protect the pensioner and the fixed income

groups  from  being impoverished by inflation.  We

must learn from the lessons which others have paid

bitterly for, that nothing in life is for free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On constitutional and security matters, the last

few  years  have  shown that some  safeguards  are

necessary. Constitutional amendments will be  made

early  in this session of Parliament, so  that  no

surrender of our sovereignty, or any part thereof,

by  way of incorporation into, or federation with,

any  other  country is possible, unless two-thirds

of  the total electorate vote positively for it in

a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be criminal negligence to allow foreign

interests   with  large  financial  resources   to

manipulate  our  internal politics,  by  financing

Singapore    political   parties,    professional,

academic  and  other groups,  to  try  to  beguile

domestic opinion, especially if their efforts  are

insidiously  multiplied by purveying them  through

mass  media  set  up and supplied generously  with

funds  for this purpose. No foreign interests  can

be   allowed   to  take  over  Singapore   through

financing   and  manipulating  political   parties

through   their  naive  or  vain,  self-proclaimed

leaders.  Whether fools or knaves,  they  must  be

saved  from  their own follies or villainies  when

powerful groups set out to use them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this legislation will not prevent my

Government,  at  present or in  the  future,  from

joining  other  countries inside  or  outside  the

region,  in  arrangements for mutual security,  or

for  economic purposes, such as a free trade area,

and perhaps, eventually, even a common market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will also be introduced to ensure

that  all political parties will have their  party

expenditure and income periodically inspected. The

inspection  will be done by Supreme Court  Judges,

with  the help of accountants, auditors and  other

expert  examiners. The purpose of inspection  will

be  to  discover  whether foreign money  has  been

injected  directly or indirectly into any  of  our

political  parties. Where the Judge  is  satisfied

that   donations  are  genuinely  from   Singapore

donors, their identities and all other information

will not be disclosed, not even to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are present safeguards for future

contingencies. For the immediate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



present,  there are five challenging years  ahead.

They will not be free from the unexpected. But  an

alert people, in trim, and prepared to meet sudden

dangers, and to respond swiftly to sudden changes,

have  a more than even chance of overcoming  their

problems.  In  the  next  five  years,   may   the

deliberations of honourable Members help us all to

achieve,  in qualitative terms, what, in the  last

five, we have achieved in quantitative terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the President's speech, Mr

Speaker,  preceded by the Serjeant  at  Arms,  the

Clerk,  the Clerk-Assistant and the Second  Clerk-Assistant,

escorted the President (accompanied  by

two  A.D.C.s)  out of the Chamber, and  the  House

adjourned  without question put, pursuant  to  the

Standing Order.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<div align="right">Eight minutes past Seven o'clock p.m.</div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ADDENDUM TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>THE FIRST SESSION OF THE THIRD PARLIAMENT ON</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>THURSDAY, 12TH OCTOBER, 1972</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years, the principal objective

of  financial and economic policy in the  Republic

is  to  sustain  the momentum of  economic  growth

achieved  in  the last few years. The  package  of

incentives,  the  build-up of infrastructure,  the

sustained   effort  at  industrial  promotion   in

overseas  countries and the restructuring  of  our

financial   institutions   to   support   economic

expansion,  they have contributed to  the  present

state of Singapore's economic well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain the momentum that has been achieved, a

policy of "more of the same" would not be entirely

adequate.  This is because Singapore's targets  as

well as the socio-economic environment itself  are

not  those of the past. Today, it is no  longer  a

matter  of inducing more and more industries  into

Singapore, whatever the cost. It is possible to be

somewhat  more discriminating; to seek  industries

that do not ruin the environment, industries which

hold  good  prospects for the continuous upgrading

of  manpower  skills,  be they  plant  operatives,

supervisors  and  technicians,  or  higher   level

engineering  and scientific staff, and  industries

that  have  a  catalytic effect  on  the  economy,

encouraging  a  growth  of allied  and  supporting

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives, however, have to be reached

under  conditions totally different from those  of

five  years ago. There is no large pool  of  cheap

unemployed  workers.  But,  on  the  other   hand,

Singapore's   vocational  institutes,   industrial

training centres, Polytechnic and universities are

turning out each year more and more of the skilled

manpower that industry needs. And work permits are

issued,   liberally,  to  those   industries   and

enterprises  which  upgrade  the  skills  of   the

workers,  or where the level of sophistication  of

the products manufactured is high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more refined economic policy is required in the

new  situation to ensure that intending investors,

both from overseas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



as well as our own citizens, will be able  to

obtain  the  essential  factors  of  production  -

capital,  labour  and land - in such  proportions,

grades, skills and quantity as they may require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we succeed in this, we should see a

continuation  of the fast rate of economic  growth

of previous years, subject to one proviso. This is

that  no  severe  disruption of the  international

monetary  system  will occur to  seriously  affect

world  trade. An economy like Singapore's,  highly

geared   to  export  markets  of  the  world,   is

extremely  sensitive to changes in  conditions  in

world trade. There is little that Singapore can do

to   promote  the  badly  needed  reforms  of  the

international monetary system. What it can  do  is

to  protect itself against the adverse effects  of

economic   troubles  created  by  such   problems.

Fortunately for us, sufficient reserves have  been

accumulated  in  the  past  which   we   can   use

judiciously  to cushion off the worst  effects  of

such  crises. Also, the further development of  an

efficient  and  highly sophisticated  banking  and

financial  sector will help in providing solutions

to monetary problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should conditions be more or less as favourable

as  in  the  last  five years,  our  economy  will

continue  its robust rate of growth. The  Ministry

of  Finance should be able to meet its other  main

obligation, to provide sufficient funds  to  other

ministries   for   their  current   as   well   as

development needs. While changes in tax rates  and

additional  taxation may from  time  to  time,  be

necessary   or  desirable  to  effect  social   or

economic policies, continued economic growth  will

generate  the increased funds to be made available

to expanding ministries as in the past. As long as

the  economy  is  buoyant,  and  labour-management

relations sensible and reasonable, there  will  be

no  need  to impose major or painful increases  in

tax  rates. But it will be necessary to constantly

review the tax machinery to ensure a high level of

efficiency,   particularly  to  ferret   out   tax

evasion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rapid economic growth has given tax payers

the same tax rates for nearly seven years now,  it

has  created  a  major problem for the  government

services.  As  the  demand for skills  and  talent

increases, the problem of attracting and retaining

high  calibre personnel in the government services

has become increasingly severe. It is necessary to

reexamine  once  again the structure  of  pay  and

service  conditions  and to make  the  rewards  in

certain   departments,  ministries,   grades   and

professions more comparable to what they  can  get

in  the private sector. This is not a new problem.

But  whereas in the past we had resorted to ad hoc

solutions, it is now necessary to look for a  more

fundamental and lasting solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with increased rewards for, and

consequently    higher   costs   of,    Government

personnel,  it  will  be  necessary,  by   greater

mechanisation, and computerisation, to  streamline

the   organisation  of  the  Government  and   the

Statutory   Boards  to  increase  efficiency   and

productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to achieve quality in jobs, homes,

schools,   hospitals,  social   and   recreational

amenities, much more money will have to  be  spent

on  capital equipment, on more intensive and  more

prolonged   training   of  skilled   workers   and

technicians.  We  must  increase  our  capital  by

adding  to it what foreign investors can bring  in

by  way  of  machinery  and  foreign  exchange  in

manufacturing    industry   and   finance.    More

expenditure    will   go   into   educating    the

professionals,  engineers, scientists,  especially

in   Applied   Sciences,  computers  and   systems

analysis,   accountants,   architects,    doctors,

managers, bankers, lawyers, economists, and  other

professionals whose expertise is part  and  parcel

of  an  industrial society. We are producing  more

and   more   middle-technology  products,   whilst

developing  into  an  international  banking   and

financial centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The urgency over our defence build-up has

lessened  as  we now have some defence capability.

The  emphasis must now be to train men  to  higher

levels  of competence, and among the regulars,  to

develop  an  increasing sense of  professionalism.

Further,  the  range,  quality  and  intensity  of

training  of  technical and engineering  personnel

must  be  given the highest priority as  a  modern

armed  force uses weapons of great complexity  and

sophistication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With proper selection of personnel, with improved

systems  of training, with a clear-cut  policy  of

career  development, we shall achieve  quality  in

commanders  and staff officers in whom we  entrust

so  large a proportion of our young men. Then  the

prodigious  effort and enormous sums of  money  we

have  put  into  defence would  yield  returns  in

security  and stability which an efficient  combat

force  of high discipline, morale and professional

skill will provide.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in vastly a changed world. We are more

likely to safeguard what we have all built  if  we

face  squarely these changed conditions  and  make

the    adjustments,   however   inconvenient    or

unpleasant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The super powers and the major powers have

changed their relationships with each other.  They

were  dramatised  by President  Nixon's  visit  to

Peking  in  February, and to Moscow  in  May.  The

Japanese  Prime  Minister's  visit  to  Peking  in

September  in which 23 years of dogma that  Taiwan

was  China was thrown overboard showed how swiftly

they have changed their policies to meet a changed

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as conflict between the super powers

themselves  is  reduced, so their competition  for

power   and  influence  will  sharpen   in   third

countries, in the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

Singapore is neutral and non-aligned insofar as we

are  asked  to take sides between competing  power

blocs or competing ideologies. But, where our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



survival  is  concerned, we cannot  afford  to  be

neutral.  We will not stand nonaligned if  we  are

threatened by superior force. However there is  no

need  for the same haste as in 1968, in the build-up

of our defence capability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with our neighbours, through

ASEAN, we hope Southeast Asia will remain an  area

of  relative peace and stability, so that  now  we

and our neighbours can concentrate our efforts and

resources  on the reconstruction of our  societies

and   re-development  of  our  economies.  Perhaps

eventually a neutral Southeast Asia can be  agreed

upon  and guaranteed by the major powers. But  let

us  not forget that the Swiss were neutral but not

unarmed  in  two world wars. It was  because  they

were  capable of considerable defence that it  was

not   necessary  for  them  to  demonstrate  their

capacity.   Warring   parties   respected    their

neutrality  because not to do so would have  meant

large  forces  being  despatched  and  tied  down,

entangled with the Swiss military forces.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br><i>Modernisation of the Police</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of the new salaries and

conditions  of  service of  junior  officers,  the

Police  Force will have officers of better quality

and educational standards.



<br><br><i>Personnel</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) By the end of 1974, all junior officers

without  a  Secondary II education will have  been

retired.  Those who wish to may join in the  newly

established  Commercial  and  Industrial  Security

Corporation. The consequential vacancies  will  be

filled  by  recruitment of  junior  officers  with

School Certificate education or its equivalent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The reorganisation of the Police Force

involves    a    considerable    devolution     of

responsibilities  and duties on to  sergeants  and

constables.   These  duties  had   formerly   been

performed     by    inspectors    and    sergeants

respectively.  A flew training programme  designed

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



develop  and  increase  the  capacity  of   junior

officers  to  fulfil  these functions  is  already

underway.  It  should be completed over  the  next

three    years.    Once   this    devolution    of

responsibilities has been completed,  it  will  be

necessary  to  review  the officer  structure  and

strength of the Police Force.



<br><br><i>Criminal investigation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A centralised Criminal Intelligence Unit has been

the  subject  of  detailed study by  a  committee.

Their  recommendations  have  been  accepted   for

implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adviser on criminal investigation is being

appointed from the United Kingdom Police, with the

specific   objective  of  upgrading  investigative

skills in the Criminal Investigation Department as

well  as  improving  the  standards  of  detective

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forensic capability available to the Police

Force  is  developing in close co-ordination  with

the Chemistry Department.



<br><br><i>Prevention of Crime</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning from 1973, a system of team policing

will be introduced in two Divisions to replace the

traditional  beat  system. Team policing  involves

much more use of transport and communications. But

it  can  achieve  flexibility in crime  prevention

patrols.  If  this  system  is  successful   under

Singapore  conditions, team policing will  replace

traditional beat system in all Divisions.



<br><br><i>Physical Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operational organisation and deployment of

the  Police  requires  that  police  stations  and

establishments   be   strategically    distributed

throughout  the  island. Economic development  and

the building of new towns and housing estates have

led  to large scale population movements. This has

rendered  the  existing  distribution  of   police

stations out of date. Further, new roads  and  new

transport patterns and the latest developments  in

electronic communications



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



make  for  a  new  layout of control  between  the

policemen on patrol, the patrol car, Police HQ and

the  plan  for new police stations. These  changes

will be implemented in graduated phases.



<br><br><i>Development   of  Police  National   Service/Civil Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next four years the Vigilante Corps will

develop  its  full civil defence  role.  By  1973,

eight operation bases headquarters will be set up,

utilising   facilities   in   government   schools

throughout Singapore.



<br><br><i>Prisons</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including persons detained under the Criminal

Law, the prison population is about 2,400, each of

whom  costs about $8 a day to maintain. There  are

various    studies   undertaken   for   processing

prisoners in ways which will not only be more cost

effective  but  will  also  reduce  the  level  of

recidivism. This can be achieved by selective  use

of    deterrent   punitive   treatment   and   the

introduction  of training in industrial  work  and

disciplines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main emphasis in education is to improve the

quality   of   teachers,  teaching  methods,   and

teaching curriculum.



<br><br><i>Bilingual Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second language will be better taught through

improved methods, by teachers specially trained to

teach  the  mother tongue as a second language  in

English  schools, and English as a second language

in non-English schools. More time is being devoted

to  this. All teachers will eventually have to  be

bilingual.



<br><br><i>Curriculum Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational research and curriculum development

will  lead  to  a  continuous  re-evaluation   and

revision  of curricula so that what is  taught  is

relevant to the changing social and economic needs

of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Educational Media Service will be established

to  use  the  latest  in teaching  techniques  and

teaching aids.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching of subjects will be more related and

integrated   to   avoid  compartmentalisation   of

knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More time for extra-curricular activities will be

given,  by  reducing the classroom  workload.  The

stress  on  extracurricular  activities  will   be

encouraged  especially  in  the  cadet  and  other

uniformed   groups.  They  will   be   made   more

interesting   by   more  varied  activities   like

attachment  to Singapore Armed Forces  and  Police

Units on exercises, and training camps during  end

of year holidays. School Bands should improve with

the  return  of  several music teachers  who  have

graduated  from  music academies  in  Britain  and

Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civics will be taught to foster social discipline

and  national identity, to develop in the students

an  appreciation  of  moral and  cultural  values,

rather  than  learning,  sometimes  by  rote,  for

scoring marks in examinations.



<br><br><i>Technical Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary school curriculum will have a technical

bias. The aim is to provide a technically-inclined

school-leaver,  with sufficient grounding  in  the

theoretical  and  practical aspects  of  technical

education,   to   better  pursue   either   higher

technical        education       or        skilled

technical/vocational careers.



<br><br><i>Teacher-Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional skills of both teachers and

teacher-trainers   will  be   improved.   Teacher-training

courses will be restructured. There  will

be   more  refresher  courses  to  enable  serving

teachers to improve their teaching techniques  and

capabilities. There will be more opportunities for

teachers  who  wish to improve their academic  and

professional qualifications locally or  abroad  on

full pay or no pay leave as is appropriate in each

case.



<br><br><i>Staffing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more qualified teachers become available, the

teacher-student ratio will improve,  reducing  the

number  of  students  per class  to  provide  more

individual attention for each student.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will recruit more suitable graduate

teachers,  particularly for subjects in which  the

shortage  of  teachers  is  acute.  The  ratio  of

graduate to non-graduate teachers will be improved

in secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Restructured Education Service

outstanding  teachers  will get  rapid  promotion.

There  will be more effective deployment of talent

by  considering individual aptitudes and interests

of teachers when making postings.



<br><br><i>Educative Travel</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students and teachers will be given greater

opportunities for educative travel to neighbouring

countries through grants from the Education Fund.



<br><br><i>School Building Programme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and better-designed schools will be built in

the new satellite towns and large housing estates.

This  will relieve the present shortage caused  by

the  mass  shifts in population to these areas  in

the last few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage public participation in educational

development more generous assistance will be given

for the establishment of new aided schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more school buildings, the system of two

intakes  of Primary I children a year, at  present

available  only  in the Chinese  stream,  will  be

extended.  More secondary schools will  revert  to

single session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several more junior colleges, both government and

government-aided,  are  being  built.  They   will

provide   more  students  with  centralised   pre-university

education  along  the  lines  of   the

National Junior College.



<br><br><i>Tertiary Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and expansion of our tertiary

institutions   are  proceeding  as  planned.   The

University  of Singapore will complete  the  first

phase  of  the development of its new  Kent  Ridge

campus  by 1975. Nanyang University is drawing  up

plans for their physical and academic improvement.

The Singapore Polytechnic will completely move  to

its  new  campus at Dover Road. It will eventually

expand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



to   cater  for  8,000  students.  The  Ngee   Ann

Technical  College  will develop  and  expand  its

facilities eventually to take in 3,000.



<br><br><i>Industrial Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Industrial Training Board will be established.

This  Board will co-ordinate and promote all forms

of industrial skills training, both in educational

institutions and in industry itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive range of Apprenticeship schemes

is    being    worked    out.    Legislation    to

comprehensively   regulate   all    Apprenticeship

training will be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special attention will be concentrated on the

acquisition   of   precision   skills    in    the

manufacturing  and engineering sectors.  Meanwhile

the  Ministry will continue to develop  vocational

training  in selected manual and applied arts  and

service trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system of National Trade Tests will be

established  to achieve uniform standards  in  the

level of industrial skills attained.



<br><br><i>Education for the Handicapped</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to set up a Special Education Unit

to  co-ordinate the efforts of the Government  and

voluntary      organisations     in     vocational

rehabilitation for various handicapped groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Unit will help them adjust as much as is

possible  in their social and economic lives,  and

to enable them to lead useful lives.



<br><br><i>Adult Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education will be more closely linked with

the  school  system  on the  one  hand,  and  with

industrial training on the other. Adult  Education

is  a continuation of school education for as long

as   our   workers  wish  to  improve  themselves,

whatever   their  age  in  life,  whatever   their

standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphasis will be on off-the-job training to

improve  the technical competency of adult workers

through part-time courses, special ad hoc courses,

and other specialised training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board's programme of

recreational  and  enrichment  courses   will   be

expanded.  They  are to encourage  the  public  to

spend  their  leisure in more  wholesome  pursuits

giving     them    more    satisfaction    through

accomplishing something useful.



<br><br><i>Private Schools</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to safeguard public interest regulations

will  be  introduced for better control of private

schools, correspondence schools and kindergartens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing use of radioisotopes in industry,

hospitals and the universities there is a need  to

ensure that hazards to health from radiation  will

not  arise. A bill will be introduced to  regulate

the  importation  and  usage of  radionuclides.  A

radiation   protection   inspectorate   will    be

established  as  part of the Government  Chemistry

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent widespread outbreak of cholera in

Singapore  has also indicated a need  for  regular

microbial  analyses  of  food  and  water  samples

besides the detection of chemical additives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the increase in the functions of the

Chemistry   Department   the   present    physical

facilities at Outram Road have remained  unchanged

since 1939. They are now inadequate and a plan  is

being drawn up to transfer the Department to a new

location.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next five years, the Ministry of

Communications   will  expand  and   improve   the

Republic's communications infrastructure, on land,

sea,  air  or in space, to be up-to-date with  the

latest  development in Communications,  worthy  of

our  position  as  one  of the  centres  of  World

Communications.



<br><br><i>Road Transportation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reorganisation of the Public Bus

Service  18  months  ago,  the  three  public  bus

companies have added over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



1,100 new buses to their fleet bringing it up to a

total  of  over 2,000 buses. The school bus  fleet

has  also been increased from 149 to 1,360, whilst

the  number  of taxis is close to 4,900  of  which

2,600 are new vehicles. The setting up of the NTUC

Transport  Co-operative  has  enabled  more   taxi

drivers to be owner drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid physical paralysis, arising out of

traffic  congestion,  we  are  now  undertaking  a

feasibility  Mass Transit Study,  with  assistance

from the United Nations Development Programme  and

the  World  Bank.  The study  is  expected  to  be

completed  in  a year's time and will  provide  us

with  plans  on transport systems and a  judicious

allocation of our limited land and road  resources

to achieve efficient domestic transportation.



<br><br><i>Port Expansion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet increasing and a pattern of changing

demands, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA)  is

continuously adjusting its services and  upgrading

equipment   and  installations.  The  West   Coast

Reclamation Project, when completed in 1975,  will

add  about  1,300  meters of wharves  for  use  by

coastal  vessels and lighters, and 239,000  square

meters  of  transit  sheds  and  warehouses.   New

facilities will be added to the Sembawang Port  to

enable  it  to handle high-volume cargo  (such  as

rubber and timber) economically and quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very substantial investment in the container

port  development at the East Lagoon represents  a

quantum  jump forward for the PSA. Singapore  will

continue  to  be the major port of  call  for  the

increasing number of container-ships on the Europe-

Far East run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study is being made into the feasibility of

establishing  a  modern bulk oil storage  farm  at

Pulau  Brani  linked  by submarine  pipes  to  the

reticulation  system  along  the  Keppel  wharves,

aimed  at  increasing the speed and efficiency  of

Singapore's oil bunkering operations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Vast expansion programme to provide a new

passenger  terminal, air cargo complex, Jumbo  Jet

hangar,  and  more  sophisticated  and  safer  air

navigational aids is under way. A second runway at

Paya Lebar is being planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national flag carrier, Singapore Airlines

(SIA),  is  investing in new aircraft  and  ground

facilities,  including  an integrated  engineering

complex for servicing and overhauling aircraft  at

Paya Lebar. Singapore's second carrier, Saber Air,

will  supplement SIA's role for charter  passenger

and air cargo transportation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorological services, necessary for safe

air   navigation,  have  also  been   continuously

upgraded  through a network of weather  radar  and

electronic   equipment  for  receiving   pictorial

information from weather satellites.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More facilities for fast and reliable telephone

and telex communications are being installed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of the Telecommunication

Authority  of  Singapore (TAS) and  the  Singapore

Telephone  Board (STB), scheduled  for  completion

early  in  1974,  will  mean  greater  operational

efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second satellite receiving station will he

completed at Sentosa by 1973 to establish  a  link

with    the    Pacific   Ocean   telecommunication

satellite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the international Telex Exchange and the

Public  Telegraph  Network with  its  computerised

message   switching  system  will   become   fully

automatic  by  next  year. The  current  five-year

development programme of the STB when completed in

March  1977  will  increase the number  of  direct

exchange lines from 121,400 to 236,000. This works

out  to 152 telephones per 1,000 of population  as

compared  with  90  per 1,000 of  population  in

1971.



<br><br><i>Postal Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Services Department plans to build 30

new  post  offices  and a new Postal  Headquarters

Complex  at Aljunied Road to replace the  existing

General



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



Post  Office  at  Fullerton  Building.  Mechanised

processing  of mail, and greater use of mechanical

devices  are  being considered to  provide  faster

services and improve working conditions.



<br><br><i>Post Office Savings Bank (POSB)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since becoming a statutory corporation on 1st

January, 1972, deposits of the POSB have increased

by  22  per cent to reach $111.4 million.  Banking

operations are being run on commercial  lines  and

computer facilities will be used to provide  quick

service to depositors.



<br><br><i>Manpower</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Department is emphasising on the

training  of  our youth for sea careers  requiring

higher skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TAS and STB in conjunction with the

Broadcasting   Department   are   setting   up   a

Telecommunication Training Centre at Dunearn  Road

to  train  our  technicians for the operation  and

maintenance   of   sophisticated  and   up-to-date

equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA is expanding its Training School into an

Institute of Maritime Studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans have been finalised to develop the Air

Traffic Training Centre at Paya Lebar into an  Air

Academy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All training programmes are aimed at developing

to  the full the skills of our people so that they

may  earn  better  salaries  and  enjoy  a  higher

standard of living.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's primary asset is not natural but

human  resources. It is the intelligence,  skills,

discipline,  efficiency and willingness  to  learn

and   to   work  of  our  workers,  managers   and

entrepreneurs  which decide our pace  of  economic

progress.



<div align="center"><h4>I. HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT</h4></div>



<br><br><i>Labour supply</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will allow industries or enterprises with

higher skill or higher technology



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



content, and those with prospects of going  on  to

more  sophisticated manufacture, to recruit labour

on work permits liberally. However, female migrant

workers  employed  in industry  should  have  some

primary  education.  Moreover,  all  work   permit

holders,  male  or female, will have  a  temporary

work  permit  until  they have  passed  a  medical

examination.  This  is  to help  ensure  that  the

strength of our labour force is not weakened  with

the  infusion  of  work  permit  holders  of  poor

education or health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the pool of our indigenous labour

force, more Singapore women will be encouraged  to

seek  employment. More women will  work  if  wages

were  higher, and there are provision  of  creches

and  kindergartens,  and if  clean  factories  are

sited  near  or  in Housing and Development  Board

estates. Part-time employment, and contracting  of

work  to  housewives in their homes on  piece-rate

(particularly in the manufacture of  garments  and

textiles)  will tap a vast reservoir of labour  at

present  not  utilised. Higher  female  employment

will increase the total family incomes and improve

social conditions of the lower paid families.



<br><br><i>Skill acquisition</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers must acquire skills appropriate to a

modern,  industrial society. Our  industries  must

not be hampered by skill shortages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes to establish an

Industrial   Training  Board.   The   Board   will

undertake   and   co-ordinate   all   aspects   of

industrial   training,  including   apprenticeship

schemes,   on-the-job  and  off-the-job  training.

Employers  have promised to support these  schemes

as  they  will make available the skilled manpower

they need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our industrial and commercial enterprises

become  more  sophisticated, the  need  for  high-quality

managerial expertise becomes vital.  This

is  true  of  both large and small establishments.

The  National Productivity Board aims to raise the

quality   of  management,  particularly   in   its

relationship with, and efficient use of, workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Labour utilisation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of the recently reorganised Employment

Service of the Ministry is not simply to find jobs

for the unemployed. By matching unemployed workers

and   job   vacancies  faster,  by   raising   job

satisfaction  through better  matching  of  worker

aptitude and ability with job requirements, and by

providing more accurate labour market information,

the   Employment   Service  will  improve   labour

utilisation.



<div align="center"><h4>II. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guiding principle of "Industrial Peace with

Justice" is as valid today as it was 13 years ago.

There   will  undoubtedly  be  disagreement   over

distribution of the fruits of economic growth.  It

will  be  the  task of the National Wages  Council

periodically    to   establish   equitable    wage

guidelines  acceptable  to  both  management   and

labour  without adversely affecting  our  economic

growth,  whilst ensuring a rising living  standard

for  workers. Workers must get an equitable  share

of higher productivity and profits, if they are to

give  of  their best and identify themselves  with

the enterprise they work for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall regulate increases in wages and salaries

in  a  steady and equitable manner, not too low  a

rate  to  cause disappointment, not  too  high  to

cause inflation, with more money chasing the  same

amount of homes and services, causing more imports

of unnecessary luxury goods, leading to a drain of

foreign exchange. The danger most to be avoided is

wage increases of a magnitude that pushes the cost

of our services and manufactured products up until

they  become  uncompetitive in  the  international

markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council, unions, employers and

the  Government must work together. They must  not

simply  seek  their  own  sectional  interests  of

higher  profits and higher wages, and in so  doing

defeat  our  national purpose of more exports  and

more  investments to generate more  wealth.  Wages

and  profits must be such that returns  on  equity

remain high, attracting more invest-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



ments, whilst workers get a fair share of an ever-

increasing  cake  which  their  harder  work   and

increased productivity have made possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, industrial relations functions of the

Ministry  have been mainly "curative"  in  nature.

Preventive  measures  will  now  receive   greater

attention.  The object is to prevent or  eliminate

nascent  points  of  friction between  labour  and

management before they assume ominous proportions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guiding ethos of industrial relations should

be   co-operation  not  corn-bat,  reflection  not

agitation. The Labour Ministry will do its part to

bring   about  this  mature  industrial  relations

through  education, persuasion, and  promotion  of

institutional   arrangements   through    improved

communications and reduce tensions between  labour

and management.



<div align="center"><h4>III. WORKERS' WELFARE</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers are human beings and not mere cogs in the

wheels of production. Their health and welfare are

of  prime  importance. A worker is more  efficient

and  productive  if  he has a  clean  environment,

better   educational,  recreational  and  cultural

facilities,  and good amenities at  his  place  of

work.   The  Ministry  will  protect  the  growing

industrial  work  force from occupational  hazards

and   diseases.   The  Factory  Inspectorate   and

Industrial Health Unit will be expanded  in  scope

and  size, and staffed with qualified professional

and  technical  personnel so  as  to  prevent  and

reduce industrial accidents and diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expanded Labour Inspectorate will more

stringently ensure that minimum standards embodied

in   existing   labour  laws  are  respected   and

enforced. More inspections will be carried out  by

the Labour Inspectorate to check on observance  of

protective legislation and to assist employers  to

understand  and  comply with the  law.  Where  any

employer  persists  in  infringing  labour   laws,

causing  harm to their workers, the Ministry  will

prosecute them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers' contributions to the Central Provident

Fund  have  been  increased with effect  from  1st

July, 1972, from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



10  per  cent to 12 per cent for employees earning

less than $200 monthly and from 10 per cent to  14

per cent for those earning more than $200 monthly.

The higher rates mean better provision for workers

in  their old age. Moreover, the higher rates will

raise  the home-owning capacity of workers. Up  to

this  month, 26,466 Central Provident Fund members

had  withdrawn 590,080,022 to purchase Housing and

Development  Board  and  Jurong  Town  Corporation

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of joint consultative machinery

in  all  enterprises  will be encouraged  so  that

workers   and   employers   can   understand   and

appreciate one another's problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with higher incomes, the worker will be

encouraged to constantly improve his knowledge and

skills, in adult and workers education courses and

refresher courses so that he can further  increase

his capacity in more productive labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<br><br><i>Public Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1960 two 5-year building programmes for

public   housing  have  been  completed  and   two

satellite    towns    --Queenstown     and     Toa

Payoh--created. Altogether 137,000 units of  flats

had  been  completed by the end of 1971 and  about

750,000 people (37 per cent of the population) are

now living in Housing and Development Board flats.

The  third 5-year building programme (1971-75) has

commenced and two new towns will be built at Telok

Blangah  and Woodlands. The third 5-year  building

programme will provide an additional 100,000 units

of flats to house 500,000 more people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of allowing the use of Central

Provident Fund for the purchase of flats has  made

it  possible  for many citizens to buy  their  own

homes. More than 40,000 families now own the flats

they   occupy.  However,  this  policy  has   also

resulted  in  greater demand for HDB flats.  There

are  now  70,000  applicants on the  waiting  list

(47,000 to buy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



23,000 to rent). The Housing and Development Board

will  therefore speed up its present building rate

of one flat every 26 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of higher incomes and higher CPF savings,

we  must  build almost twice as many units  as  we

have  built in the last five years. However,  with

each unit averaging about twice the floorspace per

unit, this means quadrupling the building capacity

of  the  HDB  flats.  This must  be  done  without

lowering  the quality of layout and planning.  The

standard of finish of the new high-rise flats from

the  outside,  in  the design and appearance,  and

inside  for the occupants, must be good.  We  must

avoid  another sudden surge in demand for building

material  and construction workers,  which  a  few

years ago pushed building costs up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Housing and Development Board first

began  building in 1960, the object was to provide

homes as quickly as possible with little attention

being paid to the residents' needs for recreation.

Now  that the back of the housing problem has been

broken,  the  Board  can  and  will  provide  more

facilities  for rest and recreation.  In  existing

HDB estates more parks and swimming pools will  be

provided  where  there is land available.  In  Toa

Payoh  a  sports complex including  four  swimming

pools  is  under construction. Additional swimming

pools  will  be built in Queenstown. New  swimming

pool   complexes  will  be  built   at   Henderson

Road/Jalan  Bukit  Merah, Bukit Ho  Swee,  Tanjong

Rhu/  Kallang Airport Estates, MacPherson  Estates

and Kallang Basin Estates. The new housing estates

(for example, Telok Blangah, Woodlands, Bedok  and

Ang  Mo  Kio) will be better planned and have  not

only  better designed and more comfortable  homes,

but  also  larger  open  spaces  and  more  parks,

swimming  pools  and  sports complexes.  In  every

neighbourhood,      well-equipped       children's

playgrounds will be provided in addition to sports

facilities,  such  as  basket-ball  and  badminton

courts.  Land  will  also be  set  aside  for  the

construction  of  community  centres.  The  ground

floors  of  each block of flats will be  free  for

indoor sports, like table tennis, and children  to

play



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



in.  The Board will spend about $75 million during

the   next  five  years  to  provide  recreational

facilities.



<br><br><i>Urban Renewal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slum clearance and redevelopment of the central

area  will  be accelerated so that better  housing

and  living environment will replace the congested

and  dilapidated housing conditions in  the  inner

city. People living in areas under clearance  will

be  temporarily inconvenienced by resettlement and

a  change  of  their habits in the old environment

they   have   got   accustomed  to.  Comprehensive

planning of urban renewal will be carried  out  to

reduce inconvenience and hardship to a minimum. An

Urban Renewal Authority will be established by 1st

April,  1973, to implement a systematic  programme

of  redevelopment  of the Central  area  including

housing,    commercial   and   shopping   centres,

entertainment  and  recreational  facilities,  car

parking,  road traffic and pedestrian circulation,

parks  and landscaped walkways. A new and gracious

city  will be created. At the same time, buildings

and  monuments  of  historical  and  architectural

value  are  being preserved and placed in  a  more

attractive setting.



<br><br><i>Condominium Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many private housing estates of mainly terrace

and  semi-detached houses have been built  in  the

past. This type of development is wasteful in land

use  and  produces heavily built up and  congested

areas entirely covered with roofs and tarmac  with

little  open  space. The condominium  concept  was

recently  introduced to encourage  more  intensive

use of land for housing development by the private

sector.  This  will  bring the prices  of  housing

within the reach of many more of our citizens  and

complement   the  efforts  of  the   Housing   and

Development Board in providing more homes for  the

people.



<br><br><i>Public Works</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public works projects in the construction and

improvement of roads, bridges, schools, hospitals,

parks   and  playgrounds  will  continue   to   be

implemented. The Pan-Island Expressway



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



running  in  east-west direction  will  eventually

form   an   essential  highway   linking   several

satellite towns. Work on the stretch between  Paya

Lebar  and Jalan Eunos and the extension  to  Sims

Avenue  has  been  completed,  the  section   from

Whitley  Road to Jalan Anak Bukit is in  progress,

including an underpass below Adams Road now  under

construction.  Other  road  systems  at  Bendeemer

Road,   Jalan  Bukit  Merah,  Irwell  Bank   Road,

Paterson  Road,  Grange  Road  and  Stevens   Road

forming  key routes for traffic converging towards

the  Central  business district are being  widened

and improved. Work on the major East Coast Parkway

on  the  east  coast  reclamation  site  has  also

started.



<br><br><i>Garden City</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable progress has been made in developing

Singapore into a Garden City through the  planting

of   trees,   shrubs   and  other   plants   along

thoroughfares,   road-sides,   traffic    islands,

landscaping  of  open spaces and the  building  of

parks  and  gardens. This more pleasant and  green

environment will be extended throughout  the  City

Centre, the housing estates, suburbs and the rural

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's policy is to provide more parks for

rest  and  recreation.  Major  parks  planned  and

established  are  those at  Mount  Faber,  Kampong

Java,  Tanah Merah and the Central Park at Canning

Rise.   About  one-third  or  500  acres  of   the

reclaimed  land  along  the  East  Coast  will  be

reserved for recreation to form a long stretch  of

green  from  Bedok  to  Tanjong  Rhu  between  the

proposed  major East Coast Parkway  and  the  sea.

This  stretch of about 10 kilometres of the  coast

line  will be developed into the largest  park  in

Singapore   with  beach  shelters,   toilets   and

changing rooms, children's playgrounds and  stalls

providing food and drinks. A large lagoon near the

Bedok  end  will  be  developed  into  a  seawater

swimming  complex  with a capacity  equivalent  to

that  of  about  50 Olympic-sized swimming  pools.

About  $10  million  will be spent  on  this  Park

alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close co-ordination is maintained by the Parks

and   Trees   Division  with  the  Urban   Renewal

Department to ensure that small gardens  and  open

spaces, pedestrian malls and landscaped walks  are

included  in  urban  redevelopment  planning.  The

Stamford Canal along Orchard Road will be  covered

over  and  developed into a landscaped  pedestrian

mall  to  add beauty and colour to this  important

thoroughfare.  As more high-rise buildings  sprout

up  in the City, it is essential to have greenery,

trees,  small parks and open space to  temper  the

harsh  concrete structures, and to give relief  in

the greenness of nature.



<br><br><i>Building Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Building Control Division was created in

February   1972   to  streamline  procedures   for

building  plans approval and enforcement,  and  to

deal  effectively with problems arising  from  the

rapid  expansion  of construction activities,  and

also  the  new technology connected with high-rise

buildings. New building laws and regulations  will

be    enacted   to   meet   present   and   future

requirements.



<br><br><i>Primary Production</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite dwindling land resources for farming,

Singapore  has maintained its self-sufficiency  in

pork, poultry and eggs. Ornamental fish and orchid

export trade continue to increase and flourish. As

development    of    housing,    industries    and

urbanisation continue to encroach upon and  reduce

the  acreage of farmland, our farmers must  become

more  efficient and agricultural land must be made

more  productive. Factory farms and flatted  farms

will  be  planned to reduce pollution of water  in

the  catchment  areas  of the  Kranji  and  Pandan

reservoirs from pig waste.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br><i>Health Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall quality of the Medical Services will

be  raised  to  provide increasingly sophisticated

treatment  to  the population. Singapore  will  be

developed   into   a  centre  of  excellence   for

specialist medical service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Major Developments in the Hospital Service</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals are the pivot of the medical

services.  There  is  at  present  a  shortage  of

hospital beds.(i)( (i) See Appendix I, cols. 51-2.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Outram Road General Hospital will be replaced

by  a  new  1,900-bed hospital. This new  hospital

estimated to cost $125 million will be Singapore's

premier  hospital and specialist  centre,  housing

for a start the five selected medical specialities

of  neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery,  plastic

and reconstructive surgery, paediatric surgery and

nephrology. Also planned is a teaching hospital at

Kent Ridge to be completed during the decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of hospital planners and architects are

now   drawing   up  a  plan  for  a  comprehensive

development  and  modernisation  hospitals.  Their

recommendations are expected to be made soon.



<br><br><i>Interim Plans</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile interim plans to reorganise and improve

the Service are being implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interim plans include the development of the

four   selected   specialities  of   Neurosurgery,

Plastic   and   Reconstructive  Surgery,   Cardio-Thoracic

Surgery and Nephrology. Progress on  them

is well advanced. Millions of dollars have already

been spent on building and new equipment.



<br><br><i>New Medical Institutions Planned</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four different institutions are being planned: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A polyclinic with hospital beds at Changi for

the civilian and military population there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A similar centre at Jurong, mainly `for the

treatment of industrial accidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A "half-way-home" at Sembawang for the care

of  the  mentally-ill  who do  not  require  close

medical attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) An Institute of Urban Health which will be a

conglomerate   of  various  departments,   certain

sections of the University Departments of Social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



Medicine  and  Public Health,  the  Department  of

Parasitology,   the  Vector  Control   Unit,   the

evaluation   unit  of  the  Family  Planning   and

Population  Board.  It  is  being  established  in

conjunction   with  SEAMEO.  It  is  primarily   a

research and graduate teaching institute.



<br><br><i>Rehabilitation   Centre  for  the  Paralysed   and  Chronic Sick</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutional care for special categories of the

disabled and chronic sick will be improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rehabilitation centre with 82 beds at Mandalay

Road  for the treatment of the disabled, paralysed

and  the chronic sick will be completed in January

1973.



<br><br><i>Outpatient Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing network of outpatient dispensaries

will  be  extended  to render  more  comprehensive

service.



<br><br><i>Priority placed on Health of our Young People</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More will be invested to promote the health of

our young people.



<br><br><i>Maternal  and  Child  Health  and  School   Health Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maternal and Child Health Services will be

expanded  with more comprehensive and better  pre-natal

and post-natal care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Health Service will also be expanded,

to  provide a wider health screening service.  The

service will include hearing, eye-sight and mental

screening tests.



<br><br><i>Eradicating Malnutrition</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the mental and physical

development  of  our  very young  are  at  optimum

levels,  attention will be focused on  pockets  of

malnutrition now existing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malnutrition is mainly the result of parents not

feeding  their  children with a  proper  diet,  or

having many more children than they can afford. It

will  be  combated with more health education  and

nutritional   demonstrations   to   mothers.   The

Nutrition  Unit  is  being enlarged  to  implement

feeding schemes for undernourished children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Family Planning and Population Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these are palliative measures. The basic

solution is a lower birth rate. Then we can  raise

our   standard   of  life  and  quality   of   the

environment.  Accouchement fees, maternity  leave,

priority points for homes will be so adjusted that

they  will  bring  about  the  ideal  of  the  two

children  per  family. For the  Singapore  of  the

1970's the third child is a luxury. The fourth and

fifth  are  anti-social acts. These  charges  will

take  full  effect after 9 1/2 months  from  today,

i.e.,  1st  August, 1973. Housing Board priorities

will  also be changed. The highest priorities  are

for  those who have two or less children,  whether

for  their first flat, or for transfer to a better

flat.  Families with three will drop  slightly  in

priority.  Families with four or  more  will  have

little  priority. This will be implemented  so  as

not  to  be harsh to those who already have  large

families.  But  after 9 1/2 months  from  today,  1st

August,  1973, any addition to two children  means

declining  priority in balloting for  purchase  or

rentals  of  flats. Any increase  in  family  size

beyond  two will mean lower priority in  transfers

to bigger flats, either for purchase or rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second 5-year National Family Planning

Programme  (1971-1975) is  directed  at  two  main

target groups: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The between 15 per cent to 18 per cent of

married  women known as the "hard core"  belonging

to  the low income and high parity groups who have

not taken to family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The newly weds whose numbers have increased

significantly.   Even  if   the   relatively   low

fertility level of 1970 remains constant the crude

birth  rate  will actually increase  to  24,5  per

thousand  in 1975 and 25.7 per thousand  in  1980.

(See Appendix II, cols. 53-4.)

This  is  because the  number  of  women  of reproductive  age  will have  increased  by  about

170,000 a 25 per cent increase. (See Appendix III, cols. 55-6.) The  aim  is to further dampen fertility,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



so  that  the crude birth rate will fall to  about

18.4 per thousand in 1975 and 14.8 per thousand in

1980.  Then the rate of natural increase  will  be

less than 1 per cent by 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More use of sterilization as a means of family

planning  for  those  who  have  completed   their

families will be advocated.



<br><br><i>Dental Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present scheme to give priority to

comprehensive  dental  coverage  to  all   primary

schools  will  continue.  This  service  is  being

extended to kindergarten children. It will then be

extended  to  all  secondary  school  pupils   and

pregnant  mothers  at Maternal  and  Child  Health

Clinics.  More than 90 School Dental Clinics  will

be  added to the 68 already established. (See Appendix IV, cols. 57-8.)  Two major  dental  health centres  to  complement  the

existing two at Pegu Road and Institute of  Health

will be built.



<br><br><i>Combating Drug Addiction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All outpatient clinics and centres have been

organised  to  provide  for  treatment   of   drug

addicts. A referral clinic has been established at

the  Outram Road Hospital. A second one is planned

for  Alexandra Hospital. A special  ward  for  the

hospital care of addicts will be opened within the

year.



<br><br><i>Increasing costs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new general hospital at Outram Road

costing about $125 million and increased costs  of

medicines  and  medical equipment  nearly  all  of

which  are  imported, and the  extension  of  more

sophisticated medical facilities, costs of medical

treatment  have been going up. They will  continue

to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further with wage revisions of Government

servants,  doctors,  nurses,  and  other   medical

workers, the budget of the Ministry of Health must

go up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will have to meet the increased

budget  from  increased  taxes  on  spending   and

revenue.  But  the  user  will  have  to   pay   a

relatively  token increase to remind  him  to  use

these medical services only when really necessary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment will tackle the

problems of pollution, to protect and enhance  our

environment, to increase our water resources,  and

to  maintain high standards of public  health.  We

need  never  face  the high degree  of  danger  to

public  health  that is threatening  some  of  the

polluted  cities of the industrial countries.  But

we  must  deal,  now, firmly and  rationally  with

pollution.  National  development  and   pollution

control must go hand in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep up the quality of the environment in the

face  of industrialisation and urbanisation  means

considerable  planning and  expenditure  on  anti-pollution.

As incomes go up, so does consumption.

There  will  be more high-rise flats,  more  cars,

buses and taxis, more refuse and garbage from each

household,  glass bottles, plastic containers  and

other  waste.  More electricity will be  generated

for  more  factories and homes, i.e, more  sulphur

dioxide belching from power stations and soot  and

chemical  dust  from  factory chimneys.  There  is

increasing   pollution  from  the  expanding   oil

refineries,  both in the southern islands  and  on

Singapore itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take steps now to prevent a deterioration

into  a  Tokyo-type situation. The air we  breathe

must  be  clean.  The  noise of  traffic,  radios,

television,  and rumbling machines,  must  be  cut

down. Most important of all, the pollution of  our

water through domestic or industrial waste running

into  open drains must be stopped, as soon  as  is

technically and economically possible. Rain  water

must   be   collected  unpolluted   for   domestic

consumption.    Several   big,   new    impounding

reservoirs are in the course of construction.  The

costs  are  high. But they cannot be  avoided.  We

cannot have our reservoirs filled up with polluted

water. Every factory has been, and is being, given

enough  time to install measures to cut  down  the

deleterious substances that they discharge  either

into  open  drains  or into sewers.  The  sewerage

network will be expanded rapidly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



to all built-up areas. Hard detergents will go, to

be replaced by soft ones. All domestic waste water

from  kitchens, from the washing of  clothes,  and

from  bathrooms must go into sewers, and not  into

open drains. Over 6,000 pig sties and chicken-runs

in  the  catchment areas of Pandan, Kranji,  Bedok

and   Seletar   reservoirs   will   have   to   be

reconstructed  so that waste from pigs  and  other

animals will go into sewers and do not pollute the

rain water that falls in the catchment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do this for all of us, not for any

sectional  or privileged groups. Most  people  are

aware  of  these  grave  continuing  problems.  We

cannot   allow  these  problems  to  become   more

complicated,   by   dithering   or   balking    at

temporarily  unpopular measures. The  consequences

of  not inconveniencing the polluter, now,  is  to

face a grave or even critical position in five  to

seven years' time.



<br><br><i>Water resources</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management and development of our water

resources  will  be  better  coordinated  under  a

single Ministry. Coordinated sewerage and drainage

projects  with the covering enforcement  of  anti-pollution

legislation  are  primary   preventive

measures to conserve water.



<br><br><i>Sewerage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive Master Plan for the collection

and  treatment  of  sewage in  Singapore  will  be

completed. This will be followed by the drawing up

of  detailed development programmes. The  pace  of

sewerage  projects will be' stepped up. Priorities

on   sewerage   projects  given  to  Housing   and

Development  Board,  Jurong Town  Corporation  and

other  large Government developments will  now  be

extended to Upper Bukit Timah-Woodlands areas. The

importance  of well-planned and executed  sewerage

projects cannot be over-emphasised. It is  one  of

the   major  long  term  solutions  to  our  water

pollution and conservation problem. The control of

all trade and industrial waste will now come under

a single department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Drainage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of drainage will now no longer be

confined to the task of flood alleviation but will

serve  multi-purposes, aimed at  creating  both  a

better  environment as well as the abstraction  of

drainage waters for selective uses.



<br><br><i>Water Pollution Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present legislation on water pollution control

will be revised to give sufficient teeth to ensure

that  those for whom facilities and expertise  are

available,  to  control  pollution,  will  act  to

prevent pollution. A comprehensive Water Pollution

Bill will be presented to Parliament.



<br><br><i>Solid Waste Disposal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disposal of solid wastes would become a

pressing  problem  as  available  dumping  grounds

become scarce. Modern techniques of compaction and

incineration will be introduced in the near future

to conserve land and water.



<br><br><i>Mechanisation of Street Cleansing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent introduction of mechanisation of

street  cleansing is to meet the  problem  of  the

present   shortage  of  cleansing  workers.   More

machines  will  be  acquired. In  the  process  of

mechanisation, the upgrading of the skill  of  our

workers  is  necessary for these machines  to  be

maintained and used efficiently.



<br><br><i>Hawkers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude and complexity of the hawker

problem  is  seen  in the numbers,  diversity  and

dispersion of hawkers in the city centre,  in  the

rural districts, in public and private housing and

industrial estates. The socio-economic grounds for

their  existence  in Singapore is recognised.  The

present  programme of building markets and  hawker

centres  to  resite licensed street  hawkers  into

hygienic and pollution-free surroundings  will  be

extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both public authorities and private developers

have  to consider the building of suitable  indoor

accommodation to serve hawker-type food. It is  an

essential  social  amenity to domestic  residents,

factory and office workers, and, `others.  Such  a

programme will quickly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



improve the existing street hawker conditions  and

forestall graver problems for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spending large sums of public and private

funds   we   should  not  be  frustrated   by   an

uncontrolled proliferation of illegal hawkers,  or

by   a  lowering  of  personal  and  food  hygiene

standards.  The Ministry will educate hawkers  and

enforce public health standards. At the same  time

firm  action  will  be  taken  against  unlicensed

hawkers.



<br><br><i>Air Pollution</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should now be more careful in the types of

industries  that  are  allowed.  Heavy   pollution

industries   will   not   be   allowed.   Existing

industries  which are causing too  much  pollution

will  have  to install anti-pollution devices,  or

they will have to move elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city area, there will be more intensive

surveillance  to  control  emissions  from   motor

vehicles.  Noisy  and old motor vehicles,  whether

private  or commercial vehicles or buses or  taxis

must be gradually eliminated. This will reduce the

noise  level  in  the city areas. New  regulations

will  be made to control carbon monoxide and other

residual  pollutants from exhausts to improve  the

air.  Most  cities  of  the  developed  world  are

already doing this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, as a further step, certain industries and

trade premises in the city areas will have to  use

low  sulphur fuel oil or gas. This will reduce the

emission of smoke and sulphur dioxide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open burning of domestic and industrial refuse

also  adds  to  the  pollution of  the  air.  This

practice will have to be controlled and regulated.

Either  the wastes go into incinerators,  or  they

are  used for the manufacture of by-products, e.g.

sawdust to hard board.



<br><br><i>Cemeteries</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conserve land, particularly in the urban

areas,  cemeteries in and around the city will  be

closed.  There  will  be  extensions  to  existing

public  cemeteries in the Chua Chu Kang  area  and

development of new cemeteries in other areas.  But

cremation  is  the  long  term  solution.  A  new

crematoria and columbarium will be developed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing tempo of industrialisation and the

massive  building construction in both the  public

and    private   sectors   have   brought    about

unprecedented demands for the services provided by

the PUB.



<br><br><i>Electricity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of electricity for the first eight

months of this year has increased by 22 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage II of the Jurong Power Station (costs: $133

million)  is scheduled for completion by the  last

quarter  of  1973.  A  new power  station  (costs:

$191.4 million) is being built at Senoko. Stage  I

will  have a capacity of 360 megawatts. The  first

turbo-alternator set of 120 megawatts is scheduled

for   commissioning  in  mid-1975.  A  gas  turbo-alternator

station (costs: $10.6 million) with two

generators  is  being constructed at  Senoko.  Its

first   generator   set   will   be   ready    for

commissioning at the end of this year. In 1973 the

Board  will introduce a new 230 kv network  system

to   ensure  adequate  and  reliable  transmission

capacity  to  handle the anticipated future  large

bulk load transfers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is extending its rural electrification

programme.  Since  the  inception  of  the   rural

electrification programme in March 1963, over  400

schemes benefitting some 230,000 people have  been

implemented. The Board plans to implement  another

70  schemes  before  the  end  of  1974,  to  make

electricity available to even the remotest  areas

in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Water</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of water for the first eight months

of  this  year has increased by 5.9 per cent.  The

Board has under planning and execution projects to

meet  this increasing demand. After the North East

Monsoon is over by January there will be new block

tariffs for water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance our water resources in Singapore we

have  to  pay  higher costs in anti-pollution  and

special treatment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



measures. We are also using up valuable  land  for

new reservoirs: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Upper Peirce Scheme (costs: $71.2

million)  is  scheduled  for  completion  by 1974.

It  involves  the  construction   of

another   impounding  reservoir   and   will

increase by eight times the capacity of  the

existing Peirce Reservoirs;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Kranji/Pandan Scheme (costs: $74.2

million),  now under construction,  will  be

completed  by  1975. It  will  increase  the

maximum  storage capacity of our  impounding

reservoirs by about 42 per cent;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir is

being further extended (costs: $1.3 million)

from  15  million  gallons  by  another  7.4

million gallons;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Construction of another service reservoir

at  Mt. Faber II (costs: $3.7 million) is in

progress and is scheduled for completion  in 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average per capita consumption continues to

increase.  A significant portion of it is  wasted.

The  Board  is working out new water  tariffs  for

domestic consumption. They will provide for  water

at  a low basic rate to meet the ordinary domestic

needs  of  a family. Beyond this basic  quota  the

rates will progressively increase. The purpose  of

these progressively higher tariffs for unnecessary

high  domestic  consumption of  water  is  not  to

increase  revenue  but  to prevent  the  waste  of

water.  On  the contrary we must encourage  frugal

usage  of water. Some domestic water can  be  used

twice  over, for example, re-using water used  for

bathing  and washing of clothes, for the  flushing

of toilets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure equitable rationing during periods of

drought  and  to  avoid disorderly  scrambling  at

public  standpipes, the Board will phase  out  all

public  standpipes.  It  will  extend  its   water

distribution system. About 60 miles of water mains

were laid in 197 1-72 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



supply water to housing and industrial estates  as

well  as  rural  areas where standpipes  had  been

removed and sites demarcated for redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of gas for the first eight months of

this year has increased by about 5.6 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction work on the eighth gas-making plant

(costs:  $1.5 million), a 3.5 million  cubic  feet

(85,000 cubic meters) per day Zimmer Reformer, has

commenced  and  is expected to be commissioned  by

the  middle  of  1973.  A  new  1,000-ton  naphtha

storage tank is now being constructed and will  be

completed early next year to increase the  storage

of  naphtha at Kallang Gasworks from 600 to  1,600

tons. There are at present more that 520 miles  of

gas  mains  in  Singapore supplying  gas  to  over

100,000 homes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF CULTURE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture helps to mould the social

and    cultural   development   of   the   people,

particularly the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various facilities provided by Radio and

Television  Singapore, the National  Library,  the

National Theatre and the People's Association  are

aimed  at  fulfilling  the  cultural,  social  and

recreational needs of a sophisticated  society.  A

balance   between   the   educational   and    the

entertaining  form  of books,  magazines,  TV  and

Radio can give more meaning to the use of leisure,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are by nature hardworking and

achievement-oriented. The pursuit of material well-being

comes  naturally. But it is also  necessary

for  a  people  to appreciate things of  aesthetic

value,  to  be  intellectually alive, appreciative

and  responsive to the beautiful. The  "Music  for

Everyone"   and  "Art  for  Everyone"  series   of

concerts  and  art exhibitions will be  continued.

The  stress  will  continue  to  be  put  on  mass

participation in the fields of aesthetjc  creation

and appreciation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio and Television Singapore will continue to

provide services to inform,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



entertain and educate. It will increase the  range

of  its programmes aimed at actively involving our

youths  in  wholesome and creative activities.  We

must  stimulate  the  younger  generation  to   be

conscious  of  the world around us,  and  our  own

hardwon advances they must protect. The mass media

both Government and private must help to inculcate

the  virtues  of  patriotism,  pride  in  national

effort and achievement, and the importance of team-work

and national endeavour so necessary for group

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library has greatly expanded its

range  of  facilities. It has a role  to  play  in

encouraging   the  habit  of  wide  reading,   and

cultivating  an  enquiring mind  among  our  young

through  making available a wide range of journals

and publications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association will concentrate on

social  and recreational programmes. More  holiday

accommodation will be provided for the people.  It

will  also  aim  at variety in its activities  for

youths. Several new community centres will have to

be  built  to  cater for an increasing  number  of

those  who  are interested in making the  most  of

their  leisure time, especially those in  the  new

satellite  towns. Only by better and new  premises

and   amenities   can  the  People's   Association

continue  to  contribute  to  social  cohesion  by

bringing  together  all  sectors  of  society   to

participate in common activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Museum, which has now come under this

Ministry,  is  being  re-organised  as  a  display

centre   devoted   to   the   art,   history   and

anthropology  of the peoples of this  region.  The

art collection of the University of Singapore will

soon be made more accessible to' the public by its

transfer to the National Museum at Stamford Road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any society, social deviants can always be

found.  The  Government will have  continually  to

take preventive' measures to keep the incidence of

crime and juvenile delinquency at a low level. The

Government will help offenders readjust to society

to become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



law-abiding  and  socially useful  citizens.  With

industrialisation and urbanisation,  the  pressure

of life is increasing. The traditional stabilising

forces of social control in our Asian culture  are

upset  in  parts.  There is  a  tendency  for  new

patterns  of  crime  and  delinquency  of  a  more

sophisticated nature to emerge. Their control will

depend  upon how the Government and all of  us  in

the  community can take preventive action to  keep

the  family unit from loosening. Parental care and

control  over  their  teenage  children  must  not

deteriorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already planned for the

general  strengthening of the existing  system  of

social   welfare  for  the  proper  care  of   the

destitute,  the handicapped and others  not  in  a

position to take care of themselves or to be taken

care  of  by  relatives and friends. The  Ministry

will encourage greater community participation  in

the welfare programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to mobilise more women for full-time

employment  to relieve the shortage of  labour  in

Singapore,  the Government intends to  build  more

creches, especially in housing estates where there

is  demand for such facilities. Creche hours  will

also  be  extended  for  the  convenience  of  the

working mothers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will encourage the use of all

manpower     resources    available,     including

handicapped  persons. The latter, if given  proper

training  and  guidance  and  equipped  with   the

necessary skills, could be a not insignificant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



source   of   manpower  to  meet  the   increasing

requirements of our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has laid the foundation for a

radical   change  in  our  sporting   world.   New

concepts,  new facilities, better organisation,  a

co-ordinated policy - all go towards the making of

a  new  era for sports. Fundamental to this change

is  the  need to meet the changing demands of  our

youthful       population.      With       greater

industrialisation there must be  greater  emphasis

on   community  programmes  which  can  catch  the

imagination of our young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great task lies ahead for all those connected

with the promotion of sports in Singapore. If  the

enthusiasm,  dynamism and the co-operative  spirit

so  far shown by the various leaders of the sports

organisations is sustained, we can consolidate the

framework  to  provide  the  programmes  for  mass

participation in all kinds of sport activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours must be a robust and a rugged society. Our

young  people need to grow up healthy,  free  from

the evil influences of drug addiction and hippism.

They must not be lured by the fads and fetishes of

alien  sub-cultures. Our youth must be  encouraged
