<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>ASSEMBLY HOUSE BUILDING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(JURISDICTION)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  the jurisdiction over the whole building

of  this House of Assembly has been vested in Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> No, Sir. I regret that,

owing to the heavy demands on existing Government

office  accommodation, it is still  necessary  to

accommodate  certain departments in the  building

housing  the Assembly House. It is, however,  the

hope  of  the Government eventually to place  the

whole  of  the  building at  your  disposal,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could the Chief Secretary, Sir,

give  us an indication as to when he expects this

to be possible?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> We are engaged, Sir, at the moment in

a  review  of  the  needs for  additional  office

accommodation  for  the Government  departments,

and  I  hope that the result of that review  will

enable  us  to  plan extra accommodation;  but  I

regret I cannot, at the moment, commit us to  any

definite date.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DETAINEES TRANSFERRED TO DETENTION CAMP IN IPOH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Chief Secretary

if he will state the number of detainees detained

under  the  Emergency Regulations who  have  been

transferred to Detention Camp in Ipoh as at  15th

of  July,  1955; why such transfer is  necessary;

and  what facilities are afforded for their wives

or parents in Singapore to visit them in Ipoh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No persons detained under the Colony

Emergency   Regulations  have  been   transferred

specifically to the detention camp in Ipoh. Since

the   Emergency  began,  33  persons  have   been

transferred  to  the  Federation  for   continued

detention.   They  were  detained  variously   at

Majeedi,   Telok   Jerejak,  Ipoh,   and   Kluang

detention  camps.  I  regret  it  has  not   been

possible  in the time available to ascertain  how

long each detainee spent in each of these camps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the 15th of July, 1955, none of these

detainees  was  detained at  the  Ipoh  detention

camp.  In  all  these  cases,  the  transfer  was

effected because of a detainee's connection  with

the  Federation, and in some cases  the  transfer

was purely formal in order to enable the detainee

to be released for residence in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities for wives and parents in Singapore to

visit  detainees in Ipoh, or any other  detention

camp in the Federation, are the same as those  in

Singapore - that is, normally one visit a  week  is

allowed,  lasting not more than  30  minutes  and

including  not more than two persons at  any  one

time.  With the permission of the Superintendent,

however,  more  than  one visit  a  week  may  be

allowed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, may I ask the Chief Secretary

whether he would be good enough to grant  a  free

rail  warrant  ticket to enable  the  parents  or

relatives   to   visit  the  detainees   in   the

Federation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I should like notice of that

question, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL SERVICE (GENERAL DUTY POSTS)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Secretary

if  he will state the number of applications from

locally  qualified doctors received  for  general

duty   posts  since  1954;  and  the  number   of

appointments made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> In 1954 there were 20 applications

from locally qualified doctors and 7 applications

from    locally   domiciled   doctors   qualified

elsewhere. Of these applicants, five refused  the

posts offered, one withdrew his application,  one

was  ineligible, and one failed to appear for the

interview.  The  remaining 19 - 17  who  qualified

locally,  and two locally domiciled who qualified

elsewhere - were all appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 there have been 29 applications from

locally  domiciled  officers,  of  whom  26  were

locally   qualified.  All  the   29   have   been

appointed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REVISED EDITION OF THE LAWS, SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Attorney-General

when he proposes to complete the revised edition

of the Laws of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. J. Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. J. Davies:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

preparation of the revised edition of ordinances

is  complete as far as the Commissioners and  the

Law  Officers  are concerned. It is  now  only  a

matter of printing and binding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first volume has already been bound, and I

have  already  shown  it to  my  hon.  Friend.  I

anticipate that the remaining seven volumes  will

follow in rapid succession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I ask the hon. Gentleman

for a definition of "rapid succession"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davies:</b> I suggest that my hon. Friend look

up the Oxford Dictionary!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE, KAMPONG KAPOR DIVISION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Works if  he  is  aware  that

there  is  no  Post Office in the  Kampong  Kapor

Division;   and   whether   he   will    consider

establishing one there in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I should like to explain,

Mr  Speaker, that a Post Office is sited not  in

an  electoral division, but in a postal district.

It  is  true that there is no Post Office  within

the Kampong Kapor Division, but there is one half

a  mile  away from the approximate centre of  the

Division; two three-quarters of a mile away;  and

one about one mile away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan for Post Offices, which the Postal

Department  is drawing up, includes Post  Offices

in  the Jalan Besar and Dickson Road areas,  both

of  which  are within the Kampong Kapor Division.

There are, however, a great many other areas  for

which new Post Offices are planned. It will  take

a  number of years before the whole programme  is

completed. I am therefore unable to give  a  date

for  the  building  of either  of  the  new  Post

Offices which I have mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> May I then ask the Minister

for  Communications  and Works  to  put  on  more

pillar-boxes, if possible?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I must have notice of that question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FLOOD ALLEVIATION, SINGAPORE ISLAND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and  Works  whether  the  special

officer appointed to investigate into the  causes

of   flooding  throughout  the  island   and   to

recommend  measures of prevention  has  submitted

his  report, and what the Government's intentions

are in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Chief Drainage Engineer

submitted  a  short appreciation of  the  problem

three  weeks  after his arrival  here  in  March.

Since   then,  he  has  been  engaged  with   his

engineering staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



in  making  a  thorough survey of the  situation.

When  the  investigations are complete,  he  will

submit  a  series  of  reports  on  schemes   for

drainage  in  different areas of the island.  The

first  of  these  reports is expected  in  a  few

weeks'  time, and the others will be ready before

the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the investigations which have already been

carried out, it is evident that measures  can  be

taken  to prevent flooding, but they will involve

very  large  works, and the total cost  will  run

into  a  huge  sum. It is therefore necessary  to

decide  priorities  on the  basis  of  the  Chief

Drainage  Engineer's recommendations;  to  decide

the  number of years over which the various works

have to be phased; and, not least, to decide  the

problem of financing the works.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he

will  consider laying the report, or reports,  on

the Table of this House as they are completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I see no objection to that, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CLINIC, KAMPONG KAPOR DIVISION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Health  whether he will take the necessary action

to  establish  a  Clinic  in  the  Kampong  Kapor

Division.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> The Member for Kampong Kapor

has not indicated the type of clinic about which

he is enquiring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kampong Kapor Division is in the city area,

and as regards maternity and child health

services, there is a modern clinic run by the

City Council at Prinsep Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The St. Andrew's Mission holds a clinic twice a

week  for  sick babies at Perak Road  in  Kampong

Kapor Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-patient services are available at the Middle

Road Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not consider that the needs of the Kampong

Kapor  Division can at present have  prior  claim

over  other areas in the colony in a vicinity  in

which there are no clinics of any kind.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ENTRY PERMITS (PARENTS FROM CHINA): POLICY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and  Welfare if he will  state  the  policy

adopted  by  the Immigration Department in  dealing

with  applications  for entry  permits  from  local

residents  desirous of bringing their parents  from

China  to  live with them, and who are prepared  to

give   adequate   guarantees  of  maintenance   and

support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> While each case is considered

on   its  individual  merits,  the  general  policy

followed  has  been  to  examine  the  applications

received  in  the  light  of  Singapore's  problems

connected   with  such  matters  as  shortages   of

accommodation  and  the  present  insufficiency  of

medical  services. Examination has not been related

to   hardship   and  difficulties  stated   to   be

experienced in China. The whole policy is now under

review.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ENTRY (PARENTS FROM CHINA): AGE LIMIT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and  Welfare whether he is aware  that  the

minimum  age  limit  of  60  years  fixed  by   the

Immigration  Department for  entry  into  Singapore

from China of parents of local residents is causing

grave hardship; and whether he will explain on what

basis this age limit was fixed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The age limit of 60 years is

used as a guide, but is not followed rigidly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on the adjournment yesterday  there

was  an  informal  meeting of the  leaders  of  the

Parties and Independent Members, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



it  seemed  to be the general view that  the  reply

which   may   ultimately  be  expected   from   His

Excellency  the Governor to the message  which  you

delivered to him yesterday must necessarily  affect

the attitude and the conduct of Members towards the

outstanding  business in this  House.  It  must  be

obvious, and I think it is now obvious to all, that

a  message  of  a negative character,  despite  the

ingenious  combinations suggested by  my  hon. and

learned  Friend opposite, can, in fact,  only  have

one result - and that is a dissolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, Sir, I consider it

inappropriate  to  proceed  with  the   outstanding

business at the present juncture. I would  like  to

suggest that we adjourn for a sufficient period  in

order  to  enable an adequate reply to be  received

from His Excellency to our representations. In  the

light of the intervening holidays, my suggestion is

that this House do adjourn, without transacting any

further business, until Tuesday, the 2nd of August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to caution against undue optimism. I

would like Members to come prepared to rush through

all the legislation that can be handled at the next

sitting,  on  the basis that it may  be  the  final

sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, Sir, I formally move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do stand adjourned till

Tuesday, the 2nd of August, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Southern Islands):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do stand adjourned till

Tuesday, the 2nd of August, 1955.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at 10.15 a.m. to</div>

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL PRODUCE WORKING COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Recommendations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether the Government has considered the Report of the Local Produce Working Committee dated 2nd June, 1951; and whether action is contemplated to implement any of its recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> The Government has considered the report on "Food Supplies for Singapore" by the Local Produce Working Committee dated 2nd June, 1951, and action has already been taken on many of its recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Questioner can obtain full information from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and is invited to consult them if he so wishes.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RURAL VETERINARY AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY SERVICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether he will give details of the Government's plans for the provision of Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Services in the rural areas during the year 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> The following are the details of the Government's plans for the provision of veterinary and animal husbandry services in the rural areas during 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disease control measures and medical aid to farmers' livestock. The extension of the free poultry inoculation service to farmers is under way. Over four million birds a year are inoculated. This has created a major rural industry for some tens of thousands of farmers as a part or whole time occupation and large infertile areas otherwise unsuited to farming are put to use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive work on disease control in other species of animals is also being undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations into breeding and nutrition. Investigations are being conducted in respect of poultry, pigs, cattle and goats. Breeding stock are available on a limited scale at Lim Chu Kang Station. Trials have indicated that it is possible to reduce the cost of production of local pork by at least 40 per cent by new methods which are not traditional to Chinese farming systems. Stud animals are being used increasingly among low breeding stock and interest in this work will increase as farmers see the result on their stock of this and other work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment of District Stations. Additional work at the Lim Chu Kang Station is to be undertaken in the immediate future. Arrangements are being made for veterinary staff to live in the rural areas in order to establish closer contact with farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One poultry inoculation unit operating from Lim Chu Kang has resulted in the north-west corner of the Island being converted into a virtual poultry farm with nearly two million birds. This area has infertile soil and is therefore unsuited for any other form of mixed farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site is being acquired for a second Animal Husbandry Station to serve the north and central parts of the Island. The work of this second station will cover the farming areas from Sembawang to Serangoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiments are being made in the construction of cheap animal houses which farmers will be encouraged to build on their own farms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing demands for veterinary services in rural areas have far exceeded expectations but it is hoped that with the early completion of the two new Animal Husbandry Stations and the recruitment of further qualified and subordinate staff it will be possible for the Veterinary Department to meet these demands.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT STOCKPILE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rice)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry whether it is still the policy of Government to maintain a stockpile of rice and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>

to sell it on a non-profit basis to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> The answer is in the affirmative.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT RICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Trading)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and Industry if he will state -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The cost of rice per ton as purchased by the Government;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The selling price per ton from the stockpile;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The total tonnage sold in April, May and June 1955, respectively;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The average total gross profit per month; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The manner in which the above profit is expended.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> (a) Government purchases rice by open tender. Prices, therefore, are determined by prevailing market prices at the time of the tender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Present selling prices ex Government stockpile are: -

<pre>

        "B" grade rice $464 per ton of 2,240 lb. net ex godown.

        "C" grade rice $446 per ton of 2,240 lb. net ex godown.

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Sales ex stockpile, exclusive of sales to the Army, during the months stated were: -

<pre>

        April 1955    ... 3,419 tons

        May 1955      ... 2,437 tons

        June 1955     ... 2,887 tons

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) There is no average gross profit. Sale prices are adjusted to conform to the policy of selling on a "no profit, no loss" basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial results of trading since the inception of stockpiling have been as under: -

<pre>

<br><br>It will be seen from the above figures that the profits during the first six months amounted to $61,639.41 on a turnover of approximately $8,000,000. Since the offtake is unknown, in advance, selling price has to be based on estimated figures, so that it is impossible to avoid entirely small profits or losses. The selling price is adjusted to allow for these small profits or losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table shows the alterations in prices which have been made and which took into account the above trading results: -
